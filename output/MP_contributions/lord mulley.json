["<cs> my lords in rising to address the house for the first time i crave the generous and courteous indulgence which your lordships invariably give to maiden speakers <e> <s> i think that i should also apologise for venturing to address the house so soon after my introduction which was only a week ago <e> <s> however it was on the subject now before the house and which was presented so well by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs that i made my maiden speech in another place years ago <e> <s> indeed it was in this very chamber when through the generosity of your lordships an acute problem of homelessness was resolved <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps he could clarify a point <e> <s> it seems at the moment when the committee is being asked to approve the legislation that the government are not forthcoming as to what they intend to pay by way of grant <e> <s> yet they are shortly presumably if it will mean anything to issue regulations <e> <s> if they can specify a figure in the regulations which is what i understand the bill will require them to do why cannot they tell us now <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friends lady lockwood and lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> we have no intention of trying to tie the hands of the secretary of state <e> <s> the purpose of my amendment no <e> <s> was to take up the remaining per cent <e> <s> before somebody else laid claim to it <e> <s> i shall respond to the noble earl by not seeking to move the amendment <e> <s> however i wish to draw to the attention of your lordships the importance of mathematics teaching <e> <s> it is essential for good science teaching <e> <s> the most sombre fact which occurred to me last year was that this nation once the workshop of the world is now a net importer of manufactured goods <e> <s> one wonders what will happen when as we are told they will the oil supplies dry up <e> <s> how shall we make a living unless we have a greater number of highly qualified technicians who will be able to cope with the demands of modern technology which as my noble friend lord stewart of fulham indicated have been growing not gradually but by leaps and bounds <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say briefly that i would welcome this kind of advisory board and this kind of discussion over the other per cent <e> <s> of educational expenditure as well as over the per cent <e> <s> my noble friend has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords in following my noble friend lady fisher i should like to endorse what she has said and indeed what all speakers have said about the debt we owe to my noble friend lady lockwood for introducing this debate and relating our current problems to the very important study which has been prepared by the institute of local government studies of the university of birmingham <e> <s> i am sure that it is right that we should try to learn from the experience of other countries because it is all too clear now that in this country we have not got a democratic system of government that is the envy of the world <e> <s> indeed the way we have gone down the league table from division to being almost on the point of applying for reelection at the bottom of division rather suggests that we should seek to learn rather more from other countries <e> <s> no doubt today quite properly the debate is related as my noble friend lady fisher has related it to the governments current proposals that are now under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will give way the great problem of joint boards is that none of the members is responsible for the totality of the expenditure <e> <s> they each go back to their own authorities and say i was against it but the others wanted it <e> <s> that is the whole problem with joint boards where no one is accountable to the public from whom they take the money <e> <s> if they need subsidies for transport of any kind and whether the government run it or anyone else it has to be subsidised if it is going to work then that money has to come out of taxes <e> <s> equally the present cost of water is a form of taxation because the comparison between what we pay now for water and what we paid when the local authority in sheffield ran it is enormous <e>", "<cs> it means my lords that democracy requires that you have a vote over the people who make these decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to assure the noble lord lord gladwyn and the noble lords lord beloff and lord mayhew that i shall in due course endeavour to deal with the particular points that they made about labour policy <e> <s> i would first say to the noble lord lord gladwyn that i do not think that it is any bad thing that my noble friend lord cledwyn has made a speech with which many people agree <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord gladwyn that i agree with quite a bit of the speech that he has just delivered and indeed with his observations about the middle east for example which were not very different from what my noble friend lord cledwyn has already said at the beginning of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see the logic frankly as to why any statements by a leader in this country should cause things to happen in germany <e> <s> equally i could not understand the noble lord lord mayhew who had some concept of british forces fighting an enemy alone <e> <s> the whole point of being a member of nato is that it is a collective i will certainly give way but i do not want to trespass too much on the time of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is mr kinnocks view <e> <s> it is not so far as i understand it the declared policy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister first to give us a little more information as to why it took so long for the government to come to a decision and secondly why the figures are so much below that which as i understood it british aerospace thought essential <e> <s> is he not aware that all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his considered reply <e> <s> a number of inquiries are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble earl once more to look at this matter <e> <s> one of the criticisms which was repeated throughout that outstanding debate which was made by people with very great knowledge and experience and with a lifetime in education was about the segmentation of education between the various elements the universities the colleges of further education and the polytechnics <e> <s> knowing the vested interests which exist in the educational world does he believe that any body other than a royal commission with its prestige and standing can have any expectation of receiving full support <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord does not wish to give way i will not press the point <e> <s> i was going to say that the noble lord is incorrect in saying that in the metropolitan areas it is labour party policy that the local authorities should pay <e> <s> the scheme is uniform for all the areas concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very much indebted to the noble lord for making the statement today because as he stressed it is a matter of national importance <e> <s> that is why i found the contents of the statement disappointing because it appears as though the government are viewing it only as a matter of whether or not it is right in terms of the director-general of fair trading <e> <s> this is a vital industry for the defence of this nation and for our future if we are to stay in the aircraft business <e> <s> it is that aspect with which we need to concern ourselves <e> <s> as my noble friends have already explained this rather odd merger of two concerns which on the face of it do not appear to be well aligned is a source of anxiety <e> <s> it is not only a question of safeguarding our interest which in my view is all too small an interest in the airbus project but it is also a vital defence interest <e> <s> i hope that this is not a follow-up of what we understand is the intention of the secretary of state for defence that is to put every defence contract out to private tender regardless of security and other matters <e> <s> it is on that aspect that we need some assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is again indebted to the noble lord lord fanshawe of richmond for introducing a debate which is both topical and of long-term importance although this week it is on rather a different aspect of our heritage from the debate last week which also attracted vast experience and a large number of speakers despite the lateness of the hour <e> <s> i know that he as a former whip and minister in another place and i should not regard this as a late hour <e> <s> but as a junior member of your lordships house i would ask that we do not follow the bad example of the other place in the matter of the hours that they tend to keep <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for the assurance that this modest scheme is to continue will she not convey to her colleagues the tremendous damage that has been caused to our relations with other countries through the differential between the fees charged to overseas students and those charged to our own students <e> <s> is she also aware that in the long run as future leaders of the third world increasingly seek higher education and technical qualifications in other countries this will be very detrimental to us as well as damaging in international affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble viscount <e> <s> i agree largely with what he says <e> <s> i am sure that he is right to feel and i hope he will continue so to feel that he will be more likely to persuade the government along the path he wants them to take if he joins us tonight in the division lobby in support of the amendment <e> <s> i want to speak briefly because i have noticed a danger in recent weeks of this house falling into the bad habits of another place in the times it keeps in its debates and today above all days is a day when we should assert our independence <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of that <e> <s> but in that case by a stroke of a ministerial pen and surely some minister looked at this document before it was sent to this house it should not have talked about parliament approving <e> <s> we are not asked to approve the abolition of these councils in that affirmative order <e> <s> the affirmative order is only dealing with the minuti of the elections <e> <s> i hope therefore that the amendment will be carried because i think that its message is crystal clear <e> <s> it is quite simply telling the government to take this bill away and that if they must play around with the reorganisation of local government to get on with it and that when they have made up their minds what to do to bring back the proposals <e> <s> then we will have a look at it but until they do that then i think we should not proceed in this matter at all <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister not agree that the inclusion of firecracker in the list must mean that it meets the requirements of the raf <e> <s> secondly may i stress again the importance of a market for trainer within nato in the next years <e> <s> does he not understand well that no country ever buys an aeroplane which has not been adopted by its own air force <e> <s> finally could i ask him what his right honourable friends would have said if i had announced some years ago that it was my intention to buy brazilian swiss or australian aircraft for the royal air force <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a difficult situation in that i have been preceded in the debate by two noble and gallant lords with whom i had dealings as secretary of state and i am to be followed by two others <e> <s> but i should first like to say how much we are indebted to the noble and gallant lord lord cameron for introducing this debate and how privileged i feel to follow the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton <e> <s> we had dealings together in his distinguished period as chairman of the military committee of nato when he as did all his predecessors gave me very good advice when i was faced early in my term of office with a very serious problem of finding a new cds arising from the tragic death very early in his term of the late marshal of the royal air force sir andrew humphrey and had to think very hard about the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join all those who have expressed their appreciation of the very comprehensive and competent speech with which the noble lord the minister introduced the debate today <e> <s> if i can be assured that praise from me will not be prejudicial to his future career <e> <s> i should also like to say how well i thought he replied yesterday to a rather difficult debate from the ministrys point of view and that generally we appreciate the great attention that he paid throughout the debate and if i may quote the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone through speeches sensible and otherwise <e> <s> but i shall not attempt to define which is which <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is of value that my noble friend has raised this matter and that the minister has replied <e> <s> i hope that some publicity will <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble earl is entitled to his opinion that five years was not a waste of time may i say that surely he will not disagree that it was an extraordinarily long time and not least in view of the work that had gone in to the secretary of states predecessors <e> <s> there is a great deal of reference to the differential papers and for reasons which escape me some special certificate for grades a to c i thought that the mere grading recorded on the certificate a sufficient distinction between the accomplishments of one candidate against another <e> <s> is it to be a single examination at the end of the day <e> <s> also can he give us some idea of what the reaction of the universities is likely to be because although it is the a-levels which count for university entrance because the a-level results are not usually available when the question of interviews arise the o-level performance is often crucially important in candidates getting an interview and the rest <e> <s> it seems from the statement and admittedly we have to study it rather confusing <e> <s> is it intended to get something rather fuller <e> <s> where there are references in the other place to documents made available in the vote office will they be made available to us in the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> my lords i want if i may to add my support to the noble earl in raising this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for giving us the assurance and i take it to be an assurance that the government are not planning a further reduction in the powers of local authorities by <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord diamond and supported by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> in my view the amendments go only part of the way to mitigating what i believe is a most serious prospect of damage to our armed forces <e> <s> to the noble earl lord onslow i would say that this is not a slight bill it involves a matter of grave importance because successive governments for almost years the first royal ordnance factory was established in have thought it right and i do not quarrel with the concept to make the interests of defence paramount to any commercial interest <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing to underrate the importance of safety does not the noble ministers answer reflect another serious problem namely that as a manufacturing country we are importing such a vast amount of toys <e> <s> can he give us figures for the toys that we export <e> <s> is not the lack of our manufacturing capacity and our ability to pay our way a cause for further concern <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the ministers comment that we cannot insulate ourselves from external effects would he not agree nevertheless that it is difficult to get people to invest in industry when they can earn such high sums by merely lending their money <e> <s> secondly is not the interest rate a <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the minister that i can deliver as long a diatribe as he is capable of if he tempts me <e> <s> he has been in business and i ask him how he can expect people to invest in for example the new issues that the government intend to put on the market to sell off our own nationalised industries <e> <s> how can he ask people to support that when they could receive more money by merely lending it to the banks <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i join with him in thanking the noble viscount the leader of the house for putting his case so clearly but i reject his initial thesis that we have got to follow what has happened in another place <e> <s> the noble viscount and i were in the other place together for many years <e> <s> i believe he will agree that the need for a car is greater in the rural rather than the urban constituency <e> <s> members of parliament cover large distances in their cars <e> <s> they have to go round their constituencies carry people to the polls and so on <e> <s> their need for cars is probably greater than that of members of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will find that that is just printed on the car <e> <s> if he looks at the official registration and the official statistics published by the motoring organisations the noble lord will find that his actual engine capacity is cc <e> <s> the vauxhall range is cc <e> <s> if one wishes to buy a certain foreign car i shall not mention its name in case the noble lord might be tempted to buy it one can buy it with an engine capacity of cc <e> <s> therefore with an increase in capacity of one-third of per cent you can get almost a per cent <e> <s> increase in your allowance which does not seem to me to make very much sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is indebted to the noble earl for his initiative in raising this important matter and giving us the opportunity to discuss it here in the wider forum of public opinion before the government come to a decision <e> <s> this is entirely within the tradition that he has established in the great work he has done and is still doing for the house of lords defence study group <e> <s> i believe i speak for members of all parties and indeed of none since i have already learnt the great importance for all of us and the great influence of the noble lords who sit on the cross-benches in stimulating informed discussion on defence matters and in creating a body of considerable influence <e>", "<cs> my lords i would join with the noble lord in congratulating my noble friend lady david for giving us the opportunity for debating what in my opinion is a very important subject not only the actual problems of the grants but the consequences that are likely to follow from the way things are going within this field <e> <s> before commenting briefly on some of the points that my noble friend lady david made because as the noble lord lord kilmarnock said she has covered the ground extremely well i should like to endorse what lord kilmarnock said about the cost of books <e> <s> it was my good fortune to have as tutor in politics two distinguished members of your lordships house but i would not want to hold either of them responsible or for your lordships to hold them responsible for what has happened subsequently in my political career <e> <s> one of them said of course the object of reading ppe philosophy politics and economics at oxford is that you do not really learn anything about the subject but you should have a very good acquaintanceship with the bibliography over the field <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister convey to his right honourable friend the point that we should very strongly object if further consideration of the award meant that it was to be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is indebted to the noble lord lord gladwyn for raising this matter tonight <e> <s> as he said by chance perhaps rather than by design it could not have been more topical coming as it does immediately after the ministerial meeting last week and the special meeting of the assembly in rome today <e> <s> i do not agree with a number of the points that he has made and i shall return to them in a moment <e> <s> first i should like to make it quite clear that while the assembly might not have the influence and might not attract the publicity that we should like it to attract it is by no means defunct <e> <s> only last june it had an excellent session addressed by none other than the noble baroness the minister who is to reply to this debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords quite simply <e> <s> in fact as the noble lord should know and i was just going to make the point it is the foreign offices that think they deal with the policies and the ministers of defence have to deal with the equipment <e> <s> one of the weaknesses i think of all these arrangements is that it is the foreign ministers in the weu and in nato and in any other body you like to think of that are responsible and attend the meetings as indeed did and i was very glad to see that he was there our own foreign secretary in rome last week compiling and <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to my noble friend i do not think the north atlantic assembly which is an unofficial body could be brought into the weu <e> <s> i think it is arguable that it would perhaps be more sense to have an advisory north atlantic assembly and that that would take the place of the weu but that would not provide the essential parliamentary basis to achieve a european as distinct from a total nato consensus <e> <s> but i am not against its existence <e> <s> i am not privileged to be a member of the north atlantic assembly but i am <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness mentioned some of the other items which can be done without a change in the treaty <e> <s> i believe that it is perhaps possible to make another very important change namely to have a separate representation to the assembly from each member country and not necessarily as we do now have the same members of the council of europe <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows one has to be appointed to membership of the council of europe and then one is allowed to go to the weu assembly and not the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that answer <e> <s> i hope that in that evaluation it will be borne in mind that the british interest is not only that the raf should have an aircraft meeting its specifications which presumably all the contenders do because otherwise they would not be shortlisted but that we should have the exports that will undoubtedly follow from the adoption of a particular aircraft by the royal air force <e> <s> would the noble lord also consider in the longer term what international competitors will make of it if in fact it is known that we in this country have been incapable of designing and making a basic trainer for our own airforce <e>", "<cs> my lords will the right honourable minister convey to his right honourable friend that it is not possible for the schools to do justice to a scheme of this sort when they are under such enormous financial pressure as they are at the present time <e> <s> will there be resources to make sense of this or any other innovation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl and i apologise for having last week given him a privy counsellorship which was an error of speech which i trust may be corrected in due course whether he would not suggest to his right honourable friend that where judgments of educational value are involved educational specialists should be employed <e> <s> her majesty has some excellent and independent inspectors who are very well qualified to do that <e> <s> if we send in accountants to all these colleges shall we not reach the point of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords as the secretary of state who was responsible and it was not the late lord robbins for separating tuition fees from maintenance i may say that i did so for two reasons <e> <s> first i did not want to have a distinction between home and overseas fees and i am very sorry that my successors of both parties went away from that principle and secondly so many wealthy parents were not giving their children the money to pay the fees at the beginning of the financial year of the university <e> <s> this caused immense anxiety and doubts as to whether they would be in a position to take up their places <e> <s> therefore i am extremely glad that the principle of not asking parents to contribute to tuition fees has been maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister suggest to his colleagues that they again look at their policy for competitive estimates for future procurement <e> <s> i ask that because on the one hand the actual cost of designing and producing a prototype is extremely difficult and costly on a competitive basis <e> <s> secondly from my own experience all our major defence contractors were quite unwilling even to put pencil to paper on a design unless they were paid in advance <e> <s> the consequences as we have seen in the contract for a trainer for the royal air force have meant that the major contractors have simply got some british rights for foreign aircraft <e> <s> this development is one that will clearly be detrimental in my view to the british forces as well as to british employment and british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords who have spoken in congratulating the noble lord lord aylestone on bringing this subject before your lordships <e> <s> he spoke with the wealth of experience that he acquired in his distinguished time as chairman of the independent broadcasting authority <e> <s> i think that it is generally agreed that the situation has grown very much worse over the past three or four years <e> <s> there seems to he complete unanimity among the iba the association of independent radio contractors the individual ilr companies the bbc and the general public that something ought to be done about this serious and growing problem of pirate or illegal radio stations call them what one will <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the advertisers on the overseas stations would be covered by the terms of the legislation for aiding the illegal broadcasting <e> <s> surely the advertisers on laser and caroline could be prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is a matter of general and not specific interest to the two noble lords would it not be better for a written question to be put down and then the answer would be available not only to us but to people outside <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to ask the minister whether he does not feel that this is an extremely sad day for all those concerned with british defence or with the british defence industry for him to come to this house and announce that the royal air force is obliged to buy brazilian-designed aircraft <e> <s> i would share the enthusiasm of my noble friend lord fitt had the plane been produced by shorts and not just bought off the shelf <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the minister for the statement and to welcome it <e> <s> as the minister who introduced the abortive legislation previously may i say how difficult it is to get a hybrid bill through both houses of parliament <e> <s> i hope that there is a way to reduce that lengthy process <e> <s> secondly if british rail were to be fully associated with the project i think it would be welcomed in many quarters <e> <s> most of the problems of the hybrid bill were concerned with objections to the projected route of the railways in this country <e> <s> there are also problems if british rail are to profit from the tunnel of its being able to carry goods right through the country without having to transmit them from one set of wagons to another <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining all the other noble lords and the noble baroness lady faithfull who have spoken in congratulating the noble baroness lady cox on her first major appearance on a bill i assure her that in no case is it a mere courtesy <e> <s> all of us were extremely impressed with the eloquence and confidence that she showed in making a very bad bill almost plausible <e> <s> i shall not try to compete with my noble friend lord stewart and my noble friend lord houghton in giving additional information as to why they think it is so bad <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps there may be two opinions about that as to what may happen when the question is put at the end of this debate <e> <s> in any case i do not accept that one example should decide a matter of this sort <e> <s> i think it is quite clear that the parliamentary draftsmen were told to produce a bill which will permit us to keep as much corporal punishment as we can but at least to take us through any further cases that might come before the european <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for that reply and confess that i was a member of the government which introduced it although i think it would have been a little frivolous to have resigned on the question of the date of a bank holiday <e> <s> has this not been the established practice and tradition on the continent for very many years and would it not be a gesture of solidarity to our european friends to follow this practice at little cost <e> <s> after all in this house we should be the guardians of tradition <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister and his department given consideration to the future not only of helicopters but also of other defence industries in the light of the new policy of the ministry of defence in putting contracts out to competition such as in the recent requirement for military training aircraft with the consequence that we are buying them off-the-shelf from overseas nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much indebted to the noble earl for his kind birthday greetings and although i deem it a very great privilege to address your lordships i am bound to say that i could think of other ways of spending my birthday particularly as today may be one of the few days of summer that the weather authorities seem to have been able to make available this year <e> <s> i would very warmly endorse the importance that the noble earl attached to nato inter-operability <e> <s> i am hoping that in the next generation of weapons goodness knows how difficult and long it has been <e> <s> we may get more european collaboration and co-operation than we have been able to achieve so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> although i personally agree with the noble lord lord boothby that matter is not the question before the house <e> <s> the question before the house is whether we should comply with and in what form the judgment of the european court <e> <s> the logic of lord beloffs arguments has been rejected by the government because clearly he thinks that either the court should not be there or that we should totally disregard its decision <e> <s> if we are going to comply with the decision the question is how <e> <s> in my submission and i agree with the noble earl lord onslow we should do it in a form which is both just and workable <e>", "<cs> my lords i also apologise to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will understand if i do not attempt to follow his interesting speech particularly about scotland both because i lack the detailed knowledge and in the interests of time <e> <s> i have every confidence that my noble friend lord carmichael will deal with some of the interesting points he made <e> <s> i should like to join all those in all parts of the house who have welcomed hack my noble friend lord underhill <e> <s> i should also like to express my congratulations on the two excellent maiden speeches that we have been privileged to listen to today <e> <s> the fact that we had two maiden speakers and the width of this debate in your lordships house on a friday indicates the great importance of the subject we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too agree with my noble friend that the present proposal is more satisfactory than that originally proposed <e> <s> what i cannot understand is why this particular bill should be singled out for any special treatment at all <e> <s> the noble viscount the leader of the house may recall that a bill in almost identical terms was blocked by the government whips in when no doubt he gave such instructions as he was then the responsible minister the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join all of your lordships who have congratulated my noble friend lord donoughue on a model maiden speech <e> <s> since i have had the privilege of knowing and working with him over a number of years i can assure your lordships that it was merely a foretaste of the great abilities and the depth of knowledge and experience that he brings to your lordships house <e> <s> i certainly endorse what has been suggested that he should speak often in our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact in south yorkshire at the present time i believe litigation is pending because some of the south yorkshire clubs are taking the view that since they do not ask for the police to enter they have no objection to their coming they should not have to pay for them <e> <s> i would certainly agree with the noble lord lord inglewood that if they ask for police in the grounds as with anyone else asking them to enter private property or for a private occasion they should have to pay <e> <s> but when the police believe it to be in the interests of law and order that they should be there i think that that comes under the general responsibility of the police and that the football clubs should not have to pay <e> <s> as i say i think that litigation may well be pending as a result of the refusal as i understand it of some clubs to meet the bills that have been sent to them by the police authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that following bradford the secretary of state was right to require for the first time that the grounds of third division and fourth division clubs should be subject to stringent safety considerations <e> <s> but they have to find the money to do that and they have very little revenue <e> <s> i have been looking at the figures <e> <s> in a lot of clubs average attendance is less than per game and they will have bills of to upwards to put their grounds in order <e> <s> why should the little money that they get from alcohol be taken away from them especially at this time and when they have no disputes <e> <s> that is my major point <e> <s> i know of no dispute that has occurred in a third division ground <e> <s> when clubs come into the second division they will automatically be caught by the provisions in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the money has to come out of the same pockets <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i want to support the principle of the amendments and i should like to pay tribute to the minister and his colleague the minister of state for so kindly making themselves available to discuss these problems as a way of mitigating the difficulties on the very tight time-scale of the bill <e> <s> my own preference by way of amendment is to leave the matter to the magistrates who can look at the merits of a particular case and decide in all the local circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i have moved the amendment in anticipation that there will be a reply from the minister <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord was asking me a question under the formula before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> i imagine that special <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand that the minister cannot possibly know all the details of all the existing arrangements <e> <s> however it happens to be a fact that a number of clubs have not invited and have made it quite clear that they do not wish to invite the police to be present although they have no objection to the police being there because they are unwilling to shoulder the costs <e> <s> to my knowledge in <e>", "<cs> my lords i will willingly give way to the noble lord the minister if he wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very willing to let the minister intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a wider point than the matter of football clubs and if as the noble lord says it can be further considered i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the invitation by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich to think the unthinkable i want him as a member of the mcc to recall that at the recent lords test there was not only an invasion of the ground but a great australian bowler mr thomson was probably deprived of taking his th wicket <e> <s> if some fanatics were there some incident could have occurred at in my view the headquarters of cricket <e> <s> it is not so unthinkable as he may have suggested <e> <s> therefore if it is only about football this seems a reasonable set of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who have been concerned with defence will appreciate that the royal dockyards have been a source of problems both financial and management for not just the last years <e> <s> i remember the first select committee on which i served in another place as long ago as <e> <s> it was concerned in a inquiry into the royal dockyards <e> <s> i believe it has been a very long-standing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords since i do not think that this should be the occasion for debate may i just briefly say that i appreciate the tributes that have been made to mr justice popplewell and his associates for the care and speed with which he has given his report also for the very many constructive and helpful suggestions <e> <s> i shall mention and criticise only one of them namely the membership card proviso and if in fact the football authorities are going to be left to devise what they deem to be practicable then i do not think we would have any quarrel <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord can give us that assurance because mr justice popplewells conclusion is the impeccable one that the one way to get rid of all violence at football matches is to have no spectators there and indeed that would be the end of football because it would not pay for the costs of running it <e> <s> that is the logic <e> <s> it would be immensely disappointing to all supporters of football if they could not see their own team play in key cup matches away from home <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from those considerations which the noble lord the minister may dispute does he not at least agree that a major factor in the increase in the level of rates over the last six years has been that the governments contribution to the rate support grant has fallen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> that is a factor that cannot be denied <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about six years ago when the figure was per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords while understanding the concern of the noble lord that ministers have decided to overturn the recommendation of a joint committee nevertheless i welcome the decision because this is an outstanding delay in the construction of a most important road <e> <s> i should like to get the ministers assurance that this could mean the beginning of a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely glad to follow the noble baroness because i agree that this is really an issue for the people of cornwall and devon which is of absolutely vital economic importance <e> <s> i hope that it will not be thought that if those of us in favour of the bill make much shorter speeches than those who are against it it will not be thought that we are any less convinced of the merits of the case that we support <e> <s> therefore i hope it will be acceptable if at this hour i make one or two short points without attempting fully to argue them as i should prefer to do in other circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords does this not illustrate two points <e> <s> first with the increasing use of judicial review by the judicary on a basis that i have never really understood often it is based on neither statute law nor common law every ministerial decision can now be challenged with the consequence that when judgments come after a long time there is great inconvenience <e> <s> is the whole question of our procedures particularly in the transport field being looked at <e> <s> secondly is it not much better if obviously in proper fields costs rise in accordance with inflation to make a regular small increase rather than an enormous one of this character which understandably causes a very sharp reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the government for making it possible to have this debate today <e> <s> i gather that we <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very long time it has taken to achieve this agreement i make no complaint about that having started it in does the noble lord think it feasible in the short time that now seems possible for westland to secure a similar european consortium something which i am sure many of us would have liked to see happen <e> <s> i think it ought to have been started a little earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords answer imply that the responsibility for electricitys finances is being transferred from the electricity councils and the regional boards to the generating board <e> <s> although i endorse my noble friends contention about a reduction i think that it would be wrong for the supply industry to be the body coming forward with financial and tariff proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl has stressed the consistency of the governments position let me point out that he has on more than one occasion given an assurance that it is the governments intention to comply with the european courts judgment <e> <s> as next month will be as the noble lord opposite has mentioned the fourth anniversary of the judgment would that not be an appropriate occasion upon which to introduce the very necessary small piece of legislation to give effect to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is indebted to the noble earl for raising this matter tonight and i know too that it will be greatly appreciated by all members of all three services <e> <s> on the face of it it would seem a fairly unimportant and trivial issue but i think it raises two rather important questions of principle <e> <s> first to what extent is it desirable to have in the parlance of the services purple establishments covering all three services and secondly the very severe strictures about the handling and the estimating and the costs involved made by the public accounts committee in its report dated th january last <e>", "<cs> does the minister wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the aircraft are to be manufactured by shorts but unless i am mistaken they are of entirely brazilian design <e> <s> in fact i would have thought that in the arguments that there have been about helicopters and into which i shall not go at the moment one could equally say that westland would not become involved in any american helicopter production <e> <s> i gather that such is not mr heseltines current view <e> <s> indeed i rather welcomed his belated recognition of the need for british defence industries and for a european defence capability although how he could square that view with the idea of international competition i find difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> he kindly said that the reappraisal is taking place over all aspects of costs and independent people are <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has no reason to apologise for the length of his speech because i thought it was quite excellent and i agree with a great deal of it <e> <s> indeed i hope that when we deal with the detail of the bill the minister of state will have the open mind that the government were recommended to have by the select committees <e> <s> unfortunately it would seem that his colleagues in another place approached this subject with a closed mind <e> <s> although we enjoyed very much the persuasive speech of the noble lord i am afraid i fundamentally disagree with the solution proposed by him and the government although i think with everyone else i am bound to accept that there is need for change <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that little difficulty can be ironed out by the minister because i am sure that the nation will want to know about it <e> <s> it the governments plans for trident persist the refuting and recommissioning of polaris will be an enormous problem and there is also the nuclear safety problem <e> <s> i am far from satisfied that the proper arrangements will be made and this applies to both dockyards <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to support what has been said <e> <s> following the eloquent speeches of my noble friend lord carmichael and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i think very little needs to be said now on the point of principle <e> <s> i can understand and agree with the noble lord lord tordoff that so far as individual foreigners are concerned we cannot and should not seek to exclude any members of the european community but we can meet the real point to which if i may say so i thought the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter directed us very clearly and that is competition from the states their airlines and their airports <e> <s> we can surely do that by excluding any airport company or authority or any airline including british from holding any specified amount of shares <e> <s> i would have thought there was no reason why they should have any shares in the company at all <e> <s> that being the case we would get over the problem of being in the ec as well as the other matters <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment and the views of my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> i accept at once that this would mean a dramatic change in the nature of the bill and in what the government propose <e> <s> it is because i want to see a dramatic change in the governments attitude that i support this amendment <e> <s> having regard to the problems that we have seen in the soviet union quite apart from the military aspects of nuclear weapons which are dealt with by the dockyard in rosyth one can assume that this could safely be given to a commercial contractor only if the people who are now doing the job continue to do it <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a lot of misunderstanding about what the amendment actually proposes <e> <s> first of all it proposes only that there shall be the experiment of a trading fund <e> <s> as my noble friend lord graham of edmonton has just underlined a trading fund was proposed under an act brought forward by an earlier conservative government <e> <s> the noble lord the minister asked why the labour administration did not introduce such a measure in the royal dockyards and certainly in my time we did not <e> <s> i accept that we did not <e> <s> it is not an ideal arrangement but we did not propose to give away the control of the royal navys servicing and support of the fleet <e> <s> what would have been the situation at the time of the falklands if we had had this kind of half-baked scheme which i think no one but the former secretary of state could possibly have devised <e> <s> i think i said at second reading of the bill that it was not perhaps insignificant that none of the members in the other place who had held office in the ministry of defence including the former secretary of state himself had found it convenient to be there to support the third reading of the bill <e> <s> certainly former navy ministers spoke and voted against it <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear that there are risks in having to have a price for everything <e> <s> i do not see how a contractor can reasonably be expected to undertake to service a submarine or a ship without having a contract price <e> <s> certainly we have not been told of the savings and under the trading fund i am certain that there will be savings <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount must also share some of the responsibility for imposing the restraints <e> <s> it does not need an act of parliament <e> <s> i know that there are problems but if civil service or treasury rules stand in the way they can be changed <e>", "<cs> there seems to be some confusion here because the noble and learned lord lord denning said that as a matter of automaticity the <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend is aware that when a matter comes before the courts as all too unhappily industrial relations matters do now what a minister says in this house or in another place is of no relevance <e> <s> the judges are concerned only with the statute as it emanates from royal assent <e> <s> if there is nothing in the statute what the minister may say in a letter or on the floor of the chamber is of no relevance and no help at all <e>", "<cs> no it will not <e>", "<cs> can the minister give us a firm undertaking now that he is to introduce amendments for one company only <e> <s> that will facilitate our consideration of what we might wish to put down at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> we have great faith in the ministers ability to overcome such difficulties <e> <s> he seems to have his mind and heart set in the right direction and i am sure that he will get there in the end <e>", "<cs> the amendment underlines the point that i was trying to put earlier it puts industrial relations in the dockyards in the lap of the courts because only the courts can decide whether this or that was done correctly <e>", "<cs> i too was surprised by the ministers response <e> <s> i should have thought that in any event the <e>", "<cs> my lords without intervening on the merits of this case may i ask the noble earl the minister to at least bear in mind the limited powers that the secretary of state has in all these matters <e> <s> when i was involved in a dispute with a local authority which six weeks after an election had not met to elect its chairman i was turned down by the house of lords for wrongfully interfering with that local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being here at the beginning of this discussion <e> <s> as i understand it both the noble baroness lady vickers and the noble and learned lord lord denning attach great importance to there being one company <e> <s> as i understand the minister and his amendment no doubt he will correct me if i am wrong it will be possible to have an unlimited number of companies because the amendment refers to a company under paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble and learned lord lord denning who has within the amendment included three matters of great importance <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham of edmonton has down as amendments new clauses that cover a number of the points foreign ownership redundancy and so on <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord lord denning would not take offence if the minister said that he accepted the points but preferred the new clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords as always my noble friend lord graham shows himself to be at the service of the house and seeks expedition of its business <e> <s> there will be widespread disappointment i believe in all quarters of the house if the minister does not accept the amendment for three simple reasons <e> <s> i do not wish to become involved in controversy about the accuracy of ones recollection <e> <s> i recall however that at the committee stage the minister expressed a great deal of sympathy with the concept of worker shares in any company that might come into being <e> <s> i accept at once that the noble lord was not able to and did not give any commitment that he would bring forward such a proposal <e> <s> i imagine however that a man of his sensibility would not have lost his sympathy in the short time that has elapsed between the committee and the report stages <e> <s> the fact that this is a friday should not make any significant difference to his attitude in respect of the way that the bill should be tackled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment moved with great clarity by the noble lord lord mayhew who himself was a navy minister some years ago and has personal knowledge of the problems of the dockyards <e> <s> all of us who were in defence had to wrestle with them from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the practice of ministers trying to explain matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will give leave for the noble minister to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the decision of the government to produce a green paper <e> <s> in doing so will the minister bear in mind the great difficulty that will be presented to the existing independent commercial stations if either radio or radio or any other national radio scheme came to be dependent upon advertising taking away advertising from the independent local radio stations who are in many cases having great difficulty in generating enough revenue to maintain their services <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting the disappointment of those who have promoted community radio applications and their integrity in considering the future will the noble lord not bear in mind the very wise words of the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> in fact to license these stations without any safeguards at all is not only dangerous but grossly unfair to the independent radio stations which are subject to the very severe and proper supervision of the iba and its rigorous regulations <e> <s> they also have to pay very substantial rentals to maintain the cost of the iba <e> <s> in the matter of compensation will the noble lord also bear in mind that those who make unsuccessful applications for such licences receive no compensation at all and as the noble lord lord nugent has said many of the independent radio stations are now finding it extremely difficult to break even against the varying competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be very brief but i think it right to indicate support for the bill on two <e>", "<cs> my lords while per cent on turnover may seem high and many companies would be very glad to achieve that figure will the noble minister tell us how much of that profit will be taken away by the treasury and how much will be available to the post office for improving its services <e> <s> secondly will the minister care to comment on what seems to me to be the strange phenomenon that noble lords and <e> <s> indeed people elsewhere who are great advocates of the taking of all these monopolies out of what they call civil service and government beaurocracy nevertheless constantly and i believe rightly want to have parliamentary control and interference in their operation <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that the local authorities are responsible for the procedures of planning to which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has referred there are two matters in which i think the minister could help to speed planning procedures <e> <s> first i believe that structure plans and their revisions need ministerial approval and until they are approved very often the local authority is not empowered to grant individual planning applications <e> <s> secondly there are matters of appeal from the local authority decisions which in my experience tend to take rather a long time and have a rather excessively prolonged procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the leader of the house for that answer and for his great courtesy in replying personally on a friday <e> <s> does he not agree that the unprecedented number of government amendments at the penultimate and final stages of parliamentary consideration of very important legislation reflects unnecessary and incompetent management of the legislative programme <e> <s> secondly does not the whole process of this last session rather suggest that ministers collectively and individually have not taken the necessary care with regard to the substance and detail of bills before they are presented <e> <s> can the noble viscount at least give some assurance if the government intend to stay in office for another session that they will try to do a little better <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount on reflection not feel that it is a little unfair to compare the number of government amendments with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for the explanation <e> <s> however it does not seem to me to be in accord with the policy that the government propound namely propagandising the great merits of selling properties with large discounts to long-standing tenants <e> <s> obviously if a house had been built in it is possible though i think it very unlikely that the occupant seeking to buy it would qualify with the maximum amount of discount <e> <s> i should have thought it was the case in the whole concept of selling council properties at large discounts that there shall be losses incurred because clearly public assets are being sold at a fraction of their proper price <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the amount of public money devoted to this college rather than take an isolated incident should not the noble baroness and her colleagues reflect on the distinguished history of the college in giving higher education opportunities to many who would not otherwise have had it <e> <s> the college has produced many distinguished leaders of the nation including former members of this noble house <e>", "<cs> my lords although i sympathise with the noble baronesss concern about this matter i hope the government will realise that many other questions are involved before they give unqualified support for the operation of a qualified majority on all matters within the council <e>", "<cs> my lords while not in any way wishing to deny the bbcs role in local radio will not the minister agree that at a time when we understand that the whole future of local radio community radio and their regulation is under study it might be sensible to defer proposals made as long as seven years ago even if they were endorsed by a very distinguished home secretary six years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords does this decision and others not possibly dissuade the noble lord lord broxbourne from the rather unfortunate idea that he has that we should incorporate the european statute on human rights as part of our statute law in other words putting the european court in charge of all our affairs <e> <s> in fact in my view the new doctrine of judical review that the judges have coughed up for themselves without any authority makes ministerial responsibility extremely difficult <e> <s> if we were to have the european court taking full charge of all our local courts we should be in great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to interrupt i should like to say that the labour government did not approve the purchase of trident in or at any time at all <e> <s> the question was open as was made quite clear in the election manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords although i appreciate that the period for consultation is still running can the noble lord give us an indication as to how long after the end of the consultation period it will be before the government give their proposals particularly as to the kind of legislation that they will propose to give effect to some of the recommendations in the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment and at the same time apologise to your lordships for being unable to attend the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i hope therefore that i shall not be too guilty of repeating arguments already adduced <e> <s> however i am bound to tell your lordships that a careful reading of the committee proceedings proved disappointing <e> <s> although many eloquent speeches were <e>", "<cs> i should like to join the noble lord in his appreciation of the work of the select committee <e> <s> even though one may not in every instance endorse its findings one must at least recognise the tremendous work that was carried out by all members of the select committee during what i think was a thorough examination within the scope that they were properly allowed in dealing with the hybridity of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that it is difficult to draft an amendment to achieve the purpose my noble friend lord carmichael seeks namely to retain the british national interest <e> <s> i am certain that the french government would not be unwilling to make sure that they pursue their national interest <e> <s> my experience is that they tend to do that rather better and more accurately than we do <e>", "<cs> i may be able to help the minister on this point <e> <s> there will be further amendments that will give him the opportunity to tell us the status of the safety commission and perhaps by the time we reach them he will be able to do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the facts of the failure of the previous venture are that the bill that the noble lord introduced provided that unless certain matters were completed by st january automatically those involved would have the right to bring the project to an end <e> <s> that was not a worked-out scheme such as the one we have today <e> <s> as the noble lord will recall it was a preliminary to getting such a scheme worked out <e> <s> in fact because we had two elections in the bill did not go through <e> <s> as we know the present bill has taken quite a long time <e> <s> the previous bill did not go through and there was considerable public petition and an inquiry as regards the acquisition of land and so forth <e> <s> those concerned opted to have their money back on st january <e> <s> that was in accordance with a provision in the bill which the noble lord introduced <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a further word on the point raised by the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> like him i do not wish to go into a lengthy discussion on <e>", "<cs> far from being satisfied it explains why the government were not anxious to have my first amendment <e> <s> that would have laid more responsibility on the government because it would have made the concessionaires responsible and the government would not now have to rely or those who wish to take action would not have to rely on the tort of misfeasance of public duty which is a very difficult legal matter to pursue <e> <s> there have been very few cases i am happy to say <e> <s> there was a case last year and if the minister wants me to give details i shall do so <e> <s> one sees now why amendment no <e> <s> was not wanted <e> <s> the government now say that is the reason why they do not want amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled as to why enactment has to be differently defined in this act than normally <e> <s> frankly one has to be suspicious about giving wide delegated powers of subordinate legislation that do not have to be referred in any way to parliament <e>

hope will become an act and which will govern the operation of the tunnel <e> <s> with the understanding that the minister will look at the matter again i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the exchanges and in particular to the interventions of the noble lords lord holderness and lord harris of greenwich who spent much time in committee on this matter <e> <s> i am frankly surprised that the minister who is invariably so courteous to the house should blandly repeat an assurance based on the select committee in another place which is in the opinion of our own select committee worth very little <e> <s> it is quite extraordinary <e> <s> we all know that we are amateur draftsmen when we put down amendments <e> <s> it is the drafting of the amendment that is involved <e>", "<cs> i was not aware that it was the desire of the committee to take amendment no <e> <s> in my name along with the other two amendments of my noble friend lord ennals but i am prepared to do so and discuss the three together <e> <s> obviously the detail varies between the dover harbour board problems and the losses that may be incurred by the operators on the one hand and

station <e>", "<cs> i did not follow the noble lord lord teviot when he referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i read that amendment it is concerned only with the composition of the safety authority and not with the prevention of fire although it is an important amendment <e> <s> it has been suggested by members of the committee that the text of the amendment moved by my noble friend is

to have the independence written into the bill in subsection but will not press the second part of his amendment <e> <s> if as i hope we adopt the amendment no doubt these words could be taken out at a subsequent stage <e> <s> as i said at the outset i have been extremely impressed as we all have with the careful way in which the select committee went about its business <e> <s> it would be very wrong if now we were not to take notice of one its important recommendations <e> <s> i was impressed by what the chairman of that committee has just said to us <e>", "<cs> sometimes listening to the

until just before the tunnel is due to be used then i would accept that this amendment would not be necessary <e>", "<cs> i am sure that it would be unreasonable to ask the minister to give an assurance on behalf of whoever is secretary of state at that time <e> <s> however i hope that it can be recorded so that before the tunnel operates a statement will be made to both houses of

it but a couple of years ago i gave chapter and verse in a parliamentary question in your lordships house when i asked why seven miles of road were closed for no obvious reason with not even a shovel in sight <e> <s> the answer i got was that it had been closed pending an inspection <e> <s> i imagine the inspection had not taken place because the person concerned was held up by the traffic

the word enactment <e> <s> however if the government feel that for the purposes of the bill it is essential to have the interpretation naturally i shall not press the point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> as i understand it northern ireland does not need this bill to give the right to buy equipment <e> <s> one of our worries was that a lot of the equipment would not be bought from this country <e> <s> if the minister is giving an assurance that it will be bought either in great britain or in northern ireland then

not think that that is necessarily a bad thing <e> <s> i happen to believe that ministers should exercise discretion in the national interest <e>", "<cs> i also should like to thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> however let me just reply to my noble friend lord morton <e> <s> the reason why one seeks to remove the word unreasonable discrimination is by virtue of bitter experience <e> <s> over a long period the tribunal declined to allow a comparison to be made with the charges and needle time allocated to independent radio as compared with the bbc <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord williams because the experience we have had in independent broadcasting is that if the copyright tribunal and i have no wish to prejudge it before it exists should in any way resemble its

industry <e> <s> it has had the experience of not being properly considered on questions of fact <e> <s> even if it is agreed that the appeal will be limited to points of law i think that the tribunal should at least be obliged to give effect to the decisions of the court <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for undertaking on behalf of the government that the matter will be looked at again

educational difficulties and costs in this country it would have been a political explosion because they would all have thought that the purpose of such education was to return them to their own countries <e> <s> i hope that education will not be covered by the treaty of rome as it is not at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the minister correctly when he said that it took the government a long time to get money from themselves <e> <s> in this government does not a decision by the cabinet take immediate effect in the treasury or is the treasury a separate institution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have greatly admired the progress and achievement of kenya since i visited it as a member of a parliamentary delegation at the time of mau-mau and again after independence <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that its reputation has been gravely tarnished by the allegations of serious violations of human rights <e> <s> his right honourable friend the prime minister is inevitably extremely well briefed <e> <s> did she not make representations on these matters during her recent visit to kenya and can he tell us something about the results <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his encouraging reply <e> <s> i do not wish for him in any sense to have the wind taken out of his sails which i should think is a rare occurrence <e> <s> can he not say now whether anything of substance has happened in the sense that some people have been let out of gaol or put on trial <e> <s>

controversy although i wore them for a long time we did not have any problems about boots when i was secretary of state is it not significant that the replacements will cost some per cent <e> <s> more than the existing boot <e> <s> is that not generally characteristic of defence expenditure <e> <s> can the minister therefore bring home to the chancellor of the exchequer the fact that it is stupid just to up the defence estimates by the retail price index measure <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble earl makes the point about the water industry <e> <s> indeed to a greater extent it is true of electricity <e> <s> the capital value of these industries has been built up by the industries concerned using their monopoly position usually at the behest of government <e> <s> with regard to electricity one now pays an annual tax contribution as well <e> <s> the capital is paid by the consumers <e> <s> no other industry expects its consumers to finance capital development <e> <s> that usually takes place as a result of loans which are paid off over the years <e>", "<cs> my recollection is that those industries borrowed very little and that they have been obliged by governments to finance themselves out of charges <e> <s> i believe this is a very unnecessary bill in every respect <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> as he rightly says there are now opportunities to amend these injustices to the ferry operators and carriers generally <e> <s> i think they accept that they are liable when bringing in illegal immigrants to pay the costs of sending them back to their own countries but if the entry is effected by the persons convincing the immigration officer that they are genuinely permitted to come to the country it is unreasonable if the immigration officer <e>", "<cs> my lords oftel recently published a report censuring british telecom for the great delay in providing the services for which mercury had asked <e>

has said concerning the problems for air carriers as well as the general problems posed by this act <e> <s> i think noble lords should first be reminded of the circumstances in which it was brought in <e> <s> it is a classic example of hard cases making bad law because the act was brought in in great haste by the government to deal retrospectively with the situation <e> <s> it came in on th may with retrospective effect to march in order to deal with the problem of the tamils who came here in circumstances of some distress which noble lords will remember <e> <s> this led to a great many legal problems <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house how those figures are divided between short journeys within europe and those further afield <e> <s> i believe that the european problem is quite different from that of migrants seeking asylum to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendments moved by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> as he said we had some discussion on this question in committee <e> <s> the minister gave an undertaking then that there would be a meeting between the general council of british shipping and his colleague the minister of state mr renton who deals largely with immigration matters <e> <s> the meeting took place <e> <s> i gather the shipping company representatives were received with great courtesy and there was a useful but not very positive discussion <e> <s> in my experience the minister of state is a man of great originality often excessively so and i was rather surprised to learn that he or his officials produced all the usual reasons which i think must be contained in some form of note to officials as to why they should take no action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord was to take all these amendments together <e> <s> if that is not so i shall not press this particular matter <e> <s> however i stress to the minister that i know from past

a labour party policy <e> <s> everything i said as always in this chamber is said on my own personal responsibility <e>", "<cs> to make it abundantly clear i repeat that my proposals and my speech today and indeed all my observations in this chamber are my personal responsibility <e> <s> i appreciate that we have had a good debate on what i believe to be an important matter <e>", "<cs> i am even more surprised if the noble lord believes that the decisions of the committee are someones interpretation of a debate rather than the text of the amendments which are proposed and passed or turned down <e> <s> i am old-fashioned enough to believe that the process of clause stand part is what matters rather than what may or may not be said <e> <s> however i shall not detain the committee further beyond saying that in no sense is my proposal additional to what exists in the bill <e> <s> i have no motive of a personal kind <e> <s> i suspect that if my proposals were to be adopted i

of the great pressure on parliamentary time of the governments legislative programme of which your lordships are only too well aware and since legislation may be necessary in order to rectify this matter could it not be dealt with in the education bill that is currently before the house as otherwise there will be an excuse of there being no parliamentary time available <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak on this matter but it goes a little further than the subject in front of the house <e> <s> with respect perhaps i may refer to the words of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> it deals not only with private acts of parliament but also bills sponsored by private members <e>", "<cs> my lords that is where local government expenditure has been permitted <e>

taxation can be moved only on behalf of the crown namely by a privy counsellor on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the fact that the derisory final figure of the dog licence and the lack of take-up was because the money went to local authorities <e> <s> would it not have been the case had the treasury been the recipient over the years that the dog licence would now certainly be over <e> <s> therefore would not such a scheme be a sensible thing to start <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us who the united states secretary of defense is <e> <s>

long-distance calls compares as between bt and mercury <e> <s> my experience is that mercury is much cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords while we understand that there is a distinction because contributions from pay since have been taken into account does the minister appreciate that every time there is a percentage increase the gap between pre and post pensions increases <e> <s> while as a minister in

not therefore take steps to see that the social security aspects of the pre pensions are also taken into account <e> <s> it is no good giving the hypothetical case of someone who receives the maximum

boyd-carpenter may be a little dim as it is some time since he held the dual function of a member of the house and a minister but i know that ministers carry the additional burden of constituency
