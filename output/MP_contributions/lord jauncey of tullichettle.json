["<cs> my lords i rise with humility and diffidence to speak for the first time in a debate in your lordships house <e> <s> i do it more so in the presence of my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey because the last time i had to address a committee of your lordships house as counsel my noble and learned friend was on the other side <e> <s> such was my argument that he was never called upon to answer <e> <s> i hope that i shall do better today <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise to the house for not being present at the outset of the debate in particular to hear the remarks of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> alas i was detained on business in another part of the building <e> <s> it gives me great pleasure to take this opportunity of congratulating my noble and learned friend lord emslie on his maiden speech <e> <s> i have been connected in law with the noble and learned lord for more than years <e> <s> i have appeared against him i have appeared as his junior and i have served under him as a judge in the court of session for nine years <e> <s> the association has always given me great pleasure and i very much hope that his immense experience and wisdom will now be available to your lordships on frequent occasions in the future <e> <s> this has been only the beginning of many more speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> this is a reference back to the solicitors scotland act where the rules which he makes are mentioned <e> <s> i am pleased that that is so it is clearly a matter of importance <e> <s> no doubt the lord president will take these matters into account <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words about amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and two other amendments to which my noble friend lady saltoun has already referred <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is simply to bring donor children into line with adopted children and those born out of wedlock in the law of succession in scotland <e> <s> the importance of succession to undifferenced coats of arms has already been stressed by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i only add to what she said that it is also important <e>", "<cs> i have committed a solecism <e> <s> i understand that i referred to the noble lady as learned but she has demurred <e> <s> i only add to what she said on undifferenced arms that they are of importance as well to the representors of great lowland families <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may ask him one question in relation to subsection b of amendment no <e> <s> with which he has dealt and about which i hope i made it clear that i was not very wholehearted <e> <s> my request to the government to consider a transitional provision for deeds was not primarily intended to affect the succession of donor children to their parents but rather to affect their ability to take under deeds which were executed at a time when they would not have fallen within the category of persons who could take <e> <s> in short a makes a deed for a certain class of persons when he knows that because of this legislation the effect will be that persons will be admitted to that class who would have been unable to take at the time the deed was executed <e> <s> that was the concern which i expressed in general when speaking to clause b <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is intended purely as a transitional provision of limited effect <e> <s> it applies only to deeds which were executed prior to the legislation coming into force because of course in relation to all deeds which are executed after the legislation comes into force the executor of the deed is presumed to know the law and he is presumed to know the consequences of the legislation <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is simply to avoid the position whereby unknown and possibly unintended beneficiaries are imposed upon testators and trusters <e> <s> this is a result which parliament has in the past sought very carefully to avoid <e> <s> i shall give four simple examples <e>"]
