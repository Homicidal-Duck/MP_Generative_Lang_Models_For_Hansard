["<cs> my lords i must ask your lordships indulgence for this my maiden speech <e> <s> my only claim to expertise in the field covered by the admirable white paper on the film industry is my considerable experience in other industries in the effects of restrictions restraints private cartels and government restrictions and particularly in the area of the effects of restraint on prices fixing of quotas and the like <e> <s> i must also confess to having a minor connection with another media item namely the printing industry but i think that this is only a relatively small part of the very important field of communications which we are talking about tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords like my colleague i too must declare an interest as i have been closely concerned with the eurobridge study group <e> <s> it is a very active group and has included a wide range of consultants in every aspect of a channel link <e> <s> it has dealt closely with and examined thoroughly all the problems of traffic both across and up and down the channel <e> <s> i believe that it has worked very much more than most other projects so far on the problems of engineering navigation ecology surveying insurance and many other technnical factors <e> <s> it has also dealt with those companies which have produced and are producing these new and some people feel very advanced materials and which have experience in their construction <e>", "<cs> my lords i must very definitely declare an interest having been a member of the eurobridge study group for several years <e> <s> my interest in the channel link goes back much further than that as i was involved in earlier discussions in the sixties <e> <s> i must admit that it does not go back further than that and i was interested in the figure of years mentioned by a previous speaker as being the length of time this thing had been under discussion <e> <s> i think that that was in fact napoleonic and the proposal was for coaches and four to go through a tunnel a little impractical i think even with the technology of today <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the materials we are putting into this bridge first and foremost the severn bridge which i think is the one referred to is hung on steel wire <e> <s> part of the problem they have on that bridge at the moment is that the fine wires in some of the hangers are rusting through <e> <s> i happen to be a steel man and i am very conscious of the problem of corrosion in the case of steel bridges <e> <s> furthermore on the severn bridge the structure itself i believe is subject today to over cracks at welding points <e> <s> the proposal for our bridge overcomes that very radically <e> <s> there are several reason and the first is that the cable is non-corrosive <e> <s> it does not require painting and therefore the maintenance cost is extremely low <e> <s> that applies to the hangers and to the suspension cable <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord excuse me <e> <s> perhaps i did not enlarge enough on that point <e> <s> there will be only one major pillar in a shipping lane <e> <s> the others will be on the boundaries of it <e> <s> but they will all be protected by buoys and cables which we have designed with special recognition that the largest ship moving up the channel is likely to be a -tonne tanker fully laden and running at knots <e> <s> this gear will stop that tanker whether it is head-on or side-on before it touches the bridge and therefore will both protect the tanker from its own misalignment and the bridge from being damaged <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned the use of concrete as i think did the noble baroness in regard to the burial of these materials <e> <s> one of the problems of concrete has always been that it is not an impervious material <e> <s> we are fortunate and i wonder whether the minister realises it that there is today a material which has been made by the use of polymerised cement which has been tested highly over the last years and which is totally impervious to water and almost any acid and the problem of burial of these materials which is the problem of the pollution of the surrounding area through water penetration would be completely stopped by such material <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister is aware that such materials if used in a container in that condition <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i too welcome this report and particularly would agree with what we have already heard about the support that the government are giving to the concepts and to the pressure being applied to the commission to get its regulations through in their various forms <e> <s> while i would support a great deal of what has been said about the shipping industry and the shipbuilding industry i ought at this stage to mention that i am somewhat heavily interested in a separate part of the business <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill very much indeed for <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from a deep personal and political concern i must also declare a commercial interest in the subject of the environment or rather in waste management and pollution control <e> <s> i beg your lordships indulgence for changing the direction of the debate again <e> <s> i am a director of a small company currently involved in the research and development of a safe container for the transport and storage of hazardous products but most particularly of all types of non-nuclear toxic waste <e> <s> i make this declaration not so much as evidence of self-interest but as evidence of credentials <e>", "<cs> my lords the current level of our environmental awareness has been brought about by the long overdue realisation of the potential dangers of our type of industrialised civilisation <e> <s> we have now had enough crises to force us to sit up and take a good hard look at our seemingly destructive tendencies <e> <s> although we have been conscious of the problems of pollution of one kind or another for many years most countries have done very little <e> <s> that is because the solution to those problems has relied too much on those with vested interests with their attention focused on the marketplace who in their own short term have found it more economical or expedient to circumvent the regulations or ignore them <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing that i must do in this debate is to declare an interest <e> <s> i am a director of a small company involved in the research and development of a container for the transport and storage of toxic waste products <e> <s> i am also a director of an environmental consultancy <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual in any debate on the environment i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i am a director of a small company concerned with research and development into a container for the transport and storage of toxic waste <e> <s> i am also a director of an environmental consultancy <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his very full reply <e> <s> i am not altogether happy with either the amendment or the reply <e> <s> perhaps the government will consider putting on the face of the bill a <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for that response <e> <s> i think he has answered my questions fully <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> i accept the assurances but i still think at this point that it would be better to use the word discrimination than undue discrimination <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> d <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friends argument was quite convincing <e> <s> the immediacy of the effect is what is important in this case <e> <s> for that reason i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall move amendment no <e> <s> c because i think it puts matters in the right order <e> <s> both the amendment of the noble earl lord shannon and that of the noble lord lord mcintosh deal with a national plan but from the wrong direction <e> <s> we have here a situation where the waste regulation authorities are supposed to produce a plan <e> <s> the noble earl and the noble lord are suggesting that the government should produce a plan which the wras should then follow <e> <s> however i suggest in my amendment no <e> <s> c that the government gather together all the plans that the wras have prepared <e> <s> that will give the government a basis of logistics and statistics which will enable them to find out what capacities and capabilities exist <e> <s> from that information the government can perhaps derive a plan which would not otherwise be available <e>", "<cs> i should like to take further the remarks made by the noble lord lord mcintosh and those made about my amendment in particular <e> <s> i take his point about setting out priorities <e> <s> it is a very strong point against which i have no defence <e> <s> there is no provision in the or clauses of the governments national plan for that information to be gathered together and published from the plans collected from the wras so as to allow local authorities waste disposal authorities waste regulatory authorities and all the other various authorities that are involved to produce regional or local plans on which their business decisions will be based <e> <s> unless that is forthcoming i do not believe that anybody can come up with a rational plan at any level <e> <s> one must know the overall situation in the country <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with this point <e> <s> it concerns the issue of whether a person is an occupier and knowingly permits the waste to be deposited <e> <s> the implication here is that the <e>", "<cs> i do not find that response very satisfactory <e> <s> at the end of the day we still have the situation where the innocent occupier has to pay out the money and then reclaim it <e> <s> for example what happens if the fly-tipping is of a very unpleasant controlled waste of some kind which will cost a considerable amount of money to remove <e> <s> will the occupier be responsible for that expenditure and then have to recover the money afterwards <e> <s> does he have to arrange to have the waste removed from his backyard his field or wherever when he is totally innocent <e> <s> does he have to take on this burden <e> <s> finally do the government feel that this responsibility should be shifted on to a totally innocent party <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the legal brains have been working on this matter <e> <s> i accept the ministers explanation <e> <s> i hope that he is right <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for a very full reply <e> <s> this was in many ways a probing amendment <e> <s> i am not totally happy with the reply but i am not <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his very full reply <e> <s> this is something of a maze <e> <s> i shall study his reply but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> another wonderful answer from the minister <e> <s> however it did not really address the problem on which i sought an answer namely what will happen in when there are totally different definitions of waste throughout the ec <e> <s> when that time comes and the boundaries are down there has to be a definition of waste <e> <s> as the minister said one persons waste is anothers raw material <e>", "<cs> that is provided that the new definition is not different <e> <s> under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment makes the greatest sense in calling for the banning of direct landfill <e>", "<cs> the problem with that reply is that not every country signed the basle convention <e> <s> i do not believe that it was signed by russia japan or the united states <e> <s> if someone from the united states sends something to this country the basle convention does not apply <e> <s> that is one of the objects of tabling the amendment so that those countries which are not part of the convention are forced to accept back the goods that they sent in a contaminated state <e>", "<cs> i shall consider this matter for a later date <e> <s> i wait to hear from the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
