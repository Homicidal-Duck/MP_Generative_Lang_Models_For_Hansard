["<cs> my lords i shall take the hint from the noble lord lord leonard and be as brief as i possibly can <e> <s> however i shall be an exception to most of your lordships in not apologising to the noble lord lord elton because i have every intention of being here when he winds up the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say something on this matter <e> <s> i rather hope that the noble viscount will not proceed on these lines <e> <s> the point is that we have had an opinion expressed on behalf of the leader of the house that this amendment is not relevant to the title of the bill <e> <s> i shall not try to argue about that at this moment but it seems to me that having an opinion of that sort by the leader of the house expressed by my noble friend lord ferrier it would be wrong for us to proceed in this way and it would possibly be treating the house with not quite the courtesy that it deserves if we proceed in this way <e> <s> a clear opinion has been expressed <e> <s> after all in this house we do not have the advantage or disadvantage whichever it may be of a speaker and so we must to some extent be guided by opinions of this sort <e> <s> therefore in these circumstances i would hope that the noble viscount would not feel that he ought to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to add my congratulations on the notable speeches made by the two maiden speakers <e> <s> i hope that they will speak many times again <e> <s> some years ago i began to teach a subject in oxford called ppe philosophy politics and economics <e> <s> in fact i taught it as the successor to the noble earl lord longford in christchurch and i am sure that i was nothing like as good a tutor as he was <e> <s> however one of the subjects which used to come up under politics was the question of federalism <e> <s> i can remember discussing the problem of canada even in those days and observing to my pupils from time to time that sooner or later that problem would blow up and would be a very difficult one indeed to solve <e> <s> i said that it would cause much trouble <e> <s> i am only relieved that when in fact the whole affair has blow up if i can use the expression it has gone very much better and much more smoothly than i feared and indeed expected in those days <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to say that i endorse everything that has been said since my noble friend lord eccles moved the amendment i am a trustee of the british museum and without wishing to be complacent or self-satisfied i believe that the system works perfectly well <e> <s> i should be very sorry to see members of the staff put on the board <e> <s> it would be a mistake it would be deeply divisive and it would be resented <e> <s> we know that would be the case and in those circumstances i am sure it would be wrong <e> <s> it would be a different situation when setting up a new system altogether in which case my noble friend lord eccles may or may not be right to say that it would work well <e> <s> but it is a different matter when one imposes the sort of provisions that are proposed on a very well-established system which has worked satisfactorily <e> <s> i therefore hope that my noble friend will not press the amendment but <e> <s> if he does <e> <s> i shall feel obliged with every respect to him to vote against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a trustee of the british museum and have discussed the matter with the noble lord lord trend <e> <s> i should like to express the strongest support for the speech made by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i thought it was excellent and i do not wish to add anything to it <e> <s> the trustee system has proved its worth <e> <s> i cannot see that there is anything violently wrong with it and i would endorse what was said by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington that the british museum operates in a very different way from the way in which it operated when my noble friend lord eccles was its chairman <e> <s> it is a very different system now and it is perfectly possible to adapt it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that in fact there is no danger of this <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i too like the noble lord lord beloff ought to declare an interest as an author <e> <s> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i should like to express my appreciation of the maiden speeches made by the two noble lords they were absolutely excellent and most interesting <e> <s> i think we should be very grateful to the noble lord lord annan for having introduced this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to enable certain local government elections in england and wales to be held by that system which entitles each elector to a single transferable vote <e> <s> i beg that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late and i do not propose to reply at any great length <e> <s> i believe that your lordships have heard a great deal of argument and it is all fairly familiar <e> <s> i should like to begin by thanking the many noble lords who have taken part in the debate and i even thank my noble friend lord elton and the noble lord lord mishcon for their most interesting contributions <e> <s> apart from them of course almost every noble lord who spoke with the possible exception of my noble friend lord fraser of kilmorack who was a little more doubtful was in favour of the bill <e> <s> i think that that is a matter of some significance <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be very brief <e> <s> i really want to raise only one point for the hour is late and the house probably will not wish to listen to me or to anyone else for very long at this stage in the evening <e> <s> i should like first to express gratitude to my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton for introducing this subject this evening <e> <s> i only want to refer to a point that was dwelt upon by my noble friend lord montgomery of alamein the question of multilateral and bilateral aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with many other noble lords in expressing appreciation of the maiden speech by the right reverend prelate the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a radical conservative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all welcome the motion proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> it is important that we should discuss these matters <e> <s> as he said in his opening remarks there are a wide number of subjects to be discussed and each person contributing to this debate will have his own field that he would like to talk about <e> <s> i am going to concentrate on the university field which is the one i happen to know something about and with particular reference to the white paper to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am not a superannuated or moribund vice-chancellor <e> <s> the noble lord lord annan said that they constituted a large part of this house <e> <s> however i have had an academic career of some length and i should like to express at once my strong support for nearly all the measures in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord armstrong <e> <s> i add them all the more fervently because i happen to agree with every single word that he said <e> <s> that enables me to congratulate him with the more satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords intervention on that point <e> <s> i am glad to hear what he says but when i motored past the place the other day it did not look like that <e> <s> the building looked derelict depressed and gloomy to a degree but if that is merely temporary and a great deal of rehabilitation is going on i should be only too pleased <e> <s> i do not wish to cast aspersions on someone whom the noble lord says is such a benefactor to our architectural heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i must continue <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the comments on this matter of my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu <e> <s> he may have something to say about it but if he has not i am sure that other noble lords will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord daventry on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it was most illuminating and helpful <e> <s> i very much hope that he will not go for another two years without speaking in your lordships house <e> <s> i thank all noble lords including the noble lord lord wyatt who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i thank them for some of the overkind and overgenerous things that they said about me <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> i believe that the government have shown courage in taking on this extremely difficult task that has baffled successive governments over many years <e> <s> this bill will replace confusion with clarity and obscurity with <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> my point is that it is by no means clear that crown servants would have had no defence under the present bill <e> <s> some of those who informed churchill could have argued that in defence the main issue their disclosures were not damaging to the public interest and a jury might well have accepted that argument <e> <s> under this act the person who if prosecuted would have had no defence at all was sir desmond morton who was the director of the centre of industrial intelligence from to <e> <s> it was some kind of offshoot of the committee of imperial defence <e> <s> he would have had no defence under the bill because he was in the intelligence service but the others in the foreign office the air ministry and the war office might well have had a defence <e> <s> i mention the matter only to put the record straight for it is an issue that is often misunderstood <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief as is appropriate at this stage of the evening <e> <s> i cannot pretend to be an expert on museum matters in any way <e> <s> my only claim to speak at all is that i was a trustee of the british museum for years <e> <s> i retired last september or i should not have dared to speak tonight <e> <s> i might have been in a somewhat invidious position had i still been on the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay tribute to the lucidity and clarity of the report <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in favour of the bill and i shall vote against the noble earls amendment <e> <s> i believe that the case for some form of student loan scheme is a very powerful one indeed <e> <s> it cannot be accidental that so many are operating in northern europe apparently successfully and with a greater intake of people from the poorer classes of society than we have <e> <s> that cannot be accidental <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord annan for raising this subject for debate <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford was rather severe on the noble lord but i am sure that he will be well capable of looking after himself when he comes to reply <e> <s> so i shall not dwell on that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will not be surprised when i say that i support the noble lord lord bonham-carter and urge your lordships to give a second reading to this bill <e> <s> i was chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because nearly everything that is likely to be said has already been said <e>"]
