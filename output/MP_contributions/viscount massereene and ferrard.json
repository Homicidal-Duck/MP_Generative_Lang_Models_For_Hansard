straight lines and of course if you are going to make a fence it is sensible to have them in a straight line and i do not necessarily quarrel with that they should leave say yards here or yards there

killed straight away they were badly maimed and all had to be destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave this amendment some support in the committee stage <e> <s> my noble friend lady masham of ilton

should like to ask my noble friend a question and i quite understand if he cannot answer it i cannot answer it but there is no reason why he should not be able to do so <e> <s> i understand that the

tissues which can be used for certain experiments which are still carried out on animals <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend on the front bench whether he would impress on the secretary of state to give every encouragement by financial means if possible to scientists who are experimenting in the use of tissue because i am sure that if the government were really to support that it would

issued by walsall council which to my mind is a blatant attempt to subvert democracy <e> <s> does my noble friend not agree that the duty of the local authorities is where possible to maintain the level of services and of course to upgrade them but not to spend the ratepayers money on political propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend very much for that reply with which i heartily agree will he not agree that if this habit of councils employing people according to their political labels continues it will lead to great injustice and amounts to corruption <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has referred to me i should just like to state that in the last three years

garbage collection because we have always disposed of our own garbage <e> <s> there appears to be no excuse for this exorbitant rise <e> <s> of course the reason is that it goes towards supporting council housing in glasgow <e> <s> it is my misfortune to be geographically in a highland area <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that if some local councils and councillors had been more responsible in their management of the financial affairs of councils this bill would not have been necessary <e> <s> it has been the great extravagance of some councils and

aware that my question certainly implies no reflection on the home secretary <e> <s> however if we take the multitude of problems apart from crime with which the home secretary has to contend may i ask my noble friend whether he thinks it is fair or possible to expect him today to be responsible for countering the rising amount of crime and violence which we are witnessing <e> <s> further would my noble friend agree that if we had a minister for law and order he could concentrate entirely on those subjects and inquire into the causes to see whether any groups are spreading sedition and

<s> people wanting to start businesses or to expand business if they are viable ought to be able to borrow <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that we ought to abolish wages councils <e> <s> i quite agree with that because the point is that there is no fear of sweated labour today with the welfare state <e> <s> i have actually met employees who have said to me we are quite prepared to take less but of course the employer cannot give less under the law <e> <s> if you abolished wages councils you could have more inspectors who could go round and see whether there were employees who were taking lower wages than has been laid down and whether they were doing it completely of their own accord and that the employer was not taking advantage of them <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him whether this means that the government are asking the larger dairy and pig farmers to reduce their numbers of cows and pigs to the numbers kept by the small farmer who will get the grant <e> <s> we in this county have a most efficient agricultural industry which equals the record of denmark <e> <s> one man on the land in england produces food for people whereas one

efficiency of agriculture in this country <e> <s> i agree that we do not want surpluses but why should we pander to the desire of the french government for the agricultural vote which is very big in france <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that over quite a number of years the highlands and islands development board have given very liberal grants to lobster fishermen to buy new boats and equipment <e> <s> would my noble friend not further agree that this unfortunately has rather resulted in over-fishing and that certainly in my area of the hebrides the lobsters are vanishing

riots of joy on the estate because when i arrived i always gave a big barbecue for all the children and the people and it was a riot of joy <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the reasons why there is this attitude to the police from some immigrants is that they brought that over from the countries they came from where their police are far tougher than ours <e> <s> it will probably take them some time to realise that our police are far better <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should begin by declaring my interest which is probably fairly well known <e> <s> i own a deer forest i have a sheep farm with sheep farm tenants and i am also on the deer committee of the british field sports society <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord glenarthur for his very lucid and clear introduction of the bill <e> <s> however i am afraid i cannot agree with everything that he said as regards deer the noble lord lord northfield is rather more after my own heart <e>", "<cs> my lords

friend not agree that increasing charges for a state monopoly service is no guarantee for an increase in efficiency <e>", "<cs> the point about notifying the owner within hours is that the owner will get rid of the deer far more efficiently and far less cruelly than the occupier <e> <s> the occupier may not be very used to deer <e> <s> he may wound them and will probably shoot deer of the wrong sex but the owner will usually be far more efficient <e> <s> as my noble friend lord burton said you can easily keep deer off a field for hours <e> <s> there are several easy ways <e> <s> you can drag

the poacher uses solid slugs <e> <s> to kill a mature stag with a shotgun one has to be incredibly near no further away than yards and one would have to do it by light at night <e> <s> but it is an extremely cruel practice <e> <s> the rspca may complain about it but why do the anti-blood sport people not do anything about it <e> <s> they are just not interested in that kind of thing <e> <s> it is incredibly cruel it should not be allowed and should be legislated against <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment but there is one thing i would like to ask <e> <s> does the noble viscount know whether the red deer commission really want this extra burden put upon them <e> <s> they are fairly lightly staffed and i should have thought it would not be for them to take it on <e> <s> i quite agree with the inclusion of the police <e> <s> i think it is essential that before the council grants a licence to a venison dealer they should consult them <e> <s> but i should like to ask the noble viscount whether he has discovered if the commission would like to take on this extra burden <e>", "<cs> can we not include both that is the total weight and the number of carcases and sex <e> <s> many carcases might be merely those of calves <e> <s> i really think it is essential to have the total weight <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for what he said about possibly considering the question of calves <e> <s> i think that is important <e> <s> in many instances today when one shoots old milk hinds with small calves one has to shoot the calves otherwise the calves would die <e> <s> this is not a very nice practice and i do not myself indulge in it but professional stalkers do <e> <s> i think that it would be a great help to know the total weight <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say that if a professional stalker shoots a knobber when out hind shooting he must be an extremely poor stalker and cannot know his job because the shape of a knobber as i am sure my noble friend knows is completely different from the shape of a hind <e> <s> it has a far heavier neck and its whole carriage is different <e>", "<cs> i think that would be done by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> for anyone shooting a lot of deer out of season one unattractive angle or unsavoury angle is that it is bad for the venison trade apart from any cruelty involved since many poached deer are shot

the owners stalkers or even the owner himself to rid himself of the nuisance of deer coming on to his crops <e> <s> as i have said before the occupier may well be unable to do this on his own <e> <s> therefore it is a great advantage for him to be able to call on the owner <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said in the end the occupier has the whip hand <e> <s> he does not have to invite the owner in <e> <s> but obviously it is in the occupiers interests to invite the owner to protect his crop from damage done by deer <e> <s> as i have said before the owners servants will probably be far more experienced than the occupier himself when it comes to deer <e> <s> therefore i agree with the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may tell your lordships a story about this quite a long time ago i had complaints from a tenant that his oats were being destroyed by deer <e> <s> i sent him a stalker who went out at night <e> <s> the stalker thought that he saw a hind moving in the corn <e> <s> fortunately the moon came out then and the stalker saw that it was the farmers wife who was going along beating down the corn <e> <s> she had a stags foot and was making the slot marks of a stag all through the corn <e> <s> i thought i should tell the noble viscount in particular that story because in my opinion he regards all occupiers as saints <e> <s> i can assure him that they are not certainly not in the western highlands <e>", "<cs> the position has changed very much since as my noble friend forgets although perhaps he was not born then <e> <s> in very few farmers and crofters had rifles <e> <s> they may have had an old shotgun but today every farmer has a rifle <e> <s> not all crofters do but they will have a shotgun <e> <s> one cannot really compare with today <e> <s> as i have said before the owner does come out of it badly because in the case of any tenants and certainly any tenants of mine who suffer damage by deer one compensates them or puts up a deer fence <e> <s> as my noble friend lord burton said the majority of these occupiers shoot the deer to make a lot of money <e> <s> some of them actually make far more money from enticing the deer on to their land and shooting them than they do from selling farm produce <e> <s> after all it is the owner who is the great taxpayer and yet he gets the worst side of the bargain <e>", "<cs> as i have already pointed out landowners usually recompense tenants if they have suffered damage by deer <e> <s> i also pointed out that we cannot compare or years ago with today because today the tenants have up-to-date powerful weapons they have extremely modern rifles with telescopic sights <e> <s> therefore they can destroy far more deer than the occupiers used to destroy years ago <e> <s> indeed all the big estates that i know distribute venison to their tenants <e> <s> i quite agree that that point is not strictly relevant to the question of damage to crops but they do not have the excuse to go out and shoot vast numbers of deer for monetary reward <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out to the noble lady that no other country in europe apart from ireland will have night shooting if this becomes law <e> <s> however there are very few deer in ireland <e> <s> apart from that cruelty is a factor <e> <s> as has been pointed out there are bound to be a great many wounded animals <e> <s> even if you shoot a stag dead if he is shot in the lung he will gallop for between yards to yards <e> <s> how are you gong to find him at night in a wood <e> <s> night shooting will be carried out in rides <e> <s> apart from wounding you are also going to lose carcases <e> <s> it is the wounding aspect which is so disagreeable <e> <s> deer will be wounded and how one will find them in the dark in a heavily forested area i cannot imagine <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for saying that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the western highlands like norway there are long sea lochs going into deer country like the fjords in norway and there are islands and poaching by boat can take place <e> <s> owing to the volcanic nature of the land quite big boats can come up to within a few yards of the shore <e> <s> quite a lot of poaching is done by fishing boats <e> <s> i have had one instance of it on my estate <e> <s> red deer at certain seasons in the year it does not usually happen in the summer but in the winter autumn and spring are extremely fond of seaweed especially the stags <e> <s> they come right down to the shore <e> <s> you can go along in a boat and pick them off as easily as anything <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble friend says i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend very much for that answer may i ask whether he does not agree with me though he appears already to have agreed with me that there is very little object in having fishing catch quotas if they are not going to be adhered to by members of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to be commendably short <e> <s> the noble lord lord macleod of fuinary will forgive me if i do not follow him into the questions of nuclear explosions <e> <s> i was under the impression that this debate was about the sex explosion and i shall try and keep to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that pornography was a new industry <e> <s> i am not so foolish as that <e> <s> what i said was that sex shops in this country were a comparatively new industry <e>", "<cs> having all my life owned and trained dogs from sheepdogs to watch dogs to sporting dogs i support the amendments <e> <s> the noble earl who has just sat down made the very good suggestion that there should not have to be a licence and a licence fee for sheepdogs and of course the present fee is absolutely absurd <e> <s> but i think that there could be a danger here so far as sheepdogs are concerned <e> <s> in an area in which let us suppose the local authority decided on a licence fee of members of the urban public would say we can buy a sheepdog puppy and so wont have to pay a licence fee <e> <s> but sheepdogs are not good dogs to have in urban areas because they require a great deal of work <e> <s> they have to gallop miles and miles when they are working and have to be very well exercised <e> <s> therefore i would not agree with that suggestion of the noble earl <e> <s> i think that the same licence ought to be paid for all dogs of all breeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the information on the annunciator was delayed and so i was a little late but may i say this i hope i am not out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is quite right in suggesting it is not always easy to see what is happening <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord glenarthur on the way he has handled this bill but i should like to say with due respect to him that i do not think it is in the interests of the deer proprietors <e> <s> i abhor the idea of night shooting <e> <s> i very much doubt whether this bill will be passed in another place i do not think it will be <e> <s> this is without doubt a bill for the scottish national farmers union and the forestry commission and i think we all know that <e>", "<cs> my lords here is one peer who does not agree with a word which the noble viscount who has just spoken has said <e> <s> however when one peers through the smog surrounding the foreign office as i have been doing it reminds me of a saying though i cannot remember who said it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask a question <e> <s> as he thinks that the socialist economies of the world are so efficient why is it that the private economies of the world have to feed the socialist world <e> <s> if we take russia as an example we find that before the bolshevik revolution she had a private economy and she was the greatest exporter of grain in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords today she is the greatest importer <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords although there are today million people unemployed we are now proportionately employing more people than we were in the early s when there were to unemployed <e> <s> the population has gone up considerably since then <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether if the commander of our submarine hms conqueror had wanted to be per cent <e> <s> sure of sinking the cruiser belgrano he could not have used more powerful torpedoes which i understand was a possibility <e> <s> was the reason for using less powerful torpedoes not necessarily to sink the cruiser but to cripple her for several months and thereby save many lives <e> <s> if we are engaged in a war which this is is it not dangerous to our own soldiers and sailors to fight it with kid gloves on <e>", "<cs> the only reason why the price of gas was put up was in order to build up a reserve for the further exploration of gas fields <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask this of my noble friend would it not encourage the argentinians to surrender if we told argentinas chiefs of staff that if they did not surrender within a certain time we would send in our vulcans to bomb the argentinian positions around port stanley <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord mottistone in this amendment <e> <s> i have taken no part in this bill but it seems extraordinary that ratepayers should have to give financial assistance to private businesses in local authority areas <e> <s> as i say i have taken no part in this bill so perhaps i should not speak on it <e> <s> but it occurs to me from my knowledge of certain things that have happened under various local authorities that the way is laid open to i will not use the word corruption <e> <s> however members of local authorities have friends who are in business and i should have thought that in certain cases this could be unsatisfactory <e> <s> i shall say no more <e> <s> nevertheless i support the amendment of my noble friend although i know that the government will not accept it <e> <s> but it surprises me that the poor ratepayer who is absolutely bled should have to provide financial assistance to support industry in a local authoritys area <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i understood him to say that the highland development board has had wonderful success <e> <s> it is as well that they have had a certain success but they have also had some very costly failures <e> <s> i know plenty of them which i will not enumerate now but if the noble lord were to ask me afterwards i could tell him of some from my own knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he does not agree that though of course we have great affection for the irish individually in fact many of us have irish blood in view of the attitude of the present irish government in not backing up sanctions against argentina as have the commonwealth and the majority of the eec countries apart from italy at some date in the near future we ought to review this special relationship with ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that that is really rather mean <e> <s> if an immigrant family has been here for a few years and they have no opportunity of getting a job would my noble friend not further agree that they should then get a generous subsidy if they wish to return home to their country of origin a subsidy of several thousand pounds <e> <s> would my noble friend not also agree that this would not only give them a fuller and more satisfactory life but would also ease the financial burden on the welfare state <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there was no suggestion of a bribe implied in my question <e> <s> i was just trying to help those people who wish to go home to their country of origin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now going to do something in this house which i

area in new york about which the right reverend prelate talked because i used to go to america a lot and <e>", "<cs> i was simply going to point out that in that area a great number of the occupants

difficult to know what to do with surplus straw <e> <s> i am all against burning because it destroys the insect life and so on <e> <s> i have often thought that with oat and barley straw particularly if the government would offer a subsidy for transport from the east to the west to the hills where all the cattle are it would be a great help to the big grain farmers <e> <s> that may not be strictly relevant to the matter of fines but i have often thought that the government ought really to help the big grain farmers regarding transport and it would also help the cattle farmers on the hills in the west <e>", "<cs> regarding what has been said about the man who did not pay his union subscritpion on grounds of conscience or whatever it may be i have always understood that if that was so it was unanimously agreed that he would pay the same amount to some charity or some religious body and in fact i have known an example of that <e> <s> but i quite agree that it does seem rather unfair if a man pays neither a union subscription nor the equivalent amount to a charity <e> <s> i agree that it does seem slightly annoying to his workmates <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not follow the noble lord lord monson into all the points which i rather regard as committee points in the very excellent speech which he has just delivered <e> <s> however i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord gowrie who has just disappeared but no doubt my congratulations will be passed on to him for his very good exposition of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> i have been campaigning for a step like this for a number of years for ballots before major strikes and many trade unions now have provision in their rules for ballots <e> <s> the government will probably say the amendment is not correctly drafted or is suggested for the wrong bill but be that as it may it would do the trade union movement a great deal of good if such an amendment were made law because as everybody knows the majority of trade union members are not militant <e> <s> if there is no ballot i am not sure whether under the amendment it is meant to be a secret ballot which is not the law at present but just a show of hands then as we know there is the question of intimidation and while many union members may not approve of a strike they are frightened not to put up their hands to vote for strike action <e> <s> that is well known <e> <s> i will not go on longer because we want if possible to get home before breakfast time <e> <s> i warmly support the amendment <e>",

understand that the government should have any objection to it <e> <s> in elections and especially in northern ireland you can perhaps get sometimes a little intimidation <e> <s> perhaps little is too

like to do so <e> <s> i am obviously not a naval architect but i think that naval architects ought to put on their thinking caps <e> <s> what i am worried about is that in this micro-electronic age

bonus shares in public companies the employees will instantly sell them <e> <s> you have to give a special sort of share that they cannot sell straight away <e> <s> otherwise giving these shares would

gibraltar with due respect to them are not <e> <s> or at least very few of them are <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i point out to him that if his only concern is and of course it is a very worthy concern that it will not impair transport services to the public all you need to say is if the minister is quite sure it will not impair the transport services to the public

just sat down <e> <s> of course he is entitled to his own opinion but he said that he would have liked britain to have been joined to europe for hundreds and hundreds of years that is what he said in

my lords before the noble baroness sits down does she consider that a married woman with young children who has a husband in lucrative employment should go out and get a job or does she consider that she should remain with the children <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that apart from the fact that i asked a similar question about two or three months ago we had a very good debate just

strung animal with acute senses <e> <s> it can scent a man on the hills from a mile away <e> <s> we cannot compare red deer with sheep or cattle which have been domesticated in this country certainly since the days of the romans <e> <s> would my noble friend agree that to subject these highly sensitive animals to a journey in a lorry amid the roar of traffic and to the smells and bustle of the slaughterhouse is extremely cruel <e> <s> would he agree that the kindest thing to do would be to shoot them in the neck with a rifle on the farm and that preferably the rifle should be fitted with a

backs down to the end of the sett and has his rear part against the earth so that terriers cannot hurt him <e> <s> the terriers can get hurt badly themselves <e> <s> an old terrier will learn just to bark and not to go near the badger <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i say that badger digging has never been classified as a field sport <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he not agree that the beauties of scotland must be protected because if you get hundreds of thousands of tourists straying all over the hills they spoil what they come to see <e> <s> there have been many instances of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the noble lord who has just sat down that years ago i agree that he was not in this house then the socialist opposition kept this house up until breakfast every morning under the leadership of lord morrison as he then became fighting the formation of the glc <e> <s> the noble lord hinted that we are playing party politics but who was playing party politics then <e> <s> we need not have had this bill at all if the glc had behaved financially responsibly but as we all know it has not <e> <s> it has spent

diet <e> <s> how can one be sure of the level of fluoride in the milk given by each of them <e> <s> one cannot go around testing the milk from every herd <e> <s> how can one be sure that some milk does not have a high enough level of fluoride in it already <e> <s> it will depend entirely on what the cow has been eating and on what land she is grazing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about this order since i introduced the original act in this house regarding the close season for deer in england and wales and i have always taken part in deer legislation regarding scotland <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord opposite that the shotgun ought to have been phased out a long time ago <e> <s> it has only been kept there owing to pressure from the farmers unions the nfu and the scottish nfu <e> <s> it is a disgrace <e> <s> it is difficult to kill a deer with a shotgun <e> <s> you nearly always wound it or blind it <e> <s> the other thing with which i cannot agree in this order is that self-loading rifles are allowed that should never be so <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house the noble lord is speaking of roe deer i was more interested in red deer <e>

whacking loss <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that in the s when the medicines act came about there was in fact a representative of natural medicines on the committee to help

competition <e> <s> i realise that today we need a mixed economy <e> <s> perhaps i am being a little absurd but if i were writing a text-book on the economy which is a simple subject of which people become very frightened i should discuss the advantages to the state of complete state control of the economy and the advantages to the state of the private economy <e>", "<cs> my noble friend knows very well that what the opposition are up to is to filibuster <e> <s> but regarding natural gas which we have only had for a short time when i was younger we always had gas from coal <e> <s> you do not need a lot of research to have gas from coal because we always used to have it <e>", "<cs> as regards employment by the forestry commission i know that for instance in certain areas they are not even felling the first thinnings now <e> <s> if they are felling the first thinnings they are leaving them to rot because there is no pulp mill anywhere nearby <e> <s> of course any thinnings they harvest are now going to norway where they are made into pulp and re-imported here which seems an extraordinary way to make money <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out to the noble lord who has just spoken that in countries where land has been nationalised the returns from it have been on the whole extremely poor but where land has been in private hands the productivity has been far greater <e>

eventually they ran up huge debts <e> <s> they certainly employed quite a lot of people <e> <s> but they made very great losses and by so doing impoverished the economy of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that short and sharp answer may i ask him whether he will not agree that if the public is turning to natural therapies there is an average increase of per cent <e> <s> every year there should surely be some help for the many young people wishing to study these therapies <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the turnover in relation to patients going to qualified practitioners of these natural therapies is something like million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that something over qualified medical practitioners in the therapies have studied for many years in these therapies <e> <s> will he not agree that there should be some institute perhaps under the auspices of the bma to register these practitioners and to see that they are fully qualified in the therapies that they have studied <e> <s> will he not agree that by having vat the government are putting a tax on the freedom of choice for medical attention on these patients who prefer to have therapeutic treatment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend <e> <s> i have come across many such instances <e> <s> a young person of is not experienced and the wage for him laid down by statute is too much <e> <s> the wage depends upon the individual and his ability <e> <s> the statute definitely prices a great many people out of jobs <e>

many people <e> <s> it has been a fact for years that if someone is paid a high wage for doing a small job he will be priced out of a job <e>", "<cs> i should like some clarification <e> <s> we always give agricultural workers four weeks holiday <e> <s> i also give them i understand that this is the law an extra a week for their holidays <e> <s> i have always understood that that applied to agricultural workers <e> <s> does it apply to all workers <e>", "<cs> it applies to agricultural workers <e> <s> they receive their full wages plus a week <e>", "<cs> if a worker does not want to take his holiday but would rather have the money as frequently happens where do we go from there <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that that is all right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> i remember the days of the hop market quota <e> <s> quotas were not tied to the land <e> <s> the quota was a certain figure and all the hop farmers together could not exceed that <e> <s> this prevented overproduction <e> <s> it would have been a good thing if we could have done the same with milk <e> <s> it is too late <e> <s> i just wanted to make that point and i agree with what the noble lord said about it <e> <s> it is too late <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect my noble friend behind me is rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the right reverend prelate will correct a statement he made in so far as that the coloureds and indians do have representation in the south african parliament <e> <s> the right reverend prelate said that they have no representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall keep within the new rule of seven minutes <e> <s> first of all i should like to say and i hope this makes the noble lord lord

they are well represented <e> <s> i thought i would tell him that because it might make him happier <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who have spoken especially the noble and learned lord lord denning

satisfy me i shall not sit down just yet i would be inclined very reluctantly to vote against the government <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell me whether it would be possible under this bill for a foreign company to take over all these services <e>", "<cs> as we all know <e>", "<cs> as we all know such damage is only a civil offence at the moment <e> <s> the real question is how one really gauges damage <e> <s> i have often experienced occasions when harmless trespassers have walked through a field and left the gate open so that the cattle or horses got out <e> <s> it is almost impossible to find the individual responsible and probably he did not mean to do it anyway <e> <s> so one cannot really make such instances a criminal offence <e> <s> however if someone trespasses onto private property and sets fire to a wood or to the corn then that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords eleven days ago i was priviledged to meet representatives of the zulu nation which is a nation of million people <e> <s> to a man they were against sanctions <e> <s> i also was upset about the discourtesy shown to our foreign <e>", "<cs> yes my lords he has apart

housing districts which are limited to whites <e> <s> however the south african government are rather winking an eye at that <e> <s> i happen to know that it is actually happening <e> <s> the only other matter is as i say the question of one man one vote which will take time and which will have to be done through persuasion and not by the stick <e> <s> i should also like to point out that the south african government have on several occasions offered mr mandela his freedom if he would renounce violence <e> <s> they have done the same in relation to the african national union but they will not renounce violence <e> <s> with the greatest respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke once or twice on the common market before we entered it and at that time i was frightened of the bureaucracy in europe <e> <s> on the continent they appear to have standards that are different from ours in certain spheres <e> <s> certainly that is the case in respect of their laws <e> <s> not being a lawyer i certainly do not intend to speak about the law but i await with interest the speech of the noble and learned lord lord denning regarding that aspect in relation to the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords but this bill slightly alters the position from what it was then <e>", "<cs> then i am mistaken my lords i thought it did <e>", "<cs> my lords my train of thought has been broken but to get back to the point what we must do is to try to make the ec far more effective in regard to the economic position <e> <s> for example i refer to the common agricultural policy <e> <s> it seems to be quite crazy as has often been said that we have these mountains of beef lakes of wine and vast stores of wheat and butter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are many stations in england which are understaffed apart from a signalman so that one cannot buy a ticket <e> <s> if one wishes to change to a faster train one cannot find the guard and cannot get a ticket in that way either <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that what happens is that you must purchase a ticket voluntarily as you leave the station and are delayed for a considerable time until the ticket collector writes out a ticket <e>", "<cs> my lords i heartily agree with my noble friend who has just sat <e>", "<cs> yes my lords he was he had a great sense of humour <e> <s> i have been speaking for six minutes and that is nearly enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also going to speak on the environment but i am going to speak on the natural environment and not the architectural environment <e> <s> your lordships may have

rain in the dark with these vast lorries weighing tonnes and doing miles an hour it is a question of life and limb <e> <s> i have nearly been killed two or three times <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a director of a company which owned ships carrying iron ore although they were only small ships of about tons <e> <s> in the statement my noble friend said that the kowloon bridge lost her anchor <e> <s> however if there is any wind at all a ship does not rely on just one anchor but always has two anchors out <e> <s> ships have other anchors on board too <e> <s> the ship also had her engines <e>

across the atlantic it was rash of the captain to take to the open sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression when we passed the european communities amendment bill during the last session which brought in the single european act that as we have now debased our sovereignty we have no power <e> <s> if the council of ministers decides the system of election that all countries in the ec will have surely no british government will have the power to block what the ec now decides on choosing a system of election <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord mellish aware that mr murdoch did not start the dispute <e> <s> the union started it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that the countryside in this country was man-made <e> <s> that is so to a certain extent but i think he rather exaggerated when he quoted the roman occupation <e> <s> it was certainly man-made for the last years <e> <s> when this new legislation comes into being how will it affect the wild

beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> it is slightly more encouraging than a reply i received about two or three years ago when i asked more or less the same question <e> <s> does he realise that such silent and lethal weapons can cause a grievous wound that is more serious than an injury from a high velocity bullet <e> <s> i understand that a great number of crossbows are obtained through mail order houses <e> <s> how will a mail order house ascertain whether its prospective customer is under years old <e> <s> i know that this is a very long and involved question and perhaps not quite fair so if my noble friend prefers he can write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that crime is not necessarily the <e>", "<cs> surely i am right in saying that the poorer communities who have to pay a community charge will according to the bill get help <e> <s> there will be benefit arrangements <e> <s> but the richer members who will be paying this charge pay other non-domestic rates we must remember though not all of them <e> <s> some of those rates are extremely high <e> <s> i should like to point that out <e> <s> so far as i know strathclyde increased its rates last year by per cent <e> <s> perhaps i am not quite correct in that but i thought it was about that figure <e>", "<cs> my experience has been that if the cottages are all on the same estate the employer has always paid the rates if a cottage is not tied <e> <s> the employer has always paid the rates on the house for his employee <e> <s> it should certainly be at the option of the employer to pay the rates of an untied cottage <e> <s> if a cottage is tied presumably rates do not have to be paid <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that <e> <s> i have never known a tied cottage occupied by an agricultural <e>", "<cs> as i understand it my noble friend has said that these people will benefit under the rebate system <e> <s> he has explained this again and again and not only today <e> <s> it does not seem such an insufferable problem <e> <s> what the minister said seems to be perfectly reasonable <e>", "<cs> what about those people who have very large houses but have no local authority services <e> <s> there are many such houses in scotland especially in the highlands <e> <s> those people also have to pay a great number of non-domestic rates <e>", "<cs> they have a lot of other services of course <e> <s> i have one or two crofters and i am all for it <e> <s> but they receive a tremendous grant for almost everything they buy themselves <e> <s> i do not therefore think that they do too badly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the sand eel is the staple food of the sea trout while he is in salt water <e> <s> when the sea trout comes into fresh water in his migrations which is usually three times within his lifetime he is the poor mans salmon <e> <s> the sea trout is a first cousin of the salmon but he is stronger pound for pound <e> <s> would not my noble friend agree that if there is overharvesting of the sand eel as i believe there is the sea trout will be in decline <e> <s> if that decline continued the tourist trade with regard to fishing would suffer badly since the sea trout is the pride of the freshwater angler <e> <s> is the minister aware that there are many hundreds of fishing hotels which will suffer in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which i had already guessed <e> <s> does he agree that it would save a lot of time in such hearings if the crown commissioners initiated research into the areas in which they give licences for sea cages <e> <s> does he further agree that they should carry out research into where salmon feed and the salmon routes into sea lochs where they come in to spawn in the rivers <e> <s> they should also carry out research into whether the foreshore has suitable places for jetties and sheds where such salmon farms can be serviced <e> <s> the most important point <e>", "<cs> is pollution which will spread disease <e> <s> where there are several thousand salmon in fish cages which are being fed several tonnes of food daily pollution and disease will result <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether the crown commissioners when granting these licences take into account for research purposes whether old established salmon rights in the sea are lost <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord is being impractical <e> <s> he appears to be suggesting a means test <e> <s> i know that the noble lord is no longer a member of the labour party but i should have thought that the labour party would object to this <e> <s> one would have to have an army of bureaucrats an army of civil servants questioning people to find out their ability to pay <e> <s> also a lot of people probably would not tell the truth <e> <s> some peoples income varies each year <e> <s> would that mean that an army of civil servants would question those people every year to see whether their circumstances had changed <e> <s> this appears to me to be highly impracticable <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that the poorer will suffer and the richer will not suffer he forgets always that the richer have to pay other rates such as non-domestic rates <e> <s> that is always forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant duty to congratulate my noble friend lord haddington on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was absolutely magnificent that although i understand he is with a company that manufactures crossbows he also said that he would recommend the banning of crossbows apart from use for target shooting <e>

national field crossbow federation but shooting with crossbows is not a field sport <e> <s> that is quite another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down the government statistics

minister will bear it in mind when he speaks to some of his fellow ministers who are interested in this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill was piloted through the other place by mr harry greenway the honourable member for ealing north who had two previous attempts with a similar measure <e> <s> the first attempt in prompted by his enthusiasm to crush the villains who promote dogfights involved a bill with penalties of and years in gaol <e> <s> that was no good the government realised that the penalties were far too heavy <e>

very difficult for burglars to break them open <e> <s> however they are very expensive <e> <s> if a man cannot afford one he cannot afford it <e> <s> as far as gamekeepers are concerned probably an employer would see that the firearms used on the estate were safely protected <e> <s> it is quite a problem for some people <e>", "<cs> i briefly support the noble ladys amendment <e> <s> often one is asked to shoot in different places sometimes even abroad so it is difficult to say where one will be shooting <e> <s> one can shoot at home which presumably is all right but for rifles it is a different matter <e> <s> one may be stalking on ones own ground or asked to stalk somewhere else and one can even be asked to go abroad with a rifle <e> <s> i agree with the amendment <e> <s> i do not believe one needs to tell the police because it would be difficult to tell them where you will be keeping your gun because you may be fairly mobile <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment very strongly but there can be no doubt that there are some snags in the way <e> <s> if that is so i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will tell us what they are <e> <s> without doubt there are people who have firearms without a firearms certificate <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer but i know that in many statutes there is the word reasonable <e> <s> why not have the word substantial <e> <s> i think it is far better than the words as a necessary adjunct <e> <s> without being rude what is the purpose of arguing over words like substantial <e> <s> we can go on arguing for a very long time and i do not think that in the end we will get much further <e>", "<cs> i wish to know whether ammunition includes rifle ammunition <e> <s> if high velocity rifle ammunition is being sent like and it has to be extremely securely packed <e> <s> to send high velocity heavy ammunition and rifle ammunition by mail order would be dangerous <e> <s> it could easily be intercepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> several noble lords have been circulated by the southern water authority the promoters of the bill about its objects and explaining it in every detail <e> <s> there were petitioners but have now withdrawn and i am pleased to say the promoters have received notices to that effect <e> <s> however one petitioner the british railways board is still outstanding <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i do not know about that my lords <e> <s> as will be apparent much of the contention has gone out of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend i point out that in the southern water authority was highly efficient as regards the medway scheme at leigh in kent <e> <s> that concerned flooding and holding back the flood waters in storage areas <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend has been hard on the southern water authority <e> <s> it has been very generous with the petitioners but i shall not go into that matter <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has been hard on the southern water authority because the medway scheme was very successful <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that a great number of peers apply for leave of absence for the session <e> <s> i do not know the exact number who applied this session but i believe that it is usually about to or sometimes even more <e> <s> therefore none of those peers can come in to vote they cannot play any part in the proceedings in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i missed my turn to speak for which i apologise <e> <s> however it has kindly been arranged that i can now say a few words <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much enjoyed the speech of the noble lord lord stoddart and agreed with his logic to a great extent <e> <s> unfortunately democracy is not logical <e> <s> in a general election the village simpleton casts his vote as does a great captain of industry who employs people and brings great wealth into the country <e> <s> the captain of industry and the village simpleton have the same power to choose their final arbiter if that is the right word to use <e> <s> that is not logical <e>", "<cs> my lords it has a great deal to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say that if one messes about with this house too much one will destroy a house of great value <e> <s> i understand that my noble friend lord carrington has written a book in which he suggests that this house should be an elected body <e> <s> if that were so one would have only a mirror of the commons <e> <s> i can see very little point in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken part in quite a few debates regarding devolution for scotland <e> <s> i remember one in i think which was a very topsy-turvy debate <e> <s> the bill at that time foundered as it was bound to do <e> <s> but there is always a danger when you start on devolution although the danger is of course not great provided that the driving force behind independence remains the scottish nationalist party because the scots are very intelligent and well-educated people and they will not allow it to happen <e> <s> perhaps i should say that i am partly scottish myself and anything like the present scottish nationalist party certainly will not bring about an independent scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there has been a statement from the european community that historic battlefields ought to be protected from urbanisation and motorways in particular <e> <s> does he agree that although the battle of naseby was a small battle involving only about men it has been the foundation of constitutional monarchy in this country and that therefore <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it has <e> <s> i am not stretching a point <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that it is indeed a very important site and should not be abandoned for purely commercial reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that we should bear in mind the mild winter and that there are now far fewer predators to eat the rats especially country rats <e> <s> however the really dangerous rat is the black rat which started the plague and is prevalent in sewers <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because i was told that the house would rise much earlier than is apparently to be the case <e> <s> first i thank my noble friend lady gardner for introducing the bill and also my noble friend lord colwyn who has done my job for me far better than i could have done because he is what i would call a medical expert <e> <s> he is an extremely good dentist and i hear one who hardly ever hurts his patients which is a good quality in a dentist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend was a patient of my noble friend lord colwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether the government are quite satisfied that the aid which we send to ethiopia goes to the right sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been in cardiff only twice in my life and so i cannot speak authoritatively about cardiff <e> <s> however i can speak a little about the wildlife especially the waders <e> <s> that is my only reason for speaking on this subject <e> <s> i cannot see why this cannot be a salt water lake in which case one would not have the algae or the danger of filth and stagnation <e> <s> provided there were not too many human beings around one would keep a large number of waders <e> <s> if one has a fresh water lake which appears to be the plan i do not know how deep it will be presumably it will be far too deep for waders <e> <s> even if it were shallow they would not obtain the food that they would get from salt water <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak for a moment as i have long experience of deer forests and since as a boy i have studied these animals and stalked them hundreds and thousands of times <e> <s> i have also shot them stone dead at the right age and i have stalked for other people <e> <s> i have written on the subject and with due respect i know a lot about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for giving way <e> <s> the real way to kill deer on a deer farm is to shoot them in the neck with a high-velocity bullet <e> <s> they drop stone dead and can know nothing about it though it is extraordinary that the other deer which are not shot and are standing around do not seem to worry much <e> <s> that is the only humane way of killing them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> first i should say that i intend to support the bill of my noble friend <e> <s> i have very little knowledge on this subject <e> <s> it is not really my ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i have drawn attention to the question i am about to ask before <e> <s> does my noble friend realise that if this infection ever got into wild deer it would not only destroy our largest mammal the red deer which has been here since the ice age but it would also destroy an industry which of course would take some time that is extremely important to the highlands of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that about four years ago in a demonstration british rail crashed at miles per hour a train that was packed with atomic waste and there was no explosion <e> <s> it was just a lot of smoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i fully appreciate that this is a delicate question <e> <s> however does my noble friend not agree that mr rushdie whom i understand to be a british citizen has through his writings which in my opinion are scurrilous and blasphemous greatly offended the arab world and caused great offence to many devout moslems <e> <s> does my noble friend not also agree that presumably mr rushdie has made a lot of money out of his writings and that this matter has impaired our relations certainly in the middle east with the arabs <e> <s> may i also ask <e>", "<cs> i should like to tell the noble lord lord graham that i once owned a factory <e> <s> everyone was very happy there <e> <s> i suggested to one of the workers on the shopfloor who was extremely popular with all the other men that he might like to sit on the board <e> <s> he said that he would and i put him on the board <e> <s> he came to me about four or five weeks afterwards and said that he would like to resign <e> <s> i asked him why and he said hardly any of the workers on the shopfloor will now speak to me <e> <s> therefore i think that one has to be very careful when appointing people who have no relevant experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for introducing this debate <e> <s> i also congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard on his maiden speech <e> <s> i knew his father well and i am sure that he would have been extremely pleased to have known what his son said <e> <s> it was an excellent speech <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding elephants as we in this country started most of the game parks in africa could we not help by training their gamekeepers i do not know if that is the right word <e> <s> could we not provide money to provide more staff to defeat the poachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord kimball for being delayed since the train which i went to catch never turned up <e> <s> amazing <e> <s> i was delayed by an hour but for once it was not my fault <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw on practical experience <e> <s> years ago i worked with a trans-shipping company which used to bring in grain from the river plate <e> <s> i then used to go down to the docks where the grain was unloaded by using giant hoovers <e> <s> a man in the granary turned the wheel <e> <s> eight pipes were operated with one and sometimes two dockers at each pipe <e> <s> the docker at each pipe had nothing to do except spit into the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in my opinion hundreds of thousands of landowners carry out many times better work on their own land as regards conservation than the so-called professionals who are paid high sums to do so <e> <s> landowners have more practical experience on the whole <e>", "<cs> i too support the last three peers who have spoken on this point <e> <s> i have great connections with northern ireland <e> <s> i know that certain action may be for the convenience of the government and i appreciate that point but i believe that this bill is too important to be rushed through <e>", "<cs> no act of parliament can be per cent <e> <s> foolproof no matter how well it is drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in my experience if you plant conifers especially spruce up to the side of a loch the fish will go to the other side where conifers are not planted <e> <s> the reason for that is the increase in acidity <e> <s> as regards improving the landscape certain aspects can be improved by conifer planting <e> <s> however it entirely depends on how they are planted and how rigid lines are overcome by allowing space within the fences for other more natural trees such as birch to soften the outline <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there has been a great deterioration in the numbers of sea trout this year and last year around the scottish islands and in the rivers and lochs <e> <s> does he agree that the salmon is the poor mans sporting fish <e> <s> is he further aware that the sea trout in loch maree which has the best sea trout has distinctly deteriorated this year and that in my own loch loch ba which is famous for the size of its sea trout the numbers have dropped by two-thirds <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i have not spoken in the house on this subject for the past two years <e> <s> however i have decided to chip in for a moment tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> although it is not my subject i felt that i had to say a few words <e> <s> without doubt if this bill were to become law as i hardly imagine it will there would definitely be far more abortions <e> <s> some noble lords have said that it is an open door and that it would be near murder <e> <s> i believe that that is rather a strong word to use <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord campbell of croy for tabling this debate <e> <s> he certainly gave us a vast area to cover the whole world but i shall bear in mind the doorkeepers dance or party and be reasonably brief <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the city of canterbury is in a unique position <e> <s> it has to pay for the roads within its boundaries and other facilities in order to attract tourists <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree with me that it is not an ordinary city <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested to hear what my noble friend lord marshall of leeds said about the railways with regard to the channel tunnel <e> <s> however i shall not follow that theme because i chiefly wish to speak for my friends in the county of kent <e> <s> i have a place in kent <e> <s> many people are very worried about the noise aspect <e> <s> i speak on that matter for only a short time <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may say that i unfortunately brought the wrong glasses so i could not read my notes <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for his kind words <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that for many years we in parliament have been debating the subject and the experimentation on tissues which will replace the necessity to use animals <e> <s> does he agree that to obey the ec regulation would be a backward step and would be appalling <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on my estate in scotland i have very rare birds including the white-tailed sea eagle <e> <s> so far no protection has been offered for these birds <e> <s> perhaps i am out of order <e> <s> if so i apologise <e> <s> the question refers only to england and wales <e> <s> it might have been better if it had included scotland <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that as the number of organ transplants increases so will the cost <e> <s> i do not know anything about heart transplants but i understand that such a transplant can cost up to or <e> <s> if the cost of heart transplants is added on to the cost of other organ transplants the health service will soon run out of cash and it will be by far the most expensive organisation in the country far more expensive than education <e> <s> you cannot go on and on increasing the number of transplants <e> <s> how do you choose who is to have a heart transplant if there are for example six people all wanting such transplants <e> <s> how do you choose the first person if money is getting scarce <e> <s> perhaps i have not expressed my point very well but money does not just fall from heaven <e> <s> it might appear to do so in this country but it does not <e> <s> it must be earned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was rather disappointed at my noble friend lord heskeths speech <e> <s> however i am glad that i heard the noble and gallant lord lord carver because he gave me hope <e> <s> from the press and other media i was of the opinion that the nature conservancy council was going to be abolished <e> <s> that would have been appalling <e> <s> one cannot foretell the future but it may not be abolished for a long time yet <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether her majestys government realise that several scientists have just invented a process by which they can turn the straw from corn into materials to make utensils which at the moment are made of plastic <e> <s> that will be a great help in the future <e> <s> although it is not strictly relevant to the amendment i believe that it is important that the government should inquire into the matter <e> <s> the process can be used to make utensils of all sorts <e> <s> the material will fade away in about six months or so <e> <s> therefore there will be no need to recycle that form of waste because it will vanish <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate for some time <e> <s> i understood the noble lord opposite to say that he was under the impression that there was an inbuilt bias because of the businessmen on those boards <e> <s> it is excellent if there are businessmen on those boards <e> <s> i am on boards and am chairman of a public company <e> <s> the amendments that i have heard all seem more or less the same <e> <s> with due respect the debate has been rather a waste of time <e> <s> if any of the businesses or companies with which i am involved went on like this the shareholders would be displeased <e> <s> it is quite different with government matters because you have untold finance behind you so it does not matter how much you spend or how much is thrown away <e> <s> i hope that i have not gone on too long <e> <s> i had to intervene because hearing all that repetition was too much <e>", "<cs> the real trouble with dogs in this country is that we are an urban population <e> <s> we are about per cent <e> <s> urban and of course the problem is that so many dog owners especially in our big cities do not understand dogs <e> <s> the noble lord who has just sat down said that this amendment should not come up in a bill about the environment <e> <s> i do not agree with him at all <e> <s> after all the fouling in our big cities touches on the environment <e> <s> that is not the dogs fault it is the human beings fault <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the public have done far better and have had a far better standard of living under this conservative government <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that i once had a factory <e> <s> tourism has to a great extent taken over from manufacturing industry in raising the standard of living <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out to my noble friend lord selkirk that this has been tried out <e> <s> it has been tried out in northern ireland and has been successful <e> <s> i admire my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> he has done a very good job <e> <s> i was about to say that he has been just like a terrier on a rat but that is not a very good way of expressing what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who has just spoken says that in europe wages are far higher than in this country <e> <s> however he cannot say that about the whole of europe <e> <s> in certain countries in the ec wages are definitely lower <e> <s> also he has not taken housing into consideration <e> <s> i am an employer in agriculture and

farmer in england and scotland <e> <s> now that the price of lamb is half what it has been can he tell me why it is that butchers are charging exactly the same price for it as they did last year
