["<cs> my lords i am venturing to address your lordships today for the first time because as chairman of the leeds castle foundation and working with my fellow trustees of whom i see several present in the chamber today i have spent all my time in the last eight years looking after this beautiful castle in kent <e> <s> i believe your lordships will find that our experience will be useful in considering the bill and especially the proposal that a large part of the government-owned monuments and castles should be transferred to the new commission so that they may be more entrepreneurially managed than is possible by a government department <e>", "<cs> as the first minister of education to have had a scientific education i support this <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will have good news for us <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord montagu <e> <s> the arrangement in the bill does seem probably unintentionally to discriminate against this fine museum and i feel that the committee would like to avoid that if possible <e> <s> can the noble earl tell us whether he can do anything to meet these views <e>", "<cs> i hate to disagree even in the slightest extent with my noble friend lord eccles but he has based his argument largely on the idea that the tower was not going to be moved to the commission <e> <s> maybe the tower will not be moved to the commission but many of us feel that as regards the tourist management of the tower it would be much better if the commission took over that side of the work <e> <s> indeed i think that the government in their consultation paper suggested that that might be possible in which case i suggest that the argument of my noble friend rather falls to the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the welcome given to the remarks made by my noble friend today although i do so for a reason slightly different from the reasons which have been advanced by other noble lords <e> <s> some of us are very anxious to see the new commission acting like an entrepreneurial charity <e> <s> we had some doubts before as to whether the tax regime would be suitable for such a role <e> <s> therefore i am very glad that my noble friend has set those doubts at rest because i believe the arrangement will very much facilitate the enterprising yet charitable role that some of us so much hope to see in the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to congratulate my noble friend in introducing this new clause and to ask him one or two questions about the effect that the functions of the commission might have on the work of the commission in doing its best to help the smaller manor houses farms and cottages of this country <e> <s> in doing this i am supporting my noble friend lady airey <e> <s> i can understand that it is difficult for the government to make the definition of outstanding easier in relation to the grant-making powers of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am not out of order in intervening briefly i think it is an interesting point that has been made <e> <s> we realise that the government cannot go too far in departing from the general formula of outstanding natural beauty or historic or architectural qualities <e> <s> with regard to other methods that are open for them to assist in the survival of the smaller house i do not like disagreeing with my noble friend who has just spoken but although these arrangements generally might be unpopular is that any reason why they should not be available in case in certain circumstances <e> <s> there are an infinite variety of possible circumstances <e> <s> they might prove attractive <e> <s> i think the parallel with the agricultural arrangements which have been worked out successfully over the years is an interesting point <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble earl will be able to tell us that the bill as drafted makes proper provision for the commission to engage in proper publicity <e> <s> i personally think that to over-emphasise the question of publicity if i may say so with deference to my noble friend in regard to his amendment would be a mistake because at the moment there is almost too much emphasis being put on publicity as being the one factor in successful entrepreneurial management <e> <s> i believe that that is not the case the real point is that it is the quality of the product the way in which the house is kept up and maintained and the real educational interest and other aspects of the house which is most important and which in the end will produce success <e> <s> therefore i should like to suggest to my noble friend that he does not press this amendment because i am sure that publicity is taken care of in the bill in a proper way but it should not be over-emphasised <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody in this house wishes to embarrass the government but everybody wants to see the new commission being a great success <e> <s> am i unduly nave in putting it in this way <e> <s> the fact is that the government are only transferring to the new commission about million worth of revenue whereas they are keeping in the department about million-worth of revenue from what i describe i must admit to a slightly vulgar phrase as the great money-spinning palaces <e> <s> one would feel to move the metaphor that they might be a great flywheel for the development of the entrepreneurial process and we hope for the success of the new commission <e> <s> the government are asking us to believe at the same time that they are performing some important movement towards an <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will permit me i expressly said to him that it was not necessary that the ownership should pass <e> <s> i said that i thought it was important from the point of view of the management and he did not deal with that <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former birmingham member may i say that it is particularly pleasant for me to hear the noble baroness lady fisher welcoming these proposals today in her soft midland tones to which she so charmingly referred <e> <s> but i think that the house ought to take note of the fact that governments of both parties over many years did great damage to the natural growth of industry in the midlands area by forcing the natural growth away from that area where it would have taken place naturally and healthily into other regions where very often it failed completely <e> <s> i am glad that this shows that governments are now taking a new view and including the midlands towns <e> <s> i think that i am right in supposing that my noble friend has said that his ambition is to encourage again the natural spirit of tremendous enterprise which has been such a great feature of the history of the midlands industrial area <e>"]
