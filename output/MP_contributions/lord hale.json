administering of the criminal law without adequate opportunity for discussion <e> <s> mr jenkins as the noble and learned lord quite properly refers to him called in their absence the evidence of

committee is not in a position to come to a decision on this proposal <e> <s> i know that it is extremely unpopular for the discussion to be pursued at this moment for many reasons but the discussion

persons concerned get it <e> <s> for the moment my own mind would run rather to the hope that there would be some preliminary inquiry a gradual acquaintance with the nature of it and before a decision was taken that a full inquiry was justified or necessitated <e> <s> in that circumstance i would certainly be more impressed by the suggestion made by the noble lord lord hooson that this if it is to be a full hearing must take place in private and frankly the original notification of the parties and the steps that are taken and the question of whether this is going to be an inquiry with counsel or not are all matters in our minds and if the discussion could be postponed for a further amendment to be tabled and the existing amendment withdrawn so much the better <e> <s> if not i shall have to

that not only that but there was no provision stating that they had to be submitted to either house <e> <s> we are not talking about the regulations which may be made locally about how one builds a road hump and so on the amendment refers to regulations of some importance and i cannot find anything which gives a specific authority or even says that they <e>", "<cs> well that leg of mutton is so

recently making a criticism of the people expressing opinions on documents that they had not received or read <e> <s> is the noble and learned lords typescript document one that has been corrected

defence of the indian ocean will be strengthened by the construction of an american-dominated defence station in the indian ocean <e> <s> they were very hesitant about it and had it almost pushed on them by british ministers let us make no mistake about that the evidence is overwhelming and as my noble friend justly said they were the first to hold a public inquiry and raise some of the problems such as the destruction of the rare large tortoises on that particular island <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the judiciary has been fully occupied for a considerable time in overriding its own decisions and in setting up committees to define words and to investigate <e> <s> there is in fact a very interesting discussion set down for next week on this matter <e> <s> will he also remember that the work he is doing in connection with the prison service also wants tying up with many other forms of public activity including for example hospitals <e> <s> will he bear in mind that the use of polyurethane has been exposed as terribly dangerous and that the necessity for an adequate substitute in many spheres of activity is growing more and more urgent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just refer to the great mass of english literature and particularly its poetry which is largely devoted to peace and say that the study of the greatest of english poets does produce peace of mind which is of advantage in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that in the case for example of kings college hospital where i have had the good fortune to have had almost continuous care for months the question of administrative costs is very largely a question of definition <e> <s> they have a very remarkable system there under which the patient can spend much more time at home with less cost to the hospital by utilising administrative services and giving the patient special examinations from time to time at the hospital in the various departments and supplying special treatment at those interviews <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he really is answering the question on the order paper or is he referring to a later statement which is not on the order paper and can he add whether the question on the order paper refers to a statement made or alleged by the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether we have reached the pneumoconiosis order <e> <s> i wish to say a few words on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious to ask a question on the pneumoconiosis regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to waste time as has been done previously by explaining that i shall be very brief <e> <s> i would prefer to carry on with my speech without any unnecessary trimmings <e> <s> i personally want to congratulate the government on this measure on the way in which it has been handled and on the way in which it has been presented <e> <s> originally it was a joint bill presented by both the great parties when it came before us in at the very moment when the trumpeters were cleaning their trumpets to blow the glad tidings of a general election <e> <s> i believe that it was the very last act of the previous dying government and it was passed with the support of all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord suggest that this would be a convenient time to take the opportunity to look at the services that the old post office used to render in its finest past <e> <s> i used to rejoice in a service called the night telegraph letter which enabled me to wire my london agents at the end of a days business and to have the message delivered to them in the morning to enable them to carry on with the london agency work <e> <s> there were many other beneficial services which have now gone and which really could be looked at and the opportunity taken to revive them <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl say whether he has had representations on this matter from the organisation representing agricultural workers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i think i have said in the house that i have had a five-scan brain x-ray under the national health service <e> <s> the noble lord lord plant was kind enough to show me all his information and the letter that he had <e> <s> i think that the matter would be as well cleared up from the point of view of general information <e> <s> i had my scan at the maudsley hospital <e> <s> it took about minutes on the steps of the guillotine <e> <s> the doctors were delighted with the result and said that the clarity of the photographs was remarkable but that did not mean that they were photogenic <e> <s> but the results in these matters are important <e>", "<cs> then i must clearly very quickly come to a close in the interests of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank the noble lord for his generous and kind response and for the information he has given and to thank the other speakers for their information <e> <s> i apologise for my own temporary encumbrance and i ask leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we all wish to thank the noble lord who opened the debate and those who have followed him <e> <s> i propose for a few minutes just to state my own limited connection with the matter because i think things can get a little out of perspective <e> <s> on th november last the then acting chairman of the anglo-romanian association an organisation of high repute wrote to the prime minister calling attention to the problems of romanian refugees <e> <s> there was then no question whatever of hiding their own views and those who are determined or desperate enough will find in the end the means to escape even if they endanger their lives in the process or risk brutal treatment or imprisonment if caught <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why these facts which are of great materiality were never passed back to us <e> <s> this is september the noble lord is talking about <e> <s> the letters to which i referred passed in november and no such suggestion was then made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the source of the allegations made against mr papusoiu after he apparently returned for a time to romania emanate from a dictator government which in the same statement he accuses of using him brutally and cruelly <e> <s> the minister is aware for he has said so himself that the allegations made against mr papusoiu in the concluding stages of the debate when no one else could advise him were based on information that the home office had been assimilating for some considerable time none of which was at any material time communicated to those who were acting on his behalf <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene <e> <s> i have much sympathy with what the noble baroness lady gaitskell said <e> <s> it is years since i was in kenya and was made aware of this practice which applied in certain tribes and not in others so far as one could know and particularly in the kikuyu tribe where it was a common practice in those days to see the woman of the household often the grandmother walking in front carrying an enormous sack posho on her head and the young grandson smoking a cigarette and walking yards behind <e> <s> at that time lady summerskill wrote to me and asked if womens rights were looked after in the colonies i was visiting and i gave her a very strong indication of this practice which appeared to have no possible explanation at all except the enslavement of women by the deprivation of any form of sexual temptation <e> <s> i do not know what we can do by legislation except in this country but one could at least perhaps think of trying to do something by education in other areas <e> <s> it is an important subject it is one that everyone has taken seriously and i know <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am grateful for that answer and that i am very reassured by it because what this government might do in any given circumstances is unpredictable <e> <s> i took this information straight from <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i have a dozen extracts from <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> may i add this <e> <s> would the noble lord bear in mind that this is as he says a very serious matter and that it would be to repudiate many pledges if there was any question of allowing this stuff to come into this country and that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too delighted to do so <e> <s> would the noble lord bear in mind that the british citizen has had to put up with a great deal over the past four years <e> <s> this really is something that he could not stand and indeed is also clearly literally something that he could not swallow <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord who i should like to thank for that encouraging answer give any idea of how many british and associated prisoners are likely to be involved in this <e> <s> if he does not have the figures will he bring them the next time a question is asked on this which i apprehend will not be long <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether this is a general alteration of the order of things in that we have on the committee one of each of the two known types of liberal and one representative only of each of the two main parties or am i in error <e> <s> i very frequently am <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this matter could be considered by the committee of selection at an appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich opened this debate with a very striking and forthright speech with every word of which i am tempted to agree <e> <s> i am also tempted to look just a little further and ask where are we going <e> <s> the story as told by the press council is an appalling one <e> <s> perhaps we have not paid enough attention to the part played by the proprietors of the papers and to the part played by reporters who were receiving orders by telegrams every few minutes to obtain more information and to press for it and who indeed very often were working with the police either to get information from them or to give what information was available <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount bear in mind that most of us are operating under difficulties with the order paper because we have a full house and a small paper <e> <s> my noble friend has raised a matter for inquiry it is a matter on which he is entitled to ask for an investigation and it is a matter which has apparently been raised in another place too <e> <s> i should have thought that my noble friend put his questions with reticence and certainly without any aggression <e> <s> i did not understand why the minister himself suggested that there had not been a certain amount of trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble lord feel that he has the burden now to rise and make further comment when two or three noble lords here have been popping up from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every word that the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson of ewell said <e> <s> he knows a very great deal more about the matter than i do <e> <s> for that reason i wondered whether i should even take the opportunity to say this <e> <s> these questions in one way or another have continued to arise throughout my legal life <e> <s> the law society wrote to me the other day to congratulate me or felicitate with me on having completed years of service on the rolls <e> <s> my memory goes back to some very quaint legal procedures even to verdicts being handed down with a pair of tongs <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how the chief valuer makes a very provisional valuation and why he used this summary method for a substantial operation and further whether anyone else was told that it was very provisional before his advice began to become operative <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister say in replying to a previous question that he does not know anything about electricity and that therefore he cannot answer a perfectly reasonable question about the heating of a house <e> <s> does this mean that the whole of his staff knows nothing about electricity or other forms of heating <e> <s> if so would not another minister who is fully informed serve the house better if not the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord on the woolsack not aware that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is it not a fact and has he not observed that the increase in crime on a large scale

described as a filly <e> <s> as i was saying it has disappeared completely from the earth <e> <s> the enforcement of the theft act as passed in this house seems to have predicted the mess of pottage

lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that information and for what he added about the previous question <e> <s> he did get into some difficulty after about five other noble lords in different parts of the house tried to ask supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the isle of man i understand and i am subject to correction that it comes under the isle of man customs bill which has certainly throughout my membership of either house been renewed every year merely to bring reciprocal duties into force as between the isle of man and the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> however if we are called upon to consider the isle of man would it not be equally meritorious to consider the lancashire coast in that area which is a centre of industry and a centre of communications <e> <s> it may be that it was included in the list that was read out but i did not identify it or recognise it with ease <e> <s> however i certainly would have thought that that was a matter for very real consideration and indeed it may have to be taken into account when considering the isle of man customs bill and the reciprocal arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is just years since leicestershire county council faced with a surplus of dairy milk in the county introduced a daily allowance of one-third of a pint of milk a day for the children in its schools living under a tory government <e> <s> is he aware also that the council found to its surprise that by the following year the children showed a notable improvement in their health <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble and learned lord <e>",

of interrogation of suspected persons ruled by no laws ruled by no former practice where the accused person may not know until he goes into the witness box what is going to be put to him at large

from foreign nurses who have come into the health service to assist <e> <s> everything has been admirable throughout and my sister who is years of age has had her life substantially prolonged <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that these figures are really quite appalling and show a tragic breakdown in the public service for the payment and allocation of these pensions <e> <s> surely this is a case which demands a little more thought a little more care and a little more insistence that notice is taken of the information obtained from the noble lords office and of the extent to which it can be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord considered looking at the question of tannin poisoning which has had very serious effects in those areas of political life in which it is consumed to excess <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there really is no dispute about what the prime minister says that she said <e> <s> this is only one example although perhaps the most grave of all of an allegation being made against the credibility of the present prime minister who is under investigation in industrial affairs at this moment <e> <s> is the noble lord aware

course of the last few months which included specific undertakings with regard to pesticides containing the seveso disaster chemical or the foundation of the dreadful poison which was used by the united states in vietnam which was the subject of countless demonstrations <e> <s> i thought i had received a clear undertaking that legislation would be introduced quite shortly but the scope of the legislation appears to vary considerably <e> <s> may i ask the minister to have another look at what has already been said <e> <s> if he does so he will find that i put down a number of questions on this general subject <e> <s> on the last occasion i thought that a reassuring statement was made emanating from the european communitys group on pesticides which seemed to forecast even the possibility of international legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the captain of england david gower was put at risk and became susceptible to really serious poisoning which kept him out of play for two or three weeks by rubbing his hand along the pitch at lords <e>"]
