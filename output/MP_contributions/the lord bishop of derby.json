["<cs> my lords i should like to press the point which the noble lord lord avebury raised regarding the comparison with the united states of america <e> <s> the united states congress is given much more information about arms sales than british governments ever give to parliament <e> <s> would the minister not accept that there is a good case for greater openness in this country <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all support the intention behind this amendment but the arguments produced by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham did not lead to the conclusions at which he arrived <e> <s> those of us who serve on a variety of governing bodies know perfectly well that groups of elected governors can get together as easily as any other governors to decide in advance the line which they will take corporately <e> <s> this kind of accusation which is thrown from one group at another does not help the argument forward at all <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a danger that we should so concentrate on the details of this report at this stage and begin to criticise them and qualify them that we render the whole report nugatory <e> <s> that would be disastrous not only for ourselves but for the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer congratulations to the noble baroness lady trumpington on her fine maiden speech which comes out of so much close knowledge and experience <e> <s> we all have to discover by trial and error what the traditions the standing orders and the customs of this house are and i suppose it would have been only by staging the demonstration that she suggested as a possibility that she would have discovered those traditions <e> <s> but i hope that we shall again have her lighthearted touch as well as the knowledge that she has to give <e>", "<cs> my lords my starting point is the one paragraph in the gracious speech which made reference to world development policy <e> <s> the queen said <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the present government are likely to be succeeded at some unpredictable date in the future by another elected dictatorship given over to the abolition of this house does the minister not consider that the surest way to preserve dual chamber government and a reformed house here is to have election to the house of commons by some sort of proportional representation <e>", "<cs> my lords the gracious speech contained this reference to an essential part of foreign affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who are concerned with various voluntary agencies working in the cause of world development find great difficulty because the faster we seem to run to catch up with the situation the further behind we seem to get <e> <s> my own gratitude is great to the noble lord lord oram for having brought forward this motion and particularly for drawing attention to the deteriorating situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as i know are many members of the christian churches to the noble lord lord oram for raising this question <e> <s> i rise to lend my support to what he has said <e> <s> he has mentioned the two approaches to practical action which harness both government and voluntary initiatives the expanded support that is necessary for the british volunteer programme and expanded support for development education <e> <s> the two go closely together <e> <s> from the point of view of the volunteers themselves participation in development programmes overseas itself contributes the very best form of development education <e> <s> vso has stated that along with all the diversity of experience gained returning volunteers all agree on one thing you will learn far more than you are able to pass on <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord who has just spoken i should like to express my welcome to this bill in general principle and to thank the noble lord lord elton for his exposition of it <e> <s> it is clearly moved by compassion and seeks to meet the difficult circumstances which certainly the granting of a special licence by the archbishop of canterbury is inadequate to cover <e> <s> but i must express without wishing to be controversial some hesitations over detail in the hope that at a later stage some account may be taken of them and some possible difficulties and inconsistencies in administration removed <e>", "<cs> what we are all trying to do in this matter is to stand in other peoples shoes the shoes of brides and bridegrooms the shoes of prison governors and prison officers <e> <s> we are all seeking to do that and i am sure that this is true of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> of course the circumstances of a wedding outside prison are not normal but it is not the length of time away from the prison with which i am concerned it is the actual place of the wedding <e> <s> it has nothing to do with extended and uproarious wedding receptions it is the actual place of marriage which will be fixed in peoples minds <e> <s> certainly i realise the difficulties that governors and prison officers must have and i am sure that it is necessary to take full account of what the minister has said although it seems to me that the situation of not being allowed to permit any exception can land you in a difficult position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for this reply and this undertaking <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving us so much reassurance about the attitude of the government this is a great help and also for the way in which he dealt personally with our considerations at the different stages of this discussion <e> <s> it seems to me that issuing some directive to governors is likely to be a much more effective way of having our concerns dealt with than trying to express them in legislation <e> <s> that kind of approach enables the much more personal and human considerations to be weighed up whereas anything that is written into a bill tends to be very precise and restrictive <e> <s> in view of the undertaking that the noble lord has given i for my part am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for his interesting replies and speaking as one who since becoming a member of this house has always regarded himself as a disqualified person and who has been helped along the path of sanity and virtue by seeing the letter l against his name in the register of voters and by not receiving a polling card may i ask whether the noble lord the minister is aware that neither the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury nor any other lord spiritual has any desire or intention to take this matter any further and nor will any of us in future knowingly go against tradition and custom in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords some of your lordships have commitments which make it very difficult for you to play a regular part in the affairs of this house <e> <s> all bishops are in that position because of our duties elsewhere <e> <s> it is impossible for us unlike others of your lordships to have a weekly meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords several references have been made to the fact that there is a large attendance of bishops this evening <e> <s> there are six people in this house who were in days past principals of theological colleges <e> <s> five of them are on these benches and one is on the cross-benches in the person of the noble lord lord blanch <e> <s> all of us ceased to be principals of theological colleges long before the current debate began so we cannot produce out of our heads the kind of evidence that would answer some of the criticisms which have been made <e> <s> i would ask your lordships to remember that the principals of theological colleges are a bit like saint sebastian arrows are shot at them from all directions <e> <s> i ask you to treat them and those who work with them with the justice that is characteristic of this nation that you listen to both sides of the evidence and take little account of only one side which can so often be distorted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick has called attention to the need for her majestys government to develop policies to give new life and national pride not in this instance the opposite of humility and to encourage motives <e> <s> this is to ask not only for changes in action but also for a fundamental change of mind a change of attitude repentance a word that has been used already and not from these benches <e> <s> policies applied with authority inevitably affect peoples thinking <e> <s> they can give a right lead guiding people to repentance and it is the nation as a whole that needs some change of mind and attitude <e> <s> this motion has implications for us all <e> <s> unless there is a general will to achieve the noble lords objectives her majestys governments objectives if they are in the right direction will be undermined <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be willing to pass on the assurance that from independent episcopal experience the appointment of prison chaplains certainly from the church of england point of view is carried out with very great thoroughness and very great judgment after a good deal of inquiry from people who know the particular candidates concerned <e> <s> would he be willing to mention the fact if it gives some assurance that every prison chaplain has also to be licensed by the bishop of the diocese who is in duty bound to make careful inquiries before he gives the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us in this house are criticised from time to time for being remote from the ordinary world <e> <s> one value of the televising of our proceedings has been the unforced provision of the information that among us there is considerable practical experience and marked professionalism <e> <s> we bishops have many direct contacts with people of all ranks in the communities of our dioceses <e> <s> we learn much indirectly through the experience of our parochial clergymen <e> <s> like all of your lordships we have the right to vote in local government elections and we are well aware of the effects on us and our people of the policies of district councils <e> <s> we have a right to speak in this particular matter because of our knowledge as well as because of our membership of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords my remarks this afternoon do not arise out of any party political standpoint nor out of any narrow interest in church schools but because of visits to schools of various kinds and discussion with teachers in different situations <e>", "<cs> my lords some of you may have seen a recent television programme which showed and interpreted a gathering of the world wildlife fund at assisi <e> <s> it was presided over by his royal highness the duke of edinburgh and it was held at assisi because of the special relationship which st francis had to animals and his care for them <e> <s> what made this gathering so unusual and remarkable was that the world wildlife fund had succeeded in bringing to the gathering representatives of all the larger christian churches from all the continents together with leaders of the other main world religions <e>", "<cs> my lords as part of the process which the noble earl described can he tell the house whether the government have yet given <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for the factual nature of his replies are her majestys government aware of the local feeling for example in derby where there are to be job losses that these redundancies are due to this particular element of government policy <e> <s> can he do something to allay the suspicion there and elsewhere that the government have in mind a policy of reducing british rail engineering to such an extent that there will he more and more job losses in the future <e>"]
