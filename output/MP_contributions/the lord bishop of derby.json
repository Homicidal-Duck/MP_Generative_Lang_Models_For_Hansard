["<cs> my lords i should like to press the point which the noble lord lord avebury raised regarding the comparison with the united states of america <e> <s> the united states congress is given much more information about arms sales than british governments ever give to parliament <e> <s> would the minister not accept that there is a good case for greater openness in this country <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all support the intention behind this amendment but the arguments produced by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham did not lead to the conclusions at which he arrived <e> <s> those of us who serve on a variety of governing bodies know perfectly well that groups of elected governors can get together as easily as any other governors to decide in advance the line which they will take corporately <e> <s> this kind of accusation which is thrown from one group at another does not help the argument forward at all <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a danger that we should so concentrate on the details of this report at this stage and begin to criticise them and qualify them that we render the whole report nugatory <e> <s> that would be disastrous not only for ourselves but for the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer congratulations to the noble baroness lady trumpington on her fine maiden speech which comes out of so much close knowledge and experience <e> <s> we all have to discover by trial and error what the traditions the standing orders and the customs of this house are and i suppose it would have been only by staging the demonstration that she suggested as a possibility that she would have discovered those traditions <e> <s> but i hope that we shall again have her lighthearted touch as well as the knowledge that she has to give <e>"]
