["<cs> my lords having had some experience in the early days of independent local radio may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that but for the difficult but nevertheless achievable amount of canadian money which was put into one of the two london stations it would never have got on to the air <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the leader for his reply may i ask whether he is aware i am sure he is that after a decision of the house it took the former administration three months before referring it to the top salaries review body and since then months have elapsed and we still have no report <e> <s> will the noble lord please do his very best to expedite the report <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to delay proceedings at all and thanking the deputy leader of the house for reading the statement may i ask him whether i am clear in thinking that as a result of the unanimous decision of this house in referring reckonable service to the boyle committee for their <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the foreign secretary is able to tell us whether or not her majestys government have accepted the whole of the law and the regulations of the illegal rgime or has the governor been selective <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> if i have the figures correctly there has been an improvement over the last five years which is extremely gratifying <e> <s> may i ask him whether the government will do their utmost if not to improve these figures to see that they are maintained in the future <e> <s> because this is a particularly difficult branch of nursing for recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for initiating this debate by means of an unstarred question but frankly i would have preferred that we were debating it on a government motion and also a government motion in another place with perhaps a full house rather than in a thinly-attended house of lords so that on friday of this week on the morning when independence is acclaimed a message from this country would have gone out from both houses of parliament wishing bon voyage <e> <s> and good luck to the new state of zimbabwe as they move into the future <e> <s> i know it would be contrary to what is normally done on independence occasions but this is not an ordinary independence occasion <e> <s> it is the end of many years of illegality the end of many years during which successive british governments have tried unsuccessfully to reach a conclusion there and it would have been a great thing if a message of that sort had been received in salisbury on friday morning of this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to be very brief in fact i shall be but i had the privilege of being a member of the committee under the noble lord the lord chairman of committees <e> <s> in dealing with bills of this sort i would remind the house that we are thinking now in terms of one clause <e> <s> we can set up perhaps four bills a year most of them <e>", "<cs> my lords if it was a criticism of the chairman of committees and myself and my other colleagues that we are not experts then i accept the criticism <e> <s> we are not we are put there by the house to do a job and we do the best we can with it <e> <s> the question has been raised as to whether or not there were petitioners against the bill promoted <e> <s> in fact there were two as the noble lord lord drumalbyn said but they were withdrawn <e> <s> he has suggested they were withdrawn and again i hope i am not misquoting him but i think he implied at least if he did not say it that they were withdrawn by the national federation of building trades employers and the federation of civil engineers for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the minister for his reply may i ask him whether the government would consider using some of this money for the bbcs overseas radio service which is perhaps the only voice of britain in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords as is customary i have to declare a small interest i should perhaps say a minute financial interest in an independent local radio company <e> <s> in doing so i should like to apologise to the minister at this stage and also to the house because i shall not be able to stay much beyond seven oclock this evening <e>", "<cs> unquestionably within the next years there will be considerable changes in the transmission of programmes <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> however who better to monitor them and to report on them to both houses of parliament if necessary than the bbc and iba <e> <s> both of them have highly developed technical departments probably the best in the country in this field <e> <s> therefore in my view it is quite unnecessary to set up yet another body to report on what the bbc and iba are already doing <e> <s> the fact that they do it annually is often missed the fault is that both houses of parliament never debate them <e>", "<cs> if this amendment is carried obviously it is an instruction to the broadcasting authority to provide an impartial account day by day by professional reporters of the proceedings in both houses of parliament <e> <s> that is a complete departure from anything that has happened since broadcasting began in this country <e> <s> no government has ever sought by statute to interfere with programme content <e> <s> i do not think that this amendment has anything to do with the televising of parliament <e>", "<cs> i had not forgotten the point that my noble friend lord hill has raised but there is no reason why we should impose it on the iba because the bbc have it <e> <s> in fact i should be interested to know the listening figures for the daily report on parliament on the bbc <e>", "<cs> i should rather speak to clause than to the amendment but if i refer to the contents of clause it will perhaps be better understood <e> <s> clause of the bill is quite acceptable to me and i would hope acceptable to the independent broadcasting authority because in the new contract period it requires to undertake and to see that the programme contractors undertake adequate training schemes <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington who has told us of her interest is in fact aware as every other chairman or chairperson will be that the iba will be required to state quite clearly what its intentions are in the field of training with effect from the date that the new contract companies come on the air <e>", "<cs> if the objective of my noble friend is to continue with what the iba has been trying to do for many years namely to reach what is known as the alternation of programmes then the amendment would not achieve that objective <e> <s> the iba has always favoured alternation by which i mean this year perhaps the grand national for the bbc next year for the iba this year the derby for the bbc next year for the iba but certainly not both of them broadcasting the same event at the same time <e> <s> there are exceptions where it is required even by government to do it i have forgotten the instruction of a long time ago governing that <e>", "<cs> my lords a few weeks ago when this bill was first before this house i received through the post and i should think that perhaps a number of noble lords did also a brochure with a light blue soft cover containing probably or pages of extracts from various bbc and iba programmes <e> <s> they were extracts taken in the main out of context <e> <s> they were smutty they were sexy they were salacious <e> <s> in fact the whole publication was pornographic and it came through the post <e> <s> it came from the national television viewers and listeners association <e> <s> the object of course was to point out to us before our second reading debate and subsequently what they regarded as the lowering of standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his somewhat disappointing reply may i ask him two questions <e> <s> first would the government agree that the dual principles of one man one vote and one vote one value are essential to our parliamentary democracy <e> <s> secondly would there not be an advantage in setting up a royal commission to look at the question of unicameral government in view of the possibility that it may be an issue at the next general election and the electorate would then have in front of them the learned comments of a royal commission in addition to party political propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord elystan-morgan in his maiden speech <e> <s> the noble lord comes to us with two great attributes <e> <s> first he comes to us with knowledge of the department of the home office in another place where he was a distinguished minister <e> <s> secondly of course probably the greatest attribute of all is that he is a welshman which means that he will contribute to our debates from time to time with that fervour and knowledge with which welshmen are associated <e> <s> i personally can claim only partial welsh background and therefore i do not intend to compete <e> <s> the noble lords speech gave us a great deal to think about and i am sure that we shall think about it <e> <s> in the future when he contributes to our debates he will always be listened to carefully if not quite so peacefully as he was on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his statement may i ask him <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for making his statement may i ask him whether he is of the opinion that if an agreed composition of such a conference were made i know an agreement would be difficult mr gromyko would be prepared to attend such a conference <e>", "<cs> this is probably the most important amendment and the most important clause in the bill <e> <s> in not moving my amendment which until yesterday was no <e> <s> i followed the lead of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and i am glad that the right reverend prelate was able to move his amendment which was no <e> <s> <e> <s> my reason for withdrawing was twofold first that the right reverend prelate and his colleagues speak for a much wider audience than i do and secondly because his amendment was a better <e>", "<cs> i started off this amendment with the idea of simplifying it for the lay mind <e> <s> i have succeeded in making it more difficult for my own <e> <s> i have listened to the lucid explanation of the noble lord on the government front bench <e> <s> i am persuaded by what the noble lord lord drumalbyn has said that we ought to look again at the definition of settled and perhaps of ordinarily resident when we reach clause <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord has said that this is in a sense a watered-down part of <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i appreciate that the amendment is very widely drawn but i should have hoped that the noble and learned lord would be able to say that he would take it away and look at it again <e> <s> i wanted an assurance that the second generation which is the grandchildren of grandparents who may be living in this country at the moment who are born abroad would not be rendered stateless in some cases and would always have the right of abode in their homeland <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord is unable to give us that assurance i really must divide the committee <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment which i said at the time was wide the object was simply to find out precisely what the government meant by <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure and a great privilege to represent my few colleagues on this one bench and to associate ourselves with the good wishes that have been expressed by the leader of the house <e> <s> july th is a memorable day not only in the lives of his royal highness the prince of wales and lady diana spencer but in the lives of all or at least the majority of the people of this country <e> <s> it is a day which we shall look forward to as much as i think they do <e> <s> we express the hope that in the future they have very many years of happiness and joy and years that are spent in a world of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether a firm date has been fixed for the mexico conference and if so who will represent this country <e> <s> will the foreign secretary himself be there <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish on behalf of this back bench to say a few words in support of the message of tribute to the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> we as a new party were most grateful to him for his help with matters of procedure and protocol and not least for finding us some accommodation when we were formed a few months ago <e> <s> he was always most generous and kind to us and we greatly appreciated that <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers answer will bring a great deal of disappointment to britons living abroad as one knows from correspondence which most of us have received <e> <s> nevertheless under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments concession on employees of the eec it would be churlish of me to continue further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we should like to pay our tribute to the late president sadat <e> <s> this dastardly act of assassination has robbed the world of a man of peace whose tireless efforts in the middle east gave us our first real hope of peace in that area <e> <s> may we hope that his untimely and tragic death will inspire others to continue the work that he started <e> <s> we join in extending our condolences to his family in the great loss and the sorrow which they have sustained <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a considerable pleasure to me and a great privilege to follow the maiden speech of the noble lord lord kadoorie of kowloon who joined us so recently <e> <s> he comes to us with perhaps as great if not greater knowledge of the far east and especially of hong kong as any other person <e> <s> we have listened very carefully and i am impressed with his peroration because never at any time have i or my colleagues felt that there were something like millions of hong kongese anxious to get on to boats and to come to reside in this country <e> <s> that was never true <e> <s> they are happy where they are <e> <s> all they wanted was to be associated with this country to have british passports and to feel that in this country was behind them in the negotiations which whether we like it or not will have to take place <e> <s> his membership of this house brings among us one whom we ought to recognise as a great intellectual power in the affairs of the far east <e> <s> we have listened to his speech with great consideration and i am sure it will be a pleasure to us to listen to him on many occasions again <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great pleasure to speak following the maiden speech of the noble lord lord stodart of leaston who comes to us after years membership of another place for eight of which he and i sat opposite each other facing each other very nice for me perhaps not quite so nice for him years in which we began at first to recognise and finally to realise that here was a man with a great knowledge of farming in his own country of scotland <e> <s> the noble lord described himself as a simple scottish farmer <e> <s> may i be permitted to delete the word simple <e> <s> his chairmanship of the inquiry into local government in scotland referred to in the gracious speech confirms what most of us have known of him over the years namely that he is a man of very considerable ability he is more than a simple scottish farmer <e> <s> it has been a great pleasure to listen to his maiden speech today and i am sure that in the years to come we shall hear him on many occasions when no doubt my former friend of my former party the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord evans of claughton for choosing this subject this afternoon <e> <s> he has a considerable experience in local authority work <e> <s> mine is considerably less only a matter of a couple of years before the war <e> <s> that experience left me with one or two firm views <e> <s> one i think it is quite in order for me to mention it in a debate on local authority reform was the inequality of the system of paying rates or from the point of view of the local authority raising rates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that from this bench we shall always uphold the law whether we agree with the law or not <e> <s> but in this case is he absolutely sure that the delay was unavoidable that the local authority had not the ability or the staff to act more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord windlesham for tabling this question <e> <s> this is a fascinating subject which has been made easier for us to understand by the very thorough study that the home office has undertaken and has published for us to read <e> <s> even those of us who are not technically-minded are able to understand at least part of it <e> <s> but it leaves a number of questions unanswered and if the noble lord lord belstead can answer some of them tonight he might help both us and the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indeed indebted to the noble lord lord noel-baker for initiating this debate and if i may say so also to the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton for suggesting one or two psychological warfare effects that might he of value in bringing world peace <e> <s> the noble lord lord noel-baker has spent a great deal of his life on behalf of world disarmament and has contributed so much over so many years and i am sure he will continue in that field for a very long time <e> <s> in this particular debate he refers to the arms race for that is what is it <e> <s> no mean athlete himself in the days when we were all so much younger he would know that in this particular race there is no winner no one can win it <e> <s> and no one disputes the terrible cost of the race in money and perhaps even more important in the drain from industry of our best technological knowledge in this country and in others towards the arms race <e> <s> all the major countries of the world on both sides of the iron curtain are fearful of possible attack and yet prepare for defence <e> <s> the brain drain of which i speak is of the most advanced kind in electronics and engineering and it takes from industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the decision to go ahead now with dbs is unquestionably the right one and should bring additional employment to the space industry almost immediately <e> <s> but in addition may i ask him whether he feels that the method of doing it was given sufficient argument and debate in this house or in the other place before the decision was taken <e> <s> finally may i ask him whether the proposed supplemental licence fee will be applicable to only those people who receive dbs or is it to be to all licence holders <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for me a great pleasure and privilege to speak following the noble lord lord shaughnessy in his maiden speech <e> <s> it was a delight to hear a canadian voice dealing with a canadian bill <e> <s> the content of his speech was of considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government view this as an official argentinian government action or perhaps the over-zealous action of a few individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my view that if this incident in the falkland islands had happened perhaps miles away and not miles away it would never have happened at all <e> <s> it is a fact of geography that the argentine government has been able to behave in this way <e> <s> some weeks ago i received a personal letter addressed to me purporting to come from the argentine embassy in this country and many other noble lords must have received a similar letter <e> <s> it suggested that the small force of scrap metal merchants on south geogia were there for a purely commercial purpose and for no other <e> <s> we now know that to be completely misleading and completely dishonest because at the same time whether fully known to us or not action must have been going on to get together this not inconsiderable naval and military force that the argentine government has used against the falkland islands <e> <s> if i have any criticism at all it is that if the government did not know then what was happening to our intelligence service in that area <e> <s> on the other hand until we get the full story it may be impossible to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords we must and i am sure we do offer them the highest praise <e> <s> it is the intention of my colleagues and me on this rather small bench to add our full support to the government to condemn what has happened and to hope for a final diplomatic solution <e> <s> but should it go beyond that then we are behind the government <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my colleagues on this bench i should like to add a brief word <e> <s> when history is written i am sure that the name of lord carrington will go down as one of the outstanding foreign secretaries of this country <e> <s> we have the highest regard for him <e> <s> we are sorry that we are losing him as foreign secretary but i am sure the whole house will agree with me that he has proved to be what we always knew him to be a man of very high integrity and great honour <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that as the government have already stated probably the best hope at the moment lies in the activities of the american secretary of state mr haig <e> <s> i think it would be appropriate from this house and unquestionably from the other house if at this stage we say to him and to the american people that we are most grateful for the untiring efforts that they are making in what seems to be an insoluble situation <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that the alleged statement in the press i hope that it is alleged and untrue of the president of argentina that there will be no solution to this problem and that his troops will remain there alive or dead makes the activity and the work that mr haig is doing almost impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal in the bill is not unlike a proposal that was before the annan committee which sat a year or two ago <e> <s> its title was dissimilar <e> <s> it was called the public broadcasting commission and was completely rejected by the annan committee <e> <s> the noble lords proposal in this bill is laudable in the sense that he seeks to reduce the licence fee from its present per year to per year <e> <s> no one who pays a licence fee will object to that <e>", "<cs> my lords while endorsing what the noble lord opposite and the leader of the liberal party have said may we add our few words of best wishes to the foreign secretary in this difficult task <e> <s> we hope for a speedy and successful solution to the discussions but we are concerned immediately about the falkland islanders british subjects who are still on the islands <e> <s> we hope that however long term discussions may be about any future sovereignty of those islands the views of the islanders will be fully canvassed before any final decision is taken and of course that parliament will be informed <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating her majestys forces on their great success in reoccupying our territory of south georgia may i ask her majestys government if the time is not now ripe for all-party talks to take place on the whole question of the current falklands situation <e> <s> the time certainly is not ripe at the moment to decide the future of the falklands but that can be done when the islands return to british sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of press reports which are currently appearing on the tape will the noble lord ask his right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary to continue to reiterate the basic statement of facts especially to our european partners who the press suggests are moving their ground slightly <e> <s> the basic fact is that the argentinian government were the aggressors in occupying our territory with forces which were vastly superior to the number of occupants of british nationality on the islands and that they were overwhelmingly condemned by the united nations for so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that from these benches while firmly continuing our support for her majestys government we agree with the foreign secretarys statement when he says that a diplomatic solution is now so very urgent <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord also despite what was said by an earlier speaker on the previous statement that in our view world opinion is extremely important <e> <s> while every detail of any negotiations cannot perhaps be divulged it would nevertheless be of great value to world opinion and to ourselves if it was made clear what is or is not negotiable at the moment by both the argentine junta and by our own government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his reply may i ask him whether he is aware that i can provide sufficient evidence that this is in fact happening <e> <s> may i quote just one case in sutton and cheam where a housebound patient has been charged for the signing of such a form <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the noble baroness the leader of the house the house cannot be unaware of the extreme gravity of the situation in the south west atlantic a situation which could easily lead to greater conflagration in that area <e> <s> i only wish it were possible for every home in the country to have heard the speech of the noble baroness or perhaps the speech of her right honourable friend the prime minister who undoubtedly spoke in the same vein because i sometimes feel that the position is not fully going home into the hearts and minds of our own people <e> <s> the first thing that we must emphasise whether individually or collectively is that the cause of all this trouble at the moment is not a question of to whom the falkland islands belong now or will belong at some future date but the aggression of the argentine government in trying to solve the difficult problem in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that we too would wish to extend our deepest sympathy to the relatives of the servicemen and the merchant marines who have lost their lives or were injured in the loss of these two ships <e> <s> despite our sorrow at these losses we remember that the task force is there in a just cause opposing and engaging an illegal aggressor who has been told by the united nations to withdraw from the islands and in our view no negotiations should be considered which do not include withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleagues the sdp peers wish to join in the well-deserved congratulations now being given to our forces who have fought so well and so hard some miles away from their homeland <e> <s> we would wish also to add our congratulations to the prime minister and the government on the successful handling of this problem which was not of their choice caused by the invasion of the falkland islands some weeks ago <e> <s> we hope that in their jubilation the government and the country will remember those who gave their lives and those who were wounded <e> <s> i hope that the government will agree with the whole of the country that the loved ones and relatives of these men should be treated with great kindness understanding and great generosity <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking personally i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for the clarification he gave when introducing this bill <e> <s> over the past few weeks i have been trying with the bill before me and by reference to four of five other bills clearly to understand it <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord cockfield that having listened to him today some of the points at least are much clearer but we shall need clarification of more of them as we move through the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness lady young for repeating the statement may i ask her just one question <e> <s> despite the negative attitude taken up by the argentine government if there is one would she consider the possibility before the summer recess of a debate in this house on the future i repeat on the future of the falkland islands which could be helpful to the government in making up their minds during this period of rehabilitation of the islands <e> <s> we are absolutely sure that it would be helpful and would not wish it to be anything other than a take note debate without committing the government in any way <e>", "<cs> i find amendment no <e> <s> which is now before us rather mysterious in that the secretary of state is asked to ascertain the opinion of the former employer <e> <s> that is not difficult in the case of someone like the railway board <e> <s> however in the case of a company the officials who were responsible at the time of dismissing the employee may be completely different and the representatives of the trade union may be completely different they may have retired or been replaced by others <e> <s> it will be quite impossible because many of these cases will certainly go back to seven years ago <e> <s> in that case how could one if one wished to do so operate amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords in applauding the calmness of her majesty during this extremely distressing occasion may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that this is a statement which the whole country would have preferred never to have had to hear <e> <s> on the inquiry which is to take place one appreciates that a great deal of it will be <e>", "<cs> in his earlier remarks the noble earl mentioned he has done so subsequently that the figures are set at this scale because they are a deterrent <e> <s> one could argue that if they were set at double the figures they would represent a much greater deterrent <e> <s> the noble earl also mentioned the fact that there is no great interest in industry in the scale of the compensation awards <e> <s> may i remind him that the british institute of management the confederation of british industry the institute of directors and the institute of personnel management are all of the opinion that these compensation awards under the special award are much too high <e> <s> if he really feels that he cannot accept our amendment may i remind him that if he does accept it and we are proved to be wrong then under the terms of the bill the secretary of state could restore some other figure with the approval of both houses <e> <s> that would be an absolutely democratic way of doing it <e> <s> if he cannot accept the amendment i am afraid i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkins will pardon me if i do not follow him <e> <s> in fact my colleagues on this bench are here because he is on those benches <e> <s> we have looked very carefully at the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord spens and my old political opponent the noble lord lord boardman <e> <s> may i say first that we are not in any way opposed to pre-strike ballots <e> <s> in fact we favour them <e> <s> but we are not really happy with the way they <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for mentioning the new clause which stands in my name and that of my noble friends which in principle is exactly the same as his amendment <e> <s> i assure the committee that having made a brief comment on his amendment it will be my intention to withdraw our amendment no <e> <s> when in an hour or so we reach it <e> <s> as i say the principle of the two amendments is the same we are of the opinion that trade unions should elect their chief officers executive officers executive committees and anyone of that rank who has the right to vote by secret ballot <e> <s> in saying that we accept at once that there are many unions to whom this already applies in particular the national union of mineworkers which has already been mentioned who not only have a ballot but use a private company to see that the operation is correctly <e>", "<cs> one of the reasons if not the main reason for industrial troubles these days is the complete lack of communication between the shop floor and the board between the workers and the employers <e> <s> this is not entirely met by earlier ideas such as profit-sharing which nevertheless helps <e> <s> nor is it met by the old idea of the statutory worker on the board <e> <s> the statutory worker on the board where it has been tried and in not many cases has it been tried has not really worked at all <e> <s> i think in the terms of the amendment now before us we have the possibility of improving communications between the workers and the board in giving the workers as much information as possible about what is the boards policy <e> <s> i do not mean that the board of directors should discuss the intimate details of the financial problems and loans and so on but their main policy and the ends which they are pursuing could easily be communicated to the workers on the floor <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take one or two brief points <e> <s> we have already taken rather a long time on a rather long report stage <e> <s> i was delighted to hear from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the company of which he is chairman and one would expect it of a company of which he is chairman already engage in this type of participation <e> <s> what i cannot understand is his reluctance to put the fact in the annual report <e> <s> it does not require as has been suggested paragraph after paragraph about detail as to whether the tea break shall be taken in half an hour and so on <e> <s> what it does require is instruction in the annual report of major decisions that have been taken by the company in consultation with their employees <e> <s> nor does it require the employees always to agree <e> <s> the fact that they have been consulted is the important thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of making a speech <e> <s> however the noble earl earl ferrers said that we have discussed this subject for the second time during the progress of the bill <e> <s> in fact on the other occasion we discussed ballots for the executive and for officers not for the general public or strikes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he has been kind enough to say that her majestys government are sympathetic to the amendment would he go so far as to say that they accept it in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good debate on this amendment and i am grateful to everyone who has spoken <e> <s> this is not an occasion when one replies to every speaker and nor do i intend to do so there are many more amendments to come and i will be very brief <e> <s> when we discussed an earlier amendment in the name of the noble earl lord de la warr and a second amendment in my name both of which were withdrawn we were given an assurance by her majestys government that they were in favour of the election of officers and executive committees of trade unions in principle and while not promising legislation soon the government said that they were looking at it with that in mind <e> <s> that was the reply we had on that occasion <e> <s> on this occasion on pre-strike ballots her majestys government have now made it absolutely clear that they are sympathetic but that they do not accept quite the same view that they did on the earlier amendment <e> <s> that is satisfactory from my point of view because it indicates where the present government stand <e> <s> for that reason i do not believe there is a need to say anything more and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when in june of this year this bill first came to us from another place it had experienced an extremely rough passage there weeks of argument in committee and at report stage a great deal of noise accompanied by the usual shouting and finally the guillotine which of course meant that quite a large portion of the bill had never been discussed at all in that place <e> <s> but here we have given it a thorough examination in what we are now told were some hours of deliberation <e> <s> i would have thought it more thinking back but i accept that it was hours <e> <s> during that time the debate has been vigorous and it has been tough on occasions but it has been peaceful and there has not been the commotion experienced in another place <e> <s> having served in both houses i sometimes wonder whether they have <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of wakefield <e> <s> he comes to us with a great deal of knowledge of broadcasting acting at one time as chairman of crac which if i may interpret is the central religious advisory committee and earlier than that as religious adviser to the bbc <e> <s> he has shown by his maiden speech that his interests are not only in the religious section of broadcasting but in broadcasting generally and we shall be delighted to hear from him on very many more occasions on this and other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble baroness lady vickers for introducing the bill <e> <s> it gives those of us on this bench an opportunity to support her as we did when she introduced an amendment with the same objective in mind during the passage of what was then the bill last year <e> <s> during the passage of that bill which now is an act and comes into force on st january from all sides of the house and from almost every country associated with great britain the anomalies the unfairnesses that might arise once it became law were pointed out <e> <s> we felt then as we feel now and as most people felt that it was quite wrong that one replaced the automatic right of a child born in this country to be a british citizen by a system whereby the requirement was that the child should have one or both british parents <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the exchange we had immediately after questions on the subject of procedure i am not sure whether it is any longer correct for me to thank the noble lord lord carrington for introducing this debate <e> <s> i personally at least am very glad that he did introduce it and i am always pleased to hear what the noble lord has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply my lords <e> <s> while accepting the importance of these organisations may i ask if there is agreement and consultation between the heads of such organisations and her majestys government about how many foreign nationals are entitled to these privileges and immunities such as immunity from income tax capital gains tax car tax vat customs and excise duties and even in some cases from legal suit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say because it was not clear from its answer to my supplementary question whether the numbers involved are agreed between an individual organisation and her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no greater privilege than to follow the noble lord lord gormley in a debate on trade unionism <e> <s> i am quite sure that both in this house and in the other place no trade unionist who has ever had any responsibility within a trade union has greater knowledge and greater respect than he has <e> <s> however i do not always agree with him and i do not on this occasion <e> <s> but on the question of secret ballots i do <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to support my noble ally in this amendment <e> <s> i think it is recognised by everyone in the house that one of the main troubles in industry is lack of communication and anything that we can do to improve what is known as industrial democracy will help in solving problems within industrial relations <e> <s> i fail to understand why and perhaps i have not read the detail of the second reading debate as i should have done the government thought it necessary to repeal that section in the aircraft and shipbuilding act which required the corporation to engage in industrial democracy <e> <s> it was taken out completely <e> <s> i am sufficiently charitable to hope that at a later stage the government may still decide to insert something <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting that the government and public funds have suffered a loss of million could the noble lord say what the television companies have lost during the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for repeating this statement i should like to ask him three brief questions <e> <s> first who will be responsible for setting up the new cable authority <e> <s> will it be the home secretary or perhaps rather more correctly the secretary of state for industry <e> <s> my second question is on programme content <e> <s> the minister may recall that in our debate in november he agreed with me that there was some doubt as to whether the obscene publications act and the indecent displays act would apply to cable television <e> <s> i have not cleared my mind <e> <s> has he <e> <s> if he is still in doubt will this be included in a new proposed bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular pleasure to me on a subject in which i am particularly interested to hear the white paper introduced by the noble viscount who comes to us as leader of the house of lords <e> <s> he and i have known each other for a very long time serving in another place <e> <s> we are both members of probably the most powerful trade union in the world that of chief whips <e> <s> but perhaps it is not everyone who will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i concede that i may be wrong but i think it is much more likely that it will be companies covering perhaps half a million people which will apply for these early franchises or that some of the cable companies which are already broadcasting will apply for them because they too will need licences <e> <s> i hope that the government will advertise these franchises in absolute detail and that they will ask the applicants for these or franchises to publish their applications so that the public can read them before the government take a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement which the minister has repeated today is as the noble lord lord underhill mentioned a return to the position which we debated during the passage of the employment act in the last parliament <e> <s> during its passage we on these benches and the liberal benches covered almost every one of these items as an amendment to the bill <e> <s> in fairness to the government let me say that they made it absolutely clear when amendments were withdrawn or defeated that the principle underlying those amendments would be raised in subsequent legislation <e> <s> it was contained in the governments manifesto <e> <s> it was also contained in the manifesto of the alliance <e> <s> in fact therefore there is nothing new in these proposals as the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to almost every speech since we started at about quarter past three <e> <s> having listened to those speeches i have read and re-read the motion <e> <s> many noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble baroness lady trumpington for the detailed and lucid way in which she introduced this bill <e> <s> i have known for a long time of her great interest in television ever since we were discussing some time ago what was then the very beginning of breakfast television <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point but if a company feels it has been wrongly represented i am not sure whether or not the individuals within that company could take the complaint to the commission <e> <s> i rather think they can <e> <s> however my view is that clause is perhaps unnecessary while we have the broadcasting complaints commission <e>", "<cs> the act requires the iba to have a representative for scotland for ireland and for wales and each one of those three gentlemen is chairman of his national committee which is a considerable help <e> <s> but the cable authority as i see it is a very different sort of animal from the iba <e> <s> it does not engage in transmission it does not do any engineering <e> <s> in my view it would be very much better if it is felt necessary so spread the cable authority throughout the country to relate it to the areas where cable is being transmitted because at best cable will not be transmitted as the iba is required to do to per cent <e> <s> of the whole of the country to be achieved in cable in the beginning will be very lucky to serve half the country <e> <s> i certainly shall not oppose this amendment but i do wonder if it is really necessary <e>", "<cs> it only remains for me to thank the minister and assure him that i am extremely surprised at this stage that an amendment has been accepted <e> <s> i thank him and i am very glad that he is prepared to support it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon called in aid the act which was of course a consolidation act <e> <s> he will be well aware that there is no requirement in that act to include a member of the entertainment world on the independent broadcasting authority <e> <s> but from my experience over a number of <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can take the matter much further or we shall get the needle stuck on the record in the same place the whole time <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that i have already had one amendment accepted and in view of the generous offer that the noble baroness has made i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the problem before us is the actual wording of the bill <e> <s> the words proper proportions mean very little indeed <e> <s> i have been trying to think of something more acceptable such as maximum attainable but those words may have legal problems <e> <s> there is not very much between any of us in the committee <e> <s> what we are anxious about is that we should get as much british or ec material as possible into the programmes <e> <s> on that we all agree <e> <s> but i think that the committee needs reminding that the iba have never been instructed to put per cent <e> <s> british into their programmes or even or per cent <e> <s> it has been entirely left to them as the noble lord lord jenkins said after many years of discussion with the distinguished safeguards committee about the maximum that they could attain <e>", "<cs> yes and i believe it was reached at that point but it had been going on for a very long time probably even during the noble lords own period when the earlier discussions of the safeguards committee were working to that figure <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness explained a great deal but she did not really answer many of my questions <e> <s> the fact is that in addition to providing an income and eventually we hope some profit for the cable licensees there is another duty and that is to provide a service to the consumer and it is in the consumer that i am interested at the moment <e> <s> i made the point that the word following appears in the amendment <e> <s> as soon as the licence has been granted i am sure that the licence holders who after all are in business would be anxious to hear from the local people in an advisory committee type of way what is of importance in that area <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me see why the government think that what is worthwhile in independent radio is not worthwhile in cable <e> <s> for that reason i am afraid that i cannot withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i gathered from the noble lords remarks that at the end of the year when there is an excess of revenue the home secretary is hardly likely to take the whole of that excess or even part of it until <e>", "<cs> my lords in the proposed amendment of the noble lord the minister which we shall no doubt see later or perhaps in the other place has he got it in mind to retain the provision that the variation requires the consent of the licensee <e> <s> is the idea that the authority could not vary a licence at all without the consent of the licensee <e>", "<cs> my lords during the second reading of this bill from these benches i and my colleagues supported the idea of the maximum possible amount of eec material in cable programmes <e> <s> we were doubtful whether a percentage should be put in <e> <s> as i said in committee we feel that percentage might mean the maximum possible <e> <s> if one talks of percentages we should like per cent <e> <s> but that is not attainable <e> <s> i think that the words in the amendment maximum practicable take the matter as far as we feel it would be possible to go at an early stage <e> <s> we fully support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am satisfied that the cable authority may if they so wish consult the bbc and iba joint panel and be guided by its views <e> <s> as far as the other matters outside the charitable and benevolent areas are concerned they are beyond the purview of the bbc or the iba <e> <s> upon reflection i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather astounded to hear what has appeared in the advertisement <e> <s> it must have been approved or vetted by someone at some time but if in fact it has happened then the iba are at fault and they ought to be told so because they are responsible for vetting of an advertisement which appears on television <e> <s> i take it from the right reverend prelate that that is where it would appear <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one further point which is on approving advertisements <e> <s> this obviously is not very clear <e> <s> it has been suggested that itca view them all and that the iba are responsible overall <e> <s> in fact what happens is itca do a lot of the pre-vetting and that every morning of every week other than saturdays or sundays the advertising department of the iba see on closed circuit television the new programmes which are being transmitted and those in doubt the per cent <e> <s> i mentioned earlier are dealt with accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and the house may recall that prior to the setting up of the commission to consider complaints the bbc and the iba themselves considered any complaint of unfair or unjust treatment the infringement of an individuals rights or whatever it might be one of the main arguments for setting up the commission the noble lord may recall was that the bbc and the iba were both judge and defendant in their own cases <e> <s> therefore it was essential to set up a new body to do precisely that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the explanation given by the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon has said this is the third attempt <e> <s> the problem from the beginning was that we have not felt that the words proper proportions were adequate to cover what we really need <e> <s> what we really need is the per cent <e> <s> of eec material which for this purpose includes the eec britain australia and new zealand <e> <s> we appreciate that it is impossible to achieve per cent <e> <s> at the moment and we want to get there as soon as possible <e> <s> i think that these words are the strongest and the best that we have yet had and we on these benches have pleasure in supporting the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to add my congratulations to the honourable member of another place who introduced this bill <e> <s> i understand that he was fortunate in the ballot and gave up a very good position in the ballot to introduce what is a somewhat controversial bill and perhaps a difficult bill for a back-bench member to handle <e> <s> i congratulate him and wish him every success with the bill <e> <s> some congratulations are also due to the government for finding time for the measure although a slight tap on the wrist might be appropriate as the bill is brought to us just three parliamentary days after it was first seen in the vote office <e> <s> that is hardly sufficient time <e> <s> nevertheless there is the committee stage to come <e> <s> much as i want to see the bill go through i feel that there are one or two issues which if not necessarily requiring strengthening at least need clarification <e> <s> i have no doubt that this will be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord who is in charge of the bill one question <e> <s> in view of the fact that video nasties are we hope likely to be caught under this bill and will not be certified by the designated body is he really saying that he is satisfied that the bill as now drafted is sufficient to prevent video nasties being manufactured in this country for export abroad <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am quite sure that both the bbc and the iba will in a sense keep their end up when these discussions take place <e> <s> with those words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment i am very sure that i used the word nucleus and <e>", "<cs> i think enough has been said on this for the secretary of state whoever he or she may be at the time to realise what your lordships want in this bill <e> <s> with that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time in the evening with an important debate with speakers to follow i intend to be brief <e> <s> first may i say that i agreed with the point that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby made that it is unfortunate that at this stage in the middle of a major industrial dispute we should be discussing this bill <e> <s> but the government are not to blame <e> <s> it was part of their programme and it is perhaps a matter of chance that it has come on at this time <e> <s> there is perhaps never a right time because there is always something going on in industry which makes it difficult to discuss a bill of this sort <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble colleague on this amendment may i remind the committee what the noble lord lord mccarthy said on clause when he was opening this committee stage <e> <s> he said let the unions have a choice <e> <s> we on these benches are of the opinion that under certain circumstances where it is clear that the individual trade unionists of a trade union wish to retain their existing electoral system they should be allowed to do so for a period of five years provided it is done within <e>", "<cs> this very short debate has made it absolutely clear that there is a great deal more to be said and more to be thought about with regard to this matter <e> <s> i do not propose to do anything further tonight we will have an opportunity on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that the noble lord has given an undertaking that the government will look at and will consider what we have had to say i think that perhaps we can return to this matter at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords during the second reading of this bill which now seems to have been a very long time ago i was unwise enough to believe i now know wrongly that the system that had obtained for many years whereby the bbc and the independent television companies under the iba were responsible for their own programmes no longer completely i say completely exists <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i do not intend to reply to the question that has been put to me about why some of us left the labour party <e> <s> there is a case to be put there that can perhaps be discussed not here but outside on some other occasion <e> <s> all i want to say in closing the discussion on this amendment is that our real concern is not with the people who pay the political levy to whomever it may go <e> <s> we are concerned about the people who pay the political levy to parties to which they would prefer not to contribute <e> <s> under those circumstances i think the house should test the position by calling a division <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the government omitted to include contracting-in in the trade union act which was given royal assent last week would the noble viscount on behalf of the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord diamond who regrettably is unable to be here today i wish to extend to the noble lord lord shinwell our felicitations and happy wishes on his achieving the age of years <e> <s> i speak in a dual capacity on behalf of a party which had nine members in the house in which he served at one time who are now in this party and as his whip for years <e> <s> for nine of those years i was his chief whip <e> <s> if anyone thinks that it is easy to be chief whip to manny shinwell i respectfully suggest that he thinks again <e> <s> he was always very loyal he frequently disagreed but finally one could rely on his accepting the discipline that existed in the party <e>", "<cs> my lords after that rather sad statement perhaps we should return to the question of televising this house <e> <s> there are too few occasions in this house when we have the opportunity of thanking the lord chairman of committees for initiating a debate and for taking the chair at a select committee as he has on this occasion <e> <s> his work and that of his committee have produced a report with which we may not all agree in total but which nevertheless provides us with all the information we require for what is after all just an experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the only point i wanted to make on that aspect <e> <s> i do not want to go on speaking for much longer <e> <s> one could continue for a long time thinking about possible problems and snags but we are after all talking about only a six-month experiment <e> <s> i hope that your lordships house <e>", "<cs> if they would my lords then presumably the authorities are in order in registering an illegal radio station for vat <e> <s> i find that amazing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one point to raise on this bill <e> <s> it is a small point in relation to the <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and to join with the noble lord lord mishcon in congratulating the minister on his attaining a new post <e> <s> i shall not say that he will actually be delighted with it <e> <s> we were always grateful to the noble lord when in his former post for his great courtesy in replying often to difficult and awkward questions from this side <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> in view of the terms of reference of the peacock committee is it not a little unwise to commence yet another system of radio financed by advertising revenue before the committee report especially in view of the fact that yet another local radio station has failed this week <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to my noble friend lord rochester for initiating this debate <e> <s> i think we are fortunate in that we have had contributions from three very distinguished trade union leaders <e> <s> they have not agreed among themselves but this is not unusual <e> <s> there has been a criticism from one noble lord that we have spent a half of one of our very few and precious days discussing the trade union movement <e> <s> we felt that the subject was topical and we felt that the country was interested and one has to remember that there are millions of individual trade union members who are watching what is happening in what is known as the t and gw case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the quota arrangement that applies to the iba also applies to the bbc <e> <s> secondly can he give us the percentage of british television production which is sold abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord lauderdale in his opening remarks referred to those of us who are speaking at what is known as below the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of my colleagues on the alliance benches also add our very hearty congratulations to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on his marriage <e> <s> we who are on these benches have the privilege of being almost his near neighbours in this house which gives us the advantage of hearing asides and i can assure the whole house that those asides over the past few months have been very happy <e> <s> we congratulate him on his marriage and wish all possible luck to himself and his good lady <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now return to the debate on the televising of this house <e> <s> the decision of the house in july of last year which was probably the third or fourth debate on the televising of the house that we had had was on a motion in the name of the noble lord lord soames who was merely in favour of continuing the experiment which had been going on for six months until such time as the select committee had reported giving the house an opportunity to come to a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that they are getting full and complete cooperation from the countries in south america such as colombia bolivia and others <e> <s> is it their view that those countries are doing everything possible to stop this terrible trade <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will pardon me if on this occasion i do not debate the peacock report which we shall have the pleasure of debating before the christmas recess <e> <s> however there are one or two points that arise out of the peacock report that will have to be mentioned during this afternoons debate which has been the position with the noble baroness herself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and to the government for their obvious interest <e> <s> can the minister say whether there is likely to be a derogation of the directive which does require a tachograph on vehicles which are not years old <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord once again whether he has any idea of the date when this derogation of the directive will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord annan for introducing this important debate <e> <s> at the same time may i apologise to the noble lord and to the noble earl the minister who will reply that i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> my reason is not the same as that of the noble lord lord willis my reason is british rail <e>", "<cs> if this amendment is accepted by the government we should realise that we return to the <e>", "<cs> my lords when considering where bbc local radio stations should be sited do the government consider the effect on the bbcs finances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask her whether her departments scientific experience will be available to <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that when i first read the order i was at a loss to understand why it had been introduced <e> <s> however having heard the explanation from the noble lord i think i now understand <e> <s> unless the order is approved we shall find that we have direct broadcasting by satellite in the early years of the next century without a parent body an authority controlling dbs <e> <s> therefore the four years is essential <e> <s> if that is the reason it is an important one which i am sure the whole house will support <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl bear in mind the famous words of a previous postmaster-general who said that the government of the day can either sack them or back them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for his reply and acknowledging fully the work that the radio investigation service has already done is the minister aware that the pirates are rather like mushrooms <e> <s> they spring up overnight <e> <s> at the present moment in the greater london area there are over of them and there is probably an equal number in the rest of the country <e> <s> does the minister agree that a strengthening of his departments ris by an increase in numbers would speed up this work in preparation for the work that has to be done under the proposed green paper on broadcasting <e> <s> for example i am told that in the whole of the county of sussex there are only two of those offices functioning and they cover part of surrey as well <e> <s> of course chasing the pirates is not their only function <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that many of the larger stations in london not only advertise the frequency on which they are broadcasting but the address of the transmitter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing the debate <e> <s> i have read the report and i confess at once that i understood only a part of it <e> <s> i do not feel too distressed about that because it has been the admission of most noble lords in the medical profession who have spoken before me <e> <s> however we are grateful to the noble lord lord hunter because we can raise any subject connected with public health <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord bonham-carter for introducing the debate i am very conscious of the fact that probably within months we shall have one and perhaps two new broadcasting acts <e> <s> that will certainly happen in the next session of parliament <e> <s> i am concerned as to what is likely to be contained in those acts if the present government or any government take into consideration everything that has been said this afternoon by the noble lords lord renton and lord annan <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one brief question which i assume that the noble lord has forgotten to answer <e> <s> i refer to a question from the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> what happens to the proceeds from this sale <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the drastic changes in broadcasting perhaps rumoured perhaps actually going to happen the whole problem arises because the government are late in presenting their white paper <e> <s> if the industry knew what was going to happen to it and a responsible minister in the home office was able to deal with it i can assure the noble lord that the position would be very much easier <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no mention of broadcasting in the gracious speech but the publication of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of occasions upon which a government of either political party have found it necessary to issue a directive such as the one issued by this government on th october are so limited that i find it extremely difficult to remember even one such case <e> <s> in a very much lighter vein i remember a directive instructing us not to advertise cigarettes on television but that is in rather a different field <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first declare a small financial interest in a small independent radio company and at the same time ask the noble lord to excuse me if i have to leave before his winding-up speech <e> <s> unhappily the tragic accident in the south-east yesterday makes it very difficult to get to and from the coast easily <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> will her majestys government take into consideration the findings of the select committee on transport that found as regards the main runway at gatwick there is one take-off or landing every five minutes <e> <s> that may not be serious at all times but certainly it is at some times of the day especially in peak hours <e> <s> secondly the recommendation from that select committee was that no effort should be spared to proceed at once to introduce and provide an additional second runway perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister and the noble lord lord tordoff for their kind comments about my noble friend who is unable to be here today <e> <s> noble lords may already have realised that i have neither the knowledge of the noble baroness nor her tenacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply and note that the responsibility is placed on the local authorities <e> <s> that is probably correct <e> <s> is he aware that it does not need a chemical analysis of the sea water to determine how bad the situation is <e> <s> all that is necessary is to use ones eyes and sense of smell and it becomes very vivid indeed <e> <s> is he aware that in the case of sea water that is disturbed for example by weather or current it is usual to hoist a red flag warning the public not to bathe there <e> <s> i am not asking for the same action but is it not possible to introduce some method of warning the public that they and their children should not bathe in sewage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble
