["<cs> my lords those of us who have counted ourselves for a good many years as close and admiring friends of the present foreign secretary must have had our friendship and admiration powerfully reinforced during the last nine weeks <e> <s> a year ago in this house in the sanctions debate friendship did not prevent me from voting conscientiously against his advice <e> <s> nothing could deflect me tonight from voting on his advice and for this bill <e> <s> it seems to me that for a man whose brain works at a tempo and with a reasoned assurance possessed by few he has conducted these negotiations with a most remarkable patience more remarkable from him than it might have been from a more leisurely and hesitant personality <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government not derive some comfort from reflecting that a similar dumping operation in russia unthinkable though it might be with cards bearing the portraits of lenin stalin and beria would hardly find a ready market among the consumers of the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government noted that at the last session of the european parliament in strasbourg no fewer than three motions were tabled and carried unanimously condemning terrorism one of which specifically related to an israeli citizen <e> <s> do the government not think in contrast that the fact that yasser arafat the arch-terrorist himself was invited to appear at the rostrum of the united nations which he did with a pistol ostentatiously strapped to his thigh has had the effect of lowering the dignity and significance of that body <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply i should like to ask him two further questions <e> <s> his reply seemed to cover the category which i used in my question of for his own use <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that for their own use something like one-quarter of a million owners of video-tape machines are presumably breaking the law unconsciously every day and would he say how this kind of use squares with the concept of an englishmans home being his castle if they are thereby infringing the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house though not the whole country is aware of the factors which make a debate of this nature timely and significant and we therefore owe gratitude to the noble lord lord plowden and the committee which produced this report <e> <s> the european commission are charged with producing a new design for the financing of the community a restructuring of the budget to produce it soon after st june the month in which the united kingdom takes over the presidency of the council of ministers <e> <s> i hope that restructuring here means as much as it promises by implication and i hope that the date of the report will not slip much further than st june <e> <s> it is the first recognition that a deep injurious problem exists and that a solution must be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in all conscience i feel i should preface my single question by saying to my noble friend how very greatly i feel fortified by every aspect of his statement that i have understood <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be too much to ask him to spell out a little further what he said about the expansion of the role of the logistic forces in scotland and northern england in the second of which areas i am closely and fairly actively involved in the territorial army context <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will recognise i am singularly privileged to follow the noble lord lord strathalmond after his highly informed maiden speech <e> <s> so modest is the noble lords self-description in works of reference that i have been hard put to it even to discover that he is a chartered accountant under the scottish rules which the scots will tell me are far stricter than those of their sassenach colleagues <e> <s> i had also discovered before he told us so that neither his father nor his grandfather had been able to speak in this house <e> <s> therefore he is the first in three generations who has addressed us <e> <s> up to that point i had attempted to interpret his title which i had picturesquely taken to signify the valley of the almond trees but i found it difficult to imagine such a scene in scotland where the straths are <e> <s> i was also mindful of the arabic expression which i picked up while serving in the middle east bukra fil mish mish <e> <s> this means tomorrow when the almond blossoms which is the same as saying in spanish maana maana or tomorrow never comes <e> <s> we must be grateful that today the almond tree has blossomed among us we all hope that it will blossom continuously and that we shall receive many more informed contributions on a variety of subjects from the noble lord who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great personal satisfaction to me to be able to follow the noble lord lord weidenfeld in this debate a noble lord with whom i have shared so many views in the past across the international field and across the floor of this house including practically the whole of what he said today <e> <s> it seems to me particularly appropriate right and necessary that he should spell out and emphasise the janissary characteristic of general jaruzelski and of the action which he carried out within his own country on foreign orders <e> <s> the pretence has happily been dropped though no sooner than it should have <e>", "<cs> my lords having asked a very similar question to this of an earlier government before the earlier european elections i have fewer questions to ask than my noble friend who has put down the question today <e> <s> there seems to me to be less reason for delay now than there was then <e> <s> does not my noble friend the minister agree that those who by circumstance are residents and who tend to know more about the subjects in hand than do the residents of this country should not be excluded as they are at present being excluded from the possession of the vote in our elections <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the leaflet signifies a new departure or a new interpretation or merely a new emphasis on the law do not the government agree that its results as raised by my noble friend lady airey and reiterated by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that gibraltar airport referred to specifically in the question lies across the isthmus and is built out from the isthmus known politically as the neutral zone which has never historically belonged and still does not to britain <e> <s> is there not some question as to our right to operate an airport with flights in and out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in this debate partly because i wish to be among those to congratulate the noble lord lord northbourne on his maiden speech and to agree with the confident prediction made by the noble lord lord sainsbury that we can look forward to many valuable contributions from him in future debates <e> <s> unlike some others i have had the advantage of knowing him for a number of years giving me some awareness of the enterprise and energy with which he produces and markets grain and vegetable crops seeking fresh territories to develop and make fruitful <e> <s> he is therefore speaking to us with real knowledge as most speakers in this house do <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government consider that in the light of the recently and frequently described efforts of her majestys government to reach accord with the argentine over the falkland islands including the possibility of condominium leaseback or eventual cession of sovereignty it is even more difficult than it was before for any spanish government further to restore the facilities which once existed on the gibraltar frontier without parallel possibilities being included for discussion in the intergovernmental talks promised by her majestys government and soon i hope to take place between our government and the spanish goverment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that these remarks should go unanswered particularly from these benches when they are delivered by a noble lord who might count as my friend <e> <s> he cannot in fact say that he sincerely believes that the policy of this government is to create unemployment <e> <s> unemployment may be one of the results of their policies but to say that it is the deliberate policy of this government the noble lord lord bruce of donington knows to be untrue and he should be reminded of the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords what has drawn me into this debate is the impression that there is more in this than flashed before the eyes and passed the ears of another place within the last few weeks <e> <s> we have been told with satisfaction how quickly it went through <e> <s> the members of both houses are busy men and women and governments of all complexions like to bring through with expedition legislation to be enacted <e> <s> this admirable energy can lead to occasional injustice and i believe it has led to some measure of injustice in this case and up to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only responding i hope as gently as my noble friend has gently intervened <e> <s> i was saying that it is pertinent to this bill and to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sorry occasion <e> <s> although the minister may mitigate our sorrow in some small degree that is i calculate the best he can hope to do <e> <s> i am in a personal difficulty because i have known the minister most closely concerned my honourable friend mr david waddington even longer than i have known my noble friend lord elton and that acquaintance has led me to like admire and feel affection for them both <e> <s> that cannot prevent me from stating as a parliamentarian that on the morning of monday th march something pretty foul was done at the hands of their <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate in which for perfect correctness many of the speakers are required to declare some kind of interest and i do so as a farmer in yorkshire and lincolnshire <e> <s> but individual declarations of interest do not here refer as in so many cases to a single business enterprise but to a whole industry <e> <s> some farms according to soil and environment are affected to varying degrees but few i dare to affirm can be otherwise than adversely affected by the proposals in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing in the world i want to do is to misinterpret my noble friend but the context of his quotation was a conversation with this farmer <e> <s> i have to tell him that when i repeated this when i read it to the farmers with whom i have spoken they were amazed naturally offended and not all that credulous <e>", "<cs> my lords no my understanding on the advice of far more learned farmers than myself is that to combine the straw with the soil considerable proportions of nitrogen have to be added which will eventually add nitrogen to the water supply <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down again when the noble lord whose <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness has done me the honour of mentioning my intervention <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled by certain aspects of the debate so far <e> <s> for the first time in my life and probably for the last i find myself in profound disagreement with my noble friend the minister <e> <s> it is almost a miracle in our relationship <e> <s> i also disagree with other speakers who say there is not sufficient difference between straw and stubble <e> <s> there is an immense difference and my noble friend lord onslow certainly did not convince me that a difference cannot be found <e> <s> in fact my noble friends lord caithness and lord northbourne themselves spelt out the difference that exists <e> <s> as the noble lord lord alport himself will be well aware the burning of stubble is not a modern system technically wicked or corrupt <e> <s> it has been applied during long ages of history and reference to it is to be found in the bible itself <e> <s> the noble lord may perhaps have in his own mind those inspiriting words <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be extremely appropriate that tonights debate will be answered by my noble and profound friend lord gowrie for it allows us to examine the problems of the national heritage across his joint responsibility for the arts and the treasury added to which he has responsibility for employment <e> <s> i wonder what other minister would have been given the burden of both major debates in the course of one day <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate which i had assumed was bound to be conducted in a mood of deep sorrow and dire disappointment <e> <s> the noble lord lord paget in whose name it stands and upon whose thoughtful initiative it was set down and opened has explained why in trenchant terms not mincing his phraseology or fears for the future <e> <s> in contrast one or two noble lords have found <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not given nor have i intended to give any example where the judiciary has misbehaved <e> <s> i can give examples where the judiciary has been by-passed <e> <s> that is my complaint <e> <s> to cite a few distinguished cases bishop muzorewa mentioned in the noble lords motion and mr vote moyo have been detained for over eight months without trial <e> <s> general lookout masuku and mr dumiso dabangwa and others were re-detained after acquittal by the high court and are still detained more than a year later <e>", "<cs> my lords he was gaoled for thoroughly unsatisfactory and improper reasons by mr ian smith and that i would not attempt to contradict <e> <s> he was as i was just about to say imprisoned for years by mr ian smith and yet he has emerged without rancour towards any man or towards any race <e> <s> notwithstanding he is a man of powerful character whom i am happy to regard as a friend as i hope he may regard me <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply may i ask him to carry a little further forward his response to my noble friends original question <e> <s> can he give an assurance that the view of her majestys government in the knowledge of the appalling results of the yalta agreement is that no british government could conceive of setting the seal of the british people to such an agreement in the future
