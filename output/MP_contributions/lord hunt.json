["<cs> my lords although it may seem to be a matter of detail in his reply to the noble lord lord wells-pestell the minister made no mention of the noble lords reference to the use or the mis-use of the union flag by a party which is totally unrepresentative of any constituent part of the union <e> <s> in view of the very strong feelings which are held about this abuse not only in this house but outside it could the minister give the house an assurance that this particular point will be looked at very carefully in the review of the public order act <e> <s> i believe that there is a good precedent for this in the city of glasgow <e> <s> at certain football matches when matches of a national or international character are taking place the union flag and the irish flag are not allowed to be used <e> <s> that is the city from which the present commissioner of police came <e> <s> he was the deputy chief constable of glasgow <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that i too welcome the statement of the minister that the government intend to publish the findings of the internal review which has been going on for a long time <e> <s> i think for rather more than months <e> <s> therefore i share the concern of the noble lord lord avebury to see its appearance <e> <s> would not the noble lord agree however that in general the workings of the parole system which i suggest has amply justified its existence in the last years would be greatly improved in the public eye by a policy of more openness <e> <s> finally can the minister give an assurance even at this early stage that the system despite its shortcomings will not be made more burdensome costly and time-consuming by substituting a policy of a prisoners right for the present principle of the home secretarys discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted to note the intention of my noble friend if i may so refer to her to ask the government about the developments since that most important inter-departmental circular of th december last year <e> <s> in a debate in your lordships house on st january this year on home office penal administration i suggested that some effective authoritative link was needed at central government level in order to <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to some very remarkable speeches this afternoon including the latest one by the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> i have listened with a very proper respect to a number of your lordships who know a great deal more about this subject than i do because you have been professionally or politically directly involved with secondary and other ranges of education <e> <s> therefore it behoves me certainly at this stage of the debate when all or nearly all that could be said has been said to be extremely brief <e> <s> indeed i shall be brief but i have seen from a different perspective than has been put forward this afternoon quite enough of the ill effects of early segregation in the very sensitive period of a young persons life that is covered by secondary schooling to be quite certain where i stand in regard to this bill <e> <s> i am strongly opposed to it and it seems to me that i must say so <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow closely the noble viscount lord simon in his case for supporting this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness in explaining why she would not be able to accept it made the point that was made by the noble lord that the parents the teachers and the members of the local community were not consulted about the plans put forward if you like under duress as required by the then-secretary of state for education <e> <s> that may be so it may not be so <e> <s> it may be right or it may be wrong <e> <s> i am clear however that two wrongs do not make a right and in this case it is most important in fact quite fundamental that there <e>", "<cs> i am intervening very briefly on a point that some of your lordships may feel is an irrelevant point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david speaking just now said hopefully that she was sure that everyone had read the debate that took place last tuesday th july on second reading of this bill <e> <s> i am quite certain that very few if any of your lordships have read that debate <e> <s> some of you were here to listen to the debate and may remember much that was said <e> <s> i listened to it all because i was speaking <e> <s> but the non-appearance of <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who was not a signatory to this amendment and in fact saw it only when he came in this afternoon i have only one point to make and that is very much in line with what the noble viscount lord simon had to say in drawing a clear distinction between the two parts of the amendment <e> <s> i feel quite reassured by what the noble baroness lady young has said about the forthcoming education bill which will take care of the second part of the amendment <e> <s> with regard to the first part i am inclined to support the mover of the amendment for the reason put forward by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley namely the time factor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trefgarne who is to reply has heard an almost unanimous chorus of dissent and disapproval and regret at the governments intention to dissolve the ministry of overseas development and absorb it into the foreign office <e> <s> i am sorry to have to add another voice to the regret but i feel that i must stand up and do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to do rather more than indulge in the very pleasant convention in your lordships house of thanking the right reverend prelate for putting down this motion <e> <s> without further ado i enthusiastically declare myself to be his ally in supporting the principle of the proposal we may disagree about the details which he has put before your lordships house <e> <s> indeed i should like to reverse our positions and the right reverend prelate has encouraged me to do so by saying how delighted i am to find that he is my ally <e> <s> that will sound pretentious so i ask his pardon for that <e> <s> but it is a fact that i have said much the same thing on many occasions both inside and outside your lordships house <e> <s> the right reverend prelate referred to the debate on the address in november and as recently as last july in a debate on juvenile delinquency i made the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i would entirely agree with my noble friend lady gaitskell that this is precisely so but i also believe the harsh probability of life is that that lack of work is something that will be with us if not for ever for a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second time in a matter of weeks that i have had the pleasure of following closely the noble lord lord soper delivering an ecclesiastical commercial <e> <s> the last time i recollect having appeared to disagree with him in your lordships chamber but i hope i made my peace with him outside the chamber and i take this public opportunity of assuring him and your lordships that i do not really dissent from the proposition he has put to the government this evening <e>", "<cs> i shall be coming to that in a moment my lords <e> <s> i intend no disrespect whatever to the very able deputy secretaries who have held this post for a number of years in the past but i say that the lack of identity within the service and in the mind of the public at large of the head of the service and the limited term it has been held have i think been one of its main structural weaknesses <e> <s> i was glad to note the prospect which is held out to prison governors to aspire to this summit this peak of their profession and i hope that future service chiefs will as may has recommended serve for a full seven years <e> <s> taking the noble earls point surely the essential point is that the best person should be selected for the job regardless of where he comes from and that he should serve for an adequate time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord clifford of chudleigh has done us a useful service by putting down this motion <e> <s> i hope it will also prove to have been timely because we know that the home secretary is to make a statement on government intentions after easter and we must all hope that our discussions this afternoon will not be too late to be taken into account despite the fact that no doubt that statement is in an advanced state of readiness <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there is a very basic difference between recidivist offenders referred to by the noble lord lord brockway and violent offenders in general which is the subject of this question <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak without the authority and knowledge of the noble lord <e> <s> lord heycock and without having heard all the argument but i also tend to agree with the amendent <e> <s> my reason is a different one <e> <s> i think it is very important that the bill should not mislead parents into expecting things which in the very great majority of cases will not be realisable <e> <s> the clause as phrased gives the impression that parents are going to be at liberty to make proposals about <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly indeed in the same sense as the last two speakers simply to voice once again my grave concern about the effect on parents who will be disappointed in the choice of schools to which their children may go <e> <s> all over the country there will be innumerable appeals and disappointments and undoubtedly this will place a very heavy load on the appeal machinery <e> <s> together with lord alexander who has greater experience i would see this creating a very serious practical problem and indeed a serious social problem <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness a question following immediately upon the point made by my noble friend lord james of rusholme <e> <s> it is only for clarificationi am not on the offensive at this stage <e> <s> where does the noble baroness see the initiative lying in this matter of selection <e> <s> going back to an earlier point is it likely to be the parents who will have an idea which may be a grandiose and unrealistic idea that they should like to see their child go to an independent school selected from a very few schools at any rate in the first instance and therefore probably in some distant part of the countryor is the initiative to lie with the school to do the selection and then discuss the matter with the parent <e>", "<cs> may i come in briefly <e> <s> i find myself in disagreement with the noble lord lord stewart and diametric <e>", "<cs> we have heard some memorable speeches this afternoon from people with much greater authority and experience in education than myself <e> <s> we have heard mention of various points of principle and we have heard points of down to earth facts or probabilities <e> <s> on the points of principle we have heard of the discretion which noble lords have insisted must be left with the local education authorities and i would not dissent from that as a general principle <e> <s> we have also heard during this debate today and last monday and tuesday about the question of equity and equity is at the level of the children <e> <s> if there has to be a choice and i believe in this case there has to be between discretion and freedom of choice of local education authorities to interpret this clause in the way they will some one way and some another and equity making certain that no children suffer as a result of the inability or unwillingness of their parents to pay or their decision to send them on their feet to school give me equity every time <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl lord longford for drawing attention to this important matter and if it does not sound as if i am patronizing him to compliment him upon his courage and persistence in continuing to draw attention to matters arising from our penal policy and in particular the effects of that policy on the state of our penal institutions <e> <s> i am stating the obvious when i suggest that this is not a popular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are other areas in our inner cities including certain london boroughs where the situation which arose in st pauls district of bristol last night has been for some time more predictable than what happened in bristol and potentially more dangerous <e> <s> does this not add powerful weight to the case for instituting a wider inquiry following the police inquiry into the events in bristol <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness kindly made a reference to myself in hopeful support of her amendment and i am very happy to give that support to the extent of confirming that the questions which come to probation officers on the subject of social security rights and so on do subtract considerably from the mainline work of probation officers <e> <s> it takes a considerable amount of their time <e> <s> i do not know enough about the proposed amendment to go along with the noble baroness entirely in support <e> <s> i confess that it had occurred to me to suggest that this could be done in the local citizens advice bureau which was what the noble lord lord wells-pestell suggested <e> <s> i warmly confirm that it would be highly desirable to divest and save the time of probation officers by some move to get <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i am sure he is but i must put this in the form of a question that in the meantime many thousands of prisoners who would properly be placed in these secure units are serving to no good purpose from the public point of view and to great inconvenience and discomfort from the point of view of staff and inmates in her majestys prisons in penal establishments which have no facilities at all for dealing with those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has introduced his motion so fully and so forcefully and the noble lord lord wigoder who followed him has joined lord hutchinson in making some valuable suggestions that there seems to me very little that i can add to contribute to this <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the objective of the government in creating a situation in which there will be employment i should like to ask the noble lord whether the government are aware of the seriousness and and i use the words advisedly the potentially explosive nature of the situation as regards unemployment among young school-leavers and particularly among young black school-leavers <e> <s> if the noble lord is not fully aware may i ask whether he will cross the river and pay a visit to the borough of lambeth and talk to some of the young black school-leavers in that borough <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> at the beginning of his speech he said that the amendment standing his name and in the name of the noble lord lord spens and others had the support of many cross-benchers <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord to justify the adjective many just in case it gives the impression that there is on the cross-benches here a solid phalanx of support for this amendment <e> <s> i should be surprised if many crossbenchers had not come to this house this afternoon intent on listening to the arguments and on making their own independent and individual judgments on the balance of advantage of those arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister assure the house that the proposals they have made in regard to the sports council for northern ireland have taken fully into account the importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord lord janner in the plea which he makes in support of the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> it would be most unfortunate if as a consequence of this bill more old people were constrained to be moved from their individual dwelling-houses with all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord lord hooson in thanking the noble earl lord longford for putting down this unstarred question and almost in the same breath and i hope he will understand me to reveal the fact that i rise with very little enthusiasm to contribute to this debate on the unstarred question <e> <s> i probably share this lack of enthusiasm with the noble lord lord belstead but <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the arguments of the noble lord lord hooson without if i may say with great respect to the noble lord having a particular brief for the amendment as it is drafted <e> <s> the only point that i rise to make is that i think that the analogy of the press council is most relevant here <e> <s> the press council having taken account of the recommendations of the royal commission on the press which reported two years ago has built into it conciliation cooling-off machinery which makes the formal proceedings of the press council a procedure of last resort <e> <s> i totally agree with what has been said about the danger of the bcc being the immediate recipient directly of every complaint that comes in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i certainly hope he is of the exceptionally serious situation in regard to the unemployment of young people in the north-east <e> <s> is he also aware i do not suppose he is that i was there only a couple of weeks ago to discover that anything up to per cent <e> <s> of school-leavers are remaining unemployed for up to months <e> <s> does this not add particular emphasis to the hope expressed by the noble baroness lady elliot that if at all possible more should be done under the youth employment programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor suggested that this should be a short second reading debate <e> <s> i should like to assure him and your lordships that my contribution will be very short <e> <s> in fact i have little to add to what has already been said in the other place in your lordships house this afternoon and indeed outside parliament through one means or another but i am intent on saying in my own words things that may well have been said before <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the royal commission on the press which reported in regarded the unfettered discretion of editors save only in regard to conforming with the general policy of their publication to be of absolutely fundamental importance to the freedom of the press <e> <s> does he also recall that among our recommendations in regard to the closed shop in the aftermath of the debate on the legislation under the previous govern <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess myself yet another of the defaulters among the speakers today in not being able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i will not seek to earn myself a halo by giving the reason why a previous engagement takes me elsewhere but i gave my reason to the government chief whip and offered him the opportunity of striking my name off the list of speakers should he not think that reason adequate <e> <s> i find my name still on the list and i am grateful to him <e> <s> at this stage in a debate of this nature it is almost impossible to enter entirely new ground or ground that has not already been touched on to a considerable extent by others and i am afraid i shall be touching on such ground though i hope more briefly and in other words <e>", "<cs> my lords we have this afternoon listened to two very notable maiden speeches <e> <s> it was the privilege of my noble friend lord walston to speak in praise of the first maiden speech that of the noble earl lord halifax and it is my privilege and my great pleasure immediately to follow the noble earl lord peel <e> <s> the noble earl brings to your lordships house the benefit of professional training at an agricultural college <e> <s> he also brings the knowledge and experience of his own professional activity on the land <e> <s> he bears a historic name <e> <s> he chose to speak on a subject of which obviously he has very great knowledge and he has spoken with tact in an area which in my small experience is not void of discord <e> <s> he has spoken with balance <e> <s> but he has also displayed great courage in speaking with deep conviction about interests which he himself enjoys and which he proposes to defend <e> <s> we have listened to two notable speeches and i am sure that your lordships join me in hoping that we hear the noble earl lord peel speak on this and other subjects many times in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister was referring to mr selby the former governor at brixton prison he looked in my direction as though inviting my comments as i was one of those who during the debate on remand prisons and prisoners spoke very highly about mr selby <e> <s> i take this opportunity most gladly to repeat that my opinion of that officer is a very high one and i am glad to hear that he has a future <e> <s> as i am on my feet and without wishing to probe the minister any further on the details of the circumstances in which these escapes took place it may help the house to assess the extent and magnitude if that is the right word of the errors and omissions if we had some idea of over what period of time things had been going wrong and when things started to go wrong at brixton prison in regard to security <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment if only because this is very much in line with what one might call progressive penal policy or thinking to make appropriate reparations in the context of what has been done or misdone <e> <s> i think it would be very right that this amendment should find its place in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord foot said that there was an expression of view from all sides of this committee in terms that the noble lord lord craigton has eloquently expressed <e> <s> i should be failing in my duty if i did not get up to express my view from these cross-benches a view which is totally in favour of everything that has been said in criticism of this clause in the bill and the governments attitude generally towards the sssis <e> <s> it is a crucial matter <e> <s> when lord craigton said that this was a view shared by all the conservationist bodies i can speak with knowledge of all those conservationist bodies in membership with the council for national parks <e>", "<cs> having heard the minister i shall not persist at length in giving my own personal views about the afforestation that has been going on over the years in national parks beyond saying that nothing has distressed myself as an amenity user of certain national parks and many other people than the darkening and the obliteration of the openness of the landscape in the national parks which was the main characteristic intended to be preserved in the act than the serried dark phalanxes of forestry totally changing the whole character of the landscape <e> <s> i am not at all satisfied that consultation agreements will safeguard and prevent further extinction of the openness of the landscape in the future and i am comforted to hear that the minister is prepared to consider the noble viscounts amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i rise to support and recommend to this committee the amendment in the names of the noble viscount lord ridley myself and others and in doing so to make a brief comment on the amendment to the amendment put down by the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> when the noble viscount lord ridley was moving his amendment he made a passing reference to long haired conservationists and he looked in my direction <e> <s> i hope very much that members of this committee will not identify me as a long-haired conservationist <e> <s> i am in fact more properly described as a short-haired recreationist an endangered species a less exotic species which is badly in need of protection under schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> i confess to feeling a little unhappy about the addition suggested by the noble lord of reasonable because it is such an imprecise and an undefined adjective <e> <s> more importantly i rise to express surprise at the suggestion by the noble lord lord gisborough that in making a requirement a local authority would do so on political grounds <e> <s> i should have said that the whole purpose and burden of this area of the bill is that the local authority might well make a requirement but the requirement would be based on the desirable need to restore the landscape <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly and i thank the minister for being patient while i add one more voice to the support given to the amendment <e> <s> i have only just looked at it but at first flush and having listened to him and the other speakers i would like to record my support <e> <s> i think its inclusion in the bill would fill an important gap that is there at present in this otherwise excellent bill in making provision for the making good of the sins of omission in the past <e> <s> i think the value of the first part of this amendment can be that carrying out such a survey and having on record the things that need to be done despite the economic difficulties in the immediate future that record will provide a useful marker a useful point of reference for members of the public who are affected by these various derelictions to take up with parliament the need to make them good as and when it is politically possible <e> <s> i would like to give the amendment my support <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord avebury responds to the ministers request to withdraw the amendment i should like to ask the minister when he is considering sympathetically the amendment and the sense behind it to bear in mind that we are legislating for a very long period ahead <e> <s> whatever the dart committee may have said about the situation to date and there is room for differences of opinion about that situation in terms of whether it is satisfactory or whether it is threatening in my submission in the next years or so there will be a very considerable growth in the trail riding habit <e>", "<cs> we have heard the farming and landowning points of view as regards this amendment and i should like as a hill walker and a long distance walker very warmly to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite essential and enlightened self-interest on the part of all who walk and who happen to take dogs with them that they should conform to the terms of this amendment in the interests of the goodwill and good relations between the recreationists and the farming and landowning community <e> <s> it is i think and if not it ought to be a part of the country code <e> <s> therefore it has everything to be said for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i just want to say how glad i was to hear the noble lord who has just spoken and at the risk of plagiarising and repeating what i said at the committee stage and on second reading i should like to remind your lordships that when we talk about the per cent <e> <s> who co-operate and the per cent <e> <s> who have been described by the noble lord lord buxton as rogues we are thinking not of any very small minority of rogues <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dream of intervening to delay the resolution of this particular amendment except to emphasise the point that the noble lord lord winstanley has made that the whole burden of this amendment is to make it clear that it is the landscape value of these unique and peculiar if you like features not geologically peculiar but peculiar in relation to their unusualness in the scenery in the rest of britain that we wish to protect through this amendment <e> <s> as to who should be consulted and <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as it may be true that under the general development order it is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i warm to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> i particularly like subsection of his amendment deriving from his comprehensive and masterly historical survey in an area in which he is so expert <e> <s> it seems to me that that subsection is quite excellent because it might be described as fertilising common ground in this difficult matter of equating the diverse interests and it is no good blinking the fact that they are diverse interests between those whose livelihood is in a national park and those who come to enjoy the purposes for which national parks were set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting in the hope that everything would have been said before i needed to get up to speak for this amendment as one of the sponsors but i think it may be helpful to your lordships if i intervene very briefly at this stage <e> <s> i have very little to add which is original even in terms of todays debate on report but i should like very much to supplement one or two of the things which have been said by the noble baroness and to counter one or two of the things which have been said by the noble earl lord de la warr <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say from this elevated position and suffering as i am from altitude sickness and lack of acclimatisation that i entirely agree with both the logic and the spirit of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that everything that ought to be said has been said the only omission i feel it right for me to make good is the fact that nothing has been said from this single back bench and i shall be very brief because as i explained at an earlier stage i am still unacclimatised to and suffering from lack of breath at this altitude <e> <s> i think it should be said from this new bench that we are as appreciative as all other noble lords who have expressed themselves grateful for the absolutely magnificant work done by the government front bench and indeed by the opposition front benches in getting the bill through its various stages through its long weary progress <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the trouble that occurred at the festival on the last two occasions was the work of a very small minority of people and that the need the problem is to concentrate on those few people rather than to condemn out of hand a joyous and splendid occasion <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment that was so movingly and tellingly moved by the noble baroness and i endorse totally the reasons that she advanced for ensuring through legislation that access <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming very warmly the community enterprise programme may i ask the minister to give an indication of the extent to which the response to or demand for the programme exceeds the numbers of jobs available despite the intention to double and whether that in any way matches the demand of young people to get into this kind of employment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support very strongly both parts of this amendment although i propose to speak only in regard to the maximum sentence which can be imposed for the offence of tampering with a motor vehicle and its parts with intent <e> <s> at a time when the home secretary himself has been insisting time and again on the need to reduce the length of prison sentences and indeed to make fewer offences liable to imprisonment and at a time when the lord chief justice has been enjoining the magistracy and the courts in the same vein the noble and learned lord did so only two days ago at the annual general meeting <e>", "<cs> your lordships committee is already aware that i support this amendment <e> <s> i should like before saying anything more to apologise for my premature intervention in the committee and to thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for so properly proposing that the noble lord should no longer be heard as i believe the expression is <e> <s> having listened to the noble and learned lord there is very little more for me to say <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee would allow me to come in again very briefly in response to the point made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> he has pointed out that this is the maximum imposable sentence and of course that is true <e> <s> he has also made the case that perhaps because of the degree of the offence it would be wise to keep that as a maximum sentence <e> <s> but i hope he will agree that not only may the offence vary but the courts vary too <e> <s> the lord chief justice only two days ago speaking to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice who served on the parole board himself and is therefore in a position to speak with first-hand knowledge of the matter has spoken publicly in favour of this proposal <e> <s> furthermore in view of the urgent need to reduce the prison population and the prospect held out by the home office review that this proposal could have the effect of reducing that population by some prisoners and of the resultant benefit to the community at large as well as to prisoners themselves of their serving a proportion of their prison sentences under supervision in the community will the noble lord impress on his right honourable friend the urgency and importance of implementing a proposal on these lines at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is he aware i am sure that he is that a considerable number of people with long experience of young people their needs and their problems have been advocating some form of nationwide community service for many years quite unconnected with the current unemployment situation among teenagers <e> <s> is the noble earl further aware that recent public opinion polls among young people themselves have indicated that a significant majority of those asked would welcome being called upon to undertake tasks of benefit to other people in their neighbourhoods or in the wider community <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly indeed believing that it may be helpful to your lordships house if i inform your lordships that the council for national parks which represents the whole spectrum of recreational amenity and conservation interests warmly supports this amendment which we regard as quite essential to the defence of the purposes for which the national parks were established <e> <s> i realise of course that this amendment covers land not within the national parks but i think it has a particular importance in connection with the national parks <e> <s> therefore we believe it is right that there should be a statutory obligation on the forestry commission to take into account all those interests which are represented by the council for national parks when disposing of forestry commission land <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise one further question relating exclusively to the inquiry <e> <s> mention was made of the possibility that mr pearces remit might extend to other prisons in northern ireland <e> <s> in view of the obvious urgency of this particular escape from the crumlin road prison can the noble lord assure the house that mr pearces remit is concerned only with the escape that took place from that prison <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that not only in this instance but in respect of other and future maff plans to improve an area for agricultural purposes through expensive drainage schemes there should be a statutory requirement on the government to notify local authorities who can then raise these questions and discuss them among the local people <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just listened to a speech of passionate sincerity by the noble lord lord pitt a most powerful speech which i cannot hope to emulate and have no intention of trying to emulate <e> <s> i am likely to be much more prosaic and somewhat more brief bearing in mind that my number in the speaking list is only no <e> <s> and there are over speakers <e>", "<cs> noble lords will have noted that my name is on amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to say that i am grateful that that amendment was not moved by my noble friend lord aylestone because it has enabled me at any rate to listen with all the more attention to the considerable debate that has followed the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> all i wish to do is to put the question which comes foremost to my mind at this late stage in the debate on this vitally important question <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister and i assure him that i do not find his reply in any way <e>", "<cs> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the amendment which i had not intended to move but apparently had had a useful ecumenical spin-off <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister accept that i understand the relationship between the home secretary and the chief constables but would he also not agree that in view of the very great importance of exercising the strictest control if it were to come to a question of using plastic bullets in no matter what area of the country this is a matter which really would be such a new departure in england and wales that the government and the home secretary should be consulted before any chief constable were to have resort to these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice in support of the amendment which has been moved by the noble baroness lady vickers and to disagree with great respect with the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> perhaps i should preface my remarks by saying that i am not familiar with the falkland islands <e> <s> my own polar journeys have taken me north rather than south <e> <s> possibly this is an advantage in that such views that i may express will be guided by principle rather than sentiment <e> <s> i should like to make a brief prefatory remark in reminding your lordships how strongly i dislike the principle underpinning much of this bill the principle by which many people at present enjoying full rights and status as holders of a united kingdom passport will have that right diminished and taken away from them <e> <s> i have always thought that this was wrong and that the creation of different grades of citizenship and removing rights which exist was also wrong <e> <s> having said that i must grudgingly accept that by a majority a committee of this house has accepted that basic principle but it does make it all the more essential to look at those cases where exceptions must be made on moral or other grounds <e> <s> if your lordships look at schedule to this bill you will see that of all the territories listed now as british dependent territories there is only one whose inhabitants are incontestably and undeniably all of british stock in their origins and their blood ties and that is the falkland islands and they are falkland islanders <e> <s> no future change in the status of the falkland islands which of course is being discussed and no future generation or procreation of young islanders will alter that basic fact <e> <s> they are and they will remain a small united loyal ethnically british community <e> <s> i understand that the bill when it comes into law will affect some out of islanders <e> <s> that is a very big percentage one-fifth of the whole population who will not enjoy the status of being british citizens in future <e> <s> that is a divisive act which it is morally wrong to impose on these splendid people <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the speech of the noble lord lord geddes in moving his amendment and to the speeches of those who spoke in support of it it only remains for me to say from this bench though it would be with more confidence if more of us were here that we strongly support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment goes a long way towards removing the anxiety felt by myself and by others quite apart from those who are more directly concerned in the east asian community who under the present terms of the bill will not achieve british citizenship <e> <s> it would go a long way towards removing those anxieties and that resentment which undoubtedly they feel <e> <s> it certainly goes a long <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to second amendment no <e> <s> a i too propose to speak mainly to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> as your lordships will have gathered these two amendments are in effect identical differing only in that they refer respectively to sssis in this case and the national parks in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment which stands in my name and that of the noble baroness simply to underline very briefly the point we wish to make about the contrast between the wording of the commons amendment and our amendment no <e> <s> a regarding the appearance of the landscape <e> <s> the commons amendment clearly says that on their own moor or heath can scenically be particularly beautiful <e> <s> i contend that moorland and heath on their own can be extremely dull <e> <s> we believe that moorland and heath in the context of other types of scenery in the landscape make the beauty and therefore that commons amendment no <e> <s> should be more widely drawn according to the wording which we have offered <e> <s> so i ask your lordships at least in regard to this amendment to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with every previous speaker in praise of the scarman report and in particular for the combination of thoroughness sensitivity and speed with which it was produced in the critical situation which erupted last april <e> <s> there can be very few other people with the requisite stature intellectual and humane than the noble and learned lord who measured up to that job <e> <s> i used the word critical and it is important to remember that the crisis is still with us it has not been wafted away by the exposure and analysis of the situation which was given to it by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> and nothing less than the full and i believe prompt implementation of the scarman recommendations will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for pointing that out <e> <s> i was going to quote not from the speech in the other place but from my report <e> <s> do i have the permission of the house to do so <e>", "<cs> i thank your lordships very much <e> <s> we wrote <e>", "<cs> my lords just in case any of your lordships are not familiar with section and in the light of the exchanges between the noble lord lord sandford and the minister would it be in order for me to mention that section has particularly to do with the national parks <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister bear in mind the particular importance of the implications of the noble lords original question to the national parks and the need for farmers working and living in the national parks to have opportunity and encouragement for this diversification <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that i am no less concerned along with many of your lordships about the overcrowding and dilapidation that exists in many of our prisons <e> <s> but would he not agree that it would be quite inappropriate to involve indirectly or directly members of the royal family in ameliorating this deplorable situation however desirable the result and no matter how joyous the event <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be accounted a unique privilege for any member of your lordships house immediately to follow a lord chief justice who has sat down after making his maiden speech <e> <s> speaking as one who rather enjoys unique occasions it is for me a very special pleasure to speak in the name of all your lordships in complimenting the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice on a very notable speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for prolonging the questions arising out of the statement but i should like to put a question connected with the discussions <e>", "<cs> having read the judgment of your lordships appeal committee on the case in question and having listened very carefully to the arguments and particularly the arguments advanced by noble and learned lords this evening i should like to tell your lordships that i propose to vote for this amendment and to explain very briefly why <e> <s> one abiding conviction which has remained with me during the five years since the royal commission on the press reported to the government in has been the key position in all our freedoms of the freedom of the press despite its manifold imperfections <e> <s> whatever the substance of the conclusion reached by the noble and learned lord lord diplock in the majority judgment of the legal committee as to the relevance or otherwise of the freedom of the press to that particular case and i am persuaded that it was entirely relevant this amendment and surely this is the point that we are discussing this evening is about the freedom of the press <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the report referred to by the noble lord lord brockway the chief inspector of prisons himself has said quite unequivocally that the only solution to the present deplorable position in our prisons is a reduction in the prison population not by inference the building of more prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords we can be grateful that the motion is on the order paper today especially at a time when our thoughts are so largely focused on events miles away <e> <s> it serves to remind us that certain home-grown problems do not go away because of greater further and more distant problems and as the noble lord lord elystan-morgan said the position in some of our prisons here at home continues to be in what he described as a state of crisis <e> <s> i was slightly surprised that the noble earl lord longford did not use that term as the title for the debate instead of the word position <e> <s> it is a crisis which for want of a solution over so prolonged a period has become what i should describe as a chronic disorder <e> <s> i am among those who believe that nothing will alter the situation for the better not only in regard to the state of our prisons but also in regard to the incidence of crime except intervention by parliament to shift the emphasis effectively from imprisonment towards containment and rehabilitation in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin my brief intervention with an apology <e> <s> i should at this very moment be in the chair of a meeting at some distance from your lordships house <e> <s> i deemed it essential to be here today not because i presume to suppose that there is anything unique i have to say but because i regard this as a most important debate and i thank my noble friend lord kilmarnock for putting down the motion <e> <s> it can be said to be a very timely motion although the timetable which your lordships will have noted is extremely tight <e> <s> had the report appeared earlier and the time for decision recommended in the report been as it is it could be said that it would have been easier to believe that the timetable could be adhered to <e>", "<cs> i am happy to rise to support the amendment moved in the name of the noble baroness <e> <s> i know that she will not mind if remind her that this amendment arose from one of the recommendations in the report by the all-party penal affairs group entitled <e>", "<cs> i do not think that your lordships will wish me to detain the committee very long on this amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend has said it was intended to be a probing amendment <e> <s> i am still left with the impression that there is something to be said which is not said at the end of this clause with regard to this matter <e> <s> i am in the weak position of not having any judicial experience myself so i would not know whether the usual practice which i now understand is to take the age as the age at conviction and sentence is the normal and usual practice <e> <s> if that is so i personally am quite happy to leave it at that <e> <s> but i would ask the minister whether he would give a little further thought as to whether it would not be useful as it is not in the bill as it stands at the moment to put it in at the end of this clause <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to support the noble baroness my colleague on the all-party penal affairs group <e> <s> she covered the points that i would have covered <e> <s> there are only three points that i should like to make <e> <s> the first is that this i would see the proposal as one more move towards achieving greater consistency between the courts than is the case at present <e> <s> the noble baroness mentioned the rigours of the detention centre rgime which make severe physical demands and create a strong emotional impact on those who go through the rgime <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for providing me with some necessary education and i am now wiser than i was and to some extent reassured and relieved by what he has told me <e> <s> in view of what he has told me i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the noble baroness in probing through this amendment i should like to underscore the concern felt by members of the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group on this matter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has referred to the white paper which makes it clear that young offenders are likely to serve in adult prisons in the circumstances of the bill at this stage <e>", "<cs> i was pausing hopefully to get some support for this amendment from any other quarter of the committee <e> <s> in view of the late hour it is obvious that i do not wish to press on and insist on dividing a small committee <e> <s> have fully understood what the minister explained the circumstances which can arise particularly in the family situation and the need for continuity <e> <s> i am still not entirely happy that there should not be something more specific about the responsibilities of the probation service as distinct from the social services as a general rule <e> <s> i should like to think about this and to consider coming up with something else at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would like to thank the noble lord lord sandys for his admirable brief and for making it so clear that there is no sinister inference to be drawn from the word may <e> <s> i feel very comforted by that while being somewhat puzzled by the extraordinary interpretation put on the word shall <e> <s> i would have thought that the word shall was pretty binding and would give the secretary of state more power to his elbow to develop the attendance centres up and down the land but with the assurance that the noble lord has given me i am not going to press this point and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> speaking personally although i am speaking from this bench i am bound to say that the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord elton goes a long way towards removing my own concern that i had when i read the bill originally about the imposition of negative conditionsin supervising orders <e> <s> it may be that the court after consulting the supervisor will find in most cases that the supervisor will satisfy the court that it is not feasible and it is to be hoped that the court will abide by that advice <e> <s> i myself do not find that objectionable <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to delay the committee but i join the other speakers very briefly at this stage if only to emphasise the point that in my opinion clause is arguably the most important part of part i of the bill as it now stands <e> <s> i cannot stress its importance too much <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble baroness in moving this amendment <e> <s> in a written answer to the noble baroness as i understand it the noble lord lord trefgarne and i am glad to see that he is in his place told her regarding the provision of secure accommodation appropriate for holding to year olds juveniles on remand that locally there is and will be for some time some under-provision of the appropriate secure accommodation <e> <s> i am not quoting him but that i think was the gist of what he said <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support this amendment which is supported by the all-party penal affairs group <e> <s> in the notes on clauses it is made clear that <e>", "<cs> i rise to ask one simple question of the minister who will shortly reply <e> <s> mr leon brittan when occupying the position of minister in the home office in december in a speech in sheffield said and i use his words <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will agree that this has been a most valuable debate all the more so because of the late hour at which we have conducted it <e> <s> i should like to thank everyone who has taken part in discussing the merits and demerits as some would see them of the amendment that i have put to the committee <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord lord elton in the most friendly way that he ended with a flourish in putting the worst possible complexion on the amendment that i have put to the committee <e> <s> i am not going to try to defend it again nor am i going to say anything derogatory at this stage about the part of the bill that is passed the partly suspended sentence <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord totally there has to be a choice <e> <s> it has to be a choice involving the partly suspended sentence the amendment that i have put to the committee and indeed the amendment which will be moved very <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is in danger of taking me seriously when i did not intend to be so <e> <s> i would refer her to the record in <e>", "<cs> i am glad to give strong support to the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> on th may in another place an identical amendment was moved by mr kilroy-silk <e> <s> in replying to the motion the minister gave the impression at any rate to me as a reader of his remarks that he would take carefully into consideration the arguments for retaining day centres and therefore that amendment was withdrawn <e> <s> it is for this reason that it is most important that this amendment should be considered again <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to add to what the noble baroness has said with all of which i totally agree <e> <s> in general the shorter the probation order the more likely it is that the person serving that order will of his or her own accord wish to continue his or her contact with the probation officer on a voluntary basis what is called aftercare <e> <s> conversely the longer the order the less likely is it that that kind of relationship will grow up <e> <s> from my connection with the probation service i certainly think that the more people who still need to be befriended and counselled on a voluntary basis the better <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment deserves support and i am quite sure that the noble baroness lady birk deserves support for moving the amendment <e> <s> i say believe because it is a golden rule in your lordships house not to speak on matters in which one is not personally expert <e> <s> i cannot say that this is my field <e> <s> the expertise of course lies with the police the courts and the probation service in particular to say nothing of the prisons <e> <s> but i support the noble baroness in everything she said because i have very strong views as i am sure all your lordships do on social equity and on not discriminating between the sexes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has anticipated the point that i was going to make in support of the amendment so that i will do no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david has said just about what i was going to say after listening with great attention to the noble lord <e> <s> he has listed the difficulties which i anticipated he would list <e> <s> i am very familiar with the allocation procedures in her majestys prisons or penal establishments <e> <s> i accept the difficulty about the distance from home for visits from relatives and so on but the numbers of visits that can be fitted into days under the prison rules make that argument more or less invalid <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to say to the noble lord lord avebury that i am much less concerned about the figures which he is asking the noble lord the minister to furnish <e> <s> i am totally concerned about the very root of the matter which is the principle it does not matter if we are talking only single figures in terms of young people whose mental condition is such that they are likely to be sent to adult prisons <e> <s> it is desirable that your lordships should know what <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by apologising to the noble lord lord elton if i have pre-empted his opportunity to speak against this amendment <e> <s> i realise that i was too precipitate in that regard <e> <s> i should have listened to him and invited him to reconsider the opposition he had put forward to it when i was speaking to this amendment while moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am very sorry about that indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has spoken with his usual courtesy and i have a very high regard for his sincerety in this matter <e> <s> undoubtedly i can confirm that what my noble friend lord harris has said accords with my own feelings on this matter and i can also say to the noble baroness that i too have visited adult prisons and have seen - to -year-olds incarcerated in them <e> <s> i confirm what the borstal and prison governors branch of the civil and public servants association has written which i have quoted to your lordships <e> <s> so i know the conditions <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly in this discussion and take up the noble lord lord campbell on his concluding words <e> <s> it is my conviction and i really am speaking with considerable knowledge of the probation service and of their national association that this experiment will do great harm <e> <s> it is axiomatic that the experiment is going to depend on the active and willing co-operation of the probation service and i should like to say to my friends in the national association that whereas they do not always represent <e>", "<cs> my lords my reason for rising in this discussion is mainly because i was so extensively quoted by the noble earl lord longford during the committee stage when he presented a different shaped amendment that i thought i could not with honour sit here having been a kind of disembodied voice on the previous occasion and disclaim what was said on my behalf <e> <s> i can and gladly do confirm that what the noble earl said that i felt about his amendment is in principle correct <e> <s> but i am not entirely happy and i have told the noble earl this about the method that he is proposing <e> <s> he has acknowledged that the method may have to be thought about again <e> <s> the point here is that the preliminary review committee to which the amendment refers as the noble lord lord elton knows very well is an informal and unofficial body which is in the business and has been since of looking at all cases of lifers to see whether and if so at what appropriate point of time their cases should be put into the formal review process <e> <s> i question whether in a statute it would be proper to make reference to an informal and unofficial body of that kind and whether the home secretary could be required to give instructions to such an informal and unofficial body <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make it clear that the fact that the case has been looked at twice up to the -year mark by an unofficial and informal body gives no knowledge to the prisoner concerned as to the outcome of those two reviews <e> <s> therefore he or she will not know what the outcome is going to be or will have been until the formal review process has been gone through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord harris for making an admirable summing-up speech which saves me from making one myself <e> <s> i do not think it would be the wish of your lordships that i should go into the argument again <e> <s> i valued enormously the contributions made in the debate on my amendment and i should particularly like to say how much i valued the intervention of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> there is only one point which i am in duty bound to clear up <e> <s> the noble earl lord swinton referred to subsection of my amendment and asked why a person who infringed his licence should not come back and serve the whole balance of the sentence <e> <s> if he looks at subsection he will see that there are two conditions in which a person could be recalled one for breach of his licence and the other for committing a further offence <e> <s> the breach of his licence may be for not keeping appointments with a probation officer on a number of occasions <e> <s> it is the much lesser offence although to be deplored and not the criminal offence in any sense that is catered for in subsection <e> <s> therefore i hope that <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a brief comment on what the noble lord lord campbell has just said <e> <s> he has laid great stress on the importance of this amendment or perhaps any measure designed to reduce the prison population being acceptable to the public <e> <s> i really do question that as being a criterion <e> <s> it may sound an odd thing to say but if it had been put to the public however one addresses oneself to the public on complicated matters like this as to whether there should be remission of a sentence of one-third <e> <s> i would very much doubt if they would be in favour of it <e> <s> my own hunch is that the great majority of the great british public have no idea that remission exists <e> <s> if it had been put to the public that the middle third of the sentence should be subject to parole release under certain conditions i am quite certain that in the public would not have worn it <e> <s> so i just do not think that it is right to lay quite so much stress on that aspect <e> <s> the government of the day have to give a lead to public opinion and prove by experience that these things work before in some cases the public come to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords in adding my thanks to my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale for giving us this opportunity to review the progress made on the scarman report since we last debated it in february i should like to say how delighted i am and i am sure your lordships are to note that the noble and learned lord lord scarman has managed to arrive in time to make his contribution to this debate <e> <s> perhaps we all owe ourselves a pat on the back for keeping this debate going long enough to enable the noble and learned lord to arrive in time <e> <s> i say that and i am sure he will understand not in any sense of what little benefit there may be for him in listening to me but because we all want to listen to him <e>", "<cs> my lords as the anonymous th speaker referred to by the noble lord lord ohagan i noted the prefatory remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon who i think surprised all noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i too spoke in support of the amendment moved by the noble baroness to the nationality bill on th october last year <e> <s> i am delighted to have this opportunity to support her in the bill that she has put before your lordships today <e> <s> the point has been made that the house on that occasion and it was a very numerous house of members divided equally <e> <s> i regard that as a total vindication of the noble baronesss amendment on its intrinsic merits because it must be assumed that some of the votes cast against it on that occasion were cast very properly in loyalty by a number of government supporters <e> <s> i was glad as was everyone else who heard the minister earlier this afternoon to hear that the government are now prepared to give favourable consideration to this bill provided that the case is made out adequately in your lordships house <e> <s> it seems to me that we have been making out the case adequately ever since he said it but i am encouraged by his words to make a small contribution towards that case <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are several thousand sssis around the country of which several hundred are damaged or destroyed annually through trespass sale or other causes <e> <s> will he ensure that the rayner review body take these facts into account when considering the staff implications <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the reference in the statement to the establishment of a military garrison linked with a speech made by mr john nott at port stanley while he was on a visit to the falkland islands in which he made a reference to the potentialities of the islands as a training area from which i take him to mean that this would be a training area in which live ammunition of all kinds would be used could the house be assured that such a development would not in any way be prejudicial to the preservation of the way of life of the islanders and that by the same token it would not be prejudicial to the development of tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> from a long association with the probation service over the past years as chairman of the parole board as president of the national association of probation officers and since i can confirm and endorse everything that has been said about the dedication of probation officers to their demanding work and the skill with which they carry it out <e> <s> they work long and unsocial hours <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has said they have to deal with a perplexing range of problems demanding a wide diversity of skills talents and resources <e> <s> they sometimes have to cope with disturbed difficult and occasionally dangerous clients <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will be in order for me to give what might be called a postscript to the words of my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge if i make a special reference to the ulster defence regiment <e> <s> i hope it will not be considered invidious if i do so <e> <s> the noble earl will be aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench would also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we would particularly wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to mr waldorf and to members of his family and to express good wishes for his recovery <e> <s> i think that from this bench i can say that we are well aware of the very heavy responsibility borne by every police officer who is wearing a firearm and of the extreme difficulty that must arise many a time in making instantaneous decisions decisions which are vital perhaps to the safety and life of police officers themselves when it comes to the final moment when the decision is taken to fire <e> <s> it is relevant in this connection to put one question to the minister <e> <s> we have heard from him about the rank seniority and position of the officer authorising the use of the firearms and in charge of the party of police at the time of the incident <e> <s> can the minister give us some information and this needs to be remembered about the age experience and length of service of the officers who actually bear the firearms and on whom the ultimate and final responsibility lies at that moment or instant of firing the shot <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to begin with a provisional apology to those few members of your lordships house who are present this evening <e> <s> i had not anticipated the very late hour at which this unstarred question would begin <e> <s> i have not brought my sleeping bag let alone a tent and i do not fancy the prospect of sleeping rough on the embankment <e> <s> therefore i may have to leave to catch the latest train home <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that i was very glad to hear his expressed concern for the families of prisoners and for doing anything possible no matter what the crime to limit the damage to family relationships particularly in the case of families with children <e> <s> however is the minister aware that a journey by a family from northern ireland to for instance one of the two prisons in the isle of wight which hold a number of ira prisoners involves a family in a journey by sea by rail and again by sea with bus journeys at both ends which requires at least hours travelling time each way and longer when such families live in distant places like derry and fermanagh <e> <s> would the minister not agree that this really does impose a heavy hardship on young families and wives travelling with them <e> <s> does it not limit the frequency of family visits <e> <s> in these circumstances this is my last question would the government consider funding such visits by air <e>", "<cs> my lords we are approaching at this time the end of a long most interesting and very important debate <e> <s> its length is the product not of the length of the speeches which if i may presume to say so have been commendably short and concise but of the deep concern felt about the proposals of the government in the minds of a very considerable number of your lordships <e> <s> we have heard the soothing and reassuring words of the minister who sought to persuade us at the beginning that the purpose of the government in the proposals in the white paper is to make the ordnance survey even better than he admitted it already is <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> but the noble lord strongly implied that this is in effect what serpell was saying in certain paragraphs which he mentioned and to which he referred the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> the necessity for this independent impartial objective advice is precisely what this motion is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the most important single need in containing crime in london is to get more officers men and women on the beat <e> <s> would the minister also agree that this postulates the justified increase which he indicated in his answer to the original question <e> <s> is not probably the most important point to contain crime and does he not agree that sir kenneth newmans plans in this regard are warmly to be commended <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to ask to speak by leave of your lordships and in the same breath to offer profound apologies <e> <s> i heard various forecasts of the time that this unstarred question debate would begin <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of his reference to the local education authorities will the noble earl the minister agree with me that a number of the acts of vandalism to school buildings and other property are not perpetrated by pupils or former pupils of the schools in question <e> <s> will he accept that there is a direct relationship between such acts of vandalism and unemployment among young people <e> <s> finally can he give the house some assurance that such schemes as community policing and other community-based projects for providing socially acceptable activities for young people are having a beneficial effect on this very serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am privileged to have been invited by our colleagues on the liberal benches to respond to this statement on their behalf as well as on behalf of my colleagues on this bench <e> <s> in thanking the minister for repeating this statement on behalf of the alliance i should like to give it a qualified welcome which could depending on the answers which i hope the minister will be able to give to my questions become a more enthusiastic welcome <e> <s> it is obviously true that this scheme will do nothing to strike at the root causes of unemployment but it seems to us to be an entirely legitimate and acceptable option to offer to young people in the youth training scheme <e> <s> i believe it is an option which will appeal to a great many young people and particularly to those many who not only accept but enjoy structured programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by differing from my noble friend lord kennet by accepting in a strictly personal capacity with modest alacrity the reference of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to members of this bench as mountaineers <e> <s> it is presumptuous of me to think so but i believe that when he made that remark he looked in my direction <e> <s> if my new noble colleague lord ogmore had been in his seat at this moment i should have liked to assure him bearing in mind what he said about how nervous he felt that even after all the years that i have been in your lordships house standing at this altitude and beginning to make a speech i have an absolute horror of heights <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were now sitting on the bench occupied by the noble lord the minister which i am thankful to say i am not i think that i should be asking myself whether everything that needed to be said has not already been <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord used the words when the hullabaloo has died down <e> <s> will he assure the house that this does not indicate that he considers that an unnecessary fuss has been made by the press but arises from a deepseated and widespread concern on the part of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to assure the house that where forestry commission land situated in national parks is contemplated there is the closest possible consultation with the national parks authorities not only in view of the importance of maintaining public access but also in the interests of landscape and conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that everything possible is being done to alleviate the difficulties of journeys by relatives of irish prisoners in british prisons on this side of the irish sea <e> <s> those journeys are made between places as distant as derry city and fermanagh to prisons on the isle of wight <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of correspondence that i have had with his noble friend lord gowrie in which i pointed out that it was marginally but only marginally more expensive to make these journeys by air rather than by road sea and rail tedious and exhausting journeys for mothers and young children <e> <s> is that now an option that is available to relatives of these prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister read the report by the press council on this affair <e> <s> if so or if not will he be able to assure the house that the findings of the press council on the conduct by certain newspapers and the other media during this deplorable incident will be taken carefully into account in any possible future action in order to prevent this kind of thing happening again <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister tell the house what proportion of the total number of and year-olds who are currently unemployed is represented by the figures which he gave to the noble baroness <e> <s> secondly does he recall that the youth task group which presented its report in april last <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the skepticism among many young people particularly unemployed young people as i have found in liverpool which deters them from taking part in the scheme on the ground of the poor prospects of employment at the end of one year may i ask whether the minister is satisfied that enough is being done to persuade these young people by various means of the intrinsic value of training in a skill notwithstanding the present and expected state of the labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the possibility that the events that took place at the maze the escape could have wider implications bearing on the security of persons in other prisons who present particular security risks will the noble earl tell the house whether sir james hennessy has been asked in his report to make any recommendations regarding other top security prisons and the security risks that they may present in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the number of questions and expressions of concern in your lordships house this afternoon on this subject shows that there is no room whatever for complacency that the relatively low level of recorded damage attributable to acid rain in this country is probably due to insufficient research and that there really is an urgency to put this research in hand <e> <s> would the noble lord also agree that the five-year programme of research which i understand is being initiated by the royal society does not indicate a state of urgency <e> <s> will the noble lord accept that i am very glad to hear what he has said about the governments initiative in inquiring into this matter to establish the facts as regards the damage which has possibly been created by the cegb and the ncb <e>", "<cs> my lords following the previous question is the minister satisfied that the staffing of community homes while necessarily high in relation to the number of resident children is not excessive in present circumstances of under-use as pointed out by the noble baroness in her original question <e> <s> is it not a fact that in some of these homes with one of which i happen to be personally involved the number of staff considerably exceeds the number of resident children <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the use of the adjective spontaneous in connection with the presence of many hundreds if not thousands of pickets who assembled at warrington is entirely specious and misleading and would require redefinition of the meaning of the word in the english dictionary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister prepared to say whether the certainly to myself disappointing results so far are due to any extent to the reluctance of employers to take a full part in this scheme as distinct from the reluctance of young people if there is reluctance to engage themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for his answer may i ask whether he recalls that months ago on nd june last year during the committee stage of the criminal justice bill he informed the house that his right honourable friend the home secretary had asked the prison department to prepare a draft code of standards as a basis for discussion and that he anticipated it would be published in the currency of this year in <e> <s> does the minister further recall that his honourable friend sir patrick mayhew in another place in replying to a written question by mr kilroy-silk also anticipated that the code of standards would be available in <e> <s> is it not high time that your lordships house should have an opportunity to see that document and to approve it in view of the scandalous conditions which persist in many of our prisons as illustrated by a recent bbc film on conditions in brixton <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that i understand that he is personally imbued with this sense of urgency which has been expressed from all sides of your lordships house <e> <s> would he further accept that i acknowledge that this is not a sin of omission of this particular government but that successive governments over many years have failed to conform to the minimum standard rules laid down in the united nations in and by the council of europe in <e> <s> in the light of that would he bear in mind the additional urgency and urging that have been imparted to him during this exchange that we should expedite the action to conform with those two sets of rules to both of which we are signatories <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that parole board reports over the past years since the parole board was set up have shown clearly that few prisoners serving long sentences for acts of violence and for drug trafficking have received parole at the first review with the maximum eligibility that most have to wait a second and in many cases a third review if they are to get parole for a few months before their normal date of release <e> <s> against that fact i think that the minister will have to agree that is so can he explain what useful purpose is likely to be served by the home secretarys new policy which would justify the great difficulties now created for prison staff owing to tension in prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that in correspondence with the national association of probation officers last august his department expressed their readiness to discuss the setting up of negotiating machinery especially to deal with this very controversial problem of trainees pay <e> <s> does he not agree that this would be by far the best procedure for dealing with this controversial and sensitive problem <e> <s> is he able to let the house know what progress if any has been achieved in the setting up of this machinery during the past five-and-a-half months <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the subject of lord molloys question relates in part to the responsibility of the advertising standards authority and that the advertising standards authority is in the very good hands of my noble friend lord mcgregor of durris <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that the youth training scheme is not or should not be only about the acquisition of skills and technologies relating to the competence to get jobs and work <e> <s> should it not include the development of other qualities which have to do with responsible citizenship <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that that aspect is not sufficiently represented in the scheme at present and do the government have it in mind to look at this again after a period of trial <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister bear in mind that very much of the land referred to in the noble baronesss question falls within the area of three of our national parks <e> <s> would he further bear in mind that from past professional experience i totally accept the necessity of using that land for that purpose and agree with the inference in the question put by the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> however would the minister further agree that the use of that land for that purpose is a total contradiction of the purposes for which the national parks were designated in the act <e> <s> could the minister assure the house that as soon as the needs of our defence allow that land will be returned to the purpose for which it was designated <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that during the passage of the criminal justice bill concern was expressed by a number of people at the number of boys being sent to these centres undergoing this experimental regime who were subsequently found to be unfit and had to be returned whence they came <e> <s> is it not a fact that as at september more than boys were found to be medically unfit on grounds of mental or physical handicaps and had to be sent away <e> <s> could he assure the house that something has been done since and ahead of the publication of this report to rectify that very unsatisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> may i put another question <e> <s> would he not agree that this form of treatment if appropriate would be appropriate for acts of vandalism hooliganism muggings and other forms of violence by young people <e> <s> would he accept that my information is that the great majority of boys being sent to these centres are found guilty of taking and driving away vehicles and of theft <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that recommendations in the sense of the noble baronesss question have been the subject of many reports over many years at least as far back as the report of the noble countess lady albemarle in <e> <s> does he agree that over the past years or so the need has grown very greatly <e> <s> i feel sure that i am not alone in joining the noble baroness in expressing great pleasure at what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that answer will he accept that i do not feel particularly encouraged or impressed <e> <s> is it not abundantly clear that the provisions for protecting environmental interests under ec structural directives for agriculture our own countryside acts and under his ministrys grant policies and indeed advisory services are proving woefully inadequate to prevent serious and lasting damage being done to landscapes and to wild life habitats <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord inform his noble friend lord gisborough in case he cannot hear me that i for one have no intention of knocking the farming industry <e> <s> i am not a member of the environmental militant tendency and the wording of my question surely makes it clear that i spoke of harmonisation <e> <s> is it not clear from these exchanges and indeed from the copious correspondence and articles in the press in recent weeks and from three questions in another place on st march that there is widespread and growing public concern about this matter <e> <s> is it not the responsibility of the government to create the conditions at the highest level for the harmonious integration of the two interests both of which are of great interest and importance to the nation <e> <s> will the noble lord take this into account when the report of the sub-committee of your lordships select committee comes before him <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister assure the house that there are no women prisoners at present held in brixton prison <e> <s> does he recall that there were at least three such prisoners when i last visited that prison two years ago <e> <s> could he also assure the house that there is no intention of reallocating women to brixton <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in a number of instances notably in halvergate marsh in the broads and also in the north york moors national park where farmers have been refused ministry of agriculture grants on environmental or military grounds farmers have nonetheless declined compensation available under a management agreement and have gone ahead with development for agricultural purposes to the detriment of the environ-ment or the amenity concerned <e> <s> does this not reveal a weakness <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that this reveals a weakness in the wildlife and countryside act where there are no fallback powers of last resort to prevent such a development taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether in view of the particular quality and character of this village and its relationship with the national park his colleagues in the department of the environment and the countryside commission have been brought into full consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords the burden of my question was whether in view of the particular quality and character of the village which is not to be bypassed and in view of its relationship with the national park the department of the environment and the countryside commission have been consulted in the decision which has been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> in view of the seriousness and the increase in this problem not only in this country but in other countries in europe and america can the noble lord assure the house that there is very close liaison and consultation with our allies and partners in europe and in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that notwithstanding the sums mentioned by the noble lord as having been provided by the forestry commission and the two countryside commissions the demand for funds from the farming community and the requests for advice as to how to set about maintaining existing broad-leaved woodlands greatly exceeds the supply in both respects <e> <s> is this not welcome evidence of the concern of the farming community to regenerate their broad-leaved woodlands and maintain those that exist and also evidence of the need to step up the supply in both respects <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that these extended benefits under the terms of eec directive / while very welcome are not necessarily beneficial to environmental interests <e> <s> do they not tend to encourage upland ploughing and fencing as well as the construction of access roads and prefabricated farm buildings in some areas where such developments would be detrimental to the landscape and scenery <e> <s> in these circumstances is it not very important to abide by the full terms of eec directive / which refers to not only the necessity to promote agricultural needs but also the requirement to preserve the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful debate on this amendment and i am grateful to all those who have contributed <e> <s> i should like to preface any brief remarks that i have to make by thanking the minister for his fulsome apology which i gratefully accept <e> <s> it must have been that logical spanner which it must have been tempting to wield to bash amendments in all directions past and present <e>", "<cs> my lords under severe pressure as has been said for me they may well make cuts which are detrimental to law and order in areas of great social need which has to do with the background of the rate-capping designation <e> <s> i think there is nothing more for me to do and i have a duty to do it except divide the house on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer which sounds encouraging but is it not a fact that the non-co-operation of certain unions locally at branch level must be having an adverse effect on the development and continuation of the scheme in its second year <e> <s> is this not a serious matter at any rate for the young people who are denied those opportunities <e> <s> could he therefore tell the house to what extent the loss of more than places between the end of march and the end of april is attributable to the withdrawal of union support <e> <s> and how many places are likely to be lost following the decision of the union of communications workers to instruct its executive to withdraw support from the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to my earlier supplementary question in view of the fact that the tuc pledged its full support for the scheme at its inception and accepting my figure of about places which may be lost following the decision of the union of communications workers would the government consider using their good offices with the tuc in order to persuade that trade union and any other union in a similar position to reverse their attitude in view of the adverse effect on the training of young people which is so badly needed for this countrys potential economic performance <e>", "<cs> i should like to voice my support for the amendment to which i have put my name on the marshalled list <e> <s> the clause as drafted performs a useful function <e> <s> it reminds us i think some people need to be reminded that stopping and searching are not an integral part of an inseparable operation <e> <s> there are two stages the stopping and then if necessary or desirable the searching <e> <s> there is no doubt that of the two stages in that operation the greater inconvenience the greater ill-feeling the greater loss of dignity is incurred by proceeding to the search <e> <s> it may be obvious to say that but it needs to be said and we need to bear in mind the events that went on prior to the riots in brixton the record of them made by the noble and learned lord lord scarman and if i may add a personal note the evidence i have obtained from a service with which i have had long close connection and which is at the coalface of public feeling in relation to young people in particular the probation service <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment and to say that i have little if anything to add to what my noble friend lord mcgregor of durris has said <e> <s> but having served for three years under his distinguished chairmanship on the royal commission on the press between and i am totally convinced that these amendments are right <e> <s> it is greatly to the credit of the or more editors mentioned by my noble friend that they have gone public in expressing their views <e> <s> it is quite a relief that in relation to a bill attracting a number of amendments purporting to provide additional protection from search and seizure two of which i am about to move myself there should be an amendment to seek excusal from being protected <e> <s> i would say that it is not too much to claim that the freedom of our press one of our basic liberties depends upon this exposure to search and seizure if necessary as a safeguard against the abuse of the freedom of the press <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that in when speaking at the national park authorities conference on the site of halvergate his right honourable friend mr michael heseltine announced an agreement which he considered to be entirely satisfactory of paying compensation at the rate of a year to secure the whole of halvergate marshes for all time <e> <s> he was totally confident that this justified the act which has just passed into law <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that a great many of the greenham common ladies cannot properly be equated with hippies and that they command or should command a certain amount of admiration for having the courage of their own convictions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister accept that i really am very surprised by the answers he has just given from the position where he stands <e> <s> is he aware that home office research unit studies during the last several years and comparable studies in the united states and canada which i have read show a very clear correlation between unemployment and crime with in particular clear statistics on the - to -year-olds <e> <s> is he also aware i am sure he is of the very marked increase in the last months in the use by the courts of custodial sentences on young people in that age group <e> <s> is it not obvious that in large part that situation stems from enforced idleness frustration and despair <e> <s> finally in this situation would the government not consider some modification of their economic policy in view of the heavy social and financial costs involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear at the outset of my few remarks that i shall be speaking to the report of the committee chaired by the noble lord lord greenhill <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord adrian will not misunderstand my reasons <e> <s> in fact he will recall from my years as president of the royal geographical society that i am not competent to make sensible comments on most of the recommendations in his report <e> <s> however i have of course read it and i shall make passing reference to it at one stage in my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the exchanges with his noble friend lord elton arising out of a question by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on th july about the relationship between unemployment and crime especially between unemployment among young people and delinquency and crime <e> <s> in that connection would the noble earl know whether the home department makes any estimate of the cost in terms of the investigation the trial and the carrying out of the sentence on offenders particularly young offenders who are unemployed <e> <s> would he accept that this is really a related question and not another question <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be no bad thing if the press council and the broadcasting complaints council gave a clear definition of what is proper in the public interest and what may be of interest to the inquisitive instincts and inclinations of certain members of the public which are pandered to in order to sell newspapers and to make people turn on their television sets <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount spoke encouragingly and hopefully about the progress that has been made and the hope that was entertained during the recent discussions of further progress in regard to trans-border security <e> <s> would the noble viscount not agree that irrespective of any different perspectives and aspirations that there may be between the two governments on political objectives on this matter of security both governments are on common ground <e> <s> would the noble viscount not agree that on the question of security in so far as it concerns terrorism and acts of violence of the ira and other terrorists the prospects of progress and the need for action are not and should not be confined only to matters along the border <e>", "<cs> this may seem a very small point but my superficial reading of subsection leads me to understand that a british sea-fishery officer is invested with the same powers for investigation and enforcement as other investigating officers and may exercise those powers on land as well as at sea <e> <s> but perhaps this is not the correct way to read it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that there is nonetheless considerable disappointment among all those who care about the environment at the absence from the queens speech of any reference to environmental policy if only as an earnest of the governments concern apart from the reference to pollution which is covered by the food and environment protection bill <e> <s> is he further aware that there is equal disappointment at the delay in a response to the countryside commissions report on the uplands which was submitted last march and to which a response had been confidently expected before the end of the last session <e> <s> is it not probable that but for that delay there would have had to be a reference in the queens speech to environmental policy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow that with one more supplementary <e> <s> while it is satisfactory that there may be legislation through a private members bill to protect sssis under the wildlife and countryside act is there not an equal and urgent need to halt further losses of moorland in the uplands and of marshes through drainage in the lowlands by amending section of the wildlife and countryside act and the related financial guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister bear in mind that there is growing public concern and public awareness about these matters arising out of the exchanges that have taken place <e> <s> would he bear in <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging the importance of the statement made by the minister in answer to the original question and of course acknowledging the place the importance and the necessity of prison sentences as a measure of deterrence and as a measure for protecting the public i should like to ask him whether he would not agree that public confidence in our criminal justice system is likely to increase to the extent that the public themselves are encouraged and have the means to involve themselves in certain respects in the operation of non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment based in local communities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which i find very disturbing <e> <s> is it not a fact that the youth custody centres which have capacity for something like places are full to overflowing <e> <s> is not the overflow which is referred to due in large part to the fact that magistrates courts are making much greater use of youth custody than was envisaged in the guidelines supplied to those courts by the noble lords department after the passage of the act <e> <s> do not the figures available in his department and indeed from the survey conducted by nacro on a years working of the act bear out the fact that the use of youth custody is increasing <e> <s> quite aside from that is it not a negation of the intention of the courts that a sentence requiring a specific and constructive training programme to be carried out in the totally equipped establishment is in fact carried out in the totally unsuitable inappropriate conditions of an adult prison <e> <s> is this not a recipe for recidivism <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i personally have considerable admiration for the efforts being made by the government in this matter <e> <s> will he not accept however that there is considerable concern on all sides of the house and will the government not consider that the time is coming to review the workings of sections and of the criminal justice act <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the ministers answer imply that there is no question of co-ordination between his ministry and the department of the environment <e> <s> further does the co-ordinating unit have no responsibilities for co-ordinating the policies and plans of the forestry commission in addition to those of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea whether i am voicing a view held by my colleagues on these benches but i feel moved to rise briefly to speak from my heart in support of this amendment just in case the noble and learned lord who has moved it would have no other support except from me <e> <s> i have the deepest affection and long connections with wales <e> <s> i have some knowledge of the language and it seems to me that this is a matter of some importance despite the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that although this crime was of a particularly horrible nature and is deeply to be deplored it should not be construed as an adverse reflection on the operation of the parole system in general let alone on those who advise the noble lords right honourable friend those on the committees and on the parole board and those who are responsible for supervising people on parole <e> <s> is it not a fact that the number of offenders on parole who have been recalled for committing fresh offences has consistently been not more than per cent <e> <s> in any year during all the years that the system has operated and that the number of serious offences is a tiny fraction of that number <e>", "<cs> i was just listening and hoping to learn <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the inference to be drawn from the question is that this terrible crime would not have occurred or might not have occurred but for the decision of his right honourable friend to grant parole to pollard following the recommendation of the parole board <e> <s> is it not at least as likely to put it at its lowest that pollard would have committed his crime early this year having completed his sentence and earned full remission and having been released into the community

not be better served by an earlier release under conditions under supervision and subject to recall <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a single point about the act of worship in schools and not

"<cs> i rise to <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment and in doing so perhaps i may say that i had no part in the discussions leading to the framing of it nor in the decision to put it down for discussion in this committee <e> <s> we have heard a great deal about whether it is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say that had that been the intention i would not have dreamt of coming to

whether this amendment seeks to reproduce the greater london council and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> i do not believe that it does <e>", "<cs> i like other members of the committee was most interested in what the noble lord lord sandford put to us and no one speaks with greater authority as regards the district councils and the borough councils than himself <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i say that at this stage of our discussion i am a bit of a doubting thomas strictly in the context of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord refers to a planning organisation and quite understandably he was no doubt anticipating the demise and fall of the earlier amendments which would have set up what would have been called an authority <e> <s> he admitted that these or very disparate london boroughs disparate in the nature of their populations and their politics and in other ways are beginning to show signs of a willingness to co-operate beyond their borough boundaries <e> <s> however i think he implied that there is a very long way to go <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i am sure that he is that currently there are approximately prisoners in england and wales serving life sentences what his noble friend would no doubt wish to call so-called life sentences which are mandatory in the case of murder whereas in holland which has approximately a quarter of the population of this country the number is three and in holland a life sentence is a maximum sentence <e> <s> is he further aware that the incidence of murder in holland is proportionately no higher than in this country <e> <s> in those circumstances does he agree that there would be merit in making a life sentence a maximum sentence to be served for very considerable periods but to be reserved for the most heinous offences rather than being mandatory as at present <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly from the same set of benches in support of this amendment just to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that answer and on the whole is he aware i am glad to hear it <e> <s> in considering the cases of these four men would he consider putting to his right honourable friend in another place certain points and is he aware of those points <e> <s> that these four men were serving in open conditions and therefore there were deemed to be no escape risks and this presented no danger to any members of the public that a move to open conditions is a customary move towards eventual release for lifers and was so perceived not only by these men but by the prison staff and of course by the mens relatives <e> <s> finally because the announcement by the secretary of state on th october was applied retrospectively to all prisoners falling within the secretary of states categories is the minister aware that it was perceived as being especially harsh as applied to these men by many people who are well informed about penal policy as was reflected in the divergent views expressed on appeals in the divisional court and in the court of appeal

do not advocate a big brother approach to the protection of the countryside from a scenic scientific or recreational point of view or from any other <e> <s> there are many bodies which quite genuinely

leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for responding so positively and promptly to the suggestion contained in my question <e> <s> however does he not agree that the disparities in the use of custody particularly as between certain urban and neighbouring magistrates courts are so serious as to reflect adversely

mode a scheme <e> <s> is this not particularly hard on young people who are not fortunate enough to find an employer and hard on those voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to

nirex will be required to make good the sites once they have finished work upon them <e> <s> i am sure that everyone would agree that that is something easier said than done <e> <s> from personal experience of exploratory work of this sort in one of the national parks i should be very grateful if the minister could give any indication of the extent of the work on each of these sites in terms of hectares or acres <e> <s> my second point is in paragraph which relates to the deep facility for longer-lived wastes and the search that is going to start for that <e> <s> could the noble lord give the house any reassurances even at this early point that no such exploratory work will be undertaken in any of the national parks <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered whether it would be appropriate to offer opportunities for training for the emergencies referred to in this question by the noble lord lord renton as an option in the new two-year yts <e>", "<cs> my lords very warm tributes have been paid to the men of the royal ulster constabulary by the noble lords honourable friend in his statement and those tributes have been echoed on all sides of your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that it will be acceptable if after a long connection with the ruc i add my personal voice to those tributes to them in their immensely dangerous and difficult job <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the sale of nearly hectares of forestry commission land to private owners has already created problems as regards public access which was previously enjoyed when those forests which have now been disposed of were under forestry commission control <e> <s> in the light of that does the noble lord agree that the further sale of hectares which is planned for this year is bound to increase that problem and that matter for concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord said that all the existing safeguards will be preserved <e> <s> can the noble lord even at this early stage before the consultation paper appears assure the house that public access and recreation on reservoirs and rivers in catchment areas owned by the regional water authorities will be safeguarded under the terms of sale to private ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will have noted the warm approval given to the concluding remarks of my noble friend lord wigoder in regard to the anglo-irish accord and the effect that this affair may well have on that accord <e> <s> do not the exchanges that have taken place since the noble lord concluded his comments on the statement and the tendency for it to be put about that the blame somehow lies with the irish government underscore the importance of the government accepting and accepting quickly full responsibility for what has happened to bring this about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s>

debates <e> <s> it makes me feel duly ashamed because i was expected to take part in the earlier debate but i knew that i did not have the fortitude to do so and therefore i ratted on that one to join your lordships in the debate on which we are now engaged <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that having listened to the explanation he has given to the house in this critical situation speaking personally i fully agree with the line the government are taking <e> <s> i say this with great reluctance because having for many years seen a great deal of the work in our prisons i have always held the highest regard and admiration for the work of prison officers and i continue to do so <e> <s> however i agree that the government have done the right thing in the particular circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to start the few words that i wish to contribute with an apology <e> <s> i was kept outside your lordships chamber for the duration of about seven-and-a-half

do my best however not to repeat what i think may already have been stated <e> <s> i have of course paid careful attention to those speeches made since i returned to the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say even at this early stage how long he expects the initial experiments with six designated areas to run bearing in mind the threats in that period to the other areas within the total of recommended by the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> when does the minister expect that it will be possible to move from the pilot stage to a wider extension of the scheme <e>", "<cs> i have only just picked up the amendments and looked at the bill but i feel moved to rise very briefly to support the case made by the noble baroness in support of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> the point that has not yet been made which is well known to anyone in the penal reform business is the enormously high record of failures of custodial sentences on young people <e> <s> my own forecast is that by sending young people from their overseas station to a youth custody centre or detention centre in this country is likely to increase the failure rate <e> <s> young people would be separated from their families in nearly all cases <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be possible to devise schemes for intermediate treatment or possibly community service orders in those places so that they remain with their families in the community <e> <s> i speak from my experience of serving in stations abroad where i have the edge over the noble baroness <e> <s> the range of activities permissible under an intermediate treatment order is so great that one can make some very useful programmes which would be constructive in their effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> if i had been able to attend the committee stage of the agriculture bill when your lordships debated it on th june i should have argued with others i noted particularly the speeches of the noble earl lord onslow the noble baroness lady nicol and the noble lord lord john-mackie that it is impracticable and more important perhaps undesirable to separate the matter of advice by adas on agricultural matters on the one hand and environmental matters on the other <e> <s> i support the amendment now because i am sure that unless advice on agricultural matters is provided free by adas fewer farmers will seek advice on agricultural matters and consequentially fewer farmers will recieve the all-important advice on environmental matters that the noble lord i know is so keen they should have <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always a danger in coming in at report stage when one has missed the actual discussions and debates which took place in committee and this is my slightly handicapped position <e> <s> but i rise to support this amendment on the simple premise rather on the same lines that we have just been discussing that it is quite unrealistic and pointless to separate the matter of the conservation and enhancement of the natural beauty and amenities of the countryside if you do not at the same time promote public enjoyment of it <e> <s> that seems to me to be a perfectly good reason for including the words that are not at present on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make the same apology that i made earlier about not having followed the discussion that took place in committee leading to the noble lords amendment although i have read <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> i must confess that when the subject of bulls was discussed during the passage of the bill it is dealt with in what is now section of the act i was not particularly interested in this subject <e> <s> i was not turned on i believe that is the phrase <e> <s> but since then i have met a bull on a public footpath in an area of outstanding natural beauty and my interest has been sharpened considerably <e> <s> it was a large hereford bull confined between two hedgerows <e> <s> it was not looking at all friendly <e> <s> it was not turned stern on or whatever is the expression in farming phraseology and it was facing me <e> <s> i turned a corner and there it was <e> <s> i suspect that the farmer was using that section of the footpath temporarily as a pen <e> <s> i did not stop to ask the bull its age i turned tail and fled <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be one of the sponsors of this amendment having missed the opportunity of discussing the prospect of landscape conservation orders when it was discussed in committee on th june <e> <s> i was naturally glad to hear indeed i knew already because the parliamentary under-secretary of state mrs angela rumbold had told my council the council for national parks at an anniversary conference that the government are considering the possibility of making such orders available in national parks <e> <s> but i feel that the government ought to extend their view their focus more widely in the course of the consultations than they say they are going to <e> <s> indeed i particularly hope that the government will reconsider and have not closed their minds to the possibility of extending such orders making them available in esas in aonbs and in our green belts <e> <s> i will not take the time of the house now

continue their consultations on that comprehensive basis <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister enlighten someone who is ignorant about these matters <e> <s> will the status of the ordnance factories as royal factories be affected by privatisation and if so how <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in the matter of parole the performance and progress of offenders serving shorter terms of imprisonment is often not a significant factor <e> <s> does he agree that it would be helpful if when pronouncing sentence the courts were to express an opinion on the advisability value or otherwise of a short period of that sentence being served on parole licence <e> <s> the local review committees and the home office in turn could take that into account when deciding whether on balance parole should be granted <e> <s> would that not go a long way towards overcoming the objections of the courts <e>", "<cs> i shall not prolong the very long discussion of the committee and i rise for only a brief moment to take up and possibly reinforce one or two points that have been made <e> <s> i am one of those people who are quite seriously concerned that if this clause were to stand part of the bill in more than one respect it would create more problems than it would solve <e> <s> the particular problem that i should like to underline at this stage in the committees

addressed themselves so far if i have heard aright entirely to designated areas <e> <s> would the government bear in mind despite the importance of designated areas which i am among the first to recognise the importance of consequentially not allowing the undesignated rural environment to be downgraded <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that i too regard this as a major failure of the parole system <e> <s> however does he not agree that such cases are very few and very rare in relation to the wide scale of operation of the scheme and the long period during which it has been successfully operated <e> <s> does he also agree that some risks may have to be taken as has been said rather than court the greater risk of releasing someone a few months later without any conditions at all <e>", "<cs> my lords without dissenting in any way from the question put by the noble lord lord walston and joining in the chorus of congratulations to the noble lord himself may i ask him to bear this in mind <e> <s> i know he is aware that straw-burning even though it may be on a small scale creates a hazard not only as a smoke screen but also to wildlife animals birds and even insects <e> <s> that strengthens the case for limiting or even putting an end to straw-burning wherever it may be going on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that along with many members of your lordships house from personal experience i am very much in favour of staff colleges for various services <e> <s> however will he also bear in mind the proposal put forward in by the central council of probation and after-care committees the then association of chief probation officers and napo for the establishment of a national centre for probation studies <e> <s> that may sound a similar organisation but in fact it would be available to all members of the probation service without competitive connotations <e> <s> it may well be that this is the proposition that he mentioned in one of his replies <e> <s> we should all be interested to know how that is progressing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that deer farming can do considerable damage to the environment particularly

the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> will he accept that i am glad to learn that this protracted affair is within sight of being resolved <e> <s> will he in advance accept my apologies for not feeling able to be quite as co-operative and friendly as i was <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in a number of primary schools a promising start is made in teaching the spoken

that many reports over the past decade bearing on the growing crisis in prisons have advocated shorter maxima for prison sentences for non-violent offences <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that i can think of no report which has not been constant in advocating that course <e> <s> is he further aware that two fairly recent surveys of public opinion one commissioned by the home office and the other commissioned by the prison reform trust have shown clearly that the public would favour shorter maximum sentences for non-violent offenders <e> <s> given the fact that the great majority of prisoners now in our prisons are serving sentences for non-violent offences is there not a case for early legislation to deal with the problem in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the

<e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that whatever the outcome of the negotiations arising out of the document relating to fresh start for most prison officers particularly those working in local prisons the root of the problem is the unrewarding unsatisfactory and potentially dangerous nature of their work particularly in view of the explosive overcrowding situation <e> <s> does he recall i am sure that he does that just the other day in his latest report the chief inspector of prisons said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i too am absolutely delighted that his

persuade magistrates courts to make less use of custody and more use of the non-custodial alternatives such as intermediate treatment as referred to by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will the

name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer but is he aware that it was precisely to avoid oversights in the review of life sentence cases which were occurring

other than to echo the words she said <e> <s> we must be careful about anything we do in this bill and that the wording of the bill does not increase the likelihood of sending more young people into custody <e> <s> my reading of schedule part iii subsection a without the addition of the words which the noble baroness would insert leads me to believe that it does increase that possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in your lordships house yesterday when i understand that it was agreed that succeeding speakers would not congratulate a maiden speaker on his or her speech <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will forgive me in fact i hope that you will echo my sentiment when i infringe that agreement slightly to congratulate the noble lord lord borthwick on his admirable brevity setting a splendid example to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house what the present arrangements are for prisoners wives located in northern ireland their dependants and husbands being in mainland prisons <e> <s> is it not a fact as the minister knows that they face particular difficulties <e> <s> i am interested to know the latest position <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not surprise your lordships if i say at the outset of my remarks that in most of what i say i shall be following closely what the noble baroness lady nicol said and said so ably <e> <s> the bill is good news at a time when we really need good news <e> <s> it is good news for everyone who cares for the conservation of our wild landscapes not only in the moorlands and hills but also in the wetlands and water areas <e> <s> that is precisely what the bill purports to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment extremely briefly because the proposition has been so ably covered by my noble friend <e> <s> i shall presume to repeat to your lordships on report what i told those noble colleagues who were present at the committee stage <e> <s> i spoke then of my own personal experience in the early years of the parole board when such cases as we are now considering came before it <e> <s> i said then that this had an extremely inhibiting and indeed almost prohibitive effect on our deliberations on the merits of the cases if that is the right word and on the favourable circumstances which may well have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to support the amendment of the noble earl <e> <s> he has spoken in moving terms about the human aspect of the matter <e> <s> while i am entirely in sympathy with the case that he has made i wish to say a brief word about the practical angle of the matter <e> <s> i speak of the matter of management of life sentence prisoners in our prisons <e> <s> anyone who has served in a disciplinary capacity in a social welfare capacity indeed in whatever capacity in one of her majestys prisons containing lifers kingston prison at portsmouth contains only lifers will endorse what i say when i tell your lordships of the difficult job that they have to manage men and women serving life sentences <e> <s> there may be a lack of co-operation there may be violence and there may be misbehaviour of one kind or another borne of sheer despair in their situation <e> <s> in some there may be deep depression and apathy <e> <s> i am not trying to express undue sympathy for people who have committed appalling crimes when i say that this creates serious management problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to give support to my noble friend lord henderson of brompton in moving this and the related amendments <e> <s> any part that this bill can be made to play in addressing the most chronic problem in our penal system which is the excessive resort to imprisonment and the excessive length of prison sentences is bound to be welcome <e> <s> these amendments are aimed at that end through statutory guidelines which should impose constraints on resort to imprisonment for adult offenders <e> <s> it is logical that the same criteria applied to juvenile courts already agreed by the government should be applied when considering disposal by the courts of adult offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to have my name attached to this amendment in support of the proposition of the noble baroness <e> <s> with regard to the age upon which the noble baroness did not expatiate one has only to look at the statistics for reoffending by young people who have had the experience of prison department junior establishments <e> <s> these figures have been repeated time and time again <e> <s> the latest figures i have are the failure rate <e> <s> the rate of reoffending within two years of leaving a detention centre is per cent <e> <s> and of leaving a young custody centre per cent <e> <s> the evidence is that the highest rate of reoffending on leaving one or other of those establishments is at the lowest end of the age range that is among the year-olds <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise again to support the noble baroness particularly with regard to paragraph iii the requirement that a court should state in open court the reason why it thinks that a custodial sentence is justified even though at that point the court does not propose to impose a custodial sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i did not move the amendment <e> <s> i was not in your lordships house when it came up <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only express myself as extremely disappointed by the response of the noble earl <e> <s> over the period of the consideration of this bill in committee and on report quite a number of us and not all from this side of the house have seen this bill as an opportunity to offer amendments which would be conducive to reducing the use of <e>", "<cs> my lords i still maintain that an important opportunity is being missed to use this bill as a vehicle for doing something to our penal system which it badly needs <e> <s> it merely means that the bill will go to another place without those opportunities having been taken <e> <s> at this time late in the evening there is no point in testing the opinion of the house and on a note of regret i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the two and a half years of the common land forums deliberations five whole commons were deregistered and hundreds of acres of grazing land were lost <e> <s> to put it mildly is it not likely that during the months that have elapsed since the forum reported further losses and depredations have occurred <e> <s> does not that add great urgency and importance to reaching a decision and taking action on that report <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unable to be present at committee stage and i am therefore all the more glad to be able to take the opportunity of supporting the amendment put down by the noble earl <e> <s> in my speech at second reading on th november i pointed out that in clause there was no reference to the environmental aspects of rural and agricultural land and the need to conserve or provide public amenities <e> <s> i suggested that the words farm business in clause gave no such indication and i also drew attention to the fact that unlike clause there was no reference to section of the agriculture act which places on ministers the responsibility for striking a balance between the agriculture industry on the one hand and environmental conservation and public amenity as well as economic interests on the other <e> <s> i suggested that that reference should also feature in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall do so very briefly <e> <s> i propose to approach it in a rather narrower context than the noble baroness did <e> <s> if i have understood the amendment correctly the noble baroness must correct me if i say that i found it rather difficult to understand not from her expedition so much as from the wording of the amendment the effect of it if not the intention will be not to encourage and indeed to discourage the planting of conifer forests on the uplands in the severely deprived and deprived areas where those types of trees particularly flourish <e> <s> that is a negative purpose or it would have a negative effect and from the narrow point of view i support that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness for giving us the opportunity to discuss the vitally important subject <e> <s> it is vital because it bears on the health in more than one sense both of individual people and of the nation as a whole <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> i support all four of her amendments but we are talking about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee very long <e> <s> i understand and appreciate what the chairman of committees has said <e> <s> i appreciate entirely the hope and wish of the government that there should be a balance of interests between the three purposes in clause <e> <s> i am very much aware of the generally happy and constructive way in which <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is not only motorcycle noise in urban areas which causes grave concern <e> <s> trail riding in upland areas and particularly in the national parks is also a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has been involved in writing a report about the police forces in northern ireland i ask the noble lord to assure the house that the implications of the statement which are clearly confined within narrow parameters will not be allowed to reflect adversely on the high reputation of the ruc as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the noble earl lord cranbrook for drawing our attention to the report <e> <s> it is an important report it is delivered as the european year of the environment is drawing to its close and at a time when public concern and interest in environmental protection and in the whole area of wildlife continues to grow <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister agreed that better lighting helps in the reduction of crime in the underground <e> <s> however will he agree that the current wave of disfigurement of rolling stock while not directly causing crime creates an atmosphere that is conducive to crime on the evidence which we have from the situation both on some of our housing estates and on the new york underground <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that a personal appeal in the form of a public appeal in all appropriate quarters from mr richard branson who was appointed by the prime minister to head a tidy-up britain campaign might have a powerful effect on millions of people who admire his adventurous exploits some of whom are not among the most tidy in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to say anything that may make matters more difficult for the government in a very sensitive and dangerous situation <e> <s> however i should like to put one question to the minister which may have a bearing on the nature and magnitude of the problem <e> <s> would he care to comment on an assertion made during an interview this morning on the bbc seven oclock news when the interviewee speaking in general terms claimed that the crowds at catholic funerals are there under duress and pressure from the ira <e> <s> would he care to comment on that assertion <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers reply to the noble lord lord renton does he agree that the further planting of conifers is especially undesirable on environmental grounds in national parks <e> <s> can he confirm that nonetheless grants have continued to be available for private forestry in welsh national parks while that is quite rightly not the case in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> as the application concerns a national park whose essential characteristic is its magnificent heritage coastline will the minister ask his right honourable friend to bear in mind the dangerous precedent which would be set by acceding to the application <e> <s> i have in mind the possibility of further development elsewhere along our coastlines leading to the kind of development which has gone so far towards ruining many mediterranean coasts <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that there are no longer any young offenders aged between and sentenced to youth custody who because of the lack of accommodation in youth custody centres are serving their sentences in wandsworth or any other of our local prisons in the disgraceful conditions that have been described <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few brief words because i believe that this issue goes rather further than the community service volunteers themselves <e> <s> i had very close contacts with alec dickson when he started the movement over years ago <e> <s> one must remember to what extent the community service volunteers from the beginning have been and still are the supreme example of service by young people <e> <s> they are the exemplars and the standard bearers <e> <s> we badly need people who are prepared to do the ultimate in volunteering <e> <s> they encourage untold numbers of other young people to serve in some lesser way <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has been a pure listener with one exception throughout the passage of this bill i feel it would be helpful if the noble baroness would explain what she means in saying that it is important to keep political influences out of the matter and that it is sufficient to opt out without the ability to opt in again <e> <s> i fail to see why it should be a political matter <e> <s> it is possible that the majority of parents will wish to opt in again on purely educational grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i am right in assuming that the noble earl was speaking also to his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had to leave the chamber <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept one more question before he rises to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to burden the minister with more than one question to add to the formidable list to which he has already been asked to reply <e> <s> i noted that when speaking in the education debate he did not refer to integrated education neither did i see it in the estimates at page <e> <s> i shall be grateful to know whether the government not having made any specific reference to the establishment of integrated education nevertheless intend to give it maximum support <e> <s> integrated education in northern ireland as the minister knows only too well has a special connotation <e> <s> it is difficult to exaggerate its importance to the long-term future prospects of northern ireland <e> <s> i am thinking especially of institutions such as hazelwood college but there are a few others <e> <s> will the minister say something on that subject when he rises <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that short answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is real concern among many people lest cost-trimming economies in the new privatised industry work to the detriment of the environment and of environmental matters in all their aspects not limited only to the effect of burning fossil fuels <e> <s> would he agree that section of the act spells out all those environmental aspects clearly and in great detail <e> <s> can he therefore assure the house that the new industry both in its generating and in its distributing functions will be monitored not only to assess environmental impact but also to judge standards of service to the public <e> <s> will the regulatory system also cover those aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble baroness for explaining the farm woodland scheme <e> <s> from these benches i give it a sincere if <e>", "<cs> my lords i am covered with shame but knowing the noble baroness so well i can wear it <e>", "<cs> my lords given the circumstances of the serving personnel and their lack of freedom to choose where they live and work would it not be simpler and equitable if a standard charge were made for all personnel of all three services throughout the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the admirable work which is being done all over the country in the name of intermediate treatment <e> <s> is he also aware i am sure he is of the intermediate treatment fund which is now in its tenth year and has already funded some projects which include not only young people who have been referred from the courts but many other young people who are at risk of getting into trouble with the law and young people generally <e> <s> that is one of the most promising avenues in which to approach and deal with the prevention of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there are water catchment areas outside the national parks which have not necessarily been designated as areas of outstanding natural beauty but which have great scenic and recreational value for the public such as the elan valley in the county of powys which at present is safeguarded for public access by the birmingham corporation act <e> <s> will he assure the house that that area and other areas of great recreational and environmental value will be safeguarded for the public and from restrictive commercial development under the private ownership of water <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the moorlands association alone of those involved in this matter has been holding up the agreement all along on the proposals of the common land forum <e> <s> is it right that a numerically vey small body should hold up the consensus of the very large number of other bodies including farmers <e> <s> the country landowners association and the conservation bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that recreational journeys away from school premises are widely recognised as a valuable part of outdoor educational programmes especially for pupils in urban areas and those who do not shine in organised games <e> <s> is he further aware which i know he cannot be that a number of heads of schools have told me of their concern lest the effects of section of the act will be to deny those experiences to the very pupils who stand to gain most benefit from them because of a combination of a lack of available authority funds and unwillingness or inability of parents to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that damage has continued for the past seven years to the marine environment at skomer island and other areas that were considered to need protection way back in <e> <s> the consultation procedures that were to be streamlined according to the answers given from the noble earls front bench on at least two occasions have failed to produce results <e> <s> is it right that in these circumstances what one might call environmental imperatives should be subordinated to commercial or sporting interests <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that none of the exchanges which have taken place to date should he seen as reflecting adversely on the personal services given by the postmen and women who deliver and collect the mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having read the statement but will the noble earl clear up one point <e> <s> he mentioned the figure of members of the prison staff who remained in post at wandsworth <e> <s> are those members of the wandsworth prison staff or are they members at governor grade who have been drafted in to replace those who have come out on strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to press the minister a little further on the matter raised by my noble friend lady robson <e> <s> is he aware that notwithstanding the prime ministers speech to the royal society on global environmental issues which vitally important as they are mainly bear on the future there is considerable concern among many members of the public about the governments apparent ambivalence with regard to what one might call the more mundane environmental issues that exist in the here and now in this country <e> <s> such issues arise for example out of land disposals and the concern about continuing public access and enjoyment of the countryside <e> <s> is not a clear and comprehensive policy statement now called for from the government about the environment in all its aspects and the setting up of a body to develop that policy as recommended by the noble earl lord cranbrook in the debate on st february <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that an enterprise known as the guardian angels which purports to provide special protection for travellers on the london underground and which has been imported from new york is fraught with difficulties and possible danger and should be discouraged <e> <s> that kind of work is much better done by special constables <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that i am relieved to know if i understand his answer correctly that an article by sarah helms in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to rise to make the same point made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i rise to ask only out of curiosity whether it is not rather unusual in parliamentary drafting to have not merely a negative to which the noble lord lord mishcon has drawn attention but the use of a double negative <e> <s> i wondered whether there was some subtle significance in the drafting <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> such is my concern about the matter that last year during the white paper stage which preceded the bill i tabled a starred question on th july <e> <s> i asked the government <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also warmly welcome the governments statement despite the element of uncertainty that it contains about the longer term future <e> <s> will the noble lord accept that i can speak from the testimony of nearly years with gurkha soldiers of their exceptional qualities of loyalty courage and fighting skills both in peace and in war <e> <s> there is an extraordinary desire among the tribal people in nepal from whom we have traditionally recruited gurkha soldiers to continue that service with the british army <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that it has been remarkably demonstrated in a number of our primary schools that children of a primary school age have no difficulty in acquiring an extraordinary facility with two foreign languages <e> <s> is it not a terrible pity to waste that incipient knowledge by not carrying it on in the secondary stage for all our young people <e>", "<cs> my lords following the questions put by the noble baronesses lady faithfull and lady ewart-biggs is the minister aware of the disgraceful conditions in which young prisoners aged between and years are held not only in hull prison but also in leeds prison <e> <s> is he further aware that in hull prison numerous attempts at suicide have been made and in leeds prison no fewer than seven suicides have occurred in the past months <e> <s> how do the government reconcile that situation with a constructive and humane penal system <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that eight of the options proposed by the east london assessment study would destroy a remarkable rural amenity known as the parkland walk which runs between highgate fields and finsbury park <e> <s> that amenity provides recreation for many thousands of people of all ages is a useful educational resource a habitat for many kinds of wildlife and is a unique unifying influence on the very mixed community in that part of london <e> <s> in view of the strength of local feeling on this matter can the noble lord assure the house that before any decision is taken to build a highway along any part of the parkland walk there will be a public inquiry as happened in when the then secretary of state for the environment ruled that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of these questions will the noble earl bear in mind that should there be an eventual decision to dispose of any of the nationally owned nnrs i was talking about the nationally owned nnrs to private ownership the nature conservation bodies which are quite numerous would be unable to bid for them without additional funds <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that during the years preceding the decision of mr leon brittan to restrict the criteria for parole in certain categories of offence home secretaries had been able to accept the positive recommendations of the parole board in all but per cent <e> <s> of cases involving more than prisoners who received parole licence in that decade <e> <s> is that not striking evidence of the sound judgment and high sense of responsibility of the parole board in the public interest during that time <e> <s> does the noble earl therefore agree that the decision of mr leon brittan displayed a lack of public confidence in the parole board which was quite unjustified and unhelpful to the parole system <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the very complex and detailed character of the issues which fall under the heading of nature conservation make a case for the retention of a national body which was created for that specific purpose <e> <s> can he give the house some reassurance that those detailed issues will not suffer as a result of amalgamation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that none of these exchanges should be allowed to give the totally false impression that there is criticism of post office workers <e> <s> by and large those workers deliver and collect the mail and do a magnificent job <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure the house that visiting conditions at brixton prison have been greatly improved in the last two years <e> <s> is he aware that at about that time when i last made a visit there the conditions for visitors to brixton were quite disgraceful <e> <s> there was no shelter for visitors let alone a visitors centre <e> <s> they waited outside in all weathers and when they went inside it was bedlam <e> <s> there was no privacy <e> <s> all the visitors were together with all the prisoners <e> <s> have things greatly improved since then <e> <s> it is all the more disgraceful because brixton is a remand prison <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join the two previous speakers in congratulating the noble earl and the select committee on presenting to your lordships a very clear and persuasive report <e> <s> it is perhaps just as well for our debate this afternoon that the select committee anticipating that there would be considerable amendment to the draft directive has looked at its work in general terms <e> <s> that enables us to take a broad view of this draft directive and this proposal <e> <s> that too is just as well in view of the extremely short notice at which this item of business has been included in todays agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the demands of the tourism industry and the need to protect the countryside are not always in harmony and may conflict <e> <s> can he assure the house that environmental interests will always be carefully borne in mind when planning to develop tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe your lordships an apology particularly the two speakers who have just contributed to this debate for stepping in quite prematurely and allowing my impetuosity and enthusiasm for the bill to override my knowledge of the rules of the house <e> <s> i offer my sincere apologies and i shall try to make up for it by being exceedingly brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my words of congratulation to the avalanche which is descending on the head of the noble baroness and say that i exempt her from replying to that part of my question <e> <s> however when considering the provision of adequate teaching facilities for all young people will she bear in mind the great importance of providing adequte residential accommodation in the form of centres and camping opportunities outside school premises because they are an essential provision <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the tourism industry has an important role to play in the matter of conserving the countryside including the disposal of litter <e> <s> can he tell the house whether that aspect of the responsibility of the tourism industry is included in the training programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a brief word of welcome to the statement on two grounds <e> <s> the first concerns the reference in the statement to the report of the noble lord lord carlisle <e> <s> here my reasons differ from those of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> as i understand the statement the government give substantial confirmation and support to the findings of the report <e> <s> speaking personally from a background at the parole board i was delighted to learn that the work of the parole board over the years is to be confirmed and in certain important respects strengthened <e> <s> in that connection perhaps i may ask the noble earl one question <e> <s> according to page six of the statement for those prisoners serving more than seven years the final decision in the selective process for additional release on parole will rest with the home secretary and not with the parole board <e> <s> may i take it i hope that this is the case that the advice of the home secretary regarding selection will nevertheless come from the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that a call for the adequate provision of secure units by the regional health authorities for mentally disturbed offenders was made by the house of commons expenditure committee as long ago as <e> <s> the may committee on the prison system endorsed that call in very strong terms in <e> <s> the all-party penal affairs group reinforced both those recommendations in <e> <s> in view of the numbers of mentally disturbed offenders inappropriately held in our prisons is it not high time that this pressing need was met <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact as my informants assure me that the government of nepal have been faced with serious threats to law and order in the country instigated by agitators who are intent upon exploiting legitimate political demands for reform and that reports of over-reaction and excessive force and repression of press freedom are grossly exaggerated for political ends <e> <s> is that not more credible in view of the known benevolent nature of the regime of nepal and the notably peaceful character of the nepalese people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the school sports forum reported jointly to the department of education and science and the department of the environment last year on certain adverse consequences of the education reform act on sport and recreation <e> <s> is he also aware of the constraints imposed on teachers time and training both of which are essential to enable pupils to experience outdoor education in outdoor pursuit and field study centres <e> <s> as this fact has a very definite bearing not only upon schools but also upon the community can he assure the house that the adverse consequences reported by the forum are duly monitored with a view to amending the education reform act <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> will he accept my realisation that a most difficult problem was posed for his right honourable friends <e> <s> however given the nature and scale of the damage that can and has been caused by the department of transports road infrastructure programme in terms of the countryside and air pollution and given also growing public concern for the environment together with the prime ministers explicit support for green policies does he agree that it is desirable to review and perhaps revise existing road transport development particularly in regard to sensitive areas which are governed by circulars issued about years ago <e> <s> does he further agree that it is desirable that fresh consideration should be given at cabinet level to effective co-ordination of environmental policy as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords confirming what was said by the noble lord lord molloy will the noble viscount accept that the main point of my question was to inquire about the effective co-ordination of the governments plans for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has rightly drawn attention to the courage of the prison officers in the situation that arose in strangeways prison <e> <s> this was echoed by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend lord harris of greenwich have pointed out that the conditions obtaining in strangeways regarding overcrowding and the long confinement of prisoners in their cells are typical of those in all other local prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that it is not only world heritage sites which are under severe pressure from those who would develop them for commercial purposes for the tourist industry i point out to the minister that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was greatly encouraged by the assurance that he gave to me in the debate last november on the ec report <e> <s> it was in response to my observations about the international responsibilities of member states in providing habitat and species protection <e> <s> is the minister also aware that as has been made clear during the course of our exchanges many noble lords are worried about the urgent need for more action before there are further losses to wildlife as a result of the lack of sufficient designation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the unfortunate effects of the publicity given by the media to the recent events at strangeways has been to give a totally false impression of the relationships which exist between prisoners and the prison staff <e> <s> they displayed acts of violence and hatred by a small number of prisoners against the prison officers below <e> <s> will the government consider ways and means of trying to correct that impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> according to my information this installation will extend over a distance of about a mile <e> <s> it will consist of numerous masts of about feet in height linked by wires <e> <s> in the light of that information does the noble earl not agree that the installation will have a damaging and even a devastating impact on the landscape within the national park <e> <s> is he aware that at the proposed site the installation will be seen for many miles along the heritage coast footpath around st davids head as well as inland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that rather disappointing reply <e> <s> does he recall that it is now two-and-a-half years since the government promised early legislation <e> <s> in their manifesto of they said that legislation on the common land forum report would be forthcoming <e> <s> a green paper was published in may of that year <e> <s> is the minister aware that during the long interval of time that has elapsed many hundreds of commons have been lost through deregistration <e> <s> now that the court case concerning hazely heath in hampshire has been settled by a ruling of your lordships judicial committee and notwithstanding some reservations on the part of the moorlands association does the minister not agree that it is high time that we had a bill <e> <s> further can we hope that repeated ministerial statements that the forthcoming legislation will appear soon really mean soon <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the figures that he has given to the house concerning to year-olds and the remarks that he has just made about the probation service reflect considerable credit on the probation service <e> <s> does he further agree that those factors indicate the growing confidence of the courts in that service <e> <s> doubts which i think are wrong have been expressed about the service at various times in the recent past <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the intention behind the amendment moved by the noble earl <e> <s> i understand that he does not intend to press it to a division <e> <s> however i shall support one of the subsequent amendments to be moved by the noble lord lord chorley <e> <s> that will have the same effect as regards a joint committee proposed by the government as is suggested in the noble earls amendment <e>", "<cs> i take up the point raised by the noble baroness purely for clarification <e> <s> she voiced the view that the two broad interests nature conservancy and the wider countryside should not be brought under a single umbrella at the level of the joint committee for all kinds of reasons <e> <s> i should like to ask through the committee whether the noble baroness is saying that the intended countryside council for wales which has exactly that overall function and the proposed merger between the two bodies in scotland will not work either <e>", "<cs> i rise to express my support for the two amendments tabled in the name of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> apart from what has already been said i think that the point should be made about
