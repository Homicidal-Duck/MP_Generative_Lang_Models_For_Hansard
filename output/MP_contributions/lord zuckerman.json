["<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is aware with regard to the creation of real lasting jobs that over recent years the united kingdom has fallen behind not only japan in a disastrous way but every european country for which there are figures in development money in forward investments <e> <s> so that the creation of new industry based upon new discoveries demanding high-risk capital is something which the government i feel should look to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all immensely grateful to the noble lord lord noel-baker for having initiated this debate and for having done so in so eloquent and moving a way <e> <s> the matters to which he has directed our attention grow more and more critical as every month passes perhaps in the light of current events as every week passes <e> <s> of one thing i am certain lord mountbatten himself would have been very pleased had he lived to see his strasbourg speech sparking off this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to revert in this debate to those issues to which my noble friend lord gladwyn directed his remarks and also to one sentence spoken by my noble and gallant friend lord hill-norton <e> <s> there was a slight difference as it were in meaning and intent between the two <e> <s> i should like to dwell on this because it concerns the entire relationship of what one calls an armoury of strategic weapons and what are now called theatre or tactical nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether in reference to chemical and biological agents i may ask if we are bound by any international conventions or any agreements which we have ratified beginning with the geneva convention of i think on the use of chemical agents <e> <s> we are certainly not bound as i remember from the point of view of protective devices <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a bit of a challenge to rise immediately after the speech of the noble lord lord shinwell but none the less i do so <e> <s> he has painted a very ambitious picture <e> <s> indeed as i listened to the words of my noble and gallant friend lord hill-norton i realised that what we are really talking about is precisely the same problem that we have been facing for all these years not only as the noble earl lord carthcart said of inflation but also in a period when we have to face the inevitable consequences of the technological arms race as a result of which a unit of resources buys less defence every year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all be grateful to the government for having passed the defence programme that we are debating today in a realistic framework in order as the secretary of state for defence said in another place to stop the drift down a path which has led to cuts in ammunition fuel training and deployment and which as he put it would inevitably lead in the next few years to increasingly degraded operational ability his words <e>", "<cs> even if the gdp stops falling the government <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> i apologise to both noble lords <e> <s> i was about to say that even if the gdp stops falling it seems to me that the government and the nation as a whole will have to steel themselves to the proposition that a per cent <e> <s> increase per year will not assure the present programme <e> <s> all experience shows and this point emerged from other speeches although not quite in the way i wish to make it that a per cent <e> <s> annual increase is likely to be very much less than the cost increases that inevitably occur in the development and production of military equipment which makes up some per cent <e> <s> of defence expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> the americans have borne the cost of the research and development for the missile <e> <s> if i may resort to a little personal history i was with the prime minister of the day mr harold macmillan at nassau when that arrangement was concluded <e> <s> like all the civil servants present i was busy on the drafts and there were some words which had to be added about r and d to make it plain exactly how the polaris deal had to be agreed in the way that it was and why the trident deal followed suit <e> <s> those words said that the americans <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a question to the noble viscount <e> <s> is he aware that precisely what he has just been saying was said no doubt in this house but certainly in another place years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put one question <e> <s> i understood the noble lord to say that it was the policy of the united states government and of the british government that there could be field warfare in which nuclear weapons are used <e> <s> knowing full well that there are many people who say that could be i would like to know and i am sure your lordships would like to know whether any government has stated that policy as explicitly as has been implied in the noble lords statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i have studied the report of the select committee with considerable interest and at the outset i should like to congratulate the chairman my colleague the noble lord lord sherfield and the members of his committee for having assembled so much useful information and having pulled it together so well <e> <s> they have made a number of recommendations <e> <s> these were outlined by the noble lord lord sherfield when he opened this debate <e> <s> i want to refer to only two of them <e>", "<cs> was the setting up of the royal commission on the environment that was a recommendation of ours <e> <s> i find that in his memoirs sir <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mayhew resumes his seat may i put a question to him <e> <s> he referred to the policy of flexible response in relation to nato strategy <e> <s> does he know that mr mcnamara the author of that policy has recently published an important statement in conjunction with mcgeorge bundy who was head of the national security council during president kennedys regime and the earlier part of president johnsons regime gerrard smith who has been involved in these matters for as long as i know and that means as long as i have which is over years and george kennan qualifying that very policy and asking governments to consider a no-first-use policy <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble lord lord kennet i should like to add my tribute as a one-time civilian member of the planning staff of combined operations and also as one who was heavily concerned in the preparations for the normandy invasion to the brilliant way in which the services mounted and executed the operation which came to such a happy end <e> <s> when i look back over the years i can hardly conceive that it would have been possible so speedily to do what was done <e> <s> when i think of the days and days that were spent in mounting even a small operation this was truly a remarkable operation <e>", "<cs> the answer to that question is yes my lords <e> <s> i will not go into the technicalities here but i am prepared to debate them in private with whomsoever the noble viscount puts up <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two or three points that i should like to make in this debate <e> <s> the first and i say this because we must be fair to the people from whom i took evidence in the course of my inquiry is that no one pretended to knowledge which he did not have <e> <s> when it came to the question of cyanide as a means of getting rid of infected setts or setts which were suspected of being infected i specifically asked the rspca representative about this matter as i made clear in the report <e> <s> i addressed the question to him and made quite sure that it was recorded as a matter of fact in the report <e> <s> the rspca man knew no better way of dealing with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by apologising to your lordships house for the fact that i cannot remain to the end of this debate and in particular to the noble baroness <e> <s> lady trumpington because i shall not be here to listen to what she says in summing up <e> <s> i shall read with great care what has been said <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord houghton in the way that has been done by the noble lord lord beaumont for having drawn the attention of your lordships house to this white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by adding my word of appreciation to those that have already been offered to my noble friend lord sherfield for having introduced this debate a debate which as previous speakers have made perfectly clear concerns matters which are critical to the well-being of our country not just in the long term but in the short term <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mayhew for having introduced this debate <e> <s> it is a most important matter and i am sure that we shall hear about it again and it may be we shall also hear various views about it <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships if despite my wish to remain to the end the debate i fail to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord mayhew introduced the debate on this subject in january of this year i knew it would come back again to your lordships house but i did not realise it would come back so soon <e> <s> on the other hand i have been impressed by the force of the introductory remarks of the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i do realise that this is a subject on which we should focus a lot of our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord mayhew repeat what he said about president reagan <e> <s> is he assuming that president reagan will be taking the decision about deployment <e> <s> do i understand that the noble lord lord mayhew thinks that president reagan will be in office and will take the decision about deployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord who put this very important question aware that there are two bodies both of which are international and apolitical which are considering this matter and are due to report <e> <s> there will not be anybody able to say that these people are in favour of unilateral multilateral more or less disarmament <e> <s> one is the international council of scientific unions on which we are represented through the royal society which has commissioned a report through the organisation concerned with problems of the environment <e> <s> it will be reporting in washington in late september and then in munich internationally in october <e> <s> there will be a two-volume report which ought to satisfy everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to focus my contribution to the debate today on an observation made by the noble lord lord trefgarne in his opening speech about the desirability of a two-way exchange given that we co-operate with the united states in the sdi programme <e> <s> yesterday the main editorial in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord stockton for whose vision in introducing this debate we should all be very grateful pointed out in the course of his opening speech that nothing will stop the further march of new technologies <e> <s> as the debate has proceeded i believe that two problems have emerged <e> <s> first how quickly can the benefits of the new technologies be spread and their ill-effects and short-term effects alleviated <e> <s> secondly what part shall we play in the development of these new technologies <e> <s> obviously those are not just problems for government <e> <s> governments do not create new technologies <e> <s> however governments have always had to deal with the social and economic consequences of major technological innovations and that point has been made by others who have already spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what proportion of the amount which is devoted by the ussr of its defence spending to strategic defence goes to abm and to anti-aircraft <e> <s> according to cia testimony given to the senate armed services and appropriations committees in june of last year one-tenth of the total spent on defence goes to strategic defence but i have seen analyses suggesting that far more than half the sum involved goes to anti-aircraft defence <e> <s> indeed the record of the testimony which i have read carefully indicates that there is a blurring of distinction between abm and anti-aircraft <e> <s> i wonder whether we have our own views on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness explain to your lordships house exactly how it is possible to reconcile the statement made by the president to the american people the night before last declaring his right to develop test and deploy against missiles with the assurances given to the prime minister at the beginning of last year about nothing being done which would be in defiance of the abm treaty <e> <s> one must bear in mind that at that time we were dealing only with a strict interpretation whereas what the president said in his address on the television related to what is now known as a broad interpretation or according to gerard smith who negotiated the treaty a new treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords the manner in which the contributions of members of your lordships house have complemented each other during the course of this afternoon is a tribute to the skill of the noble viscount lord torrington who chaired his committee so superbly <e> <s> i had the privilege of sitting under his chairmanship and i do not believe that anyone could have done a better job in steering us to a report which from what has been said so far has the approval of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords my question arises out of that last answer <e> <s> i refer to the speech made by the foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe a week or two ago in which he said that it remains crucial to seek the answers to r d questions before reaching conclusions on what may be technically possible <e> <s> is that to be dealt with independently by her majestys government <e> <s> have we the machinery to do so considering that general abrahamson the director of the sdi office has said that no one can prove it cannot work which means that he is set on a course of proving a negative <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to focus on only two issues in this debate <e> <s> both of them also concern realities although i must confess of a more specific kind than the general ones to which the noble lord lord pym referred in his brilliant maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to conclude by saying that i sincerely hope there will be further steps in the process of arms control initiated by the signing of the treaty yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my word of thanks to the noble earl lord cranbrook for bringing the attention of your lordships house to the problem of the ozone layer <e> <s> i should also like to add my congratulations on the most statesmanlike maiden speech of the noble lord lord bridges <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing to controvert the noble lord lord hatch of lusby i wish to add my support to the ministers answer <e> <s> there was no incontrovertible evidence that tests had been carried out by south africa <e> <s> i was in close touch with the inquiries which were then being made <e> <s> the answer was totally dubious <e> <s> no one to this day knows what that one pulse was about <e> <s> in saying that i obviously cannot say whether or not south africa has or has not got nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the potential guinea-pigs perhaps i may ask the minister whether she would agree that there is an enormous amount of uncertainty about the levels of radiation which are noxious <e> <s> will she also agree that the experiment which the elderly fellows of the royal society and the other institutions have said that they would be prepared to undertake might provide some information which would reduce the enormous disparity which now exists between what people believe to be safe and unsafe environmental radiation <e>", "<cs> my lords against the background of the profound speeches with which this debate has been introduced and after those endearing references by the noble lord lord thorneycroft to dick crossman i am happy to say that i served the noble lord lord thorneycroft in previous years under the old official secrets act i trust satisfactorily and would do so again under any official secrets act <e> <s> my own contribution will be somewhat narrow <e>", "<cs> my lords no unfortunately i have not <e> <s> if the minister has provided a satisfactory answer no doubt the noble lord the leader of the house in winding up the debate will refer to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i would now be in breach of the official secrets act if i were to say that i may have done so <e> <s> perhaps when the year-rule is up the noble lord lord callaghan can refer to the papers and see what the situation was <e>", "<cs> my lords when i became the chief scientific adviser to the ministry of defence mr harold macmillan later to become the earl of stockton then the prime minister gave me some advice about these matters <e> <s> he said kill the projects when they are small fry <e> <s> they are more difficult to stop when they become sprats and impossible when they are herrings <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall now lead up to my final point <e> <s> given the letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the soviet union allowed a party of americans including scientists in the defence field to inspect a missile cruiser <e> <s> each one of its weapons is apparently able to deal with a carrier group <e> <s> is this not a question which we might put to the soviets <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the minister that when the crown estate bill was going through parliament in i was secretary of the society <e> <s> the then minister of works the noble lord lord molson who was our main landlord and a member of your lordships house i do not know whether he is in his place agreed to insert a provision for additional acres on the understanding that those acres would help beautify the whole park <e> <s> there was no intention and i do not suspect my successors on the council of having any intention to do other than ensure that the amenities of regents park would be improved if the government or the planning authorities decided to go ahead with the -acre extension <e>", "<cs> my lords what evidence can be given that nuclear warheads are in fact tested before they go off <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset perhaps i may apologise to your lordships that i have to absent myself from part of the debate <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord bonham-carter i sincerely trust that i shall be here at its conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord takes his seat perhaps i may put a question to him <e> <s> in his introductory remarks he appeared to <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to apologise to the house <e> <s> i regret that i shall not be able to listen to the whole of the debate <e> <s> speaking as a one time experimental biologist whose main theme of work was reproductive physiology i should like to say here and now that never in the course of a day have i listened to a better exposition of the total framework within which one ought to view the work that one does in this field <e> <s> from my point of view it has been more than an eye opener <e> <s> i have learnt a great deal and i have been deeply impressed by very much of what has been said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return to a point made by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> i understood from what she said that women will undergo a traumatic experience in providing the embryos which might be used in research assuming that the bill receives noble lords assent <e> <s> was she referring to women who go to a fertility clinic or any other clinic or to a laboratory and ask to be injected with the hormone concerned the noble lord lord walton knows what hormone that is as do i in order to provide a number of oocytes for experimental purposes <e> <s> i was under the impression that the bill dealt entirely with women who seek help in infertility clinics and who go voluntarily to those people who are licensed to do what is necessary <e> <s> there may be super-ovulation as the noble baroness indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am confused by two words in amendment no <e> <s> b which we are now discussing which reappear in amendments nos <e> <s> and a <e> <s> those words are or normality <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord walton can explain how one can test sperm for normality merely by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unaware that new bore-holes had been drilled <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the recent abrupt decline in the water table in norfolk can be attributed to that action on the part of the anglian water company <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that were the practice of transporting these flasks across the channel not safe the iaea would be the first to protest to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reinforce what the noble lord lord nugent has said the situation is bound to get worse next year unless we have phenomenal rainfall in the months ahead on the basis of past records is it possible to say exactly what amount of rainfall we need from now until let us say next spring in order to be certain that we shall not be in a worse situation this time next year than we are now <e> <s> otherwise so far as i can make out the situation is bound to become worse each year for some time to come <e>"]
