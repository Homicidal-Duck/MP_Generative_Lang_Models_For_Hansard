["<cs> my lords everybody will agree with the object of the bill which has been moved by the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> speaking as a layman the bill seems to me to impose severe penalties on anyone who tampers with witnesses in criminal cases <e> <s> the preliminary question therefore as to whether we should proceed with the bill is whether the existing law is important and if it is whether a private members bill introduced without consultation and i was going to say without knowing all the facts but having garbled some of the facts is the right way to put it right <e> <s> it is not for me to cross legal swords with the noble lord even though i am his target <e> <s> all i can do is to seek independent legal advice for myself and i have it here <e> <s> there is a great deal of citation of cases and judgments and i shall detain the house only with its final paragraph <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not what mr bessell has said it was his london solicitor a man of standing who if necessary is prepared to swear an affidavit to that effect <e> <s> i know the name of the official but i do not want to name him in this place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord wants a further explanation <e> <s> i have already explained that the reason we entered into the contract and thought that it was all right to do so was because our own legal advisers said that it was all right as did the office of the director of public prosecutions <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make this discussion longer than it has to be but perhaps as one who has been as long in journalism as anybody else in your lordships house the committee might like to hear what i have to say <e> <s> practically all of it has been said already <e> <s> what i should like to do is to tell it in a different way because all the speakers seem to assume if one does not know anything about it that this bill has just been produced and the government are being very pigheaded about it <e> <s> it has a long history going back to the beginning of and i think that the government have been rather goaded in this matter <e> <s> i have deep sympathy with their position <e> <s> they have been bombarded with advice from many quarters <e> <s> sometimes that advice has been changed and sometimes it has seemed self-important <e>"]
