["<cs> my lords it may appear that this is a strange and inappropriate subject for a maiden speech from a lord spiritual <e> <s> i hope to persuade your lordships in a very few minutes that a suitably modest contribution from these benches is not out of place <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will not be thought inappropriate by this house or by the noble viscount lord massereene if a brief interjection is made from these benches even at this stage in the progress of this bill <e> <s> your lordships may recall the speech made by my right reverend friend the lord bishop of ely when this bill was being read a second time <e> <s> in it he referrred to the report entitled <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee will be indulgent to a bishop who finds himself a little lost in the forest of marshalled amendments at this point <e> <s> i want to make two points which i hope are not inappropriate at this moment <e> <s> it goes without saying that like all other speakers i am totally against this practice and hope that we shall legislate against it to assist its inevitable demise which surely must happen in any case but we wish to hasten <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the noble baroness for her statement on this matter <e> <s> in view of the unusual circumstances in which an anglican bishop was a representative of the plo perhaps i may make a short comment and put a <e>", "<cs> my lords in the shire counties and therefore in the shire dioceses as well there are still some people waiting to be converted to the doctrine that the politicisation of local government is a good thing in itself <e> <s> be that as it may it must surely be for the general good of society that the public funds administered by local authorities should be seen to be devoted to the provision of services which will benefit the community and not to foster party political ends <e> <s> in broad principle therefore i speak as one who warmly welcomes the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a general welcome to this bill and i believe that others who might have spoken from this quarter of the house would certainly want to do likewise and indeed to add our tribute to the untiring work of the noble baroness lady masham and to express the <e>", "<cs> rose to move that this house do direct that in accordance with the church of england assembly powers act the measure be presented to her majesty for the royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i shall do my best to answer at rather short notice the important points he raises about clause <e> <s> it may help to refer him to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all members of this house would wish me to begin with a word of congratulation to the noble lord lord dormand on the maiden speech we have just heard with such interest <e> <s> his long experience of the processes of parliament and passionate concern for society came through unmistakably and must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to confine my contribution to the debate to one point of principle which i believe is the basis of the report of the select committee <e> <s> i am well aware that the whole topic is full of complexities <e> <s> as the first member of the select committee of your lordships house to speak in the debate as well as one of the last to join perhaps i should begin by paying a tribute to the chairman of the committee the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e> <s> he conducted our proceedings with skill fairness courteousness and clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the wish of the house that i should begin by capping what the noble earl lord lytton has just said <e> <s> he spoke to us with an authority and expertise which if i may say so without impertinence belie his years and he combined them with conviction <e> <s> that is surely a combination which we shall look forward to hearing many times in the future <e>", "<cs> i also dare to hope that the minister may come to see if he has not already done so that the bill as it stands without this amendment is a triumph of logic over reality because i do not believe that it will work in its present form <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may press him to say something more about the review <e> <s> i have listened to the whole debate because of the churchs concern for the homeless <e> <s> the problem is a blot on the nation <e> <s> one recollects that only yesterday when we were debating blasphemy we claimed to be a christian nation <e> <s> none of us can be comfortable with the homelessness figures which are not confined to london but are also known in provincial cities <e> <s> they concern us all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the churches welcome this debate this afternoon and hope that it will lead to searching and widespread discussion throughout our society of the issues which are brought before us <e> <s> there is not a vicarage in the land where deep concerns about marriage divorce and the fate of children and young people in our society are not a continuous cause of conversation and indeed of prayer <e>", "<cs> my lords although this debate almost inevitably must break open upon party lines its almost transparently biblical theme of the poor must commend some kind of response from these benches <e> <s> i believe that an expectation has grown up in recent years that the voice from the churches must be confrontational prophetic and denunciatory <e> <s> few of us would deny that that voice has its place <e> <s> prophetic protest against injustice or oppression is too deeply entrenched in the judaic-christian tradition to be outlawed <e> <s> it is accredited both in the old testament prophets and in the words of christ himself <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made several times to the select committee of this house and i have to own that i was a member of it <e> <s> i was glad to sign the report <e> <s> as was rightly said its conclusions were unanimous <e> <s> because i intend to vote in favour of the two amendments in the name of the noble baroness lady cox i shall offer a brief word as to why i shall do so <e>"]
