["<cs> my lords i should like to invite your lordships to consider another context within which your lordships might be prepared to entertain this motion <e> <s> the motion before your lordships and the motion which follows although different in form and different in substance both call in question the proposal to discontinue certain services services which are concerned with the projection of our cultural image overseas and the emphasis on the word cultural i gratefully borrow from the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford <e>", "<cs> my lords the house may feel that there is a certain vice in the drafting of the amendment in terms of there being considerable confusion between entitlement and discretion <e> <s> in view of amendment no <e> <s> which affects clause your lordships may wonder whether it is appropriate to import the question of discretion being satisfied into what would appear to be a question of entitlement <e> <s> the amendment is confused in its drafting and in view of subsequent amendments could give rise to considerable administrative difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor not agree that this majority judgment of the european court of human rights taken as it was on a stale statute which no longer represents our law and taken as it was in relation to a situation where the employers implemented the closed shop practice at the instigation of the union really affords no assistance to our future developing law which in any event surely must have some regard to the situation where certain employers implement the closed shop contrary to the wishes of the trade unions <e> <s> furthermore would my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor not agree that the judgments of this court do not easily adapt into the form of a united kingdom statute <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord elystan-morgan for his most courteous and generous acknowledgment <e> <s> if this amendment is put forward as a vehicle for discussion as i understand that it is it serves a valuable purpose <e> <s> but i respectfully suggest that in its drafting as it is before your lordships it could not really serve a useful purpose because the shoe pinches on article <e>", "<cs> my lords i most respectfully invite your lordships to reject the proposed amendment and very briefly give my reasons <e> <s> under the bill the secretary of state has three types of discretion not the three categories advanced by my noble friend lord colville of culross but i would suggest the following each of which requires separate consideration the first category of discretion is the discretion by which the secretary of state deprives status <e> <s> it is a deprivation of citizenship where <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to express indebtedness to my noble friend lord colville for having raised the amendment <e> <s> however if it were pressed to a division i would urge the house not to support it

judicial review <e> <s> he may well ask and your lordships may well wonder but the minister of state constitutionally is not competent to give that assurance he cannot bind the judiciary as to how they will apply and extend judicial review <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gifford rightly says there lies the nub of the problem <e> <s> there is a problem but the minister of state cannot deal with it here <e> <s> what some of us lawyers think we need is an administrative court where these matters be they of discretion or entitlement may be wholly reviewed on a full rehearing <e> <s> but it is far too great a step i suggest to seek to use this bill as a vehicle for the general legal reform of public administrative law <e> <s> for those reasons i urge the house that if pressed to a division the amendment be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone rising to speak in this important debate would wish to congratulate the noble lord lord wolfenden on this useful comprehensive and very brief report <e> <s> in opening i would wish to associate myself wholly with everything that has been said by my noble friend the duke of portland and the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have misunderstood what the noble lord lord mccarthy said i withdraw my remarks unreservedly <e> <s> it was my understanding of what he said that led me to say what i said <e> <s> but if i am wrong

bicameral system of government <e> <s> whether it happens as it does here by accident of our friends or as it might in other circumstances by design of our enemies it denigrates the system of bicameral government <e> <s> finally may i say that i would have supported this amendment wholeheartedly but for the inclusion of the last few words which for me to adopt would imply a degree of hubris which i am not prepared to indulge in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to detain the house even at this late hour to touch on the passage in the gracious speech which is concerned with the introduction of legislation in the sphere of industrial relations <e> <s> this perhaps envisages that by such legislation the balance will be re-set between the legitimate interests of the trade unions on the one hand and the interests of society as a whole on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is not appropriate that the livelihood of those who work in our shipyards and of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord longford has done your lordships house a considerable service by introducing in his unstarred question this very important subject for debate

of your lordships and i am one although i have only just the privilege of being here must say that i feel it was a pity that it was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> i shall be at pains to seek to convince your lordships by i hope a fair process of reasoning that what the noble earl has said about her majestys judges is wholly irrelevant that it does not serve to clarify the subject and that it does not serve to criticise at root the situation which is surely the wish of all on all sides of the house to examine this problem <e> <s> that the overcrowded state of our prisons has reached the flashpoint of unacceptability is not in issue <e> <s> what is in issue is whether the policy of her majestys government on fair and objective review is open to some of the criticisms which your lordships have made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do pay attention to it <e> <s> in the circumstances although your lordships may see the force of the intervention as i do not and i do pay attention to it i propose to continue <e> <s> what i was about to seek to show was that paying attention to it and accepting it it is wholly irrelevant if this be so if this be right if judges pay attention to it if such is their attitude and if there is the court of appeal as a supervisory and regulating agency to seek to attack the judges because it is an attack without profit and it ends in no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that perhaps the difference to which reference has just been made could be attributed to the remarkable co-operation and help from the trade unions in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord kimberley will forgive a question contrary to the tenor of his question may i ask my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that if the government were to seek to control this practice of glue sniffing young people would only turn to sniffing something else <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also be allowed to associated myself with the expressions of gratitude to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for his speech which concentrated the mind wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with that in due course but briefly i took the figures from another noble lord who spoke <e> <s> the cost as stated in the report itself and i am open to correction because i do not have the paragraph number in mind was million per annum after five years rising to million per annum after years excluding the cost of the civil servants <e> <s> those were the figures i was going to use until i heard the other figures mentioned <e> <s> i based the figures that i would have used of million and million on the basis used in the report and on no other basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged <e> <s> the two figures marry with that qualification <e> <s> the most important reason for not implementing this scheme is not the question of cost to which the noble lord lord diamond just referred which is basically dependent on a political concept as to whether one treats this as a welfare state matter or whether one does not <e> <s> it is this that in view of the intended reforms which have just been announced by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor if one adds to those intended reforms three very simple reforms one has a viable and wholly sufficient alternative <e> <s> there is no necessity whatsoever in these circumstances to enter into this scheme of no-fault road accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i would wholly accept that i do not know that in the years that the committee has been working on this matter they borrowed ideas from the sources that the noble lord lord mishcon has mentioned and others besides <e> <s> i certainly would not on any political plane claim any pride from one party against another <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the introduction of a mandatory remission scheme such as is envisaged by the noble lords

lord lord wilson of langside and <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that it would be wholly premature to seek to set up any inquiry until consideration has been given to the international cartel arrangements to which my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has just said and respectfully ask the government whether they can conceivably think again <e> <s> to substitute the consent of an owner of property for the consent of a sheriff to subrogate individual rights to subrogate what is reasonable for a refusal on the part of an individual for what is considered on the part of an official to he reasonable is not totally novel to the law <e> <s> there are precedents <e> <s> i am not pretending that this is a total departure planning law would indeed afford an example of that but one wonders with respect perhaps your lordships may wonder too whether this is really necessary here in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asked my opinion <e> <s> off-the-cuff lawyers opinions are always notoriously useless but as your lordships have invited me to give my opinion i would say no with respect i do not think it would prejudice the position of the planning authority <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord i think that would he carrying his very good points a little too far <e> <s> but that does not derogate from the force and substance of the main point he made and <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully ask your lordships committee whether your lordships see any advantage or profit in continuing this debate when it is perfectly plain that my noble friend the minister cannot reply on behalf of the government and when it is equally plain that much of what has been said by your lordships is apt to cause most severe misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to your lordships for not having been able to attend the house throughout the whole of this debate <e> <s> secondly would your lordships allow me to express a deep sense of personal deprivation at not being able to hear the maiden speech of the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister confirm that when consideration is given to the genscher colombo proposals by her majestys government this will not import any new legal obligation that adversely affects our fishing interests <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question for clarification <e> <s> with his vast experience of these matters may i ask if it is his view that without clause the same sort of pressures i prefer to use a more neutral term which were exercised in the sasse situation could be exercised again to the detriment of the society <e>", "<cs> my lords this motion which calls upon her majestys government to revoke this regulation will stand in effect on a division as a veto on subordinate legislation <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that in the white paper cmd in it was stated that on subordinate legislation the present power of the house of lords on rejection was inappropriate and unsuited to modern conditions <e> <s> this is the category of subordinate legislation the delegation of power to make regulations which is not subject to either affirmative or negative resolution in parliament <e> <s> this regulation is within the competence of my right honourable friend the home secretary by virtue of the will of parliament <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of correction i am afraid that i was disagreeing if i may say so with respect hook line and sinker with the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i was taking one of the points of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead

house i need no one to defend me <e> <s> the only reason why i did not rise to the bait a little earlier was that i thought it was not worthwhile to do so that we were getting late and i did not wish to indulge in any form of personal exchange or acrimony not because i cannot defend myself but because i preferred not to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that in this instance the act gives rise to a curious and unwelcome consequence for although under section it is a firm of less than six partners that is a firm where the partners say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i invite your lordships to consider very briefly two questions <e> <s> the first is how can regulations provide for an appeal against refusal when first of all the grant is discretionary and secondly when there are

government at any time <e> <s> if so is it such an act as in his judgment warrants the setting up of any inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords if consideration is to be given to this amendment then consideration might also be given to one aspect of damage although of course i take aboard the observations which my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson has just made <e> <s> but your lordships may think that this aspect is rather special rather odd and extremely unsatisfactory <e> <s> it arises in the context of subsection of the proposed new clause which is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that the reference in the question to democratic pretensions really constitutes a form of insult to all members of nato <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise for not having been able to attend at the committee stage <e> <s> this amendment raises the question whether the majority decision in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned

that this is not the appropriate vehicle in which they should be conveyed <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend agree that if for example the secretary of state were to give directions under clause

stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> would he not agree that this problem is basically a matter of municipal law

the last year introduced this type of protection points to the fact that this type of industrial property ought to be protected <e> <s> if he will agree with that would he not consider it appropriate to introduce a short bill on a non-controversial matter or at all events to give some sort of avuncular benign support to the introduction of a private members bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister agree that it is appropriate that the government should take a positive initative not only as regards share option schemes but also as to guidelines for voluntary worker participation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to your lordships house for having arrived late in this important debate <e> <s> i should like to support the spirit of the amendment <e>

hope this is not an irregular intervention <e>", "<cs> with due deference to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones may i briefly at this hour put one or two points for your lordships consideration <e> <s> i do not propose to string them together there is no time <e> <s> if they do not make sense well they do not make sense <e> <s> first guidance has been laid down by the court of appeal quite recently as to the use of partially suspended sentences <e> <s> secondly it has been recently pointed out that this section of the act came into effect only on th march three months ago and your lordships may think that it is a little premature to repeal it in its infancy at this stage <e>", "<cs> i defer of course to the vast experience of the noble lord lord hunt on all matters appertaining to penology and particularly parole <e> <s> but i am a little worried and puzzled because i always understood that it was the function of the courts and judges to decide how each individual offender should be dealt with that it was their responsibility and that parole was based on selection whereas supervised release although the noble lord said that it was not automatic looks according to his subsection as though it is automatic because of the mandatory shall <e> <s> i concede the point that under the three years of subsection there is an element of permissive administration with the agreement of the secretary of state but as i read subsection and i do invite correction if i am wrong it does read as mandatory and automatic <e>", "<cs> was it not i may be wrong about this an option a choice between partially suspended sentences on the one side and supervised release on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords as the originator of this amendment which found scant favour in your lordships house and notwithstanding the fact that it was moved on third reading by my noble friend lord renton i commend ii to your lordships yet again albeit that it comes from another place <e> <s> the reason for commending it is simply this that it is wholly requisite in submission to give legal precision to clause within the general intendment of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister not agree that this form of question with its inbuilt comparison between argentina and angola can serve no useful purpose for two reasons first because the day must come when we must make accommodation with argentina and secondly that to talk of the use of sanctions against a friendly state is contrary to our concept of international law <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend the minister what the objection to this amendment is <e>", "<cs> i was <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he could perhaps think about this amendment <e> <s> i speak on this occasion in practical terms as a recorder <e> <s> is the problem that this could contravene the truck acts <e> <s> is there some legal problem that has inhibited my noble friend from giving free consideration to this <e> <s> because if there is not then it seems to me there is much to be said for it <e>", "<cs> the problem is that not all lawyers judges and recorders know the law <e> <s> off and on as a deputy recorder or recorder i have sat for years and until i heard the committee debate this matter i did not realise that the substance of the amendment was something that happened <e> <s> it has never happened in my court <e> <s> i go along with the <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his open-mindedness on the matter <e>", "<cs> may i support the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> the reason why i cannot support it in its present form is that there are problems which have been mentioned by my noble friend the minister concerning the precise functions of the judge and of the court of appeal <e> <s> i do not want to take time on friday in your lordships house <e> <s> i would most respectfully ask my noble friend whether he would take it back pending further consideration of what the lord chief justice might think by way of guidance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord scanlon speaks of reality <e> <s> one of the great realities which faces us surely is that we require a responsible trade union movement <e> <s> nothing that i should say should be misunderstood and thought to indicate the contrary but and there is a but the reality of the man who joins the union in the circumstances where he cannot earn his livelihood unless he does so and the noble lord lord scanlon then says that there are the rules and constitution and they are complicated but he signs and accepts them is in submission not realistic <e> <s> then one comes further along the line to seize the point of realism <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would give way for a moment with the greatest respect i think that <e>", "<cs> may i to some degree come to the rescue of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e>", "<cs> i understand his concern about the absence of recognition machinery for inter-union disputes <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e> <s> it is in submission a serious defect under our present structure of law and it is something to which i adverted on th june i think it was on second reading <e> <s> so it is not something that i have dreamt up as a salvage operation <e> <s> but this is where we part company <e> <s> the noble lord is confusing the absence of recognition procedure with the subject matter of this amendment and this has made the whole presentation very difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not be <e>", "<cs> may i support the way in which my noble friend lord renton put his observations <e> <s> but there is one other point i would wish to make <e> <s> surely the gravamen of the speech of the noble lord lord wedderburn was really that there was an absence of any form of machinery to grant derogations from the closed shop where both the employer and the employed wished to operate a closed shop and there was no reason in the national interest why it should not be operated <e> <s> i mentioned this on a previous occasion and gave the example of equity there is also the problem of the seamen <e> <s> if at some time the government not necessarily in this bill were to introduce some form of arbitral or quasi-judicial machinery so that the closed shop could be operated where it was in the national interest or where both parties wished to operate it then surely the substance of the noble lord lord wedderburns observations would dissolve <e> <s> therefore his amendment in those circumstances would have no sound basis <e>", "<cs> may i inquire of the noble lord lord jacques whether as a matter of broad principle there is any viable distinction between this amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> which was discussed in your lordships committee yesterday <e> <s> if so what is it <e> <s> furthermore for information because i am ignorant about this is there some feature of the co-operative society that makes it different from the matters that we discussed yesterday <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> it was if i may explain the one which was to delete lines and moved by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will forgive me if i do not follow the noble lord lord wedderburn along the lines of the detailed analysis of the strasbourg judgment <e> <s> i have read with great care the majority judgment and the minority judgment at least half a dozen times and with the utmost respect i do not accept his analysis <e> <s> may i leave it at that <e> <s> it is for noble lords to form their view about it <e> <s> but coming to grips with the amendment the situation surely is that this amendment carries with it the concept that we should outlaw the closed shop as such without qualification <e> <s> if that is the case i wish to say to your lordships that that is and must be a wholly unacceptable suggestion a wholly unacceptable concept <e> <s> although in countries such as germany i understand that the closed shop is outlawed it is a totally different regime <e> <s> in our regime with our history with the way that the trade unions have grown and developed it would be an unwarranted outrage to introduce a provision of this nature <e> <s> that is why i would reject the amendment and would support the views which have been expressed by my noble friend the minister on the front bench <e>", "<cs> surely to accept an amendment along these lines involves entering upon a sort of collision course with the trades union movement and for what conceivable good or purpose <e> <s> why should this be necessary when there is no individual interest that is threatened there is no individual interest that is at stake or that needs protection and when there really is no individual who is put to the hazard of injustice <e> <s> this is merely an attempt to take on the trade unions which is one thing that i as an individual would never support <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern of the noble lord lord spens but i respectfully suggest that if properly observed the provisions of subsection go part of the way but i ask my noble friend the minister do they go all the way <e> <s> is this an area where perhaps consideration should be given to the type of machinery to be adopted <e> <s> that machinery would not be to ensure that one drags in many people so that something is imposed upon the trade unions that would be quite wrong for the reasons that i have already submitted it would be to make certain that the matter is brought to their attention in a proper way <e> <s> i might have misread the provisions but there does not seem to be any machinery in that regard and i wonder whether my noble friend the minister considers the point worthwhile <e>", "<cs> if it is in order to reply in plain language which the noble lord lord mottistone likes to use i would ask with respect to him how can they turn up if they do not know <e> <s> that is the only matter that is concerning me <e> <s> in my submission that is not a matter of nonsense it is a matter of plain justice

<s> it is not really wholly appropriate to do so because this was a situation where there was ballot-rigging and it was dealt with in the high court <e> <s> the purpose of mentioning it was not to cause the noble lord lord wedderburn any particular pain but to point to the fact that this amendment is really totally misconceived that it should never go before an industrial tribunal as a matter of law and that if there is a serious question of impropriety in the taking of the ballot it should go to the high court <e> <s> there is precedent for it and one of the precedents is the etu case and i make no apology for mentioning the fact <e>", "<cs> may i seek to come to grips with lord underhills point <e> <s> there is a distinction between the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal if it is invoked in relation to unfair dismissal and if in that context the question as to whether the ballot was this way or that way arises <e> <s> that is one type of problem <e> <s> the type of problem that i was dealing with has been misunderstood by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> i was dealing with the case which did not necessarily involve unfair dismissal at all but gave rise to the problem of whether this was a rigged ballot <e> <s> in those circumstances it is wholly appropriate that the high court should retain its exclusive jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that categoric and unqualified answer which negatives the rumours that prompted the asking of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister agree that without safeguards and serious study of safeguards this new technique could imperil the dignity of the human race threaten the welfare of children and destroy the sanctity of family life <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord aylestone will forgive me for not having been present as soon as he opened the debate on the amendment <e> <s> i should like to say very briefly that the award proposed in the bill reflects a very special situation in which a man may lose his livelihood in a closed shop situation and in these days of unemployment it may take a considerable time before he finds a suitable livelihood again <e> <s> there are also problems with the union which although it is not strictly within a disciplinary procedure may nonetheless persist and affect the mans right <e> <s> at the bar i know of several cases during the last five years in which a man who has been dismissed in a closed shop situation has not been able to find employment for years and years <e> <s> therefore this is a rather special situation <e> <s> i would for these reasons support the front bench in resisting this amendment and i hope i have given a reasoned objection in support of doing so <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord lord underhill as one who longs to see established i believe one would say re-establish a strong virile trade union movement which was responsible and had effective control <e> <s> but perhaps i would part company with him on this aspect i would submit that the liberty for non-trade unionists which we are seeking to provide in this bill will strengthen the trades union movement rather than weaken it <e> <s> one cannot be dogmatic because who can tell <e> <s> all one can do is to have regard to the problem without passion and in a constructive way the approach which the noble lord lord underhill always adopts <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e>

concept and turn it on its head <e> <s> so many of the propositions of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton and i say this with respect have just been turned on their head <e> <s> it is a fantastic conceit and a fantastic conception that this clause is some kind of trap to ensnare district auditors or to disadvantage labour councillors <e> <s> it is a ridiculous concept because the issue is plainly a simple political issue <e> <s> it is much broader than district auditors or labour councillors <e> <s> the issue is simply are we to adopt the concept of individual freedom that

association and all that that entails which is envisaged in this bill <e> <s> indeed the activities that gave rise to this amendment only highlight the problem that there is now as i stated before no recognition machinery to obviate poaching or to deal with inter-union disputes which adversely affect those with no interest in the dispute <e> <s> by and large the bill does not purport to deal with the internal affairs of trades unions and how it can be stated that this amendment is immoral and objectionable when all that it seeks to do is to obviate abuse wholly defeats me <e>", "<cs> i would

involvement in this indeed there have on occasions in the past been cases where the noble lord lord wedderburn and i have been on opposite sides say that i agree that he has drafted this provision amendment no <e> <s> with very great care <e> <s> i also agree that the interlocutory injunction in a trade union case is within a special category <e> <s> but where i do not agree and this is where the rub lies is that the main purpose of clause of the bill is to be able to give the court jurisdiction to do this very thing rather than to award damages in other words to be able to move in quickly and regulate a problem a trouble as it does in other spheres before the whole thing gets out of hand and vast damage is caused <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly return to the serious matter of this amendment and try to meet it with reason rather than polemics <e> <s> in particular may i try to meet the point raised by the noble lord lord underhill in deference to the great regard that i hold for him <e> <s> with respect i think the problem is really this <e> <s> i know it is not intended to but this amendment will in fact only add confusion because if brother jones from swindon writes a letter to the executive committee how does he prove that the executive committee have ever received it by way of notification <e> <s> and you are back where you started from <e> <s> it does not really help and i think that that is the problem <e> <s> i know it was not intended as an obstructive amendment but on an objective analysis i hope that the committee will agree it does not really matter

three reasons <e> <s> the first is the one put forward by the noble lord lord aylestone that is that it sets up the secretary of state as an arbiter as to whether or not a ballot should be held a decision which is not subject to any control any judicial review and which frankly brings the government into direct conflict with the trade union movement and in my submission is wholly inappropriate

the benches opposite should accept that ever since the decision in <e>", "<cs> i raised this matter at second reading <e> <s> it is a technical matter <e> <s> the object of this amendment is to ensure

it <e> <s> there is a gap in the legislation and i was hoping that perhaps my noble friend the minister might consider including this matter on his agenda for consultation <e> <s> the approach in the drafting of this clause is not to be recommended as again it is almost too draconian <e> <s> but the approach advocated by the noble lord lord rochester is a wholly constructive and useful approach and one that should be considered with care <e>", "<cs> i share the enthusiasm of the noble lord lord rochester and the misgivings of my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> voluntary worker participation must be the order of the day but what positive initiative can the government produce <e> <s> i should be most interested to hear anything in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister agree in the context of this statement that a limit should be set on so-called sympathetic action especially in the state-controlled sector where there is no identity of interest with the trade dispute and where the apparent purpose of such action is to bring pressure to bear on the government <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether it is the legitimate business of the miners union to support this strike or the aslef strike by picketing and the provision of substantial donations <e> <s> and is this support lawful under the existing law or even constitutional within the rule books <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word in favour of this amendment and may i apologise for not having been able to be present when this part of the debate was initiated because i was in the temple <e> <s> of course there is no easy answer especially for those who have the job of sentencing <e> <s> this was not made any easier by dr beeching who having been let loose on the railways and wrecked them then was then let loose on my profession and did his best to wreck that and certainly destroyed the sense of involvement between the old recorders and following up their sentencing policies which in the days when i first sat some years ago we always did <e> <s> now we sit anywhere <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness my lords <e> <s> of course i agree i agree that there are circumstances where the evidence is overwhelming and therefore the experiment should not be indulged in <e> <s> i am trying to follow the intellectual analysis by which the noble baroness put her case that this experiment which is what it is is unworkable <e> <s> in doing that i do not want to be side-tracked on to the path of my noble friend lady faithfull because i do not accept her approach on this matter at all <e> <s> the fact that we happen to sit on the same side of the house does not mean that i from my experience or from the process of reasoning i have adopted adopt what she has said at all <e> <s> to deal with the intellectual analysis of the noble baroness which was tight and is something with which one ought to deal because it is a question of reasoning

judge is usually the only other viable option <e>", "<cs> my lords surely your lordships would not wish to legislate on the basis that it does no harm <e> <s> surely the whole concept of legislation is that it should seek to do some positive good <e> <s> if it is superfluous with the greatest of respect and even at this hour of night ought it not to be left out <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene but i feel that my noble friend on the front bench may truly have been misled by his department <e> <s> it is a most important matter this review of young people and i do not know how one can get to million from what i understand of it <e> <s> i believe that a mistake has ensued and if a mistake has been made it would be wrong to allow this matter to stand <e> <s> if a mistake has not been made and instead i am mistaken then i will withdraw my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to support this amendment <e> <s> i did so at committee stage <e> <s> i do so again <e> <s> everything that has been said by the noble lord lord hutchinson with meticulous clarity as one would expect with a background of vast practical knowledge is wholly justified wholly accurate and wholly true <e> <s> indeed it has been supported by the noble lord lord wigoder who also has considerable practical knowledge in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer the noble baroness lady phillips a possible explanation <e> <s> it is not so much the gravity or nature of the offence but the fact that the sort of problem which could arise is this you are sitting trying a case with a jury and you

northern ireland <e> <s> there is no evidence that it is acceptable to the judiciary and i rather decline to entertain the notion that even if it were not acceptable to the judiciary this would in any way be reflected in sentencing because i do not think that it would <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say one word in opposition to this amendment <e> <s> again your lordships are faced with a problem of overcrowding in prisons so your lordships are invited to endorse this innovative experiment which puts far too great a degree of discretion in the power of the police <e> <s> it is in my submission something which should not be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully alive to the system that is operated at the moment where there is a degree of discretion in the police which to the general satisfaction of everyone so far as i am aware operates and is accepted publicly <e> <s> if the purpose of this amendment is to achieve anything further it is objectionable for the reasons that i have given <e> <s> if it is merely to state in this form what in practice happens already it is otiose and irrelevant to the problem of overcrowding the prisons <e> <s> there is in my submission absolutely no merit in this proposal at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that under existing law it is open to the pickets to contend that they are entitled in support of their own pay claim not only to interfere with the due performance of the contracts for the supply of medical materials but also to seek to secure that persons do not deliver these supplies <e> <s> in that situation would my noble friend the minister not agree that where human life human suffering and human wellbeing are put in hazard there is a case for a revision of the law in this particular regard <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the practical and effective decision is taken in the street at the gates by the pickets <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few brief words in opposition to the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury who has vast experience in these matters at once recognises the problems of mandatory bail in the circumstances related to the gentleman to whom he referred <e> <s> if he is allowed free he tends to be difficult to find much to the expense and inconvenience of the executive <e> <s> the noble lord also very fairly recognised that the effect of the run of the decisions of the courts is that the illegal entrant in effect has no rights <e> <s> in these circumstances is not the balance about right and ought not the amendment to be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i with respect ask him a question <e> <s> he poured scorn on patriotism <e> <s> does he not believe in patriotism and if he does not how can he say as he has said in your lordships house that he speaks for the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the spirit of this amendment which seeks to introduce this concept of worker participation a peculiarly english concept of consultation before decision making and a measure of participation in profits <e> <s> the distinction between this concept and other concepts is of importance because of the obligations arising by virtue of united kingdom accession of the common market <e> <s> i refer to worker participation in the sense of worker representation which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has touched upon <e> <s> there are two types your lordships will appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords at second reading i mentioned this problem that is being raised by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and as i remember i mentioned it in relation to equity being wholly ignorant of his vast experience and identity with equity <e> <s> again if i remember aright my noble friend lord mottistone mentioned the question of shipping in this context <e> <s> i am not going to take up your lordships time but is it not right that there are certain situations where derogations might have to be granted in the interests of fairness and practica <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to say a word in opposition to this amendment <e> <s> let us assume that there is a common element in deterrence <e> <s> let us assume that there is a common element in what the noble baroness lady seear referred to as the breach of law clement <e> <s> but superimposed on this there is something which is not a common element <e> <s> the reason for this distinction is that in these days it is difficult to find employment and that the loss of employment which arises from this situation can cause very substantial damage to the workman <e> <s> it is not only difficult to prove through the ordinary judicial process of the courts but often in practice it involves a delay of some two to three years as i know having appeared in the high court for workmen in such circumstances <e> <s> with the utmost respect to the noble lords opposite there is a real distinction <e> <s> it is therefore wrong to equate all this as though it were covered totally by a common element <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i see the problem raised by the noble lord opposite but persons adversely affected questions of causation and questions of remoteness of damage really and truly belie exact definition and any attempt to do so could only add a wholly unworkable provision <e> <s> all that one can do within this sphere is to take aboard the case law in the three aspects of this problem that exist and allow the tribunal to adjudicate accordingly <e> <s> there is no way that this can be improved by definition <e> <s> one of the problems of law is seeking to over-define and in submission there really is no advantage in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it in order on a point of clarification to ask the help of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton as to whether in a sense he is taking the same point as arises on amendments nos <e> <s> a and b in part <e> <s> if that is so is it fundamental to his thinking that we must seek to put aside the distinction between a contract for services the self-employed and a contract of service as employee <e> <s> if that be his fundamental thinking where does it take us in practice <e> <s> does it take us to the point again i am seeking help of derogations in the public interest of some general kind rather than relying on the technical distinction <e> <s> i do not know whether i have made myself plain <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of principle i oppose this amendment <e> <s> the introduction of pre-strike ballots may well appear to have some democratic appeal but on examination it is i would suggest for the very brief reasons that i propose to give superficial and wholly meretricious because at this stage of our social evolution as an industrialised society any adoption of this concept would tend to debilitate our efforts towards a national economic recovery rather than to sustain it <e> <s> why <e> <s> because if one acknowledges the need for a strong vital responsible trade union movement as i do as part of the essential machinery of collective bargaining then is it not necessary also to uphold the authority to uphold the dignity of the executive of the trade union over its membership <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment widens as it is intended to do the nature of the primary dispute which has a very important bearing on the area of the secondary action under section of the act <e> <s> that is the intention of the amendment <e> <s> it is all very well to talk about will-o-the-wisp logic but the logic of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton has been wholly consistent in seeking to widen and widen and widen this as i have said before since <e> <s> with respect to him it just will not do to talk about shallow legal analysis <e> <s> this cannot be right <e> <s> saying that something cannot be right does not mean that it cannot be right <e> <s> as we see it it is wholly within the logic and the purpose of this bill and it is wholly right that the bill should remain as it is unamended <e>", "<cs> my lords coming to the substance very briefly ships are laid up all over the world

in error <e> <s> i question him with great respect <e> <s> surely flags of convenience disputes are not lawful in most other countries and exceptionally are lawful here <e> <s> of course if i am wrong

the leave of your lordships to seek to explain some of the misapprehensions with which it has been entertained so far in certain quarters in your lordships house <e> <s> i am extremely disappointed that the noble lord lord rochester should distance himself so far from the intentions and the spirit of these proposals <e> <s> i fear that perhaps it is because he does not truly understand what they aim to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister allow me to interupt him i will take no time merely to say most respectfully that i do dissent <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank all your lordships who have been good enough to contribute to this debate not so much those who have supported me but those curiously enough who have opposed me because it has made this a constructive occasion when the views of everybody interested and concerned may be aired <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support what the noble and learned lord lord elton has just said <e> <s> it is of very great importance and really requires no emphasis from me <e> <s> as it is so important perhaps the more people who speak on it the better but i shall not repeat what the noble and learned lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to detain your lordships briefly to speak against the amendment <e> <s> i agree that the amendment could serve a useful purpose if the proposals which it embodies as regards the setting up of a committee with an independent member could be embodied by the secretary of state in the implementing regulations within section <e>", "<cs> my lords having supported this amendment may i be allowed to add my congratulations on the way in which this has been brought forward and my total dissent from everything that the noble lord lord hutchinson has said about the approach to bail because i happen to take a different approach <e> <s> but that is by the way <e> <s> the point is that the government have met the spirit of the amendment which was proposed and this does not bring with it the dispute that arises as to the correct approach to bail <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose this amendment on its merits and not for most of the reasons advocated by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> if at this stage of the parliamentary process this bill were to move ahead of its base founded upon current attitude

difficult to follow the reasoning of the noble lord lord wedderburn and if i err in my appreciation of his approach i hope he will forgive me <e> <s> i have tried to take it in stages in an effort to understand what lies behind the amendment <e> <s> first though of course i am open to correction it seems that the amendment assumes a legal obligation to consult representatives and trade unions <e>

for the reasons that i have so far given i must say that i am not able to understand what constructive purpose the amendment serves <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment <e> <s> it is basically related to the tailpiece <e> <s> your lordships see the form in which it lies <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill is much to be welcomed not only for the opportunity that it has given for constructive and good-natured debate but also for affording an important contribution to the declared policy of the government which was and is the gradual reintroduction of the rule of law in substitution for the misrule of so-called self-regulation <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of putney speaks of consensus i speak to him of consensus <e> <s> that was the will of the electorate <e> <s> the bill is a constructive step in a gradual process to be seen one day in context with the first step taken in and with the next step which lies ahead of us <e> <s> it is not irrelevant to speculate that if the bill were a boundary stone setting the limit of legislation instead of a stepping stone our commitment to the electorate could never be honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords i came to this debate with an entirely open mind and it is still pretty well open <e> <s> on balance i wish to support this amendment for these reasons <e> <s> it is vital to reduce the work load on magistrates courts <e> <s> secondly the proposer of this amendment has vast practical experience and speaks on behalf of the association which has the pre-eminent right to be heard in these matters <e> <s> the argument between two and three points would in submission constitute an increase in the burden of that workload which on balance would not be justifiable <e> <s> agreed fixed penalties are generally unacceptable but there is a points system for these penalties and we are saddled with it <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect this could in special circumstances work an injustice <e> <s> with the greatest respect i would hope that these special circumstances might be taken into account when the regulations are made in due course

consideration is to be given to other measures to be laid referred to in the gracious speech in the field of industrial relations may i ask my noble friend the minister four questions arising outside the ambit of the existing legal framework rather in the vein proposed by my noble friend lord cockfield in the pursuit of new ideas <e> <s> the first is this <e> <s> should there be mandatory negotiations before any recommendation for collective industrial action qualifies for statutory immunity <e> <s> should employees in the public sector with pensionable employment be required to accept a no-strike clause in exchange for arbitral machinery <e> <s> and if so should this concept be extended to other categories of employees in the public sector <e> <s> should we have a safeguard to prevent misuse of trade union funds to subvent industrial action either proposed or taken contrary to the wishes of the majority of the members <e> <s> furthermore and i am afraid that this is one of my old chestnuts but it will take only one second to say it should we set up machinery for the resolution of inter-union disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the trade

chancellor in what he has just said not the last matter but the one before it where joining hands with my noble friend lady lane-fox he elevated this debate to another plane a plane to which this debate in truth was not intended to go <e> <s> here was the way in which i hope it was legitimate to do so i sought to limit this debate to a situation where brain damage was occasioned by a certain

in a recent debate was that we should seek to improve the quality of statute law and to render it readily and plainly enforceable <e>", "<cs> i put aside for a moment any shift of power and come to the question of definition and the fears of the secretary of state having too great a power <e> <s> briefly if one defines benefits along the lines of the amendment one would not be assisted in being able to challenge a decision of the secretary of state for arriving at an unfair decision in a matter of public administration <e> <s> indeed going further i would say that there is the general judicial review machinery which is developing and which has operated successfully since as long ago as under the thameside case <e> <s> such machinery is developing the whole time <e> <s> under the bill as it stands there is machinery by which if the secretary of state were to act unfairly or irresponsibly unmindful of his duties he could by way of judicial review be brought to account for an unreasonable decision <e> <s> unless it be thought that by having made those very brief observations i am not in favour of the general spirit of the bill i would say that i am but i was not addressing your lordships committee on that point <e>", "<cs> i agree that there is a difference of opinion between my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and me <e> <s> i do not take that view with respect <e> <s>

of this clause and could operate in favour of the liberty of the subject <e> <s> i merely ask my noble friend if he could possibly keep an open mind and at least consider that aspect <e>", "<cs> as i

protection of consumers <e>", "<cs> surely we must all be in agreement that one day and one day one hopes soon there must be a new approach to the bus/rail integration problem and that this will involve central financing and indeed central control <e> <s> but surely this veto at this stage in the hands of this committee and as proposed in this amendment could well stultify that long-term approach <e> <s> although this in submission is valuable thinking contributed by the noble lord lord underhill in these amendments surely with respect at this stage it is premature <e>", "<cs> as i understand it clause as drafted is a requisite part of the machinery of control of local authorities in the sphere of transport that is if one accepts the general principle of the bill <e> <s> of course if one does not then one does not and one would not support the amendment all the way along the line for the reasons advocated cogently by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the amendment would substantially weaken the concept if one examines the matter objectively and for that reason supporting the principle of the bill i am driven to oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> since the bill is to have further stages may i respectfully suggest that the intervention of the noble lord lord mishcon might perhaps and i say this with respect have been taken a little more seriously <e> <s> he was not playing with words <e> <s> i agree that as used in this context the word requires is probably very much the same as the word requests but neither of those terms is an invitation to dance each is a command to dance <e>", "<cs> i support wholly without qualification the idea behind the amendment as expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i agree that perhaps the amendment as drafted does not give effect to the concept which the noble lord has advocated and which as a matter of broad principle i am bound to support <e> <s> if the executive demands that something must be done which is going to cost money it is manifestly unfair as i see it that this should be taken into account for the purpose of fixing the grant <e> <s> i beg my noble friend the minister to have regard to the broad merits of this plea since it is one which if not met could perhaps give rise to a feeling of slight oppression <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully beg my noble friend to take this away and reconsider it to receive representations with an open mind and to take a little more time on this one <e>", "<cs> may i say a brief word in opposition to this amendment <e> <s> clause must be read as a whole albeit that we are only dealing with subsection of it <e> <s> private contracting surely must now have its part to play in the new transport system <e> <s> i agree that this is a politically sensitive issue but i have no doubt that the view reflected in this clause is right <e> <s> naturally noble lords opposite may take a different view but it is essentially one of political judgment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for clarification whether he is saying that as a matter of construction of the act as a whole it is the latter interpretation <e> <s> if he is i think that i agree with him that is the interpretation that it lies within the secretary of states remit rather than exclusively within the executives <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e>", "<cs> i suggest that there is a sane practical reason for the inclusion of amendment no <e> <s> to which other noble lords have spoken <e> <s> its inclusion does no violence to the spirit of any principle in the bill <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> i should have thought with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord underhill that it really adds nothing to the bill and i would oppose it because it would not be appropriate

avoid repetition the role of private contracting must be recognised <e> <s> briefly in reply to the noble lord lord tordoff why should he fear that this would not be done fairly that <e>", "<cs> yes the expenditure is lawful within the limits but there is a query as to whether it is unlawful outside the limits <e> <s> however that is the whole concept of the bill <e> <s> that is the principle and in order to achieve it there must be the requisite control under the bill <e> <s> as we see it that involves a clarification of the law and in order to achieve that clarification we must use this bill not another act <e> <s> that is in essence the structure right or wrong <e> <s> i submit that it is right <e>", "<cs> having had the advantage of listening to most of what has been said on this clause

ambit generally <e> <s> without wishing to take time on this occasion i remain unconvinced <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in opposition in particular to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but

constructive one but the obligation is put on the national bus company which i would have thought in this context was the wrong way around <e> <s> i would have been happier to impose an obligation upon the executive to obtain such information as it needs from the national bus company and not impose a direct obligation on the national bus company <e> <s> if this makes sense to any of your lordships i wonder whether further consideration might be given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords in opposing this amendment it would be wholly inappropriate to seek to repeat the reasons for opposition

achieve to enable the unemployed to lead an ordinary sort of life and the question of risking a few more pounds to provide the unemployed with money to search for work which is the principle to which i have said over and over again that i adhere <e> <s> does the noble lord appreciate the difference <e>", "<cs> perhaps your lordships will permit me to say that this problem exists on this side of

of course read them in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to say very briefly that this amendment inspired by my noble friend lord drumalbyn is highly important and wholly apt because it

in submission greatly to be welcomed and my noble friend is also greatly to be congratulated <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment because under clause of the bill it appears that proposed

analysis this amendment falls into two parts <e> <s> the first part is paragraphs and of schedule to the act which is applicable only to gaming machines as defined under that act and do not extend to include amusement machines as defined under the bill <e> <s> these paragraphs make provision for a hearing notice of decision grounds of decision to be given to the applicant <e> <s> the spirit of this part of the amendment of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs is wholly subsumed and indeed extended by an amendment that i propose to move no <e> <s> which provides for hearing and a reasoned decision <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not accept if my noble friend will forgive me that the fears he has expressed could have materialised <e> <s> but there are certainly other reasons why clarification is requisite <e> <s> as what one says goes on record i do not want to accept the way in which my noble friend has put it <e> <s> the plain fact is that this amendment appears to be acceptable by way of clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful again to all noble lords <e> <s> dealing directly with the point made by the noble lord lord carmichael the problem is really this <e> <s> if i can state the problem in plain english then the drafting may fall into place <e> <s> the problem is that there may be a fish fryer somewhere in balham who has one of these machines and yet under the bill as it is drafted without these amendments the local authority because a machine is on his premises is entitled to regulate his opening hours <e> <s> that appears to be oppressive and therefore to try to cope with what could be an oppression i have sought to restrict the jurisdiction of the local authority to imposing conditions only when a machine is in an operable state <e>

amendments nos <e> <s> and i shall not be in a position to accept amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i am unable to accept this amendment as it stands <e> <s> i am unable to do so first because of the inclusion in it of the extension of premises and the concept of user to which i have already spoken and which permeates through to this clause <e> <s> secondly it does water down if the noble baroness will keep these most respectful criticisms in mind with a view to producing a new amendment at third reading the concept of reasonable excuse <e> <s> this point

because of the faith that i have in his judgment but because of the respect that i have for his knowledge of this subject <e> <s> i also have faith in the judgment of all other noble lords who have set their names to this paper <e> <s> this is an operational matter of constitutional importance upon which not only for the reasons given by the noble and learned lord lord denning but also for the reasons given by my noble friend lord elton surely it is proper to rely upon ministerial assurances in this exceptional instance both as regards the issue of circulars and as to the system of monitoring <e> <s> why <e> <s> because it is operational because the circumstances are wholly exceptional because it is concerned with security because mens lives are at stake <e> <s> in this context the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon and i do not see it from his point of view was made very well but there is the obverse of the coin <e> <s> it goes both ways does it not <e> <s> for those short reasons i would oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the position my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has opened this question for objective discussion and these amendments relate to the exercise of administrative powers by the director under clause to deal with likely contraventions and to secure compliance with licence conditions according to the procedure laid down under clause <e> <s> again the question arises as to whether the rigidity of the drafting structure of this bill is apt to afford fair play according to the principles of natural justice <e>

to maintain and promote free and fair compatible opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also briefly support the general spirit of this amendment <e> <s> may i ask my noble and learned friend whether he can confirm to the house that there is in the bill no obligation whatever to work the licence and no machinery for revocation if it is not worked <e> <s> if that were so surely in the public interest it would require looking at <e>", "<cs> i also hope that your lordships will not accept this amendment <e> <s> the structure referred to in clause of the bill can only refer to a structure in which a person has his home or living accommodation under clause <e> <s> a building in the course of construction already falls within the provisions of the bill if someone is living in it <e> <s> but the amendment proposes to include buildings in the course of construction in which no one lives a point made already by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> in the interests only of clarification may i say that it seems that we are in danger of confusing the civil law of trespass with the proposed criminal entry under clause of this bill <e> <s> if there is an unlawful entry prohibited by clause of this bill then i do not understand what useful purpose could be served by adding the qualification remaining <e> <s> if on the other hand and i speak with due deference because i speak in the presence of lawyers more distinguished than i am the entry was lawful under clause then remaining there could be made a criminal offence by extending expressly the provisions of this bill <e> <s> but the question is ought we to import into the criminal law which is what is proposed any such extension <e>", "<cs> yes i appreciate that my noble friend lord renton referred to amending clause and i am concerned only with and i can see every justification for that and i hope that my noble friend lord elton might be able to pass a provisional view on that <e> <s> but outside that ambit i cannot quite see perhaps for want of understanding why there should be any further amendment <e>", "<cs> surely the amendment seeks to afford statutory recognition of the medieval practice of sanctuary by grasping the cathedral door knocker <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly may i thank my noble friend the minister for such measure of flexibility as he was able to afford having regard to the rigidity of the drafting structure of the bill <e> <s> may i also thank him for his free dispensation of indulgences for those afflicted with spasms of heresy and to welcome the spirit of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the amendment to which i have just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i now beg to move the privilege amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i

baroness has <e>", "<cs> my lords with deference to those of your lordships who oppose the principle of this bill and in particular to those with years of experience in the affairs of local government

surely no doubt the exposition by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on the constitutional position the overall economic policy and the business wastelands devastated by high rates met another <e>

does not arise until a conclusion has been reached as a matter of administrative discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lords lord mishcon and lord avebury surely it is not really a case of just filling the gap with something to add <e> <s> the question is whether the principle is broadly correct <e> <s> i am not trying to pick at the drafting i take the point made by the noble lord lord avebury but i am trying to deal with the broad question on its merits irrespective <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> it is surely somewhat repugnant to carry

it is of consequence to the due administration of justice that persons who have committed crimes of sufficient gravity not to warrant a fine or a discharge should not man juries within years of the commission of such offences <e> <s> the quality of disposal as between youth custody as it is now or borstal as it was detention suspended sentence and the community service order as such affords no

noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> i oppose the amendment <e> <s> surely a crime of sufficient minimal gravity which warrants probation in all the circumstances should exclude people from jury service for five years <e> <s> i take the point of the noble lord lord mishcon that there is a problem with the young on the commission of the trivial offence <e> <s> but probation is also awarded for

fundamental distrust in the trade union movement as a whole <e>", "<cs> that is what it comes to <e> <s> it is a fundamental declaration of mistrust that the trade union movement is able to order the management of its own internal affairs on balloting <e> <s> and would your lordships not also consider that the backlash of justifiable resentment to such an over-interventionist approach would not

amendment <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord lord wigoder says that disposal affords no certain yardstick to the gravity of the offence especially as regards probation where the range of gravity of the offences for which it is imposed is so wide <e> <s> the range extends from the most serious offence so serious that it would be common ground that in the circumstances the disqualification should run to the relatively slight offence committed by the man who is given the chance to whom the noble lord lord mishcon referred <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a very short question <e> <s> in view of the criticism that he has again given of the way in which our courts exercise their discretion in trade union cases would he agree on reconsideration that the taff vale case has nothing to do with the exercise of discretion <e> <s> it was a decision made in law which the house of lords appellate committee held was right but with which statute disagreed and held as wrong <e> <s> does he agree that that had nothing to do with the exercise of discretion <e> <s> would he agree that by and large the high court in this country has exercised its discretion in these affairs objectively fairly constructively and in the interests of the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> surely this amendment means that clause as it stands might require some modification in the light of the postal ballots amendment <e> <s> the effect of clause as it stands is to oust the incidence of section of the act of if industrial action is endorsed by a trade union without <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn asked what contribution this clause will make to industrial relations <e> <s> it will make a very substantial contribution <e> <s> it affords a democratic right to trade union members which the majority of the rank and file wish to have to have a voice heard and a will heeded in the taking of industrial action <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn says that this has nothing to do with the solution of industrial disputes <e> <s> that surely cannot be so because the result of a ballot as so often seems to be forgotten can be used to negotiate a settlement at the discretion of the trade union official rather than to call for industrial action <e> <s> broadly speaking this clause serves a useful constructive and valid purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the logic of the analogy with the lawnmower as referred to by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> if i want to borrow a lawnmower from a skinflint neighbour who happens to like

elton for having an open mind which i also do wholeheartedly or to pay tribute to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor but to point out that in the course of this debate a certain injustice was exposed but the view was taken by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that it ought not to be dealt with in this bill <e> <s> in deference to that view the matter was not pursued

seeks advice i always thought that that would lie within the province of the law officers who advise the house objectively without wearing the hat of whichever party it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords

problems <e> <s> one can only make ones speech at this stage one cannot debate one cannot examine one cannot discuss <e> <s> indeed i rose a moment ago to disagree with the noble lord lord henderson of brompton in his approach that it was offensive and invidious to put the mentally handicapped in a category different from the physically handicapped <e> <s> these are matters one would wish to discuss if it is necessary to discuss them <e> <s> at this stage of the bill having listened to what has been said it surely would not be appropriate without further examination of these matters to

ordinary lawyer i considered to be very unsatisfactory <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take this on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how this arises <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael puts this forward as a probing amendment to ascertain the intentions of the government <e> <s> it is now suggested that the government should accept it <e> <s> the position of students has been dealt with by taking a median line between exemption and rebate in clause by a government amendment which was accepted <e> <s> it is not understood quite why having listened to noble lords this

on the four issues with which i was concerned <e> <s> they were the extension of the scope of clause to include the mentally handicapped the question of the vulnerable groups which lack ability to pay under clause on which we had my noble friends assurance the special position of the students to which reference has just been made and lastly the amendment to clause which includes the principles

question of misleading the carriers <e> <s> as the minister said at committee stage the carrier can refuse to pay <e> <s> if he refuses to pay the secretary of state must prove the contravention in

quite contrary to practice because it substitutes the discretion of a tribunal for the discretion of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords surely this is not an emergency measure as that is ordinarily understood <e> <s> it is a permanent component part of our immigration control <e> <s> as i understand it the intention is that this pattern of bill will be accepted throughout europe on a recriprocal basis <e> <s> in these circumstances the amendment surely would not be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wish to endorse what the noble and learned lord lord denning said <e> <s>

it really lies within the remit of the director general of fair trading to monitor the operation generally of the code and that unless and until he reports adversely the matter does not lie within the province of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to introduce a new topic into your lordships discussions and to go down another road for as yet in this important and highly informed debate on economic affairs your lordships have considered aspects of the inter-action between wealth creation and employment at both international and national levels <e> <s> one of the factors not the only one but an important one affecting both wealth creation and employment at national level in our own back yard is the essential contribution which the trades unions have to make to the economy <e>",

<e> <s> how do i justify <e> <s> i justify because of the history of massive abuse of power <e> <s> that charge has not been answered in your lordships house tonight <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak <e> <s> but there is a perfectly valid reason why this amendment should not be included in the bill in its present form <e> <s> in fact there are two reasons <e> <s> first this type of provision for the disabled in other transport acts has been made by way of a code of practice introduced into the bill to give such effect as is thought right <e> <s> the second reason concerns the intention about no passengers or goods being carried <e> <s> why should goods not be carried if proper provision is not made for disabled persons <e> <s> i suggest that in the form in which it is drafted the whole concept is inappropriate for inclusion in the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the question through the usual channels will my noble friend use his good offices to ensure that when this review which on all sides of the house is considered important and which has been on the stocks since the days when my noble friend lord cockfield answered from the dispatch box is published we can have a full days debate on it <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that new hospitals cannot operate without adequate nursing staff will my noble friend the minister agree in view of the speeches made by my noble friend lady cox that it is most unlikely that the government would ignore that aspect of hospitalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask your lordships to be good enough to accept my apology for not being in my place for the opening speeches <e> <s> i shall of course read in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps your lordships will allow me to say a few words <e> <s> i think that on one aspect quite inadvertently the noble lord was not quite fair to the noble and learned lord lord ackner who is not in his place <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord ackner suggested only that if the judge wanted assistance he might ask counsel to provide him with a reference to the guidelines <e> <s> he went no further than that <e> <s> in case the noble lord lord mishcon thought that he went further in fairness to the noble and learned lord i thought it was right for me to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister agree in view of the projected legislation that even with counsel there is scant hope of improvement in the quality of bills when introduced there is scant hope of avoiding that series of government amendments which have bedevilled so many of the bills and there is scant hope of easing the burdens of your lordships revisory role <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister accept that he is not answering for private industry but is answering a question in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> surely there is a need to look at this matter because there is a presumption that if different words are used the legislature means something different <e> <s> it is extremely difficult to understand what the difference would be between the facts on which a return is granted and the evidence on which the return is grounded <e> <s> if there is a difference then of course i accept that and also that my intervention is out of place <e> <s> but if there is really no difference then surely there is something to be said for the observations made by the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> very briefly i oppose this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord appreciates extradition is based on reciprocity <e> <s> reciprocity in this relevant context is based upon the convention <e> <s> it is true as the noble lords says that this involves very serious changes in our extradition law but surely this is the same theme more or less as that which runs through amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson said roundly that the signatory states i assume it is the signatory states who have ratified the convention do not extradite their own nationals <e>", "<cs> yes but the noble lord will appreciate not in context with the implementation of this convention <e> <s> this is the very reason that my noble friend the minister has said that this is causing such enormous practical difficulties because in a sense forget about black sheep we are the odd man out <e>", "<cs> let me say briefly because i have said in substance on another amendment everything i wish to say that i oppose the amendment <e> <s> in doing so i say at once that everything said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is wholly well-founded on the assumption of course that it is the court that has to continue to consider whether the evidence would be sufficient <e> <s> that is wholly well-founded and i take the point that it may well appear to be a retrogressive step <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with his most helpful interruption at a later stage because i am seeking to save time <e> <s> i am trying to deal with the nub of the argument as advanced and i accept that there are two points of view <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord who raises a very important point <e> <s> there is no provision in the bill as i see it but it is wholly implicit as i understand the law of judicial review that if the home secretary were to decide to make an order an order considering what evidence before him is sufficient to warrant the trial of an arrested person and he makes that decision without allowing due representations to be made how could it be said in the divisional court that he had complied with the requirements of natural justice <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain to the house what are these chlorofluorocarbons and who produces them <e>", "<cs> in practical terms surely the noble lord is right <e> <s> there is really no practical difference in the end between the proposals of my noble friend the minister which rest upon the permissive may make such provision and his undertaking to include in that the concept of legal representation and the question of the right to cross-examine and the concept of the amendment of the noble lord lord hutchinson which incorporates precisely the same concept <e> <s> at the end of the road it is merely a matter of wording <e> <s> in principle both amendments arrive at the same result <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will accept the amendment which is for clarification <e> <s> the word video could give rise to difficulties of interpretation <e> <s> it might be argued for example that it related only to a tape or some such thing <e> <s> this is in line with introducing the other series of amendments which i shall support <e>", "<cs> this should be twofold the tape and the transcript so far as anything is said <e> <s> so long as you have those two safeguards then this is clearly entirely proper <e>", "<cs> may i seek a measure of clarification from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i find the drafting although i accept the spirit of it extremely difficult <e> <s> i may be wrong and i seek his correction if i am <e> <s> one can take it quite shortly

take further advice and that the matter should be put right without necessitating a formal amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord misunderstands me <e> <s> i was not referring to that in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> or <e> <s> i was only asking for consideration to be given to the situation which would produce this which was the law of the state of colorado <e>", "<cs> i have supported the principle of this series of government amendments for a long time <e> <s> the first time was in this chamber on the prosecution of offences bill where we divided against clause and defeated the government <e> <s> in committee first time around i tabled clause and second time around i tabled amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that appeared in the first marshalled list but has been withdrawn in favour of the governments amendments <e>", "<cs> very briefly i support the bill as it is drafted <e> <s> i want to take only one very short point <e> <s> the noble lord says that theft is theft is theft in any system of law but that is precisely the distinction which gives rise to the concept underlying clause that it is not theft <e> <s> it is taking a motor vehicle or other conveyance without authority and it is merely because it is not theft and there is no dishonest intent to deprive the owner permanently of it that it is relegated to trial in the magistrates court <e> <s> although in due course i would be opposing the amendment of my noble friend lord elton i am very supportive of the concept that someone charged with theft should have the right to trial by jury <e> <s> i think the distinction here is such that the two clauses as drafted are wholly to be supported <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i hope that on no account will the government accept the principle of this amendment <e> <s> if it is ever put to the test i hope it will never be accepted whether proposed by the government or by any other quarter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support this amendment <e> <s> the principle of it was reflected in my amendment no <e> <s> the first time around <e> <s> at second reading i put down a marker for tabling that amendment and the principle had the support of the noble and learned lords lords lane lord ackner lord denning and lord roskill <e> <s> on the second occasion it had the support of the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e>", "<cs> i oppose amendment no <e> <s> but only because i favour amendment no <e> <s> a which the committee may well think is apt to deal with the problem about

in the company of my noble friend lord windlesham <e> <s> i am afraid however that i should part company with the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> will the minister take on board the obvious support in the committee for amendment no <e> <s> a as it stands and also the general support in the course of the debate irrespective of the other larger issues which loom behind it for the fact that the judges should no longer indulge in the private practice of writing notes to the home secretary but should state their reasons in open court so that they may be considered under the provisions of amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> the problem about this amendment is that it does not aim at setting minimum standards <e> <s> it ordains them and requires their implementation at once

humanitarian ground or the discipline ground although on both grounds and i concede it at once the spirit of the amendment is entirely well founded <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend give way <e> <s> i am very much obliged to him <e> <s> it is perfectly all right if people want to share what is not right is the requirement that they shall share <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister

difficult to ask any government to commit themselves in advance to implementing the recommendations of a report <e> <s> it has been recognised by the noble lords lord hunt and lord donaldson that this proposal involves a restructuring of the parole system <e> <s> clearly the matter warrants consideration and among other matters it is for general review by the carlisle committee subject to this amendment <e> <s> i think that at this stage it would be premature to try in this bill to seek to find a resolution <e> <s> with respect i disagree with the approach of the noble lord lord mishcon when he says that if the government will not commit <e>", "<cs> very briefly i support the principle of the amendment <e> <s> it is made so much easier if the committee is not put into the position of having to divide on it <e> <s> the reason why i support it is from my experience as counsel having sought on the instructions of the treasury in one of these cases to support the disciplinary findings of the board of prison visitors and having been unable to persuade either court certainly not the court of appeal that these findings should stand <e> <s> it had with the best will in the world breached some of the fundamental principles of natural justice and the courts quite rightly rejected my submissions and quashed these disciplinary findings <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i hope the committee will not accept subsection or subsection for the reasons that have been given <e> <s> the device of subsection is that it creates a statutory duty and presumably envisages some form of enforcement <e> <s> the mind boggles at that in this context <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support my noble and learned friend lord havers <e> <s> the speech of the noble lord lord hutchinson seemed to me wholly unrealistic <e> <s> it seemed to take no account of the due interest of the state no account of national security and no account whatever of the way in which by tradition mr

realism about this <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has truly said the onus is upon the government to justify change <e> <s> i hope the committee will agree that the onus has

bones we have to move ahead <e> <s> we have to move some way somehow to redress the balance to protect the child against the molester <e>", "<cs> my lords i opposed this amendment in a slightly different form in committee <e> <s> the amendment has the support of three of the noble and learned lords on the cross benches and of my noble and learned friend lord hailsham and therefore one has to approach the reasoned justification for the amendment with some care <e> <s> the whole argument in justification which i propose to suggest is entirely flawed warrants the most serious and careful attention <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly record support for the principle of the amendment on the basis of the reasoning that has been advanced without repeating my support for it at committee stage at cols <e> <s> and of <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the amendment is not acceptable for two short reasons <e> <s> first it would not be acceptable to the general public in the present state of the law pending a general review <e> <s> secondly as has been explained by my noble friend lord windlesham would it not shoot his fox which i find rather an attractive fox <e> <s>

amendment no <e> <s> would not be apt <e> <s> however i accept the point that in this area there is a case for short-term measures along the lines of amendment no <e> <s> pending a general review <e> <s> i oppose amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment not only for the reasons given by the noble and learned lord but because it does not take on board the crucial question of intent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say with the greatest respect to my noble friend the leader of the house that the patents and copyright committee of the society of conservative lawyers informed me this morning that there are certainly three amendments of principle that it is seeking to formulate and that there is rather a short time to consider the complications of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> it is a fundamental principle of natural justice between the individual and the state save in wholly exceptional circumstances such as state interest or state security that the individual who by virtue of an administrative decision may be disadvantaged should be entitled to know the broad substance no more of the case he has to meet both in fact and in law <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may very briefly oppose the amendment in principle <e> <s> it envisages a kind of pre-trial a mini-trial on issues for which guilt or innocence will in the long run be established judicially <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i suggested at committee stage and assuredly at report that the secretary of state should give reasoned decisions <e> <s> i wholly accept and wish to support the reasoning of my noble and learned friend lord havers in particular on the security angle <e> <s> therefore the amendment would require redrafting in my view although the spirit of it is clearly sound <e> <s> in particular it is sound because there is always scope for argument as to whether on the construction of any particular statute the executive must give a reasoned decision or as to whether in the absence of a reasoned decision the court can quash a decision as unreasonable in the sense in which that term is understood in administrative law <e>", "<cs> if it is of any assistance to the committee certainly the view of the society of conservative lawyers patent and copyright committee is that this would be an undesirable amendment because typesetting can hardly deserve such a long period of monopoly <e> <s> that is the view of the committee which albeit political does not operate politically <e>", "<cs> i also hope that the committee will not accept this amendment for the reason which has been so ably given <e> <s> this is part of the vice of clause no <e> <s> which we will come to <e> <s> i merely mention that in parenthesis <e>", "<cs> as i understand amendment no <e> <s> i shall be corrected if i am wrong it could prevent the copying of a few words which according to established case law would qualify for protection <e> <s> if that is so surely it would be undesirable <e>", "<cs> i do not understand it and i have no hesitation or shame in admitting that <e> <s> certainly i find it very difficult <e>", "<cs> is not the problem that if the amendment stands as it is and i accept the spirit behind it the courts may well construe it as extending public interest beyond the confines of case law as it exists today <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the government were entirely right to omit the substance of the amendment from the bill <e> <s> that is true quite apart from any questions of drafting <e> <s> it is all a question of balancing the interests of a group with sectional commercial interests against the home user <e> <s> it is doubtful whether the record industry is being seriously disadvantaged to the degree that we should tip the balance against the home user or that that situation would ever arise <e> <s> the question of exceptions can be made a matter of drafting <e> <s> i agree with what the noble viscount lord monckton has said and i think that the government are entirely right <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> special leave is virtually meaningless but material change of circumstance is well understood

commitment to have another look at that <e> <s> my main reason for making that suggestion is the views expressed by the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead who after all commands considerable authority on this subject <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord howie of troon for introducing this amendment <e> <s> it affords a most important opportunity for discussion of a serious apparent deficiency in the drafting of clauses to of the bill <e> <s> it affects amendment no <e> <s> b which stands in my name <e> <s> the apparent deficiency in the drafting is concerned exclusively with the design right as the noble and learned lord lord denning just said <e> <s> the new right is that there is not and perhaps cannot be any definition or yardstick which deals with how similar a design has to be in order to infringe <e> <s> such a provision as to similarity is one would have thought a fundamental requirement when one creates a new right such as this <e>", "<cs> the question is as the

my name amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i should have thought it wholly correct that the new right should be created because the artificiality of the route by which this was dealt with by your lordships appellate committee cannot be satisfactory on any showing <e>", "<cs> the problem perhaps arises because the new right covers so many different types of article <e> <s> there are certain articles to which my noble friend spoke where there are substantial research and development costs which in a sense might be treated as discoverable and disclosable in a special form of register which would give a longer period of protection and which would not give rise to reasonable objections on the grounds of monopoly <e> <s> on the other hand i agree without qualification with everything my noble and learned friend lord hailsham said about monopoly <e> <s> there are certain other types of article where the costs of design are minimal and there is no research and development at all <e>", "<cs> i have crossed this amendment from my marshalled list as it has been spoken to i believe <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment because i prefer the concept of reciprocity <e> <s> that is a state of fact which can be judged by the secretary of state <e> <s> it is preferable to the mere ratification of the convention which does not necessarily mean that it is implemented <e> <s> it marries with the concept of amendment no <e> <s> jza and to clause albeit in another context which relies very heavily upon the concept of reciprocity <e> <s> as a matter of consistency and as amendment no <e> <s> jza is in my name i oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged for the reply which my noble friend the minister has given <e> <s> i am a little confused about this because on the one hand he says as regards paragraph b that the courts would apply it anyway so what is the object of putting it in <e> <s> would the courts apply it anyway <e> <s> how does he know <e> <s> you are creating a totally new right and if you are creating a totally new right and you really do not know what test the courts will apply why not put it in the bill <e> <s> if my noble friend the minister says that it is the test they would apply and says that there is nothing wrong about the test why not in substance put it in the bill <e> <s> on the other hand it is said that one must not tie the hands of the courts <e> <s> which is it <e> <s> it cannot be both in logic <e> <s> you are either going to not tie the hands of the courts and assume that they will apply any test or you are going to assume on a ministerial asssumption which has no legal effect that the courts will apply a certain test <e>", "<cs> may i add that it is worth stressing that this is not really my amendment <e> <s> it is an amendment proposed by the intellectual property committee of the society of conservative lawyers because using the words of the noble lord lord williams of elvel they took the view that the bill was too wide and warranted clarification <e> <s> the amendment has a perfectly respectable origin although i moved it myself <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful not only to my noble friend the minister but for the help that i have had from the benches opposite from the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> this is really a non-political problem trying to get a reasonable and sensible

the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i have had a word with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and we are entirely in agreement upon this and i shall not carry my speech in opposition beyond just a word or two <e> <s> this clause is concerned with rights of seizure of infringing copies of design rights <e> <s> these rights of seizure in relation to infringing copies of copyright were considered under a previous clause <e> <s> my noble friend the minister gave an undertaking that he would consider this position <e> <s> exactly the same position arose on illicit recordings under clause and again my noble friend the minister undertook to consider the position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the absence of community regulations there are certain decisions by the court of justice that may well inhibit her majestys government from prohibiting the import of dangerous toys from other member states of the community <e>", "<cs> i regret

"<cs> the questions raised by the noble lord lord mishcon are very serious and important ones <e> <s> i hope they commend themselves to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down for the sake of the record it was i who suggested that amendment no <e> <s> was premature <e> <s> it is for that reason that although i support the spirit of it i could not support it as an amendment on its own <e> <s> i hope that the committee will be able to take a broader view if procedure allows and discuss a wider range of amendments as suggested by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment as i sought to indicate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is having regard to the extent of exclusion by regulation appropriate that the regulations should be approved by affirmative resolution in both houses <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones rightly said there are matters here which go to the root of legal advice and assistance <e>", "<cs> if this is to be put to a division perhaps i may seek assistance from any quarter of the house <e> <s> i am a little confused because subsection as it stands with its exclusory effect as accepted by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale could in effect render amendment no <e> <s> otiose <e> <s> that is because subsection as amended is subject to subsection <e> <s> it is this draconian or vast or unlimited exclusory effect in subsection that drove me to say what i did and to support very firmly amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for an affirmative resolution of both houses <e>", "<cs> i speak very briefly hoping in no way further to endanger the noble lords well-being or health <e> <s> it seems to me that it is wrong to give both branches of lawyers a semblance of a monopoly of consultation <e> <s> it also seems wrong with respect to seek to impose such a duty on a lord chancellor in his very high important and influential office <e> <s> it seems to smack of a loss of confidence that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would discharge his tremendously important duties in a way which it is unthinkable that he would discharge them <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would always as a willing party have the widest consultations which would include no doubt both branches of the profession <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord ackner has just stated the amendment does not deal with the charge <e> <s> the main problem is that there should be no charge on the amount recovered <e> <s> the amendment seeks to deal with the offer of representation <e> <s> it is a misconception to think on the aspect of the offer of representation which is different from the charge that legal aid cannot cope with the situation as envisaged by the amendment <e>", "<cs> if we close the gap as proposed by the amendment where do we go if we do not accept the principle suggested by the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> it does not deal with the essence of the injustice <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord renton that the principle of the amendment is entirely sound but it rather pre-empts the regulations <e> <s> it would be more appropriate surely that a provision of this detail should appear in secondary legislation rather than in primary legislation <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord lord ackner as always does a signal service in underlining the merits involved <e> <s> the hope must he that some form of assurance will be given <e>", "<cs> it would have been my wish to support this amendment as i share the anxieties expressed so well by the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> of course i declare an interest as in the case of the noble lord lord meston <e>", "<cs> may i support everything that my noble friend lord renton says <e> <s> i ask respectfully that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor perhaps considers a departure from practice in this way <e> <s> as a rule the regulations say at the start of the explanatory note these regulations are made pursuant to section this that or the other of the act <e> <s> it would be very helpful in this case if reference could be made in the explanatory note to the penalties for breach of the regulations as

quite apart from the question of subsidy if the suggestion that the contractors should provide investment was implemented that would be wholly contrary to the principle of free tendering and could ensure only that the contractors for the most part would be able to secure the contract <e> <s> that would be totally wrong as i hope the committee will agree <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> the case for intervention by central government is accepted by the noble lord lord hayter to prohibit abuse of rates on political publicity <e> <s> this amendment is designed to clarify only and on any objective analysis the fears of the voluntary organisations which i assume are nonpolitical are wholly misconceived <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness accept the principle of prohibition for political purposes as does the noble lord <e> <s> lord hayter <e> <s> in the answer to that question lies the whole attitude to intervention by central government in this and other spheres <e>", "<cs> while opposing the amendment i should like to say that if the thinking and philosophy is confused as was suggested by the noble viscount the responsibility is wholly mine <e> <s> i drafted the clause <e> <s> i propose to defend it and the intention behind it <e> <s> i do so with a totally open mind <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> this clause is not based upon any misapprehension of the functions of local authorities <e> <s> the view was taken certainly by me that the whole ethos and the traditions of local authorities were being sorely traduced and that a new balance ought to be set between central government and devolved government <e> <s> this is part of it <e> <s> there was no misapprehension because it was totally and wilfully done to prevent one aspect of abuse of the rates <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> it is totally unacceptable in principle because the justification for the intervention by central government in devolved government is the sad saga of the abuse of rates in this and other contexts but we are concerned only with this context within the prohibition of clause <e>", "<cs> i do not suggest that it was not well meant well intended or that i doubt the sincerity of anyone but for the reasons i have sought to give i suggest that it is wholly misconceived and unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my intention as draftsman it is a valid point to take if i may say so with respect to the noble lord was that it was the intention of the local authority <e> <s> i would have thought it so read <e>

has not been <e>", "<cs> i oppose the amendments <e> <s> at this hour i wish to make only one point why should the courts be encumbered with juridical imponderables such as the literary merit the pedagogical need and what is incidental to principal content and what is essential to completeness of a work of learning or reference <e> <s> these concepts render the prohibition in clause totally unworkable <e> <s> they dilute the whole essence of the prohibition and in view of what my noble friend the minister has already said this afternoon they are surely unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i have made my point and i do not think the committee would wish to hear any further from me at this stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord henderson of brompton for his charming courtesy and for the assumption that because i do not take up the committees time at this hour i am unable <e>", "<cs> from this side of the committee we do not have the impression at all that the more the minister says the more difficulty he gets into <e> <s> one has the impression that noble lords opposite have created difficulties which on examination do not have substance <e> <s> i am not much given to supporting ministers but on this occasion my noble friend the minister has acquitted himself logically and well on this subject and is in no difficulty at all <e>", "<cs> yes at long last one knows what one is facing <e> <s> one realises why all the speeches on amendment no <e> <s> which i gather was an arts council amendment proposed by the noble viscount and seconded by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton were not in favour of the amendment they were even against the amendment <e> <s> they were against any interference that was in favour of the motion that the clause shall not stand part <e> <s> the motivation has just been explained and we can read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is not so much a question of consideration by the chancellor but that of a fundamental review of the service which i understand my right honourable friend the prime minister proposes to undertake <e> <s> is it not the case that all these questions on specific issues are very valuable and constructive but that they merge into a greater question for fundamental review <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment which seeks to excise the first limb of clause notwithstanding that in principle clause stood part by a very substantial majority in that form <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of the noble lords amendment is to excise the first part of clause contrary to the principle established by the agreement that the clause stand part <e> <s> furthermore that would be contrary to his own support for the interaction between these two clauses on the bill of the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord ask me to answer that question <e> <s> the second part is not sufficient because as i have sought to explain the first part applies generally to abuse of responsbiility in the promotion of homosexuality and it applies to the type of situation envisaged by my noble friend lady cox who widened the second limb to teaching <e> <s> it would cover that teaching in schools and the first limb can cover conduct in schools as well as the general application outside schools <e> <s> the second limb is concerned only with the specific type of conduct in schools <e> <s> i hope that i have answered the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords time goes on and if i have not done so then the house must judge <e> <s> on examination of all the objections there is no reason whatever for the excision of the first limb and to do so would defeat the general efficacy of the prohibition and would run counter to the decision of the house on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not do that <e> <s> i only said that the noble lord lord henderson of brompton had repeated previous arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an inherent defect in this clause which renders it quite <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly support these amendments <e> <s> they clarify the true and original intendment of the draft as it came from the bill of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> as to amendment no <e> <s> the house owes a debt of gratitude to the noble viscount lord falkland for having put forward the amendment that served as a vehicle for the expression of fears felt by various sides of the house about the incidence of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment <e> <s> it is picking at words to no profit at all <e> <s> it makes not the slightest difference to the sense <e> <s> it is all part and parcel of the idea that you pick one word pretended and another word acceptability and push in other words such as on the basis <e> <s> if the sense of the intention is clear as the minister says it is what is the profit of this exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government for the amendment <e> <s> it vastly improves the drafting of clause which was criticised by various sides of the house during the previous stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not accept the amendment <e> <s> at one stage when we were discussing clause of this bill the chamber divided against the government on the status of the code of practice <e> <s> that is now no longer in issue <e>

along with the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend the minister and your lordships will think it right to accept this amendment <e> <s> everyone knows that the phrase as it sees fit does not really mean what it appears to mean and the fact that it is there will not alter in any way the correct judicial approach to the drawing of such inferences from the primary facts on the evidence <e> <s> and of course if they are not properly drawn by a tenable process of deduction then the decision would be reversed on appeal <e> <s> everyone knows that <e> <s> however if one is drafting a statute it is preferable to use an expression which means what it appears to mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it impossible to support or not to support this amendment <e>

valuable contribution <e> <s> take the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords although this is the report stage perhaps i may ask a question for clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord stockton on his clear comprehensive and precise exposition of the case for this amendment which stood in my name at committee stage <e> <s> i hope that second time around it may commend itself to my noble friend the minister quite apart from drafting considerations which can always be put into shape <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister explain in this context

inter-union rivalry dispute <e> <s> notwithstanding the decision in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm what is being done about the aspect of the question of the noble lord lord molloy concerning staff training <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support the spirit of this amendment in the hope that the minister while retaining total flexibility which is crucial will nonetheless take on board the experience of my noble friend lord renton in these matters of drafting for which everyone in your lordships house on all sides is always grateful so that clause can be made intelligible or a little more intelligible than it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene on a matter of some substance <e> <s> my noble friend is saying that on his advice the incertitudes of clause are clarified by proposals that the government have made that are within the public domain <e> <s> that may sound all right to a layman but it will not wash in a court of law <e> <s> it is a total error of presentation on his advice <e> <s> with the greatest respect to him it does not meet the point of my noble friend lord renton and the noble lord lord mcintosh or even the rather puny point that i was trying to make <e> <s> it is plain wrong and his advice is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the question tabled by my noble friend lord gainford asking what are the latest measures being introduced has not yet been answered <e> <s> when the noble lord lord mellish raised what he may think is a valid point the answer given was that his observations would be referred to the ministers right honourable friend <e> <s> i revert to the question <e> <s> what are the latest measures to be introduced by the government to tackle the problem of homelessness especially with regard to those people sleeping in cardboard boxes in the metropolis <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment in principle for the reasons given by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> that may sound odd coming from these benches but i pay him the tribute of saying that his analysis is a wholly objective and constructive analysis with which i personally agree <e>", "<cs> my lords we surely start on common ground <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mottistone said the unions should be well-managed <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said one then has to attract the right type of manager and that involves some continuity of office <e> <s> as the noble baroness intends to move amendment no <e> <s> although it is possible to speak on both amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps at this stage in order to save time i may confine my observations to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend was good enough to mention my name i should like to assure your lordships house that the criticisms they were respectful criticisms that i made about amendment no <e> <s> not amendment no <e> <s> were made in the light of having read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will permit a brief intervention in opposition <e> <s> by virtue of sub-paragraph i the amendment elaborates solely for the purpose of administration on the previous amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the reasons i sought to give which i think i understood in relation to my objections to amendment no <e> <s> still apply with full force to this amendment and there is no object in repeating them <e> <s> none of them has yet been answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say without being too technical that what is proposed is obviously unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a problem here which transcends this bill <e> <s> it concerns the propriety of giving power to the government to introduce a code of practice so to speak without your lordships knowing what is proposed <e> <s> since the only effect of the amendment appears to be to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to follow either the reasoning or the rectitude of the legal presentation of the noble lord <e> <s> lord wedderburn <e> <s> unless he is being highly over-technical which i am sure he is not it seems to me that he is saying with one breath that all strikes involve breach of a contract of employment having with a previous breath said that withdrawal of voluntary overtime is not in breach of a contract of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is in order for me to reply so i shall not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that the nub of the problem is not the restrictive practice issue but the fact that there is no effective machinery whatever for the orderly resolution of inter-union rivalry disputes <e> <s> if that is so does he agree that it is incumbent upon any government to take appropriate steps in the national interest if the tuc cannot put its own house in order <e>", "<cs> having listened to what has been said surely in the name of sanity my noble friend can take advice from his department as to whether this can be made a little more readily intelligible <e> <s> it can be done quite simply <e> <s> it is a matter of collecting the various consequential amendments and putting them in a schedule <e> <s> it is true that some legal adviser might have to work for eight hours to do it it could not take him longer but i believe it would be worth the candle to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the paper to which she referred will also deal with speech therapists as an adjunct to appropriate education provisions under statute <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that although security measures on boarding an aircraft lie at the heart of the matter even if they are agreed internationally they are not really enough unless there is some further dimension or further convention to allow for some form of entirely new international verification that they will be carried out <e>", "<cs> i support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> it raises an extremely important point where the state of the law is wholly unsatisfactory <e> <s> i declare an interest having been counsel in a recent case in the court of appeal in which the <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will take on board and bring into the statute the simple concept that in an appropriate case on the facts speech therapy is an educational provision <e> <s> in other words we should set aside by statute what i believe the court of appeal would have done if it had proceeded on the basis of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is probably yes because the ultimate arbiter on a matter of interpretation under article is the european court of justice <e> <s> within the community context perhaps the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords though i shall he brief there is no disrespect or want of sincerity in what i have to say <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his erudite and most constructive contribution <e> <s> i think that the noble lord accepts that in accordance with the law commission report and our own knowledge of life the practice is so widespread as to warrant legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be wholly inappropriate <e>", "<cs> i have often argued the case for the disabled in this chamber but now if i may say so very briefly and give my reasons i find myself in some difficulty with this amendment <e> <s> on the scottish bill i argued for the exemption of the severely mentally handicapped on the basis that it was totally absurd to apply the principles of accountability to severely mentally handicapped people <e> <s> the government accepted the argument i see my noble friend lord glenarthur in his place <e> <s> the amendment was carried into the bill <e> <s> it was agreed in another place and it is now in the scottish act <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether it is possible that two doctors would be taken on board <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is not so much a question unfortunately perhaps of the national interest but of the public interest as defined by statute <e> <s> i think it is section <e> <s> if there are no grounds as the minister says for referring the matter under this statute then it follows that the monopolies and mergers commission has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter <e> <s> in those circumstances therefore is not the minister wholly justified in refusing to refer <e> <s> but what about the future <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clarify one point with my noble friend <e> <s> he referred twice to a code of practice <e> <s> i understand this to be a code of practice as to what information should and should not be available <e> <s> what kind of legal status will that code have <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive me it has status under the bill but what kind of legal status <e> <s> it is a serious question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is no true reciprocity of treatment as regards the disposal of major shareholdings on takeovers as between our financial institutions and those of certain other member states <e> <s> does he agree that the proposed merger and takeover regulations to be discussed at the council of ministers on nd june are a crucial and urgent consequence affording some form of community solution <e> <s> secondly if as the noble lord said on a previous occasion reciprocity is to be the test by which we refuse or allow a takeover bid is there any statutory provision to give effect to <e>", "<cs> is it really a question for the election of the individual who says this is my main residence and then both or either registration officers accepting it <e> <s> is the election of the individual binding on the registration officer <e> <s> is that election open to question by either or both of the registration officers <e> <s> if it is there will be administrative turmoil and muddle with these wretched registration officers one saying one thing and the other saying another thing <e> <s> would it not be far simpler to make the election of the individual for example my noble friend lord renton who says this is my main residence binding <e> <s> that would be conclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is a wholly false equation to seek to equate productivity in a manufacturing industry with employment <e> <s> has this not been clearly demonstrated even since the days of the tolpuddle martyrs <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble lord lord mishcon for that wholly unexpected and undeserved compliment and thank the noble baroness for her co-operation and assistance during the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty on this <e> <s> i support everything that my noble friend has said <e> <s> the difficulty is that although it is most welcome to have a general introduction to the amendments as i understand the right reverend prelate wishes to have any detailed consideration of religious education which arises under amendments nos <e> <s> to two of which are in my name cannot be dealt with and it has been taken out of the mass of grouped amendments <e> <s> however the sister <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will bear with me for a moment because it will save time <e> <s> there are amendments in my name <e> <s> subject to what is said i am opposing the amendments in the name of the right reverend prelate which are part of this paving amendment <e> <s> but i am supporting this amendment because it paves the way to my amendments <e> <s> in other words i shall support this amendment although i am opposing the other amendments of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> therefore what are we doing with this amendment <e> <s> there can be no objection to the amendment because it accepts that religious education and collective worship are inseparable and there should be a common approach <e> <s> everybody would agree with that <e> <s> where the divergence lies is on the means of implementation <e> <s> the right reverend prelate has one package and with respect to the house i have another with those noble lords who support me <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that cannot be so because if the principle is consistency this amendment which my noble friend the chief whip has not appreciated is consistent with i shall support it both the amendment of the right reverend prelate and with the amendment that stands in my name supported by the noble earl lord halsbury and my noble friend the duke of norfolk and the other supporters <e> <s> it is consistent with both <e> <s> so when it is said by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that if we support amendment no <e> <s> we support the amendment of the right reverend prelate that totally puts out the other amendments <e> <s> and there is a consistency between both of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i stood my ground because it is the turn of this side <e> <s> perhaps i may say a few words in relation to amendments which stand in my name and in the names of the noble earl lord halsbury the noble lady lady saltoun of abernethy and my noble friend the duke of norfolk <e> <s> i shall be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for any confusion that i may have caused <e> <s> it was obviously in my mind that the house was not confused at all <e> <s> perhaps we can have some assistance from the chief whip <e> <s> i understand that when we have spoken briefly and in broad outline in due course we can speak to our own amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the chief whip <e> <s> there is not much more that i wish to say save to make two comments <e> <s> first on amendment no <e> <s> surely it would be premature to entertain the detailed discussion which is bound to ensue on the other two sets of amendments <e> <s> secondly i should want to support the amendment because it would pave the way to my amendments but i cannot do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both my noble friends <e> <s> i shall not say more about this rather complex matter <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton has tabled amendment no <e> <s> and others and i shall be moving amendments to those amendments <e> <s> my noble friend lord thorneycroft has tabled an amendment and i have an amendment to that amendment <e> <s> we will deal with them on their merits in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think he fails to appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for permitting me to intervene <e> <s> i only do so because i am the great-grandson of a church of scotland minister <e> <s> perhaps i might suggest that at this hour of the night these matters which the noble lord is raising are fine matters of criticism they do not go to the principles <e> <s> we have vast important principles at stake <e> <s> perhaps it would not be profitable to pursue this much further <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respond as the main mover <e>", "<cs> my lords to save a lot of time i can adopt every single word that my noble friend and sponsor lord renton has just said <e> <s> however i wish to emphasise as my noble friend the chief whip and others know that i had serious reservations as to whether on this vitally important issue there had been an opportunity for fair reasonable full objective discussion as to what we should do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly perhaps i may declare an interest in that i have sat for years as a recorder in lewes <e> <s> i have been written to about this subject and i wish to support the spirit of this amendment on the basis of the information that i have received and of what i have heard this evening <e> <s> i hope that the government will regard it with sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend referred to amendment no <e> <s> standing in the names of myself the noble earl lord halsbury my noble friend the duke of norfolk who is in his place and the noble lady lady saltoun

<e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the position and this was clarified i hope by the intervention of the government chief whip and the noble lord lord ponsonby yesterday we had an introduction and outline by virtue of the grouping <e> <s> we who were respectfully challenging the package in order to question what it offered and to seek assurances were assured that we would be able to speak freely and fully on both religious education which we have done and we have received assurances which have matched the two main principles of those who support our amendment and on collective worship which we are now in a position to consider <e> <s> i propose as my noble friend lord thorneycroft is dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords the ruling of the government chief whip or at least the suggestion if it was not a ruling was supported by the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> it was that we should be in a position to discuss these matters because we were challenging we had on our first two principles received assurances of great value from the right reverend prelate and we needed to ensure that the grouping would not prevent us from being heard on this issue also <e> <s> it is an issue on which we wish and indeed demand to be heard <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may continue with my speech and refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment proposes a collective act of worship for all pupils irrespective of the faith to which they adhere which reflects the school itself <e> <s> if one reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not concerned with opting out <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not appropriate for the minister pretty soon to call in i think that is the term the parking arrangements otherwise it may be too late and serious dislocation could arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i shall be brief <e> <s> with the greatest of respect to my noble friend this is not a question of definition <e> <s> it is not to the point that the existing provision may be satisfactory <e> <s> surely the point is what is to be the statutory status of the bill as regards this most important aspect of education <e> <s> all that i would ask is that my noble friend the minister examines the position <e> <s> with respect to my noble friend i do not go along wholly with him on the question of cost but it is a relevant consideration <e> <s> all i hope is that my noble friend the minister will not reject the matter out of hand <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is to be welcomed as far as it goes <e> <s> however as my noble friend hinted a moment ago it does not go all the way <e> <s> it is welcome particularly having regard to the definition of learning difficulty in such a way as to include speech therapy in an appropriate case and to appeal by statute the erroneous decision in the oxfordshire case to which i referred in committee at cols <e> <s> and when supporting the amendment of the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> my noble friend speaking on amendment no <e> <s> a then said that she would consider the position <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is extremely difficult to answer this question on the order paper in the form in which it is put because quite fairly the criteria must depend largely on ruling circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend the minister one short question <e> <s> would not a community service order be appropriate and wholly adequate to cover the situation <e> <s> i have read the debate which took place at an earlier stage of the bills proceedings on the subject especially the contributions made by the noble and learned lords lord wilberforce and lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> surely a community service order would be an adequate and appropriate deterrent for the offence <e>", "<cs> my lords since my name is down on amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i may pay a tribute very briefly to my noble friends lady cox and lord elton <e> <s> they have played a very important part in the development of these matters behind the scenes and have greatly assisted the right reverend prelate in his arduous duties <e> <s> it is right that your lordships should know that that is the position <e> <s> i wish to be associated with everything they have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for allowing me the opportunity to bring this matter before the house for discussion <e> <s> having had that opportunity and the advantage of having heard what has been said and even having a vestige of common sense and i hope a little common humanity i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> it in no way conflicts with any principle in the bill <e> <s> it is reasonable and modestly presented albeit anodyne in the eyes of some <e> <s> it represents a scottish interest which is real <e> <s> i hope that the government will recognise that it is real and accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say to what extent the governments response is inhibited by the acute shortage of nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that there is an air of real urgency in the matter <e> <s> for example does he know of the situation at st peters hospital in covent garden <e> <s> does he accept that nurses are leaving their profession <e> <s> will he look into the matter to see what can be done in the immediate future to try to reassure some of the nurses <e>", "<cs> abhorrence of harassment has been expressed from all sides of the chamber <e> <s> that is common ground <e> <s> it is common ground that the existing situation needs strengthening <e> <s> it is common ground that the bill strengthens it <e> <s> however we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> does that amendment add anything to the bill or strengthen it <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that there is no interconnection <e> <s> however one is defeated every time in the ball game of grouping <e> <s> at the end of the day each amendment must be considered and moved on its own merits <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has no merits whatever in my humble opinion amendment no <e> <s> has <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i support the commons amendment <e> <s> whether one regards it as on the balance of evils or not is perhaps another question

we are now in a situation of having to change with the times in order to seek to curtail the growing menace of criminality in this country and to deal not only with a specific problem which is not relevant in this context of juries being put in fear but of witnesses being put in fear <e> <s> i do not regard it as anything other than a relevant and useful contribution which the commons have made to assist in the fight against crime to say does it really matter whether the witness is in court or is not in court if he is put in fear <e> <s> does it really matter whether it can be assuredly proven that he was put in fear or kept out of the way by the accused <e> <s> that is sometimes a very difficult fact to prove <e> <s> in these circumstances on balance surely it would be wrong to reject the commons amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that by and large the public is far from satisfied with the quality of service which it receives from this monopoly <e> <s> would he be able to go a little further with regard to the nature of the review so as to consider whether the monopoly should continue without any form of no-strike clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a brief word in opposition to these amendments <e> <s> i shall take the two main points made by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and respectfully seek to try to answer them <e> <s> the first point is the majority voting procedure and the second is the fact that tenants are apprehensive about the risks to their security of tenure <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just answer the noble lord as we are in committee <e> <s> this business of saddling which is the term i used means that if they do not want to be saddled with the council then they do not have to be but if they

the housing list <e> <s> i have sent a private note to my noble friend but he probably will not have had time to read it <e> <s> that is a matter of some concern <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry and i apologise to my noble friend but can he say from where that quotation comes <e> <s> from which document is my noble friend reading <e> <s> is it part of a statute or a regulation <e> <s> what is it <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether these measures will have statutory force and effect by regulation <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e>", "<cs> i support these amendments if only to retain a measure of credibility in the chamber for what i said on a previous amendment and which i understood to be the policy of the government and to ensure that shall and not may appears in clause <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for his openmindedness <e> <s> once clause is amended in this bill it casts an entirely new light on the voting procedures because although the procedures are novel the fact of the matter is that it is now enshrined or will be in the statute that those who do not want to go along can opt out <e> <s> that draws a distinction constitutionally between this type of voting procedure and other types of voting procedure <e> <s> therefore it is no longer right in this context to refer to these voting procedures as tainted or suspect <e> <s> they are just different <e> <s> this is relevant to the voting procedures <e>", "<cs> i do not understand how the criticism made of the government that they failed to accord equal opportunities is made good by anything that the noble lord has said <e> <s> i fail to understand this criticism <e> <s> it is as i see it wholly misplaced <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does less than justice because when we see a fair objection in principle to the bill we have given way and accepted opposition amendments <e> <s> nothing that he has said contributes to any constructive criticism of the bill <e> <s> it is a political opposition and one understands and accepts that as a political opposition but that does not mean to say that it is based on reason

does my noble friend agree that his reference to the pearson report truly with respect is not in point <e> <s> does he not agree that because it is so clear that it is no-fault there ought to be statutory compensation <e> <s> i ask my noble friend on what basis that compensation should be awarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word in opposition to the amendment <e> <s> it involves an important derogation from the fundamental principle of the bill that the slr is far too dangerous a weapon to be held by private individuals whose homes and motor-cars may well be broken into and the slr sold by the thief to an armed robber <e> <s> it raises the question of derogation from principle as indeed is proposed in other amendments such as amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house and in particular to my noble friend lord swansea for not having been in my place when he opened the debate on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is based on the assumption that the owner of the weapon will be able to fire it <e> <s> that is crucial to the concept of the amendment <e> <s> it is a total misconception and is quite incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord mountgarret on his totally correct grasp of a matter of somewhat intricate construction with which i respectfully agree <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has said that the amendment is surplus to requirements <e> <s> assuredly as a matter of construction it is because it can add nothing to the governing words of clause b as it stands <e> <s> that is the first point on which one would oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may very briefly take the point made by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> surely there is no doubt that if the legislation were specifically to say as proposed by the amendment that there should be no limit in respect of shotguns and did not do so in respect of firearms one would have the position where the courts could well take the view that the chief officer did not have the power to impose arbitrary limits in respect of firearms <e> <s> of course that is not the intention of the amendment but it could have that legal result which would be most undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the great shadow of hungerford to which the noble lord referred is of the greatest possible importance <e> <s> however i am sure the noble lord will agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the point arising briefly is fair compensation for the exploitation of ideas and intellectual property under clause f as regards which there is no provision in the bill as it stands and hence the concern of many noble lords especially the noble earl lord halsbury expressed on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend appreciates that paragraph f goes far wider than patents <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly accept that unfair delay in publication and delay by inadvertence is unacceptable and ought to he prevented for the reasons that have been given <e> <s> however the amendment as drafted goes far wider than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which i welcome <e> <s> i wish to draw attention to the words <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> it was not mitigated but resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords while i totally support the attitude of the government on this let us not be unmindful of the debt we owe to the opposition <e> <s> it was the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh which was the crucial amendment that i supported which ensured that in no circumstances should the situation arise that a secure tenant should be forced against his will to do anything which he did not wish to do <e> <s> although that was part of the concept of the government it was not enshrined in the bill <e> <s> although i support the government on this i think a debt of acknowledgement should be paid

although it was perfectly correct for matters to be canvassed as they have been and indeed i support that is this not beyond the bounds of what is permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who supported the opposition amendment perhaps i may briefly say that the government amendment greatly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for introducing amendment no <e> <s> because that greatly eases the conscience of those who wish to support the government notwithstanding the governments acceptance of the opposition amendment to secure that there would always be the right to resile from the decision <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask how one starts to define the competition for the old boys <e>", "<cs> my lords in deference to my noble and learned friend a competition for old girls <e> <s> could not some of the wide boys devise another kind of competition which under no reasonable approach could possibly qualify for exemption <e> <s> therefore i suggest that the concept of amending the bill to include competition without a qualifying definition to curtail the area of exemption should not be acceptable to your

brief at this stage of the debate <e> <s> i wish to make one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals has said specifically and quite clearly that no constitutional issue arises <e> <s> he is of

appreciated that the noble lord as always with his commendable frankness in effect accepts that this question is sired by frustration out of anger which is not the best parentage i suggest to your lordships for such a progeny <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i have already taken the point as he will see in <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble earl that i did understand <e> <s> i was about to deal not only with the contribution of the noble and learned lord but with his vote on an important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the unstarred question makes no such concession and is completely unclear as to what is proposed <e> <s> even if it were couched in the form in which the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede has suggested still my question arises <e> <s> how many attendances would be required <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddartsays per cent <e> <s> what kind of attendances <e> <s> over what period <e> <s> if a contribution to debate is relevant is any intervention however short a contribution to the debate <e> <s> i welcome interventions because they focus attention on the issue but these questions have to be defined and answered before any regulatory process can be introduced <e> <s> and with respect to the noble lord lord stoddart none of them received any attention in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord that simply will not do <e> <s> it is no use talking about working out things that cannot be worked out <e> <s> they cannot be worked out without making a total nonsense <e> <s> no one has yet devised a viable or operable system <e> <s> if the noble lord has one why has he not so informed the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not in the last manifesto but and i hope that the noble lord will agree because i have studied the subject a little that was the first manifesto since which did not in fact include it <e> <s> but be that as it may as i understand it it will be in the next manifesto <e> <s> so what is the use of worrying about the last manifesto <e> <s> i simply do not understand the noble lord lord stoddart when he says that it is a matter that really will not happen before this and that <e>", "<cs> my lords what has this to do with the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the opposition chief whip for giving way and i shall be very brief <e> <s> no the policy of the labour party is abolition not reform <e> <s> those are the words used in its manifestos <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of the question on the improvement of services how many of the workforce who operate these trains drivers and signalmen are on the executive board of management <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the answer which my noble friend gave but surely there is a further question to be answered along the lines which i suggested to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i oppose the amendment because it adds words to the bill without adding substance <e> <s> that is not a good way to draft legislation <e> <s> of course there is a danger but it is a danger which is well known to the court and the court is well placed to deal with the danger to which the amendment adverts <e> <s> in any event a child is susceptible to his environment and pressure whether proper or improper and perhaps that is not entirely the total approach <e> <s> the child may be influenced but those are all matters within the competence and expertise of the court <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones pointed out there are drafting difficulties with the amendment <e> <s> however that is not a problem <e> <s> i support the concept of the amendment but having regard to the expertise of judges surely it is otiose <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of interest have her majestys government any power to direct the london underground <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have misunderstood the position <e> <s> if a court orders something to be done within a period of time or not to be done within a period of time failure to observe such an order renders the person concerned liable in contempt <e> <s> whether proceedings are instituted for contempt is another matter <e> <s> if there is unreasonable delay and the court is satisfied that there is wholly unreasonable delay surely the court already has adequate powers without the proposed amendment <e> <s> i may have misunderstood the position but with great respect i wonder whether this is wholly necessary <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will give sympathetic consideration to this matter <e> <s> surely it is a useful amendment in the interests of children that the principle of this approach which is only to consider should be stated on the face of the bill <e> <s> with respect as we are seeking to improve the bill would not this provision be a reasonable improvement or at all events could not consideration be given to it <e>", "<cs> with respect can the noble and learned lord consider whether as he suggested the amendment is fairly covered by clause b <e> <s> with the greatest respect i should not have thought that it was <e> <s> if it is not and if there is any doubt about it why should not the government consider at report the introduction of an amendment to clause b to include the point <e> <s> can the matter possibly be considered further in view of the reference to a division <e>", "<cs> surely this is a most helpful and reasonable amendment <e> <s> the question of the representation of the child also arises under the convention on human rights <e> <s> the child has a right to be represented if under sub-paragraph b he is to be removed from the united kingdom <e> <s> what harm would it do to insert something along the lines of the amendment which would all but demand that the interests of the child should be represented <e>", "<cs> i support the concept that my noble and learned friend should reconsider the clause <e> <s> i also suggest that the clause is desperately adrift and needs reconsidering <e>", "<cs> if i may with leave assist at the moment they have none but the committee will see that under schedule it is proposed that they should maintain and use accommodation <e> <s> i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> to delete paragraph i <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull is totally right that at the moment they do not have such accommodation and i am desperately anxious to see that they should not <e>", "<cs> i shall with leave be withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> the brevity of what i am about to say cannot in any way mask the sincerity that i feel towards all your lordships for the contributions that have been made <e> <s> quite clearly the amendment has served its purpose to generate discussion <e>", "<cs> i wish to associate myself without any hint of reservation with everything that the noble lord lord irvine said <e> <s> there is no point in repetition at this hour <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will take the view that the noble lord made a modest and informed contribution which pinpointed the essence of the problem <e> <s> that problem is that in subsection there is a licence for wholesale inactivity with total impunity there being no machinery enforceable in the courts <e> <s> that must be wrong <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is totally right <e> <s> the committee will appreciate that the financial excuse is no defence for failure to fulfil the mandatory statutory obligations under the education acts <e> <s> if one imports an escape clause on financial grounds what will happen to the children <e> <s> it is up to the local authority to order its affairs in such a way as to fulfil mandatory duties <e> <s> this should be a mandatory duty of the same ilk as the education acts <e> <s> it is on that very basis that i respectfully urge my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to consider the importance of the issue as regards the welfare of the children <e>", "<cs> the bill does not cover the situation it opens up a wide escape clause which is wholly unenforceable <e> <s> one either protects the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it involves the sort of qualification test which is a sham <e> <s> this is one side of the coin <e> <s> i referred to the obverse of the coin on second reading having to go into bed and breakfast to qualify for priority on the housing list if you are a woman unmarried with a child <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> it is essential to have the amendment to ensure that the framework of the bill operates according to the true intendment <e> <s> that is an important omission from the bill <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it does two things <e> <s> it strengthens the obligation by including the duty to assist which is a relevant and useful obligation <e> <s> it sets a standard albeit a variable standard as all parents are variable <e> <s> some beat their children when they are very young and some do not <e> <s> it is better to have a variable standard than no standard <e> <s> for that reason too i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor a short question <e> <s> if he says well it really does not mean anything but on all sides of the committee we thought it did and some of us including myself still think so does it matter if we put it in <e>", "<cs> when speaking broadly of assistance one cannot talk of assistance unless there is a need for it <e> <s> the very use of the term assistance presupposes surely that there is a need <e> <s> as the noble baroness on the opposite benches says in the manner of a good parent qualifies the matter in any event <e>", "<cs> it is difficult for me to answer directly as i would wish to do as always because i have no personal experience of the matter <e> <s> that is why i took the rather exceptional course for me of quoting a letter and disclosing to members of the committee that i put this before noble lords at the specific request of a charity concerned with the welfare of children <e> <s> in doing so i should like to pay tribute to my noble friend lady faithfull for convening the all-party conference at which the representative from this association contacted me <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all members of the committee who have spoken and in particular to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i know that the charity concerned will be relieved to be able to study the contributions of members of the committee and to understand that their very real fears are not realistic or justified <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> surely there are two questions <e> <s> the first is that of legal representation i am looking at the amendment and the second is whether a child is a full party whatever that may mean <e> <s> the first question surely is met by clause <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment in principle because it is a most important one <e> <s> it paves the way to the establishment of an appropriate and satisfactory complaints procedure <e> <s> whether it starts within or without the department is for this matter perhaps irrelevant <e> <s> the main concern of members of the committee must surely he that any interested person should be entitled first of all to be represented by a lawyer of his choice in this complaints procedure that the interests of the child should always be represented that the local authority should give some sort of reasoned <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i know that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has this point in mind in the consideration in depth which he is giving to amendment no <e> <s> concerning secure accommodation <e> <s> therefore i respectfully ask that this may be taken into account when he is considering the approach of her majestys government to this matter <e>", "<cs> for the sake of the record i say briefly that i wholly accept the reasoned approach of my noble and learned friend and agree without reservation that these matters are more properly considered in connection with legal representation on a redraft of clause <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment wholeheartedly <e> <s> it is an important point <e> <s> if the panels were to be established by my noble and learned friend or his department it would be a different issue but it is not the case <e> <s> the case is that they are appointed by the executive <e> <s> for the reasons that have been given by the noble lord lord mishcon with which i and other members of the profession agree i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i seek clarification as to the position of the official solicitor <e> <s> this is relevant to the question of transfer under clause the subject matter of amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name <e> <s> my noble and learned friend will be aware of the practice direction in under which as regards secure accommodation the official solicitor in wardship cases is always appointed by the high court <e> <s> to what degree will his position in this respect be affected by clause if it is enacted in its present form <e>", "<cs> perhaps at a later stage of the proceedings some form of assurance might be given by my noble and learned friend as to the apprehensions regarding the official solicitor <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief in my support of amendments nos <e> <s> c and a <e> <s> these amendments are related to amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to leave out paragraph i of schedule <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which is related to these amendments though not grouped with them was referred to in the course of the debate but has not already been debated as stated in the list of groupings <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> proposes the deletion of paragraph i of schedule <e> <s> such homes include any registered homes <e> <s> they include voluntary homes dealt with in schedule hence the nexus and childrens homes <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down perhaps i may thank him for that clarification and for accepting the rectitude of speaking to amendment no <e> <s> in this context <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank all noble lords for their support for my amendment and the constructive contributions they have made to this debate <e> <s> assuredly i am not prepared to withdraw my amendment on the basis of the arguments advanced by my noble and learned friend because with the greatest possible respect to him i do not find them convincing <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord lord seebohm accepts as do i that parents have the right to administer immediate corrective punishment <e> <s> i seek help from my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor as to whether that right would be truly assured in common law if the amendment in its present form were to be carried into legislation <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend first for taking the point on clause that i raised at second reading and the excision of that clause by an amendment <e>", "<cs> this is not really the time to go into too much technical detail but subsections and of clause i merely say this for the sake of the record raise totally disparate problems which perhaps my noble friend lord mottistone could reconsider between now and report <e>", "<cs> will my noble and learned friend permit me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> i wonder whether he will take on board that the construction which i advocated is held quite widely in the profession <e> <s> of course i accept the view of my noble and learned friend when he says that the intention is as he has stated <e> <s> would it be possible to clarify the drafting so as to ensure that there is no room for misapprehension and that it is only to ensure that it is not an alternative to care <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of recent history does the minister agree that the secretary of state should keep the social work services under constant review <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the code is admissible in court proceedings under section of the act which introduces it <e> <s> if he is so aware can he look at it again to decide whether it is fairly suitable for that purpose by reason of its indulgence in a mass of exhortation and want of simplicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment in principle <e> <s> however i wonder whether the word ensure does not impose too high a duty upon the services <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is better to have something rather than nothing even if it is contrary to the recommendations of the renton report and contrary to the strict tenets of pure draftsmanship <e> <s> it is just better to have something rather than nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> it exposes an unintentional gap in the proposed administration <e> <s> i also welcome amendment no <e> <s> having spoken on the question of complaints procedures on previous occasions <e> <s> surely representations should be heard from any person who has had contact with the child <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i spoke to a similar amendment at committee stage and i do not intend to repeat anything that i then said <e> <s> the reasons are still valid <e> <s> in essence one needs a key worker a named officer perhaps to stop the child slipping through the net of care and welfare <e> <s> i should have thought that this was an obvious improvement in accordance with the intendment of the bill and in no way in conflict with it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend one question <e> <s> if this is to be dealt with by regulations we know that the regulations may or may not so provide <e> <s> i understand that my noble and learned friend anticipates that they will <e> <s> but if he accepts the principle as he does why should not the governing principle of designation be put in the primary legislation leaving the regulations to sort out any machinery <e> <s> perhaps i am being slow on this aspect <e> <s> what is the objection to the amendment in its present form if the principle is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i am more than content and thank him for taking the principle on board <e> <s> again the problem is rather more complicated than i had appreciated <e> <s> i am sure that the government will produce the right amendment to meet the principle <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of this question can my noble friend say what the governments attitude is towards the future of the dock labour scheme as that seems to be what is behind the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must have misheard because i did not mention amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am relieved from referring to amendment no <e> <s> but in a sense it is complementary <e> <s> i am obliged to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord who is always helpful <e> <s> that has cleared the yard-arm of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> now i can get down to the object of the amendments which stand in my name <e> <s> i am obliged to all noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in this important debate <e> <s> i hope i shall be forgiven if i do not mention them by name <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for the consideration he has given to the contributions to this debate from all sides of the house for the consideration he has undertaken to give in the future and also for the consideration which he has already given to this subject as is wholly apparent from his mastery of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of any feasible definition of the phrase cherished number plate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend referred to various duties of the director general <e> <s> to whom will he be responsible and answerable in discharging those various duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that to be the case in the long run but in plain ordinary english to what body if any is this man or woman to be answerable in the discharge of his or her duties <e>", "<cs> my lords the television cameras stand on tripods hooded like parrots <e> <s> and is it not agreeable that we return to the aura of our erstwhile privacy <e> <s> the only sobering thought i have as i look upon those red hoods is this is that how the world sees the importance of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> as i am not debating industrial relations policy i must not take too much time <e> <s> i am trying to debate the white paper <e> <s> i take it that the criticism that the white paper is not geared to a position of full employment is no longer valid <e> <s> the noble baroness added in the context of either the white paper or industrial relations policy i took this down that it was just union bashing <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> very briefly i was going to make the same point as my noble friend the minister and to suggest respectfully that he leaves the clause as it stands <e> <s> but there is one aspect which ought to be brought out <e> <s> he has to prove that he did not know <e> <s> all right that is the burden <e> <s> but what is the standard of proof <e> <s> the standard of proof is not that he has to prove beyond all reasonable doubt <e> <s> that is the burden on the crown <e> <s> all that the defence has to prove is that on the balance of probabilities the civil burden he did not know <e> <s> as i see it there are no problems and in the very special circumstances no manifest injustice <e> <s> for those reasons i join forces with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in suggesting that there are no serious problems with this clause <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to him the point made by the noble lord lord nathan is wholly misconceived <e> <s> there is no problem at all <e> <s> the defence has to prove either that he did not know or that he had no reasonable cause to suspect <e> <s> in either event the standard of that proof is that on the balance of probabilities such was the case and again i respectfully suggest that the clause is proper in the circumstances as drafted <e>", "<cs> the amendment introduced by the noble lord lord mishcon raises a crucial point for discussion <e> <s> as i happen to agree with everything my noble friend lord colnbrook has said i can be very brief <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is and no one suggests that there is not an acute shortage of speech therapists and as responsibility lies among three departments which causes practical administrative problems is there not a case for a measure of more direct and centralised control <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister for clarification for those of us on these benches <e> <s> i am not alone in not having had the privilege of being introduced to the london area model <e> <s> exactly what is it all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the duke of norfolk for introducing the debate on this bill <e> <s> it is a bill to confer legal status upon embryos produced by <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e> <s> i am always glad to give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the hands of the house <e> <s> we are under strict constraints of time <e> <s> lithe house wishes me to answer i will do so but it will take more time <e> <s> perhaps i will be able to reply if there is time at the end of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the crucial issue hidden in this question whether the power of government is used to free individual actions and choice or to restrict them <e> <s> in that regard is it not right that this government have in all events used their power to the former end <e>", "<cs> my lords if one is an oap like myself can one now defer ones pension up to the age of because of the tax implications <e> <s> at the moment one can defer it up to the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend the minister whether the import of coal is a question of price or want of capacity or both <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister appreciate that the noble lady lady saltoun of abernethy was not so much concerned with what the cockatoo said to the minister but whether what the minister said was true <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having jumped the gun in making one or two false starts <e> <s> i have interested myself in this problem on more than one occasion in your lordships house <e> <s> will my noble friend accept that this statement is very much welcomed by some of us on this side of the house never mind what is said by members from the benches opposite who interest themselves in industrial relations <e> <s> the statement is a relief <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may feel that the way forward and the perspective have been truly and authoritatively set by the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls who has just spoken and by the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice <e> <s> within that broad perspective i propose to make a small contribution <e> <s> in thanking my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for introducing

publicly <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last question is my noble friend aware of any economic law by which the government could increase funds to manufacturing industry other than by straight subvention which is contrary to the principles of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his reply does he not agree that if parliament were to set up an administrative court as proposed in this question that could take into account the european convention on human rights then an effective system of control by the judiciary of abuse or misuse of power by the executive which is not available under judicial review which affords no full re-hearing could be established in the interests of the subject <e> <s> i also ask my noble and learned friend whether he does not agree that unless and until appropriate domestic judicial procedures are established our government shall remain at a disadvantage when impleaded as a respondent before the commission or the court of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble and learned friend agree that the scope of judicial review cannot be extended further without an act of parliament <e> <s> cannot the judge grant a full hearing which is the point of the question <e> <s> does my noble and learned friend agree <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that that commissions opinion is but an opinion that her majestys government are not in breach of any relevant directive that the only enforceable procedure would be before the court of justice and that there is no machinery on the basis of an opinion reasoned or unreasoned upon which that process could be invoked <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the question of the right reverend prelate does the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the responsibility and decision about closure is a matter for the government and if the provision for these unfortunate people is a matter for the local authorities is it a reasonable assumption that before the decision to close is made by the government there is consultation with the local authorities to ensure that there is somewhere for them to go <e> <s> i hope that i have not put it too simply <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that if we are to have those trains running the good will of the trade unions concerned is a most relevant factor and that anything said without evidence to the detriment of the activities of the trade unions in that regard could be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> i wish to pursue the line taken by my noble friend lord gowrie who on two matters of principle identified a conflict of approach between the bill and these amendments <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the argument goes far beyond the merits of this situation which from my own experience i am not competent to judge <e> <s> however from where i speak i accept the rectitude of the governments approach <e>", "<cs> it is a rather curious problem that it appears to be agreed on all sides of the committee that one is really concerned with the protection of the consumer and yet if one looks at the drafting of the clause there is no form of legal protection available <e> <s> if this lies within the remit of the secretary of state he is answerable to parliament there is some protection <e> <s> if it lies within the remit of the director the director is not answerable to the secretary of state in any effective way and is assuredly not answerable to parliament <e> <s> therefore purely on the aspect of what is the better protection for the public i would not know which way this should be resolved <e> <s> on the issue of independence i should not have thought there was very much in it either way but then i am not competent to judge <e>", "<cs> my lords is it right that the matter of the family home should be complicated by considerations such as whether it is in joint names or whether a will has been made and what is the precise drafting of the will <e> <s> could not further consideration be given to the broad merits and fairness of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend says this directive is unfortunately subject to a qualified majority vote <e> <s> it is therefore open to her majestys government to challenge the legality of the decision for reasons given by noble lords on all sides of the house including the noble lord lord stoddart before the court in luxembourg <e> <s> is he aware that that alas is the only effective redress left open to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say to what extent experiments with electronic tagging are relevant to the mitigation of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the breaches alleged are of provisions that are complex and technical and that there is no substantive derogation from the main provisions of the ilo accord <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there are certain types of service which justify the maintenance of a restrictive practice <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is genuine concern about the wisdom of the policy of total segregation of the administrative arm <e> <s> is there any valid objection in principle to having the chief nursing officer to assist in the administration <e> <s> surely one ought to be flexible

sufficient to deal with the question raised by the noble lord lord peston as to whether the reactor should be built and the environmental question raised by my noble friend lord orr-ewing <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it was my right honourable friend the prime minister who took an initiative i think about months ago but she did not receive support from any of the other member

this hour of night nobody wants to hear a long speech support wholeheartedly everything that has been said by the noble lord <e> <s> he produced a reasoned argument <e> <s> i made my own notes which are not even worth using against his form of presentation <e> <s> he knows his subject <e> <s> he has produced it in a fair reasonable and objective way <e> <s> it must command the support and attention not only of noble lords on all sides of the committee but of the government <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord that is a misconception <e> <s> i have spoken strongly against the government but it would be wrong to force them in the sense that one does not give an opportunity to the government to reconsider this clause and bring it back to the chamber at another stage of the bill <e> <s> that would be unreasonable and i would not support any such attitude <e> <s> i support the attitude that we should accept that the policy of the government is right but the way they propose to implement the policy is not acceptable as it appears at the moment to the committee <e> <s> however we should at least in all fairness give the government a chance to consider their position <e> <s> i would be no party to any other form of conduct <e>", "<cs> there is a total misconception of the fundamental point being made <e> <s> it is better that i should discuss the matter

"<cs> my lords to save time contributory negligence is not before the house in my amendment and is no longer before the house <e> <s> nobody has an amendment which raises the amendment introduced by

the exercise of the power of the home secretary to refer to the court of appeal for a re-hearing under section of the act is not wholly satisfactory <e> <s> does the minister agree that without a full transcript of the proceedings at the trial the powers of the court of appeal are unduly and unfairly limited <e> <s> finally does he further agree that convictions particularly for murder uncorroborated but contested are wholly unsafe <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset perhaps i may thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for introducing the bill which is broadly welcomed

good intentions of the government which i support <e>", "<cs> my lords it was only in the interest of trying to save time that i did not deal with the anomaly <e> <s> i take my noble friends point <e>

in his grand practice my noble friend has never come across such things <e> <s> people like myself have to deal with them now and then <e> <s> those of us who know about it are worried about the very close relationship between the lawyer a member of the bar or the solicitor who takes instructions from the client and then represents the case in court before the jury in a very important criminal trial <e> <s> it may not sound logical to my noble friend but i hope that i have made myself plain to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask him a very short question <e> <s> when he states categorically that the bar has nothing to fear does he accept that that view is wholly dependent upon clarification of the role of the judiciary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> noble lords will remember that the first time around at second reading i canvassed the long stop extension of four weeks making eight weeks in all <e> <s> i said that if for example it were the wish of government to limit to four weeks the period of extension proposed by the bill then so be it

the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> with the greatest respect commending the noble and learned lord for his frankness i question whether this is an appropriate way in which to bring pressure upon the treasury or to seek to improve the efficiency of the lord chancellors department as regards administration <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that these matters lie within the direct remit of government and that it is essential for government in cabinet to allocate funds appropriate to that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that when an industrial dispute has to be resolved according to existing arrangements by and large it is seldom profitable to consider other arrangements in particular if those other arrangements could well involve serious and complex problems of classification <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> however in considering them both i prefer that put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon for the reasons that have already been given <e> <s> it is crucial that one or other of these amendments should be introduced to ensure that administrative convenience shall not defeat the convenience of the parties <e> <s> as some noble lords will remember lord atkin once had something to say about administrative convenience not being on speaking terms with the due administration of justice <e> <s> of course that is really what this is all about <e>", "<cs> leaving aside the question of whether subsection is to stand surely an order for costs is never made without giving the person affected an opportunity to make representations <e> <s> irrespective of what happens to subsection and it may be a failure on my part to understand i do not see the force or the sense of nor the need for this amendment <e>", "<cs> i oppose the amendment <e> <s> what is the purpose of it <e> <s> it does little other than codify existing practice <e> <s> why on earth should it be supposed that the existing practice which has continued for years and years should in any way be changed by the passing of the bill <e> <s> it is a fetter on judicial discretion <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls has said surely one can leave the judges to exercise their own discretion unfettered by parliament <e>", "<cs> i support the spirit of what has been said by the noble lord <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> in view of what has been said by noble lords perhaps i may respectfully ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor whether in order to avoid a division he will consider taking the clause back for consideration given that there is general concern throughout the chamber <e>", "<cs> the committee may think that it is hardly appropriate in committee for me from these back-benches to make so to speak a second reading speech in reply to the second reading speech made by my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell which went straight to the principle of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for tabling the amendments <e> <s> they meet every reservation that i raised on second reading and i congratulate him on the form which they have taken <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the word and should still be in <e> <s> ought it not to be a and b <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and as a matter of conscience i support everything that has been said by the noble lord lord hutchinson and my noble friend lord alexander <e> <s> i shall not go over that ground again <e> <s> this amendment also impinges on the very difficult question of according rights of audience to members of the bar who will leave the bar to obtain employment as in-house lawyers with firms of solicitors <e> <s> there will be some some say many of my branch of the profession who will do that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he accept that the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord alexander is relevant to the grant of rights of audience <e> <s> it has been supported assuredly by myself on that basis as the grant of rights of audience is relevant also to the general interests of justice and to the public interest <e> <s> will he also accept that the amendment to which he has just referred the consumer amendment if i may call it that is not relevant to the grant of rights of audience and that therefore although his amendment may well be perfectly valid for its own purpose it does not meet the point or purpose for which the noble lord lord alexander moved his amendment <e>", "<cs> i took the view at second reading that as matters stood it was doubtful in the extreme whether the designated judges could be made liable for this breach of statutory duty <e> <s> but if i may i join forces with the noble and learned lord lord griffiths who has just spoken if protection is needed and if there is any doubt as the noble lordlord mishcon suggested let us clarify the situation beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble

problem he says that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord and to place on record the gratitude of your lordships house to the noble and learned lords lord brightman and the master of the rolls whose names appear against the amendment and who drafted it <e> <s> i am grateful to them for their assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend

into play so the small margin makes a great difference <e> <s> if the offer changes with the greatest respect to my noble friend it destroys i he argument on which he was relying <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly to save time register a very firm protest for the reasons that have been given by noble and learned lords and by my noble friend who has just spoken against the lay-dominated advisory

distinction between trial on indictment where there is a jury and where there is one standard and trial in a magistrates court where there is clearly a different standard <e> <s> surely that is

friend aware that an unauthorised and unlawful transaction is not worthy of being stigmatised as being dishonest as is suggested by the opposition benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene briefly to point out that the proposal contained in the amendment that the committee is appointed by the lord chancellor must be seen in perspective <e> <s> i have no fear that there will be irrelevant or unsuitable appointments from the employed sections of the bar or from solicitors <e> <s> i am totally content that the matter should lie within the remit of my noble and learned friend

right period how are the figures broken down <e> <s> they stop at the age of <e> <s> but how are the figures broken down from the teenager to and to in age groups <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble
