["<cs> my lords in claiming the customary indulgence to a maiden speech i hasten to begin by assuring your lordships that my pillow companion for the last week has been the little red book from which i have learned that it is my duty to be short and unprovocative <e> <s> i can give every assurance on the first point and such assurance on the second as my tender conscience will permit <e>", "<cs> my lords as a newcomer to your lordships house perhaps it falls to me to say i think that i am the first person this evening to say this that our debate on the very useful motion put forward by the noble lord lord ohagan has not so far represented the way in which the debate in the country is going <e> <s> i would imagine that in this house there is a much greater consensus than at present exists among our people <e> <s> because in the country the case against remaining a member of the eec is strongly supported in quarters in sinister quarters if you like which would also like to see the dissolution of our alliances and our defences largely removed <e> <s> therefore there is about this not merely an alternative economic policy thought up by some people in cambridge but an alternative view of what britains political role in the world should be <e> <s> therefore the issue is naturally hard-fought because it goes to the very roots of our being as a people <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that my personal opinions on a matter for which i have no responsibility are of sufficient interest to your lordships house for me to be asked to give them <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to know i would naturally assume that the development of the european parliament will continue <e> <s> it started later than the other institutions but from what we know about constitutional development either in other individual countries or in a broader field there is no reason to believe that that broader representation will not play a major role in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for his illuminating statistics might it not be held that recent events have suggested that particularly in the case of those officers based in the united kingdom these were false economies as the citizens of a country to which one is directing information can only act in a relatively minor capacity <e> <s> does not this reveal the constant pressure by the treasury upon the foreign and commonwealth office to reduce our facilities for presenting britains image and britains case abroad whether through information services or through the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that a great many economists take the view that much development aid has been misspent and that there is a quite different case for helping the poor of the poorest countries and putting the money into the hands of governments who use it on projects to improve their own standing or on rash experiments such as the so-called african socialism which has made these countries poorer than they were before <e>", "<cs> one or two members of the committee have raised the question of academics and scientists working overseas <e> <s> there seems to me from listening to this debate a very particular problem which is not covered in these clauses <e> <s> that is to say that from many points of view the universities at any rate of the english-speaking world are part of a single system <e> <s> someone may wish to take up a chair in let us say an american university hold it for a few years with the hope not necessarily the binding expectation of coming back to a chair in this country <e> <s> it would be difficult to define his intention by the circumstances of his employment to say that it is relevant employment let us say to be employed by harvard or stanford universities yet at the same time it is obviously desirable for this countrys reputation in the learned world that every incentive be given to people to have experience of this kind <e> <s> the same disincentive about their childrens national status would apply and is not met by the references to relevant employment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear to be the view of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney since he entered your lordships house that we are an exceptionally foolish and ignorant body of men and women <e> <s> does he seriously believe that anybody in this house is unaware of the potential of nuclear destruction that the documents and reports which he and the noble lord lord brockway have quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that a great deal of public money is being spent in answering these successive questions from the noble lord lord jenkins of putney on a wholly hypothetical event which it is the intention of her majestys government to avoid <e> <s> is not the repetition of these questions an abuse of the privileges of this house and can they have any effect but to bring aid and comfort to our prospective enemies <e>", "<cs> i think it is necessary before we decide how we deal with this amendment to be quite certain of the international context in which we are proposing to act because the demand of argentina for sovereignty over the falkland islands is not as the noble lord lord avebury suggested an affair of recent and no doubt deplorable military dictators it goes back for a very long time indeed <e> <s> when i visited argentina on a lecture tour for the british council years ago i was asked to call on our embassy in order to be briefed on the position we took with regard to the falkland islands because i was rightly told that whatever the subject i might be giving in my lectures somebody was going to ask about the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> i am quite in accord that their anxieties are greater than ever but their wish has always been for the reasons which the noble baroness gave to remain part of the british family and not to be transferred <e> <s> the question which is before us is how can we best reassure them of our intentions to make that wish effective without giving a new impetus to the argentinian campaign which no doubt will in any event be prosecuted <e> <s> it is a question of what this conferment of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask for another explanation of the text <e> <s> does this refer to children born to these persons while they are in the service of a community institution or would it apply to any children born to them subsequent to that service if they were still resident abroad <e> <s> this is a point that we have to face because her majestys opposition is committed to taking this country out of the european communities in which case british citizens employed by them would i think under the rules of the community be very likely to lose their posts <e> <s> on the other hand they might find it easier if they were domiciled in some foreign country to get subsequent employment there rather than in this country and in the course of that employment children might be born to them <e> <s> could we have from the noble and learned lord an explanation on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that it would help discussion of the very serious problem of our defence and of multilateral disarmament if a deep shelter complex were provided for the leaders of the campaign for nuclear disarmament and if they were invited for better safety to occupy it forthwith <e>", "<cs> my lords if i do not follow immediately upon the powerful argument of the noble and gallant lord lord carver it is simply because i feel there would be something vaguely indecent in a former private soldier in the royal corps of signals challenging a field marshal on a matter of defence <e> <s> i therefore propose to return to the main theme of this debate which is foreign affairs because that as is well known is the province of the amateur <e> <s> the foreign secretary the noble lord lord carrington rightly claimed credit for himself and his colleagues for the very considerable improvements that have been made in consultation between britain and her european allies and rightly pointed out that such consultation and co-operation was an essential part of moving towards a more peaceful world <e> <s> unfortunately as he admitted and as the noble lord lord chalfont emphasised we cannot at the moment see quite the same closeness of view and intimacy of co-operation with our major ally the united states and the reason is not merely that it is easier to hop to brussels than even with concorde to hop to washington <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister agree that the election of a socialist government in france is likely to mean that at least one of our major competitors will be having a very much higher tax burden than ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the and more years of peace and growing prosperity that europe has enjoyed has been due to two innovations in the post-war world both of which we owe largely to american inspiration and leadership <e> <s> one is the north atlantic alliance which is our proper subject today and the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> my lords my interest in this matter is primarily as chairman of the dicey trust a body which exists in order to promote the appreciation of the importance in our society of the rule of law <e> <s> the rule of law requires that laws should be germane to their purpose readily understood and incapable of being used to perpetrate injustice <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson has shown beyond a peradventure that the subsection that we are discussing conforms to none of those desirable qualities <e> <s> it is obscure <e> <s> it is probably unenforceable partly for the reason that the noble lord lord foot gave and if it stays on the statute book it can do nothing but discredit the operation of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister ask whether the british embassy in copenhagen could monitor the forthcoming trial of two danish citizens on the charge of receiving money from a member of the soviet embassy in order to facilitate a peace march <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree so much with the speech made by the noble earl that i find it hard to follow him <e> <s> i think the house might find it more interesting if i were to be deal with one or two people with whom i disagreed <e> <s> i disagree in the first place and i am sorry he is no longer here with the duke of norfolk when he says that this is a debate between the house as a whole and cnd and is not a debate as is more customary between the government of the day and her majestys opposition <e> <s> it is a fact that the opposition have a defence policy which has been outlined recently although not in this house by the official spokesman for the party mr silkin in more than one speech <e> <s> i think it would be appropriate in a debate of this kind if this chamber which is part of the legislature were to discuss and compare these two policies <e> <s> the policy as i understand it and we have to rely on newspaper reports is fairly close to the policy which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is putting forward namely that we should both remove our own independent nuclear weapons and get our american allies not to station a portion of the nato deterrent force in this country and as i believe mr silkin said with total and admirable candour spend a good deal of money necessarily on conventional arms <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that there is in the academic community at large grave doubt about the efficiency and economy with which the social science research council has carried on its obligations <e> <s> that it is believed that the british academy does the same job for the humanities at very much less cost <e> <s> and would the government consider whether some similar way of channelling funds through private learned societies and universities would not be a better way of doing it than the bureaucratic superstructure of the social science research council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am puzzled as to the reason for the noble lord lord noel-baker introducing a motion in these terms not because of any doubt that he wishes to contribute to his lifelong pursuit of disarmament but because it seems to me that he is not furthering his cause by asking us to deal with highly abstract notions some of them platitudinous and others of them misleading <e> <s> if he is merely asking us to say that money which is spent on arms could in a better world better be spent in a variety of other ways then it is difficult to imagine that there would be anyone in this house or indeed anyone anywhere in the world who would dissent from that opinion <e> <s> the precise impact of course as my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton has pointed out will depend on the economic situation and the industrial situation in particular countries at particular times whether their resources are fully employed or whether as in the s they are in a state of depression <e> <s> it will vary from country to country and to pick out as the noble lord did a series of random examples does not fortify his case <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to considering unit costs when reductions are made in the amount allotted to polytechnics would nay noble friend suggest to the secretary of state that important attention is paid to whether they are fulfilling their proper role of increasing our technological potential or whether they are continuing to expand in the teaching of subjects in which they are inferior to universities and likely to remain so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his encouraging reply may i ask whether it is not the case that the organisation the national union of students which has given this excessively foolish advice is wholly financed out of public funds diverted from their proper purpose of providing student amenities in individual universities polytechnics and colleges <e> <s> can the house be told what sum of money is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords it is over years ago since i published a book entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble and learned lord was not present when the noble lord lord gifford examined a case in the scarman report about the stopping of a driver of a minicab who asserted that the policeman in question in continuing to search the cab was animated by racial prejudice <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord lord gifford is a member of the bar <e> <s> the other was a reference to the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson who no doubt had other examples in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is though very difficult to see why there is this pressure to put this element into the police disciplinary code unless it is expected that it will be used <e> <s> i think there is a general view which has been stressed by many noble lords that policing can be of full effectiveness only where the community itself is disposed not to tolerate the aspects of criminality against which the police are bound to strive <e> <s> this means of course that there are implications for education and that an element of discipline which has been absent from our schools as so many west indian parents have pointed out in evidence to various bodies needs to be restored because one way of coping with any tendency towards taking the law into ones own hands is to be brought up to respect those placed immediately in authority over one even at the level of a child <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the preamble to this remarkable document it says that the eradication of domination and interference in the internal affairs of states is essential to the full enjoyment of the rights of men and women <e> <s> would there not therefore be something of a hypocrisy if her majestys government were to hasten to ratify a convention in respect of which most of the ratifying states are at the moment the soviet union and its allies <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am at present a member of your lordships committee on science and technology i was not a member when this report was formulated and therefore i approach it as a lay reader <e> <s> i find myself in the rather peculiar situation of commending the reports positive proposals while dissenting rather powerfully from a major premise with which the report begins <e> <s> the committee begin i am afraid by falling into the familiar trap which dogs anglo saxons who talk about this subject and which is perhaps responsible more than anything else for the failure of scientific knowledge to make its full impact in government which was the theme of the speech made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and it runs through this report <e> <s> that is to say they use the curious english word science to mean exclusively the natural sciences whereas in the languages of our more successful competitors no such limitation is made <e> <s> science in french means the entire range of human knowledge <e> <s> the same is true of <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining in the thanks to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for introducing this important subject before us i should perhaps follow the example of my immediate predecessor in this debate by declaring an interest <e> <s> my interest in that part of the subject which relates to cuts in higher education which is the only part to which i wish to address myself is the interest that cassandra had in the fall of troy as it is many years since it was borne in upon me as the noble lord lord robbins will remember that the system of finance which we had fallen into for higher education in this country was bound in a time of recession to have some highly undesirable consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is the possibility in this debate of some misunderstanding on the part of those like the noble lord lord oram to whom we are grateful for introducing the subject and the noble lord lord soper who took up some of the moral points with which he rightly began a misunderstanding as to whether those who are critical of the particular solutions for the problems of the poorer countries which are advocated in the brandt report or in other aid practices arc at the same time not so concerned as are the noble lords with the problem of poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of speakers who have inscribed themselves for this debate shows the interest and concern which we feel <e> <s> it also and i must apologise to the house deprives me probably of the possibility of hearing the ministers reply <e> <s> most or many at any rate of your lordships who have spoken have had a direct connection with canada including the two noble lords upon whose maiden speeches others have dwelt and whom i too should like to congratulate <e> <s> i cannot claim equal intimacy though the tie i am wearing illustrates the complexities of canada <e> <s> it is the tic of an english-speaking university in the french-speaking province of quebec <e>", "<cs> my lords with your permission may i bring the house from to <e> <s> if by an action of the security council of the united nations the inhabitants of the falkland islands could be returned to the sovereignty which they enjoyed no <e>", "<cs> my lords when i ventured briefly to take part in the debate on this subject on saturday morning rd april i did so because i thought that there was a danger that we might underrate the ramifications of what at that time still appeared to be a rather isolated and peculiar act by an individual military ruler <e> <s> i suggested first that the ramifications of the problem were larger than at first they were made to appear and the remarks which the noble lords lord shackleton and lord buxton have made about the general position in antarctica somewhat fortify that conclusion but also that the situation would bring into play and this again has come out vividly in todays debate the interests and national outlooks of a great many countries including our own the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> that indeed has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords since the minister has received some criticism on the statement may i from this side of the house and particularly from those who have been concerned about the deterioration in standards of schooling give a very considerable welcome to the thought of a new beginning <e> <s> i think it was essential if we were to break out of what some might regard as a vicious circle that we should have two new bodies to look afresh at these two main components of our educational system <e> <s> one hopes in particular and i think i gathered this from the statement although i should be glad to be reassured that the new body on examinations will be able to have a fresh and thorough look at the ill-starred proposal for amalgamating the two -plus examinations <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission perhaps i might take up the argument from there because it seems to me that the noble lord lord mishcon has as it were interrupted the progress of our debate by introducing a major irrelevancy <e> <s> the fact of the matter is and the noble lord knows this as a distinguished lawyer that it is not customary and cannot in any legal system be customary for someone who believes that he has an unchallengeable right suddenly to get up and say perhaps after all i should see what the court has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that it should not be considered now or that it should not have been considered in the past <e> <s> i am explaining because i think it is important that as the noble lord has said there should be unity and understanding the circumstances of the past <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that in any legal system supposing i am sitting in my garden inherited by me from my father and my father from his father and some neighbour came along and said this garden really belongs to me i doubt that if i went to the noble lord lord mishcon for professional advice he would say to me run along to the court and establish your case <e> <s> he would say if your neighbour has a legitimate claim on your garden it is your neighbour who will go to the court and the processes of the law will take their course <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mishcon holds a different opinion of the legal system from that which i have described but i am going to continue because i think it is important <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that useful and informative answer may i ask him whether he does not consider that recent events have shown the importance to this country of close connection with countries of the commonwealth <e> <s> may i further ask him whether or not he is aware that both the foreign and commonwealth office and the department of trade have stressed the importance that they attach to a flow of students from commonwealth countries to these shores <e> <s> in conclusion may i ask him whether or not it might be thought that a more sensible way of limiting any excess supply could be found than the blanket and on the whole offensive method of discriminatory fees which the treasury has forced upon the other departments concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all your lordships will agree that this is a very unjoyous occasion <e> <s> none of us can face with equanimity the possibility that within hours or days we may be engaged in hostilities on a much wider scale than hitherto <e> <s> all of us therefore must have come here this afternoon hoping to find some alternative by which we could achieve what the noble lord lord noel-baker said must be the primary and the immediate objective the removal of the argentinian forces of invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to be the first person to congratulate this maiden speaker on his first appearance in a speaking role and to express the hope that freed from the restraints on controversy which are acceptable for a maiden speaker he will frequently enlighten us from his own vast experience in government <e> <s> he has chosen perhaps characteristically a debate in which he was bound to hear some criticism of the profession which he so lately adorned because we must imagine that the white paper which is the subject of our debate this evening is the product of anonymous public servants since i hardly believe that a document of this quality could be the product of the hand of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor or even have been revised by so distinguished a scholar <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to my noble friend lord soames for having given us this early opportunity of looking at the events to which he referred of trying to get clearer the course of diplomacy which led as he pointed out to an outcome which was and is distressing to us all that we should on the one hand feel a sense of obligation to our european friends and on the other hand feel a sense of irritation at their conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for putting me right <e> <s> i do not disagree with what he said <e> <s> his conclusion seems to be one that we cannot so seriously affect this and the noble lord lord soames pointed out that there is no prospect of going back to a deficiency payment system as to get over the problem of having to receive monetary compensation payments <e> <s> that is a recipe for disaster and for further disasters of the kind that came up this year though possibly in a new form <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the minister on that last point may i ask whether there is not something in the point made by two previous questioners about the changing of names <e> <s> it would be relatively easy to legislate that people should not stand for parliament except under the name under which they have been known for say a year before the election <e> <s> this is clearly not a serious method of propelling new forces into the political arena <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord know whether a russian language edition of the report is being published in the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney suggested that there was a movement of consensus sensible in this debate this afternoon and that this arose from the newness of the circumstances in which we find ourselves <e> <s> i must plead then to being the odd man out on both <e> <s> while appreciating the motive of the noble lord lord brockway in bringing this motion before us today because indeed international discussions on disarmament are matters of vital importance i cannot assent to the praise and respect which has been offered to the noble lord or to those of his persuasion because in my case it would be hypocritical to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that would depend upon the soviet calculation of the results of the publication of this document and i am not in a position to know what their calculations about that would be <e> <s> they may well have thought that in a debate in the british house of lords that curious institution which they see still exists it would indeed be quoted to support the view that they are moving towards verification when there are simpler ways particularly in regard to the vienna talks by which in action their adhesion to the principle of verification could be ascertained <e> <s> i do not know but i do not regard the matter as a closed one <e> <s> but it is not as i said to begin with on details of this kind that we should linger because on the whole for quite different reasons nothing to do with the peace movement and if anything pushed back by the peace movement i think there are reasonable possibilities of an advance in the disarmament field <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend the minister to explain for the benefit of the house i believe what is meant by the expression front-line states <e> <s> are those states in the front line of a war <e> <s> if so with whom are they at war and for what reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not assume that impartial scholarship was attainable <e> <s> i said only that where it was likely to be partial or thought to be partial the public purse should be not involved <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be appropriate since both the noble lords lord molloy and lord jenkins have from the opposition benches opposed these proposals to say something about their arguments <e> <s> it seems to me to fit very closely the arguments which on other amendments and other clauses have been advanced from the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not think that it is not very helpful to the cause of peace to pick out and put on your lordships order paper quotations from the press which by the time they are discussed may have been overtaken by other statements <e> <s> in this case a day later a statement from the state department that they had no knowledge of such an agreement <e> <s> would it not be better to confine our discussions of these matters to occasions when the subject can be thrashed out in the light of information afforded to us officially <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened with an interest unusual i think in our rather frequent defence debates to the last speech which has done what is rare in these debates set our minds moving along new paths of thought in this case contrasting with those who after years of rehearsing it can only make the same speech again <e> <s> i have to begin i am afraid by apologising to the noble viscount who is to wind up the debate for the fact that i shall be unable to stay to the end having thought that this debate was to be held on another occasion <e> <s> my regret is less because i suspect that when i come to read the noble viscounts speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the institute of peace studies in the university of bradford has been described some years ago in relation to both its content and the type of student who attended it as being a rest camp for urban guerrillas <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that since the proposed affiliation of the national union of teachers to the cnd parents are rightly disturbed about what peace studies might mean in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that heartening reply <e> <s> in particular i should like to ask whether the government are attracted by the idea of using some public money as seed-corn to enable institutions to get extra money out of industry which would help in the collaboration of industry in this training <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to follow at length the speech of the noble lord lord brockway who has preceded me because i have in the past made speeches to counter the plausible and utterly misleading point of view with which on these occasions he regales us <e> <s> i do not do so because i am beginning to think that the noble lord lord brockway is a figment of someones imagination i believe it to be the imagination of my friend the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> when lord chalfont explains to us the degree to which the policies of our ally the united states of america are being vilified and misrepresented to this house and what is much more important to the british people at large the noble lord lord brockway gets up and gives a speech which bears out what the noble lord lord chalfont has been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted if that is the view of the noble lord lord kennet but clearly it is not the view of argentina and of other countries which supported that resolution <e> <s> no reading of it can make one feel otherwise <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kennet will excuse me but i believe the impression he gave to the house was that he was trying to contradict or criticise the reactions of the foreign secretary and of the prime minister to that resolution <e> <s> if that was not his intention then he fell short of his usual clarity of exposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume then that the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> gave a quotation which was the same as mine that it refers to the wishes but not to the views of the falkland islanders <e>", "<cs> that takes us a long way from the resolution <e> <s> the most important fact however which it seems to me one has to recognise because this does i think explain our deep distress about the fact that many of our friends did not support us is that although the noble lord lord kennet said that the resolution refers to the expressed intention of both parties not to resume hostilities that intention has never been formally expressed in clear terms by the government of argentina <e> <s> why otherwise would this country which is <e> <s> as we all know stretched militarily financially be spending proposing to spend vast sums of money on defending the falkland islands if no military threat existed if we do not feel it necessary to do so for other parts of the world <e> <s> there is a military threat it has once been actual <e> <s> the authors of that actuality have not repudiated it <e> <s> and to say that the resolution recognises the intention of neither party to resume hostilities which incidentally puts the parties to those hostilities on an equal footing as though the aggression had been as it were shared between them again makes that resolution unacceptable <e>", "<cs> may i ask another detailed question <e> <s> will the security commission be entitled to look also at the arrangements for the physical security of material held at gchq and similar places <e> <s> it seems to be that it is almost impossible even with the best system of vetting in the world to prevent people retaining things in their heads and communicating them to other people but in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness the minister agree that irrespective of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether in looking at the resources he will look at the position of those specialised hospitals which have to depend for their money on the districts while their patients may come from all over the country and indeed in cases requiring special skill from all over the world <e> <s> it seems curious that this fact was overlooked when the new system was brought in <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of a small london hospital such as st marks which has a world-wide reputation in a <e>", "<cs> my lords the military argument has been set out with such force by the noble lord lord mayhew that i shall not follow him along that line <e> <s> it is my object approaching the matter rather differently to persuade your lordships that although we may i believe be confident in spite of these prognostications of doom that britain is not going to be consigned to the ashcan of history the ashcan of this house would be an appropriate place for this bill to find its last rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for having on his first appearance in this capacity made so lengthy and illuminating an answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that the teaching of english particularly the writing of prose and the presentation of matter in english is equally important for budding engineers <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that while there are well-known and established international disciplines known as international law and international relations in our major universities there is no genuine discipline nor could there be in something called peace studies <e> <s> would she not further agree that therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that informative if somewhat depressing reply i should like to ask whether the continued refusal of the soviet union and the warsaw pact countries to honour the spirit of the helsinki agreement in so far as contact between peoples is concerned does not make total nonsense of the claim by mr e p thompson and other leaders of the so-called peace movement that their organisation has serious ramifications on the other side of the iron curtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what then are the obstacles to these reductions actually taking place <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment on two grounds <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of putney spoke about appointment and election <e> <s> i should have thought that the only bodies of importance in the united states which are not elected are the trustees of the great museums and the museums are the best run institutions in the united states <e> <s> as far as appointment-by-whom <e> <s> is concerned years ago there was no secretary of state for the environment and i would not as a student of the machinery of government be certain that in years time there will be a secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> we may want to alter the situation in that department long before then <e> <s> we are told that we are legislating for the future <e> <s> there will i think be a prime minister and therefore i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of the lack of enthusiasm for this proposal which i do not share since i think that a single advisory council would be better and less bureaucratic than a network of specialist committees i am prepared in the absence of my noble friends to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that explanation for which i thank the noble earl i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the minister is correct but this is just another example of what happens when reasonably intelligent people like the council of the society of antiquaries do not know what is meant by a proposal in a bill because they are not accustomed to legislation by reference <e> <s> i should have thought that this very simple change could be made to reassure them whether or not in fact it is legally absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> i have not been asked about monument but it might as well go in too <e>", "<cs> my lords it would keep us here a long time on the day on which we are thankfully breaking up if i may use that analogy to deal with all the many and interesting points which the noble lord lord gladwyn has put forward on the somewhat slender substructure of a question about a particular set of negotiations on disarmament <e> <s> but that does not mean that on some future occasion it will be irrelevant to enter into this broader field <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have thought that that consequence necessarily follows <e> <s> there are various ways in which to deal with political movements some of them more subtle than others <e> <s> after a long acquaintance i would associate the noble lord lord mayhew with subtlety <e> <s> but i do not think that in pursuit of his laudable objective he has done his cause or rather the cause of multilateral disarmament which is his mine and i hope the cause of the majority of noble lords a great deal of good by going on to suggest that the rather lukewarm reply not total dismissal as he suggested and as i think the noble lord lord belstead will indicate to mr andropovs latest set of proposals arises from some failure of temperament or ideology in either the president of the <e>", "<cs> my lords what is permitted to the citizens of one country to say about their government takes on a different picture when the same thing is said by politicians in another country <e> <s> there is quite a gap between an internal domestic debate in which clearly americans have every right to criticise their own president and trying at one and the same time to say we wish to cement our alliance with the united states but we think the president is temperamentally and ideologically unqualified to deal with a serious situation <e> <s> as i said i do not regard it as my business to pursue that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the leader of the house for her answer <e> <s> may i ask her whether the consideration will extend to a more imaginative and positive policy on the part of the civil service commission on the model of some major private companies which go out into the field to look for the kind of people they want rather than remaining in london and hoping that people will come to them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord glenamara for introducing this debate if only because it has enabled us to hear a remarkable maiden speech from the noble lord lord pennock putting our current worries into an historical perspective which is something we often fail to do and also if i may say so demonstrating that a degree in history is not necessarily an impediment to progress in a variety of fields <e>", "<cs> to claim an interpretation of the intentions or outlook of the secretary of state by reference to a piece of on the whole incorrect gossip either on breakfast television or in a sunday newspaper no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent this debate has been disappointing <e> <s> it has been disappointing in the sense that the franks report has clearly not achieved what we hoped it would achieve <e> <s> it was set <e> <s> its membership was agreed <e> <s> its terms of reference were agreed and yet we find that noble lords opposite are disposed to challenge its conclusions <e> <s> i find this a rather extreme example of party spirit <e> <s> indeed its seemed to me that the noble lord lord hatch of <e>", "<cs> my lords i would myself agree that the report brings up these points <e> <s> the report states and i am inclined to agree with it that even if the decisions had been taken differently and i think that in many cases with hindsight one would have <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that your lordships will be unfamiliar with the fact that i often find myself in some disagreement with the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> but he has never previously managed to shock me as much as he has shocked me by this amendment or rather by sub-paragraph a in which he refers to the minister ensuring <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a would have repeated an amendment which in rather different words i moved unsuccessfully in committee on behalf of the british academy urging upon the government the institution of an advisory council <e> <s> because of the views that the house expressed at an earlier stage i think my noble friends felt that it was unlikely that this amendment would be successful <e> <s> also the amendment that we are now considering would to a large extent meet the feelings of the academy <e> <s> as i understand them briefly they are that however well the secretary of state goes about the task of appointing members of the commission the field which it covers is so wide that issues may always arise or problems may arise where it would be necessary to seek additional expertise from specialists in the particular field of historic buildings ancient monuments or archaeology as the case may be <e> <s> although i suppose that the minister may well answer that the establishment of committees is normally something which statutory bodies can do anyhow i think that it would <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister say whether an up-to-date list of these local authorities is being conveyed to the soviet leadership so that they can take full account of it in their targeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow the noble lord in the range of his approach to the subject of our debate except to note with some disappointment that what started in a vein which as the noble lord lord carrington pointed out we have come to expect from the noble lord lord soper that is to say a vein of pacifism and non-resistance based on a personal moral commitment towards the end of the noble lords speech seemed to turn to something which is very familiar in debates on this subject namely the exciting of prejudice against our allies in the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i go a little way with the noble lord up to a point but there is not the slightest evidence for the remark he just made and if i were honoured by being asked to give historical advice to the prime minister i certainly would not make that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper namely as an amendment to the motion that the bill be now read a second time to leave out now and at end to insert this day six months <e> <s> noble lords may have wondered why they were being asked to assemble on a friday morning in order to hear rehearsed in perhaps a somewhat new context one of the most familiar arguments in government or in politics the advantages of a proportional representational system <e> <s> indeed in so far as the speech of the noble lord who moved the bill is concerned they may still be wondering <e>", "<cs> my lords with his customary solemnity of delivery the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby accused me of levity in addressing your lordships on this bill <e> <s> my reason for doing so was quite simple <e> <s> if you go to see a dangerously sick friend and find that his doctor is prescribing two aspirin you have only one other way of meeting the situation <e> <s> either you can cry or you can laugh <e> <s> the seriousness of the position in local government which has been emphasised by the speakers on behalf of the bill is in no way met or matched by the remedy which they propose <e> <s> that is why i found it so difficult to take it seriously <e> <s> on the other hand some serious arguments have been put forward in the course of this debate and without detaining your lordships for much longer i should like to refer to them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord include in his definition of chequebook journalism the practice of a once-respectable newspaper the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is about years since i first made a speech against the principle of differential fees for students of different origins <e> <s> that was in the congregation of the university of oxford at the time when the differential was first introduced <e> <s> at the university college at buckingham to which my noble friend lord boyd has been good enough to refer we from the beginning regarded it as a principle that the fees should be the same for students of any origin <e> <s> i believe this still to be the correct principle although i can fully understand and appreciate the fact that if this leads in a particular country to pressures on its resources above those which it can reasonably be expected to undertake some method must be found of limiting the inflow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend the leader of the house for her very encouraging reply may i ask whether this particular question has been referred to the security commission since the publication of the radcliffe report which is now more than years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that encouraging reply which does not altogether confirm what one hears in other quarters can we be assured that if there is evidence of local authorities not wishing to implement these provisions the government will reconsider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he answer a brief question which will help us in making our personal plans <e> <s> in view of the fact that the noble earls party is against renewing the order does he propose to divide the house at the end of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the measured accurate account given by the noble lord lord banks would i think be sufficient to explain why he and other noble <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> he said quite correctly that he had invited the surviving members of the academic advisory council to assist in the selection of a new director <e> <s> but is it not also the case as i have already indicated that they have in fact declined to assist him until their wishes are met on other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl the minister agree that the initiative taken in the schools by the manpower training commission is likely to raise the prestige of vocational training and make young people more interested in taking advantage of the schemes to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he approves of the logic of the ugc which wrote to one of the universities in question to say that the money was being removed because they believed that the admission of these students would diminish that universitys contribution to research <e> <s> does the minister believe that the ugc is right in believing that there is an exact equation between the number of students in a class and the amount of research done by the teacher <e> <s> if he does not believe it could he call the attention of the ugc to the fact that this kind of logic is widely resented <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest in asking my question since the forensic eloquence which persuaded the lords in their judicial capacity to deliver the judgment now to be reversed by administrative action was the eloquence of my elder son <e> <s> having attended the judgment in that case it does not seem to me quite fair or useful to say that this primarily affects although no doubt it does to some extent a number of wealthy persons who send their children to expensive boarding schools and who are not much affected by the change <e> <s> as i remember those who brought the case had been studying at institutions of further education or at polytechnics or in other places in order to prepare themselves better for entry into university <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the minister for that reply may i ask him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first is he aware that the loyal and patriotic citizens of the thames valley strongly disapprove of these activities which are largely conducted for the benefit of soviet television and believe that it adds injury to insult to expect them to pay for them <e> <s> secondly will the noble lord agree that the investigations by his department into the possibility of making the instigators of such demonstrations pay for them should not be inhibited by false references regarding the freedom of speech which is in no way involved <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not agree that the work of the inspectorate is likely to be hampered if they are asked to undertake other tasks <e> <s> in particular has the attention of my noble friend been drawn to the apparent insistence by the ilea under its new leadership that the inspectorate should investigate political teaching in schools a matter that has excited opposition from many heads of maintained schools <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining the expressions of thanks to the noble earl lord cathcart for initiating the debate and having had the advantage of hearing it may i say that i have been able to see the vast range of knowledge information and opinion that can be brought to bear by your lordships on this important issue <e> <s> if i am at all disappointed it is that there has perhaps been more concentration on the periphery and on the areas in which the influence of the soviet union is exercised than on the soviet union and its policies <e> <s> it is no good expecting to discover what we can do to deal with these threats without an understanding of what the soviet union is about <e> <s> this point was made before he embarked upon a fascinating disquisition on cuba by the noble lord lord thomas <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any incompatibility between those two statements <e> <s> there may be and no doubt there is a decline in the emotional adherence to the tenets of the communist faith in a country which has had a communist rgime so long established <e> <s> but that does not mean that the leadership do not interpret the affairs of the rest of the world in the terms of marxist-leninism <e> <s> i see no contradiction whatever in those two views being held simultaneously <e>", "<cs> yes my lords a very free translation is without anger or passion <e> <s> only if we study it can we hope to match ourselves against those aspects of its policy which we find a threat <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the bill and in particular to express deep regret at the governments unwillingness to sponsor it themselves i do so not merely out of a sense of physical loyalty to the only other peer who derives her territorial title from the same parish as i do nor indeed because of a sudden upwelling of charitable impulse but for a specific reason that the inquiries which preceded the bill and the researches of sir charles kimber and others to which the noble baroness referred appear to me to reveal a quite surprising weakness in one of the organs of central government namely the charity commission <e> <s> this seems to me to be a matter of some concern to your lordships house and of general concern to those who feel not only that policy must be right but that we need to have the machinery by which policy can be made effective <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor opened our debate this afternoon he referred to the recent general election and pointed out as one possible interpretation of the results that it might lead to the substitution for the labour party of the alliance as the more formidable opposition <e> <s> if this were to happen and i agree that this is a possible interpretation of those results i <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that would take me fairly far from the substance of my speech <e> <s> i will just point out that the ilea itself is not directly elected that as the noble lord very well knows the number of those who vote in local elections is considerably less than those who vote in national elections and that although education ought perhaps to be at the forefront of voters minds in local elections it is not necessarily always so <e> <s> i am not at all sure that we might not be thinking eventually and here i am thinking dangerous thoughts because although the cprs may have gone dangerous thoughts will go on about some form of directly-elected local school boards on the american model <e> <s> if we must insist upon some form of local autonomy that might be better than entrusting it to bodies which have general purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take the opportunity of a charities bill to make some uncharitable remarks <e> <s> shortly after the general election was called each of us present received a personal writ of summons to attend this house <e> <s> we did not have to wait for the suffrages of the electorate <e> <s> noble lords opposite remain with their numbers undiminished and some believe shortly even to be increased <e> <s> this should lead one to the reflection that this is a continuing body <e> <s> we are who we were on th may <e> <s> one might have thought therefore that the procedures of the house would allow business to be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a misunderstanding <e> <s> the council would as my noble friend lord renton pointed out need to have an official who would correspond with the charity commissioners in order to get the list <e> <s> presumably he would have a typist who would type out the list and distribute it to the interested parties <e> <s> so that there is a cost even though the basic information is with the charity commissioners rather than with the local authorities at present <e> <s> therefore it is not i should have thought a very expensive procedure provided that the register is up-to-date <e> <s> at any rate that is the estimate that we have received <e> <s> if there are alternative estimates of the cost of the operation then clearly it is for the home office with the charity commissioners to supply these estimates <e> <s> it is curious that though we have had costs adduced as one of the reasons for scepticism about this bill we have not had these costs in figures before us <e>", "<cs> my lords we hardly need to be told even with the eloquence of the noble lord lord wells-pestell that this is a serious subject all of us i think are convinced of that and not least her majestys government <e> <s> i am surprised that he should have gone on to say of a government which have introduced schemes and they may indeed as the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say anything about the objections of some civil service unions in preventing the taking up of some places including i believe a proferred place at downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps meet that point made by the noble lord lord mishcon with a few figures <e> <s> in the borough of camden per cent <e> <s> of councillors hold public service appointments <e> <s> in islington my unhappy birthplace twinned with grenada per cent <e> <s> of councillors are employed in the public service <e> <s> in the glc per cent <e> <s> of councillors are employed in the public service <e> <s> public servants in the service of local government or other public authorities have a clear right to be represented like other citizens but it is difficult to believe that councils in their treatment of some subjects are not affected by the preponderance of this single interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not talking about corrupt conduct <e> <s> i am talking about the tendency in local government which tends towards an exaggerated degree of local expenditure <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite a different thing <e> <s> the interchangeability of local government posts with paid employment under other local authorities is a feature of this kind <e> <s> i would not wish to keep the house longer since i have twice been interrupted but if time permitted i would give other examples from outside london of similar features <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord let us know the date of that report which so strikingly contradicts the reports referred to by my noble friend lord mottistone from the chambers of commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that at the last glc election the leader of the labour members was the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> he was the person whom the electors of london expected to lead the council after the election <e>", "<cs> who by <e>", "<cs> my lords he was elected to the council he was not elected leader <e> <s> the people of london were not told that he was to be leader if they voted for labour candidates <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not right in thinking that at the election on th june of which we were reminded earlier it was made clear to everyone voting for a conservative candidate that if the conservatives were successful mrs thatcher would be prime minister <e> <s> it would have been thought very odd if some other conservative had suddenly appeared on th june and gone to buckingham palace <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary and on this occasion a pleasure to thank all noble lords who have taken part in a debate largely directed towards my education <e> <s> there are only two persons i should like to single out if i may <e> <s> one is my noble friend lady cox who by giving the grounds for my suspicion and dislike of its present management saved me from the necessity of explaining at length my views on why i believe that ilea should find a directly elected substitute <e> <s> in particular i hope that the noble lord lord stewart whose speech i attended to as usual with great interest will since he was out of the chamber at the time do me the favour of reading the speech of the noble baroness lady cox because i think that he will then better see why i was making that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords the pleasure of following the noble lord lord hankey is somewhat diminished by the fact that he has said much of what i myself should have liked to have said <e> <s> i find myself in almost total agreement with him but i will perhaps cover some of that ground from a rather different point of view and begin since we have not had a right reverend prelate to address us this afternoon on a matter which has some moral connotation with a quotation from a prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords supplies of commodities from the american ports in the gulf of mexico which would be in the time of crisis one of our major sources of supplies of all kinds both peaceful and military <e> <s> after all this is one of the worlds great trade routes as i think we were reminded in an earlier debate about grenada by the noble earl lord de la warr <e>", "<cs> my lords there are reasons for taking the view that it is not always the most conspicuous point on the map which one should worry about solely <e> <s> there are perfectly good reasons for regarding the channels that pass grenada as vital just as there are important reasons as the noble lord lord hankey pointed out for worrying about the entrance to the red sea <e> <s> naval strategy is a matter of many points and not merely of a single one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down the prime minister of new zealand has expressed himself as in full accord with the american action <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that much educational opinion holds that it is the business of governors to govern and of students to study <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a brief question of the noble viscount <e> <s> would he not agree that to some extent the damage that has been suffered by the european idea in this country and no doubt elsewhere is due to the fact that much limelight is thrown upon prime ministers and presidents when they gather together in this way <e> <s> would there not now be a case for leaving the negotiations on milk prices and matters of that kind to junior ministers and to officials and for the leaders of europe to come together only when they are assured that they will be signing something already agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house in deciding as i hope it will to vote against this motion will do so on the grounds of the argument and will not be swayed in voting for it by the extraordinary argument adduced by the noble lord lord shackleton that since it is bound to come anyhow we might as well vote for it now <e> <s> being mortal all of us are destined to die but moral philosophers have never thought this fact a justification for suicide <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the general gratitude to the noble lord lord nugent for introducing this important debate <e> <s> i would not venture to dissent on the main thrust of his remarks if only because the time of screening of the programmes about which he complains is a time when unless i am detained in the house by the whips office i am normally in bed <e> <s> my only regret is that the noble lord did not perhaps focus and nor i think have other noble lords focused on another aspect of the problem of children or young people and television <e> <s> that is the general effect of a largely passive hobby replacing activity <e> <s> this is something that educationists are worried about and although it is hardly the fault of the bbc if mothers prefer to keep their children quiet in this way it is something that we should always bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise which is not always the case with the noble lord lord mayhew on one particular point namely that if a party uses its allotted day in our proceedings to raise a subject of importance it is imperative that the leadership of that party in this house should explain that partys policy rather than confine itself either to generalities with which we all agree or to criticism of her majestys government which is their natural right and perhaps their duty <e>", "<cs> my lords were it not for the seriousness of the subject that we are debating this evening i must admit that my first reaction to the <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the point in the noble lords speech to which i was referring <e> <s> i was referring to his belief that we should have a more varied system of higher education with greater differentiation among institutions and that there were in our management of higher education important obstacles to achieving that aim <e> <s> my reason for taking that view at the time was that there was a major watershed in our affairs when the ugc was transferred from the treasury with which it had previously worked directly to the department of education and science as it became <e> <s> it seemed to me then and it still seems to me inappropriate that a department which has a massive responsibility for a quite different kind of activity namely education in the schools should also take on this particular task <e> <s> it seemed to me almost inevitable that with a major government department balancing one form of educational expenditure against another and <e> <s> of course in the robbins period it was the universities which profited at the expense of the schools but later things became different there would be an increasing degree of control from the centre an increasing degree of uniformity and all the matters which the noble lord <e> <s> lord annan and the noble lord <e> <s> lord todd with whom i totally agree now proclaim <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister agree that in view of the seriousness of the problem of international terrorism the use of the word terrorist to describe a movement in this case of so far as i can make out open rebellion is pejorative and does not conduce to enlightenment <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the leader of the house not agree that if we are to take seriously the proposition of the noble lord lord henderson that it is a matter for celebrating the coming of parliamentary government the correct year for celebration would be in and not when parliament itself was in abeyance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to look a gift horse in the mouth but i should like to take the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how well acquainted the noble baroness lady birk is with the yiddish language but there is at least one word that she probably does know and that is the word chutzpah which is usually translated as cheek or brazen effrontery <e> <s> in any event that was the word which welled up in my mind when i read her amendment because whatever one may think of the merits or demerits of the bill and we shall all be tired of its merits and demerits before this session is much older it is clear enough that for the labour party to present itself in a formal amendment as a defender of local democracy is straining credulity <e>", "<cs> my lords no one could say that the first three speeches this evening have been full of blatant optimism <e> <s> yet i find myself rather more pessimistic than any of the three speakers who have preceded me in so far as the possibility might exist of a successful outcome either of the efforts of the secretary-general of the united nations which have been rightly commended or of any other international movement towards a settlement of this issue <e> <s> my reasons for this pessimism relate to my belief that we constantly underestimate in discussing soviet moves in afghanistan or indeed in other parts of the world the ability of the soviet union to plan for a long time ahead to carry though its plans and to stick to the commitment that it has made although as the noble lord lord caccia has reminded us there may be circumstances although i find them difficult to see in the present case when they have beaten a retreat <e>", "<cs> in rising to oppose this amendment i hope that i shall not be thought to be wanting in sympathy for the various voluntary bodies particu-larly the charities to which the noble lord lord ennals referred in the admirable and indeed indispensable work which they are doing in our community <e> <s> the trouble about this whole group of amendments is that it illustrates what has been a problem in dealing with the finance of local government in this bill as no doubt will be the case on other occasions which is to say the degree of confusion that has arisen in recent years about the respective roles of national and local government <e>", "<cs> my lords as that is a direct question perhaps i may answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord cledwyn would look at the article by mr marac in the current issue of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord has not overlooked a third noun in the motion diffusion <e> <s> if the word diffusion is looked at in the same way the motion does not defend the present distribution of private property <e> <s> the motion advocates its diffusion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary for the mover of such a motion to end the proceedings on a happy note by thanking all those who have taken part in the debate and i do so without reservation <e> <s> however my own joy is somewhat alloyed by the fact that to some extent the experiment of facing this house with a general proposition has as the noble baroness lady seear pointed out not altogether succeeded <e> <s> certainly it was not my intention as the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos suggested to make a speech in defence of all the policies of her majestys present ministers <e> <s> were i a minister that would be my duty but the prime minister has not thought fit to include me in her administration <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us may think that the subject which we are discussing is so serious and grim that it is not as the noble lord lord molloy said a suitable subject for confrontation <e> <s> but having sat opposite the noble lord for the three years in which he and i have been in this house i must say that i find it difficult to accept from him a preaching in favour of non-confrontation <e> <s> it is enormously insulting not only to members of the front bench but to all of us who sit on this side of the house to tell us and to shout it because no evidence is ever produced that it is the intention or ever has been the intention of her majestys present ministers deliberately to create unemployment <e> <s> that is an insult to us all and i must tell the noble lord that we resent it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> it was said in so many words by the noble lord lord molloy and everyone present in the house heard him say it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there is something inconsistent about asking her majestys government to make representations to the government of south africa and doing ones best to prevent the prime minister of south africa coming to this country to receive those representations <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone whose inglorious military career never raised him above the ranks i feel a certain diffidence in taking part in a debate dominated by ex-ministers and by those who have served with great distinction in the services <e> <s> but it is important to emphasise that we should nevertheless be open-minded about the very serious set of organisational problems which has been submitted to us by the present secretary of state in the consultation document <e>", "<cs> my lords the defence estimates white paper could give us an opportunity and has to some extent given us an opportunity for discussing serious issues concerned with the priorities to be given to various aspects of our defence <e> <s> but we find ourselves in such discussion under a certain inhibition because of the misuse which is so often made of arguments by defence experts on technical and professional matters by the campaign of disinformation to which the noble lord lord gisborough referred earlier in this debate <e> <s> i am sure that some of the company with which the noble and gallant lord lord carver finds himself associated in print is very far indeed from his own ideas and his own wish to see this country and its allies strong rather than weak <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would with pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i would guarantee that i could find in a file of <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will give consideration to this amendment for the views which have been advanced both by the noble lord lord howie and by successive speakers <e> <s> the only point that i should like to make is that i find it very confusing that the government do not as we shall learn later accept the view that the initial form of elections by secret postal ballot is a guarantee of democracy and at the same time regard as undemocratic any form of indirect election however strong are the guarantees of the way in which the initial electors have been elected <e>", "<cs> i am about to substantiate them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn saysand has said more than oncethat we cannot proceed to legislate about malpractice because there is no evidence that this ever occurs <e> <s> i can only suggest that he is so busy with the geneva conventions and with the commentaries by other learned lawyers upon those conventions that unlike the rest of us he does not read the daily newspapers <e> <s> otherwise he would know for instance that in the great city of bristol <e> <s> the transport and general workers union has had to order an inquiry because of allegations of malpractices in the very important election which is going on for the general secretary of that union <e>", "<cs> i did not say that those malpractices are proved <e>", "<cs> nor is it a smear <e>", "<cs> i said that responsible trade unionists obviously think that there are matters which deserve investigation <e> <s> i say no more and i say no less <e>", "<cs> the evidence which the noble lord seeks would be evidence which has been tested in a court <e> <s> there are alas a great many examples of things which are unjust and which are not brought to court for reasons with which the noble lord lord wedderburn is very familiar <e> <s> one is the cost of litigation with which his profession is perhaps concerned and the other and more important one is that if it is done by a member of an association he may find that he loses his status among his friends and his colleagues and may even lose his job <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i did not recognise that fact <e> <s> i do not believe it to be a fact <e>", "<cs> before i answer the eloquent and persuasive speech of the noble earl i should like to reply to one serious point which was made by the noble lord lord mccarthy the noble lord lord graham and i think one or two other noble lords regarding the mandatory drafting of this amendment <e> <s> i should like to make it plain that this is not inconsistent with the views which i earlier expressed about other forms of voting <e> <s> it would be extremely difficult for back-bench peers without the resources which the government have to draft the kind of elaborate amendment expressing the kind of exceptions that might be made the delays that might be necessary in order to allow the compilation of registers and the various other practical points that rightly arise <e> <s> that seems to me to be a matter for government <e>", "<cs> my lords as the representative of elitist and right-wing education or as i would prefer it as the representative of those who care about educational standards i am gratified that the statement goes a long way to meet the anxieties which the national council of educational standards and others have expressed about some of the original plans for amalgamating the two examinations <e> <s> it is an extremely complicated statement <e> <s> there is a great deal in it besides the actual re-casting of the examination system <e> <s> i think it would be improper and of little use to comment until one has had time to digest it <e> <s> however i should like to ask just one question about the distinction certificate <e> <s> am i to <e>", "<cs> on that point i feel that i can do little but re-echo the words spoken some time ago by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> those of us who supported the amendment which the committee carried are pleased to learn that as the noble earl put it the government take seriously the will of the committee on this matter and we understand though for reasons of convenience we may regret it that it is taking longer than we might have hoped to find the appropriate form in which to incorporate the committees wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that for at least years certain departments of this polytechnic have been subject to continuous disruption by students claiming on political grounds to dictate who should study who should teach and what standard should be applied in examinations <e> <s> at a time when public expenditure is being limited could not more useful expenditure in the higher education field be found <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence through injury of my noble friend lady sharples and with her permission i beg leave to ask the question standing in her name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords coming as i do from a town which boasts not merely a west pier but also a palace pier may i express gratification at the facts and thank the noble lord the minister for bringing them to the attention of the house <e> <s> may i ask him whether he feels there is not scope for a slightly more generous treatment of this important form of our antique <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who took some part in the campaign for an elected ilea may i indicate that not everyone will be wholly pleased about the fact that the elections are to be on the same date as the borough elections <e> <s> one of the chief arguments that we put forward was to try to separate in the minds of londons electorate the educational issues of the capital from the other issues concerning local government which come up in ordinary borough elections <e> <s> it is clearly no use asking the government to change their mind on this aspect but might i ask the noble earl the minister whether he would put to his honourable friend the idea that in the elections there should certainly be a distinction and that on no account should the ballot paper be a single one for both authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the advantages of the debate on the gracious speech is that one can refer both to things which are in the speech and if one prefers it to things which have been omitted and that gives the house a latitude which it does not always enjoy <e> <s> i wish to start by referring to something which i regret was not in the speech and that is the failure to make an unambiguous declaration that it is the intention of her majestys government to give notice of their withdrawal from unesco <e> <s> the case for this was made very eloquently as many noble lords may remember by the late lord vaizey and we must all mourn his untimely passing during the recess <e> <s> if he <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate a year ago to which the noble earl called attention we were largely concerned with the problem which is endemic in local government finance between the desire that elected members and their electorates should have a say in both the nature and the cost of their services and the impact of the rating system or indeed of any of the alternative systems that have from time to time been suggested on the economic health of the community in question and of the country at large <e> <s> these are problems but i venture to say despite the appeals made by the noble lord lord irving and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that what we do not need is another major inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness had been good enough to allow me to finish my sentence she would have found out what the end of that sentence was <e> <s> at the end of that sentence i was going to say that it was to be done by appealing to conservatives and to cross-bench peers of a conservative habit of mind to go into the lobbies with the opposition <e> <s> the noble baroness cannot dissent from that because the numerical facts of the case show that the opposition does not by itself command enough votes in this house to defeat a measure of a conservative government <e> <s> i feel we must be agreed about that if we are agreed about nothing else <e>", "<cs> not i think my lords in debates on local government but i am quite prepared to believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh has expressed himself to that effect <e> <s> indeed knowing him it would be surprising if he had not done so <e>", "<cs> and others <e> <s> my lords i would be glad to hear them speak from that side of the house either this afternoon or in future debates on local government and to hear them make those same points <e>", "<cs> my lords there certainly have been no abuses comparable to the glcs <e> <s> the expenditure on publicity by the glc is much greater than that undertaken by any of the other metropolitan counties in respect of their own abolition <e> <s> the use for instance of members employed by other councils by some neighbouring councils within those authorities is an abuse which is not confined to london <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made clear although i did not perhaps do so sufficiently that i have as indeed must all noble lords the greatest admiration for voluntary societies whether national or local whose objectives are those of benefiting their fellow citizens <e> <s> my only objection was to extend the phrase voluntary organisation to include organisations whose objects are primarily political but are yet financed out of local government expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but i said that i was interested not in the compensation terms but in the fact that the people being compensated had apparently been appointed without proper qualifications <e> <s> those are two very different things <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister agree that in the light of the fact to which the noble lord lord avebury referred that there is statistical evidence that girls are keener to take these <e>", "<cs> my lords we authors if i may use a phrase once used by benjamin disraeli to queen victoria we authors who also have to declare an interest as well as the booksellers and publishers are impecunious and often in search of free refreshment <e> <s> the noble lord lord annan and i drank a glass of wine earlier today at a reception to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the oldest continuing publication house not only in this country but in the world the cambridge university press which since has not let a year go by without publishing at least one and nowadays it is very many books <e> <s> it struck me then how odd it was to be going on to discuss this misbegotten child of some back-room official in the treasury who believes that uniformity is more important in taxation than its consequences either economic or cultural <e>", "<cs> my lords it was to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science that i asked my noble friend the minister to convey this message <e> <s> it seems to me that in the cabinet he above all is responsible for books <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships will have had the experience of being asked what is the house of lords like <e> <s> after this afternoons debate i think my future reply will be its like a rock pool you throw something in and you cannot tell what will come scurrying to the surface <e> <s> when some months ago i had the idea that it would be nice to have a debate on the civil service i could not have foreseen the course that this debate would take or the amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in the first place to echo the words of the noble lord lord soper <e> <s> unemployment is a moral challenge to any society <e> <s> any government must give priority to the solution of the social problems that it presents and it must equally be the wish of all other parties in the state <e> <s> above all i should have thought that on those grounds we ought to condemn unreservedly any man or group of men who seek deliberately to add to the toll of unemployment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister say whether consideration has been given to much the simplest way of solving this matter namely that camden which has the largest part of the heath should run it and that those parts that belong to two other boroughs should be transfered to camden by the local government boundary commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the very gratifying victory of england in the second test match was due as we know to the impatience of an indian batsman who having scored a six very early in his innings tried to do it again off the next ball and was caught at mid-on <e> <s> that impatience which often brings one to grief is i fear on this subject of local government shared by the noble baroness lady birk on the front bench opposite <e> <s> having as she pointed out helped to induce your lordships to alter to some extent the shape of the original paving bill it now appears possible to bring forward an amendment which if carried would cast doubt upon the governments procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it can have been one of many examples because so far as i know it is the only amendment which has been seriously pressed to a division in another place and as i said it is an amendment which itself presupposes the passage of the main bill because it deals exclusively with plans for the future when the glc will no longer exist <e> <s> furthermore it does seem to take us from the object of this order which is as i understand it to carry out a quite specific pledge which was made in your lordships house and in another place that it would not be proper to proceed to cancel these elections until by giving the bill a second reading the other place had indicated that it would find its way into law <e> <s> it would indeed have been improper or remiss of her majestys government i think if having said that they were going to proceed in this fashion they would not have proceeded in it because what has occurred since the original undertaking was given has altered the situation in this respect <e> <s> it therefore seems to me that it would have been perfectly simple for the noble baroness to have reserved her fire until the main bill came before us and allowed this consequential order to go through without amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has proposed for our debate this afternoon is an important and serious one <e> <s> relations between the government of the united kingdom and the government of the united states which have had a varied interest since the united states cut loose from us some years ago are always worth looking at <e> <s> indeed we are fortunate that two noble lords who have held the important post of her majestys ambassador in washington are to take part <e>", "<cs> my lords at question time this afternoon which seems a very very long time ago reference was made to the overseas services of the bbc <e> <s> in the world service tomorrow two members of this noble house are to be asked to explain todays debate to the world one of them is me <e> <s> i have therefore been giving close attention to our proceedings <e> <s> i must say that from the beginning i have found them falsified to some extent by a motion which in a less tolerant house for instance a school debating society might have been ruled out <e> <s> i say that for this reason <e> <s> there are three elements in the motion of the noble lord lord beswick which give or take a word or two any civilised government ought to accept <e> <s> any government would want to unite the nation any government would want to stimulate pride in the welfare provisions of the nation and any government would wish even in a sinful world to make something of social responsibility <e> <s> but in the middle we have the joker in the pack where the noble lord lord beswick inserts the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that i left out that word <e> <s> i cannot see that it makes very much difference because directly or indirectly a person either becomes employed who was not previously employed or does not <e> <s> whether this is the result of someone buying something which he is going to make or whether he is directly employed by a nationalised industry or by an agency of government to him i should have thought makes very little difference <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that editorial will mean what it usually means and that it will not be a matter of toning down the report in order to spare the susceptibilities of certain pressure groups in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords we have acquired perhaps unintentionally a new measuring rod for the interest which the public at large is likely to take in our debates <e> <s> that is provided by whether the cameras are switched on or switched off <e> <s> this afternoon we have seen them switched on for a debate about drug abuse in this country a serious problem for government and for society and switched off for a discussion of events which on some apocalyptic judgments might mean the end of humanity as a whole when even drug abuse would cease to concern us <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is an interesting comment but it somewhat undermines the position of the noble lord lord mayhew which i was exploring <e> <s> that is because he said that he thought that this was the effective reason for the soviets returning to geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the house an assurance that the green paper will be based on the principle that access to higher education whether as student or teacher is a privilege to be earned by work and is not as some dons in oxford appear to think a licence to plunder the public purse <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply but is it not rather extraordinary that there are no precise figures for both universities and polytechnics <e> <s> this question has been talked about for a number of years <e> <s> is it not the case that even if the money comes out of student union funds it is still ultimately public money which is reaching students who by definition are not engaged in study <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that very informative reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he does not consider at a time when very many children are being deprived of important educational opportunities that the dispute continuing with some of the trade unions in the educational world is a matter of the first urgency <e> <s> is it not further the case that it must in the end be established in that as in other occupations that salaries are proportionate to work and endeavour and that to try to separate contracts of employment from salary negotiations as the national union of teachers has been doing is inimical to the education service and to the welfare of children in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not agree that the point about american telephone boxes is that the telephones in them actually work <e> <s> is that not the objective which british telecom should have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who was born when mr asquith was prime minister i had a certain feeling of nostalgia in hearing the noble lord lord wigoder suggest that one of the measures of that famous liberal government should be repealed <e> <s> i cannot go along with him in his line of argument but i would say that there are other measures that that government enacted as to which if he were to move their repeal he would find me cordially with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that any absentees have very powerful and pressing reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not the jury was vetted the jurys capacity to distinguish its role seems to me to be inadequate <e> <s> that is my opinion <e> <s> the noble lord is obviously entitled to disagree <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am suggesting that with the juries that we have legislation probably needs to be much more tightly drafted than it is or we shall go on getting cases where the judge interprets the law in one way and the jury takes it upon itself to interpret the law in another way <e> <s> with regard to the contribution of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby i am afraid that what it has done is to point up another reason why it is impossible to dispense with an official secrets act of very much the kind that we have now though better drafted <e> <s> that is that we cannot assume that even members of parliament of either house necessarily put the national interest first <e> <s> it is all very well to say that of course in any freedom of information act we would provide for nothing touching upon national security <e> <s> however the question is who is to decide national security <e> <s> if it is left again to the conscience of individual civil servants or to individual members of either house of parliament to probe and to say if they do not receive an immediate answer to their probing that the country is being deceived rather than we cannot know that perhaps some important security consideration of which they are necessarily unaware is at stake then it seems to me we cannot do without a fairly severe act of this kind because the noble lord lord hatch of lusby took the time allotted to his speech in rehearsing matters concerning the general belgrano <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that we all regret the death of our foes <e> <s> they die in wars on both sides in a number of ways sometimes intentionally sometimes accidentally <e> <s> it is the cruel result of war <e> <s> but to say that on each occasion every fatality must be examined to see if it could have been avoided is obviously a counsel which no government and no parliament could accept <e> <s> therefore one asks why this particular tragedy has been drawn out for so long and drawn out in a way which has placed a considerable burden upon ministers who have been diverted perhaps from the much more important task of knowing where we go in respect of the falklands by the necessity over and over again to rehearse replies to questions of this kind in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl make a direct comparison between the role and status of sir winston churchill and the role status and actions of mr tam dalyell <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since i arrived in your lordships house i have been wondering whether the representatives of the official opposition were still capable of surprising me <e> <s> this evening they have done it again <e> <s> i find it remarkable and surprising in view of all the circumstances that the noble lord lord shackleton should appear to feel that there has been an inadequate willingness on this side of the house to co-operate in improving this bill <e> <s> after all this bill has been foreshadowed ever since the general election <e> <s> it was immediately met not merely by the normal interplay of party debate as is justifiable by refusing the co-operation of those officers of local bodies whose co-operation would be needed for a smooth transition every device has been thought of propaganda has already been referred to enough efforts were set on foot to make this bill impossible <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords that i think is a matter of interpretation <e> <s> my impression is that many of the people who lead these cities are pleased at the thought that they will recover their identity as first-tier organs of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel for introducing this wide-ranging topic for our debate and for his own speech based as it was upon practical experience of almost unique length in this field <e>", "<cs> if we are to accept the argument put forward by the noble lord lord diamond that this is not a wrecking amendment we are left with only one alternative adjective to put to the amendment namely that it is a frivolous amendment an amendment which may not delay the passing of the bill but which will delay your lordships committee in coming to grips with the various important issues of substance in the bill which we have to discuss and may indeed occasionally have to amend <e>", "<cs> i think that the proposal for a referen-dum if it is genuinely made must be seriously considered <e> <s> reference has been made to the precedent of the referendum on staying in the european communities <e> <s> if i remember correctly very great efforts were made to see that both sides in that argument had a full opportunity of presenting their case that in no way was the accretion of funds to one or other side to influence voters and that the whole thing took as it should if one takes a referendum seriously a very long time <e> <s> therefore i must presume that those who intend a referendum intend again a form of delay <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister not agree following the last supplementary question that it is essential that schools bring girls to the point at which they can profit from university and polytechnic education in these subjects <e> <s> will he also agree that the figures supplied to me by his department through his courtesy show clearly that girls from girls schools do more than twice as well at these subjects as girls from mixed schools <e> <s> should we not draw some lessons from that <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised though i am prepared to be convinced that the noble baroness should think that the historic buildings and monuments commission to which we are giving new work at almost every moment this evening is necessarily a more suitable body to take over this responsibility than the royal commission on historical monuments <e> <s> the importance of <e>", "<cs> i should like to return for a moment to one of the alternative proposals before us the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> it seems to me that that incorporates not so much a threat to the pollution of the environment but a pollution of the english language <e> <s> a residuary body is not a body upon which in the normal meaning of the word new functions can be conferred <e> <s> indeed i was so surprised that i thought at first that it was just that the noble baroness had been brought up in a very polite way and was taught to use the word residue rather than the word waste so she thought residue could go to a residuary authority <e> <s> however i understand that that was not her intention <e>", "<cs> i too thought that there was such a distinction but the affairs of the national union of mineworkers have rather confused this distinction in the public mind <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord graham has said there are a number of amendments on the subject of archives including amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name <e>", "<cs> that is quite correct <e> <s> this is only trying to follow the governments precepts about economy not taking the new marshalled list as it comes in order to save money and paper <e> <s> i do apologise <e> <s> nevertheless i was aware of the content though not of the placing of the other amendment <e> <s> as i said i think it is generally agreed that the whole subject of archives ought to be discussed together because different ways of approaching this subject have occurred to different noble lords <e> <s> some of us have been in contact and some of us have acted independently <e>", "<cs> my excuse for addressing your lordships a second time this evening is partly to bring us back to the subject of ilea <e> <s> certainly i would not wish to engage in a general debate about the merits or demerits of proportional representation for political bodies whether national or local <e> <s> some regard pr as the plague some like the noble lord lord diamond believe on the contrary that it is a cure for almost any plague perhaps even the cure we are looking for to get rid of aids <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may at this point explain why some people who like myself were in favour of an elected ilea replacing the present structure are nevertheless favourable to the proposals in the bill and find it impossible to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when we argued the case for an elected ilea rather than some kind of joint board we took on board the view which has been powerfully expressed by the noble baroness that there are great practical considerations which would make the maintenance of a central focus for inner londons education desirable all other considerations being equal <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly if i may to suggest a revolutionary proposal that is to say that we should stop doing things in the british way and look at the way in which this problem might be tackled elsewhere <e> <s> i agree totally with the noble baroness about the importance of archaeology as a subject and as a contributor to history and also about the importance when you have a multi-disciplinary team of keeping it together <e> <s> the issue is where this team should be located and how it should be financed <e>", "<cs> i find this amendment very difficult because i still feel having heard the noble earl twice that i am not completely sure what it is he has in mind <e> <s> as i understand it and i may be wrong the proposal in the bill is for an organisation of boroughs or metropolitan districts which will come together and allocate money to the support of the voluntary organisations <e> <s> i understand further and this has been enlarged upon by the minister today that because there may be a gap between the setting up of such an organisation and its ability fully to fund the needs of these organisations the government will make certain interim additions to the funds at their disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like it to be thought that the very grudging response of the noble baroness lady david represents the totality of reactions to this interesting and important statement <e> <s> on the contrary i think the statement gives us some reasonable hope that the long decline in the capacity of this country adequately to organise and finance higher education may be coming to an end <e> <s> it is after all an extraordinary anomaly that we go along with the university grants committee system set up on in a totally different world <e>", "<cs> my lords will noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the question be now put <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to a powerful exposition from my noble friend lord de la warr not for the first time in this debate of what might be called the producers view of transport services the view of those who are professionally or governmentally engaged or who have been engaged in providing these services <e> <s> one must assume that for such people and it would be true in any other industry there is an inbuilt preference for the way in which things have been done so far <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the figures for reflect a wider area of recruitment or is the civil service commission unlike its competitors in the private sector still concerned only with universities south of the wash <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> if she speaks to her amendment she will put me at a considerable disadvantage in supporting the noble baroness lady lockwood on her amendment <e> <s> i do not regard the two amendments as at all congruent <e> <s> i am not in favour of the amendment which the noble baroness lady birk proposes to move but i am very strongly in favour of the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady lockwood to which i have put down my name <e> <s> i should have thought there was a case for debating them separately <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister if i may say so does himself an injustice <e> <s> when he addresses the house he makes perfectly clear his intentions most of them in this respect very benevolent <e> <s> the reason why the noble baroness lady lockwood and others put down this amendment i do not think that we would pretend that it does not carry some questions and disadvantages was that when we looked at the marshalled list where we expected to find an amendment that would translate into legislative language the very clear language that the noble lord the minister used at the committee stage we did not find it <e> <s> we did not find it in two respects <e> <s> i realise that the noble lord the minister thinks that this is a minor point <e> <s> but first we did not find it in a direct reference to the keeping together of the archives of the metropolitan counties <e> <s> it may be that archivists think only of archives as cobblers think only of leather or nowadays mainly of plastic <e> <s> but the fact is that they were very worried <e> <s> they will continue to be worried and not only the archivists themselves but the historical profession that depends upon them unless they see the word archives very clearly at the relevant points in the bill as it finally leaves your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was moved to rise by the extraordinary statement based on no evidence that i know of that there are no noble lords on this side of the house who are enthusiastic for the bill before us <e> <s> it is true that there are some noble lords on this side of the house who have reservations about one or other aspect of it but the attempt to suggest that the majorities in the division lobby today and on other days do not represent a carefully thought out policy in which we support her majestys government is offensive <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the question asked by the noble lord lord gladwyn will my noble friend the minister agree that the council of ministers would be an inappropriate body to discuss this matter as defence is expressly excluded from the treaty of rome but that european interests are continuously being taken into account by the government of the united states as witness the tour of europe which i believe the american vice-president begins today <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i can help the noble lord lord hunt in interpreting the remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunt is right in saying that we have spent a good deal of time although not so much proportionately as i a mancunian would have liked on the metropolitan counties as compared to london <e> <s> we have however spent a good deal of time on them <e> <s> what has puzzled my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter as it has puzzled me is that the argument today has been stood on its head notably by the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with growing amazement to the self-styled voice of reason and progress and i find it impossible to reconcile what has been argued with the fact which was admitted by the noble baroness that of the teachers organisations three have not gone on record as being in favour of abolition <e> <s> yet abolition is to be the keynote of a bill which was designed for a rather different purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> the bill as reported to us and i accept the correction was a bill to enable parents to contract their children out of the punishment system in a particular school <e> <s> this amendment intends and no doubt subsequent amendments will be consequential to change the bill into a measure for the abolition of corporal punishment <e> <s> however much they may dislike the bill i invite noble lords to say that they prefer it to the alternative now proposed <e>", "<cs> i cannot believe that my noble friend lady vickers is serious in her amendment because the idea of a country which becomes a patchwork quilt of areas in one of which one regime operates and in another possibly a district or city within the same county a different regime operates is impossible to contemplate for the administrator for the user of buses or for the provider of buses <e> <s> therefore the fact that london for the time being has been exempt is not really an argument <e> <s> london is an identifiable area of a very large size which has other peculiarities <e>", "<cs> there is something peculiar again about this amendment because the noble lord lord mcintosh who moved it began by putting forward a view of the experiments that have taken place which is obviously a view different from the view held by the government and by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> i would not go into that argument but what it does show is that an experiment on a relatively small scale in a limited number of areas is hound to lend itself to differences of interpretation <e> <s> yet the noble lord goes on to suggest that the only way forward and to get over the leap in the dark as it is called is to have some more experiments <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite wrong <e> <s> i sold a new university to the british public <e> <s> anyone who can do that knows something about salesmanship <e>", "<cs> i do not think that any of us would wish to deny the importance of making provision for the elderly and the disabled but there must be a question as to whether this is the appropriate point in a bill of this kind at which to introduce these provisions <e> <s> i say that because we are dealing now with the registration of services and we are endeavouring to meet this problem by making it as it were a condition for the approval of a service by the traffic commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister assure the house that his reference to the quality of life means that contrary to some things which have been said the changes in planning regulations will not adversely affect the green belt <e>", "<cs> i am unpersuaded by the noble lord lord shepherd for a rather simple reason which is to be found in the text of the bill before us <e> <s> the noble lord stated that there was only one difference between himself and my noble friend lord peyton which was that he wished certain precautions to be taken before a licence was granted whereas my noble friend lord peyton in relying on clause of the bill was content with a <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord perhaps explain how this would affect foreign registered coaches which seem to occupy a great deal of the space in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment of the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil i should like to call your lordships attention to the fact that we may all in our different ways be deluding ourselves <e> <s> we have been talking about an experiment and the idea that this experiment should continue for a few more months <e> <s> i would submit that the word experiment in this connection is ill taken <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether serious attention was paid to the increasing denial of educational opportunities to women in countries such as iran and pakistan and whether delegations from those countries were present to explain why women are discriminated against particularly in higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking your lordships to vote against the amendment i begin by expressing a regret which i am sure is widely shared in this house that we are not to have the benefit of the views of the noble lord lord plowden himself although i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question as a sponsor of the national council for educational standards <e> <s> will my noble friend agree that the question asked and the remark made by the noble lord lord glenamara that the comparison is not worth the paper upon which it is written suggest that it is extremely difficult to do serious research when those who do serious research are not argued with in terms of the problem but are subjected to prejudicial abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the principal assumption made by the noble lord lord shepherd is that this admirable metro system would somehow fall victim to bus competition <e> <s> this seems to me to be an extraordinary improbable assumption when all over the world the congestion created by motor traffic in cities is leading to a revival of underground and other rapid transport systems <e> <s> this is simply because as my noble friend lady carnegy pointed out in relation to glasgow it is quicker for a passenger and as the noble lord lord somers said it is the passengers we are concerned with here to travel through the centre of a major conurbation by rail underground or overground as the case may be than in a motor vehicle which is bound to be held up for much of the day in rush-hour traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the government will not be persuaded by the arguments that have been put forward because i think that they rest upon a misconception which often arises when people are arguing the case for consumer representation <e> <s> they argue as though consumers in respect of major services such as buses are a clearly identifiable body of people such as let us say those who play darts or bowls or indulge in some other definable minority interest <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that he might well suggest to the noble lord lord jenkins that he could allay his anxieties by the simple process of moving his dwelling to a nuclear-free zone in which case he would be perfectly safe even if armageddon came <e>", "<cs> my lords my excuse for rising so late is to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord kearton and his sub-committee for a report which considering the timetable imposed impresses one with the thoroughness with which these issues were examined <e> <s> however it leaves open questions upon which had i been a member of that sub-committee i would have liked to press the witnesses further especially the degree of support which exists in our partner countries in the community for the changes now being advocated and whether the difference that appears to exist between the citizens of this country and those of our partners is not to some extent an illusion based on different modes of political discourse <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one curious point that i should like to raise in relation to this amendment <e> <s> a very long time ago we were presented with this complex bill which was to take effect over a period of time and we debated at considerable length at all its stages the appropriate timetable which was fixed <e> <s> what is now proposed is to give the secretary of state a discretion to vary the timetable and as my noble friend lord renton pointed out some other matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining in the congratulations to the right reverend prelate and expressing the hope that he will address us again i have something specific in mind <e> <s> it was i think unexpected for many noble lords that after he spoke on the importance and efficacy of overseas aid he should have given as his example south korea <e> <s> perhaps if i were a better student of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe in moving his very welcome motion and giving us the opportunity for this debate said that he did not wish to reopen the much vexed question of nationalisation versus privatisation and i do not intend to breach his request that we should not do so <e> <s> however it seems to me that in the framing of the motion itself there is an assumption which is worth examining because it relates to the substance <e> <s> i am referring to the assumption that somehow nationalised industries that are monopolies have met the major criteria which he sets out and that the problem is created by the transfer of ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble baroness for that answer can she reassure the house that when the code comes from the committee of vice-chancellors it will not be a code to limit access to universities in order to give the vice-chancellors an easier time but on the contrary will make certain that universities accept their responsibilities for teaching their students that free speech is the highest of all university attainments <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who for years has been involved in international cultural cooperation from an academic base perhaps i may congratulate her majestys government on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether instruction in swimming is one of the matters which has been damaged by the totally uncalled for so-called industrial action by the teachers unions <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that according to the latest information at the ceremony this morning the two joint recipients of this award used the occasion once again to state and state only the soviet point of view on current international proceedings a point of view which is very well known and on which their assistance is not required <e> <s> does this not again suggest that the noble lord lord rea is totally mistaken in his view about the organisation which he wishes us to congratulate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all be most grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for having brought before us a major subject of anxiety both in respect of the welfare of the citizens of the city we are discussing and in respect of the structure of local government and its finances which have been involved in worsening the situation that there exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by assuring the noble lord lord underhill that nothing but a deep personal interest would have made me come to a debate in your lordships house on a friday <e> <s> that deep personal interest goes back for over years when as a schoolboy my holidays on the continent were precluded by seasickness between dover and calais and ended by seasickness between ostend and dover <e> <s> i was comforted with the thought that i might live to see a more sensible method of getting between britain and the continent <e> <s> all sorts of improvements have been made <e> <s> ships are more stable travel by aircraft is now commonplace <e> <s> but fundamentally the difference that is made to this country in its relations with the continent by the lack of direct communication for either passengers or freight can be much underestimated and perhaps in looking at european developments over the past few years has been much underestimated <e>", "<cs> my lords we are going to the hybrid bill procedure and we shall hear whether there will also be a debate on the white paper <e> <s> the hybrid bill procedure gives the opportunity for lengthy parliamentary discussion and through the select committee for hearing objectors <e> <s> if we look at the precedents for who is eligible to object it seems to me that they go well beyond those who are merely locally affected <e> <s> indeed it would be open to any people who believe that their employment or other interests are affected to make representations at that time <e> <s> however i should like to ask my noble friend who is to reply to convey to the secretary of state one suggestion in respect of procedure <e> <s> there is a good argument for saying that in the hybrid bill procedure we should have a joint select committee of the two houses rather than repeating the select committee procedure in each house <e> <s> the arguments adduced by petitioners would be exactly the same <e> <s> it would be a repetition of material that was already public <e> <s> and it is costly to the petitioners who can be represented by counsel and so forth if they have to go through the same procedure twice <e> <s> i have consulted the authorities and also erskine may and there are precedents on a hybrid bill for a joint select committee <e> <s> it would i believe help the petitioners and also possibly abbreviate slightly the total procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister explain why it is that noble lords opposite so frequently refer to the alleged dangers of the american research programme and never refer to the soviet programme on research in space which has been going on for even longer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return to a point which i put to the minister in our debate on th december and which has been obliquely referred to in several questions today namely the procedure for the hybrid bill <e> <s> may i ask whether the government have had any further thoughts about my suggestion that it should be referred to a select committee of the two houses thus minimising the cost to petitioners and maximising the speed at which this very desirable project can be got through <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that at a time when there are grave problems of discipline in our schools it is more to the point to give freedom to teachers to take the measures which they think desirable than to put the decision in the hands of a clutch of continental jurists remote from the scene and gorging themselves on <e>", "<cs> my lords a couple of weeks ago i was asked by the foreign and commonwealth office and <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to follow the argument of the noble lord who has just sat down and i hope that the minister will be able to help the committee <e> <s> my interpretation of what was said by the noble and learned lord lord denning and other noble lords with a legal background was the opposite namely that the code itself even if approved by both houses of parliament was not the equivalent of the <e>", "<cs> obviously i accept the noble lords explanation but i should still like to hear from my noble friend whether the government are convinced that clause in itself provides a sufficient safeguard without the necessity of a code that is to say whether it provides the legal sanctions which exist or ought to exist in all cases of misdoing whether by individuals or companies as has been referred to or by local authorities <e> <s> to me as a layman the debate on the amendment seems to suggest that at any rate the codes do not provide the protection sought for the ratepayers <e> <s> the words advisory or non-advisory seem almost irrelevant <e> <s> whatever is said apparently the code can have no legal effect <e> <s> i should like to hear what the governments view now is on their powers to safeguard the ratepayer <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that it is not mr gorbachev who should be depressed but the people of the soviet union <e> <s> after a five-hour speech from mr gorbachev no hope has been offered to them for alleviating the burdens under which they suffer including self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is privileged in discussing so important a subject as this to have heard first from the exponent of radicalism where higher education is concerned and then a reply by one of the most notable representatives of the academic establishment <e> <s> so your lordships have had both the case for radical change and the case for evolution <e>", "<cs> my lords it must at least be refreshing to your lordships when most of our bills deal with matters where we have to guard against ill faith or bad behaviour to have a bill before us which takes so elevated a view of human nature that it can do without sanctions altogether <e>", "<cs> we are talking about the creation or the revision of institutions <e> <s> there are two ways of approaching a problem of that kind <e> <s> one is to ask what are the functions that we wish to see performed and how can we see them performed most efficiently <e> <s> the other is to start with an ideology and see whether we can create something in its image <e>", "<cs> if i may i come back to this point partly because i think that the noble lord lord mcintosh misunderstood my last intervention <e> <s> my reason for emphasising functions was not that i expected that functions could be or necessarily should be dealt with at the same time as the composition of <e>", "<cs> one can appreciate the motives of the noble lord lord taylor in moving this amendment but it is so vague in its make-up and in its possible effects that i believe it would need more time to be explained perhaps at another stage <e> <s> for example it is not clear whether there are to be additional co-opted members or whether the number of co-opted members is as it were to be used up exclusively for that purpose in some or all areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary in addressing your lordships house to declare an interest in the matter under consideration <e> <s> perhaps the converse should be true and so i wish to declare that i am totally disinterested in the subject under debate this afternoon <e> <s> i rarely visit edinburgh i do not drive a motor car and therefore i have no personal information or desire for further information on the substance of the subject <e> <s> in fact my disinterest is such that i might almost be described as uninterested <e>", "<cs> i have of course listened to this debate with the greatest of care <e> <s> i am fortified in my original convictions by the unusual circumstance in this chamber of feeling that i am in agreement with the <e>", "<cs> the difference seems to me to be a verbal one since had an amendment been put forward that the local authorities in reviewing their curriculum should pay no attention to the views of the secretary of state would the noble lord lord mcintosh have been supportive of that <e> <s> does he suggest that it is or would be proper for local authorities not to pay attention to what are or what would have been stated as national priorities <e>", "<cs> i am very perplexed by the amendment of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> he seems to want to do things in the most difficult way possible <e> <s> on an earlier amendment when i suggested a much simpler way of dealing with the matter to have a curriculum of a kind which it would be difficult to abuse he said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out to the noble lord who has just spoken that though that is true this particular local authority is responsible for a very large number of children it is the largest local authority in the country <e> <s> as a member of the jewish faith i should also like to point out to him that this local authority area includes a very large number of jewish children whose families are deeply insulted by a publication of this kind <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee although moved perhaps moved to tears by the recollections of lord mcintoshs painful childhood will not go on to believe that it should legislate in the light of that experience <e> <s> i was more fortunate in my schooling although it is true that on one occasion on which i had cut pt in order to go to an exhibition of paintings by picasso i was told that if i had been a little younger i would have been beaten <e> <s> but in fact i was not <e>", "<cs> my lords my reason for finding no difficulty in supporting the recent decisions of her majestys government are those which have been stated so eloquently by the noble lord lord home of the hirsel by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and with great depth if i may say so because he was clearly not committed in the same kind of way in a party political way by the noble lord lord saint brides <e> <s> i therefore do not propose to cover the same ground but propose rather to take up a point made by both the two most recent speakers in your lordships debate and before that by the noble lord lord gladwyn in which it was suggested that the terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that many of us who travel in the superannuated cattle trucks that southern region provides on its main lines look with envy upon the comfortable and usually half-empty trains to gatwick <e> <s> can there not be some redistribution of comfort <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of our pleasant ceremony last wednesday it may be thought indelicate to refer to the defeat of the spanish armada <e> <s> nevertheless that is a reminder of the long history of the importance attached to the backup for the fleet and particularly to the role played in this by the west country <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the question asked by the noble lord the leader of the opposition is my noble friend aware that there are well over <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene between the noble baroness lady phillips and the noble lord lord mcintosh it seems to me that a lot of the argument depends on what is thought of in terms of the amount of time that would be devoted <e> <s> the word training means all sorts of things <e> <s> if you are talking about training for a man to pilot an aircraft then this is a matter of months or in some cases of years <e> <s> or are you thinking of something which could be done on a saturday afternoon just learning the rules of committee procedure <e> <s> or is there something in between <e> <s> unless we know the density as it were of the training and the amount of time which governors are supposed to spend on it we cannot answer the question as to how much the support would cost <e> <s> nor do i think we can altogether estimate the willingness of governors to submit themselves to training in addition to the work that they already do <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not only join as is customary in the thanks to the mover of the motion the noble baroness lady seear for calling our attention to this important subject but i must also congratulate her on the versatility that enables the noble baroness after withdrawing a motion full of party rancour to make a statesmanlike appeal for all-party coming together to investigate the problem <e> <s> it is perhaps regrettable although not from my point of view that the noble lord lord mcintosh found it impossible to follow the noble baroness into that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that revelation about the indifference of the post office to the convenience of the general public <e> <s> is he aware that for many years for as long as i can remember and that goes back a long way principal post offices have supplied among other things national sets of telephone directories which enabled people not only to verify telephone numbers but if they were uncertain about addresses initials or names of firms to check these before they posted their letters thus assisting the post office in its primary duty of correctly delivering correspondence <e> <s> it seems very peculiar that this duty has somehow vanished <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that one of the things most constantly said in criticism of the soviet union and its appalling secrecy is that it is the only country in which telephone directories are not publicly available <e> <s> are we to understand that her majestys ministers and british telecom are now in a conspiracy to set up a totalitarian regime in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone will feel the general relief that must be felt thoughout the country particularly by parents at the ending of this dispute even though someone with as suspicious a mind as i have may think that its timing and the collaboration of mr radice are not wholly to be disregarded in their political effects <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend a question relating particularly to his reply about further resources <e> <s> does not the whole history of this dispute show once again the illogicality of a system in which an important body of people namely the teachers are employed by one lot of people the local authorities and in the end paid for by central government <e> <s> is it not time that this anomaly was removed and that the teaching force as in all other european countries became direct employees of the government who actually pay them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh has i think contrived to suggest that this is a sort of mean a mid-point between those like myself and the noble lord lord houghton who believe that there should be a bigger role for central government in the curriculum and those who would prefer that it should be wholly a matter for individual schools <e> <s> i must say that if i am appealed to in that way i am not prepared to go along with the noble lord because my own feeling is that of all the partners the local authorities are the least qualified to deal with matters of curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord pitt for having called our attention to something which must be in the forefront of any governments consideration of the educational problem namely the importance of recognising that one of the clear dangers in our schools is the evidence which is unfortunately growing of degrees of racial prejudice which tend to make education more difficult for both those who are the victims of prejudice and those who express it <e> <s> nevertheless i would find myself unable to support this amendment in the way it is phrased because i find it very hard to see that the swann report tackles all the issues which are raised by this serious question <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister agree that more important than new stations is the point that trains should run between certain existing stations for instance between brighton and oxford as they used to run <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to disagree with my noble friends lord renton and lord trenchard but i feel as a back bencher on this side of the house who also saw the text only when i arrived in the house this morning that it is not the way such an important matter should be dealt with <e> <s> i agree that there is a mischief to be corrected but there is a variety of ways in which that mischief could be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not take up the challenge to rehearse our arguments <e> <s> i rise merely on a point of drafting <e> <s> i suspect that the noble lord lord mcintosh like other people has been in a hurry because if modified is changed to interpreted surely he should have wanted the words if at all removed <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that we must look at all possible sources for the reluctance of some americans to visit us <e> <s> may i call his attention to a remark made to me by an american who frequently visits this country and has done so over many years <e> <s> what depresses him is what he finds for the first time this year concerted anti-american propaganda of which we have had some very marked examples in questions in your lordships house in recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak about this bill with if i may say so a certain proprietorial sense <e> <s> it is years ago long before the births of our two excellent maiden speakers this afternoon that i published my first book under the title of

whether he is aware of the steady deterioration of services on southern region <e> <s> perhaps i may give him the example that a journey from oxford to brighton which used to be by through-train taking two hours minutes now involves two changes of train and is timed to take four hours <e> <s> may i further ask the noble viscount whether he is aware of a continuous and expensive publicity campaign by british rail to dress up deteriorating services as though they were improved services <e> <s> finally does the noble viscount agree with me that to call southern region network south east only makes sense on the assumption that a net is something in which you catch helpless commuters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i hasten to assure the minister and ask him whether he is aware that i certainly had no idea of privatisation in mind when i asked my original question <e> <s> i was cured of any interest in privatisation by his noble friends defence of british telecom <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether he will suggest to his right honourable friend that as part of the channel tunnel deal the french railways which run very well take over the whole of southern region <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> has he noted in the press or perhaps he knows from other sources that in the autumn both the post office and british telecom plan to raise charges to the consumer on the grounds of increased costs <e> <s> i should like to ask whether a meeting of the kind that i have suggested perhaps with the addition of the director general of oftel if the minister can afford another drink might come to the conclusion that these costs could be lowered if for instance telephone directories were available in the post office and post codes were available in telephone directories <e>", "<cs> my lords it was suggested by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham that the house should in some way express its displeasure at the attitude of <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that there is very considerable indignation in this country at the blackmailing of her majestys government by certain commonwealth <e>", "<cs> have not the noble lord who has just spoken and others who are lawyers consistently diverted our attention during the debate from the core of it which is a need to defend persons in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords under the rules of this house my five-year membership of the law sub-committee of your lordships european communities committee comes to an end with this session <e> <s> i shall not use the occasion to traverse again the ground in relation to parliamentary scrutiny which has been so fully expounded by the noble and learned lord lord templeman and my noble friend lord broxbourne <e>", "<cs> is it not surprising that from these benches someone should have endeavoured to quote the prime minister in opposition to the principle of this bill <e> <s> this bill is the result of negotiations carried on by the prime minister as the senior statesman in europe with her colleagues <e> <s> it is unimaginable that the single european act would have been put before us but for the support of the prime minister <e> <s> in an afternoon of topsy-turvy argument it seems to me that to quote the prime minister against the principle of this bill goes very far <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that our anxieties have been considerably allayed by mr kinnocks announcement that it is proposed to raise a home guard among british residents on the continent to support the army of the rhine <e> <s> are there not also reliable reports that the russian red army is now shaking in its shoes <e> <s> is it therefore perhaps unnecessary to consider the problem of deterrence any more <e>", "<cs> if i may explain why the noble earl the minister has not received any support from the people behind him it is because his arguments are without value <e> <s> we on this side of the committee cannot always be relied upon to support any ministerial argument

the house agree that it is improbable that our procedure committee or a special committee could do much about the volume of legislation but that it is important to see that we make the best of the legislation that comes before us <e> <s> in that connection will my noble friend agree that there are few legislative bodies in the world that command the range of expert knowledge that this house does and even fewer which make so little use of it through their own procedures notably what has now become the totally impracticable notion that the details of long and important bills can satisfactorily be considered in a committee of the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can assure the house that it was made clear by the foreign and commonwealth secretary that common action against terrorism is regarded by many people in this country as a litmus test of the validity of the communitys commitment to act together <e> <s> in that connection is it true as is reported in the press today that the greek foreign minister went so far as to say that he did not believe the evidence presented by the british foreign secretary or the conclusion of a british court of justice <e> <s> as this is not the first time by any means that greece has taken up a stand hostile to the interests of this country and her allies ought not the question of the status of greece in the community be looked at very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite what the noble lord lord mcintosh said public pronouncements have been made by members of the staff of ruskin college that trade union solidarity and trade union principles must rank as more important than other aspects of freedom <e> <s> if that turns out to be the case is it not proper that the trade union movement rather than the public purse should support this no doubt very valuable and important institution <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a privilege to someone born when the noble

it intact so far as further education is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that we should not observe our solemn obligations <e> <s> obviously as a nation we always should <e> <s> i

<s> no doubt the government can enlighten us on that point <e> <s> my information is that they are represented on burnham and therefore have been represented in the negotiating committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps noble lords can consider one other aspect of this matter which i do not believe has been mentioned <e> <s> the whole purpose of the limited period of a temporary and interim bill was to provide not only breathing space for permanent conditions to be negotiated which would require new primary legislation but also to give the maximum incentive to the people concerned to come to an agreement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ritchie is trying to make an exception for this advisory committee <e> <s> in relation to the educational world the university grants committee which is an advisory committee has always had its chairman and other members appointed because the duties of a chairman may be different from the duties of other members of the committee who may have particular interests <e> <s> being a chairman is not everyones cup of tea but some people are very good at it <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due thanks to my noble friend lady cox this has been a disappointing debate as a debate although individual contributions will read well in <e>", "<cs> my lords for someone who has called the noble baroness lady cox an extremist the charge of unfairness is hard to make stick <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble and learned lord would agree that i have been accused of unfairness <e> <s> i am not convinced that that case can be made out <e> <s> i shall read the noble baronesss speech to see whether i have misinterpreted her <e> <s> i can only say that the most impressive speech from the other side of the house was made by the noble lord lord taylor but i believe that the noble and learned lord was not in the chamber at the time <e> <s> the noble lord began by saying that of course we must react in a hostile fashion against this kind of thing <e> <s> he began in that way and that is what i hoped the noble baroness would do <e> <s> however as it is late i think it would be wrong to go into personal arguments of this kind because other important things should be said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord agree with me that the reduction from years to years for the closure of documents was made in the interests of historians <e> <s> there is no discontent in that profession <e> <s> it was never thought that the reduction was to enable people to make party policital points in either house of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house has observed some discrepancy between the attitude of the noble baroness lady seear who moved this series of amendments and the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey who is keen for his troops to go into the lobby in favour of them <e> <s> it seems to me that the difference could be expressed in this way the noble baroness says love my baby the noble lord says love the baby but for gods sake dont look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been talking about precedent <e> <s> i wonder whether there is a precedent for putting into a domestic act a precise reference to international obligations <e> <s> i should have thought it is a pre-supposition of any bill which is presented to parliament that the government who present the bill have made certain that it is not in violation of international agreements <e> <s> we do not find references to a bill being in accord with for example the charter of the united nations or the european convention on human rights <e> <s> therefore to put such a reference into this bill even given the assurances perhaps particularly given the assurances that the government have given would seem a very odd procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by craving the indulgence of the minister and of the noble lord lord sherfield that i may not be here for their winding up speeches for the reasons already given i very much hope that the authorities who conduct our affairs will look into the question of having our business unnecessarily interrupted earlier in the day and making this debate even later than it would have been in the normal course of events <e>", "<cs> my lords i was travelling the other day by bus from oxford to london in company with an eminent historian and our conversation turned to what would happen if the university of cambridge were to ask our advice as to the candidates for the forthcoming vacancy for the regius chair of modern history <e> <s> as we went down the list of persons who were academically and personally qualified we discovered one by one that each of those people in recent years has emigrated to the united states of america <e> <s> our discussion assumed that the university of cambridge would have the funds to continue to support the chair <e> <s> so far as oxford is concerned frozen chairs are a major fact of the universitys life <e> <s> that is the situation in brief of our two most ancient and famous universities after a long period of care by the university grants committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all thank the noble lord lord home of the hirsel not only for introducing this debate but also for the fact that he set us on the right path by pointing out that both the great countries to which we are directing our attention are in the process of change <e> <s> it is variously estimated but on the fact of change i think there is no disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend share my amazement that the labour party which derives its inspiration from those two very active heterosexuals karl marx and friedrich engels now seems determined to confine its appeal to homosexuals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend two questions about the emancipation of the polytechnics which i believe to be the most important part of the statement <e> <s> we are told that they are to have corporate status <e> <s> does that mean that they will have the power to award their own degrees that is to say will they be emancipated from the cnaa as well as from the local authorities which i think would appeal at any rate to the larger and stronger among them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that both the frequency and reliability of brighton bus services have much improved since deregulation <e> <s> i now feel thoroughly justified in the time that i spent on the bill deregulating them <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to have escaped the notice of your lordships that the whole of this debate is out of order <e> <s> the order paper refers to a green paper <e>", "<cs> i know that conferences have been the lifeblood of the trade union movement but this again is an historical fact and an historical accident <e> <s> it was splendid no doubt for people who had been down the mine or on the shop floor to find a reason to have a week at the seaside <e> <s> it is hardly necessary for those workers in the teaching profession who enjoy the longest holidays of any employed group in the country <e> <s> their complaints about lack of time would <e>", "<cs> my lords you will not expect me to follow the interesting account that we have been given about agricultural education <e> <s> i can only sympathise with my noble friend on the front bench at having to get up in an hours time to deal with yet a new area of expertise <e> <s> i do not propose to burden her with any questions <e>", "<cs> my lords no i would not suggest that it is always true <e> <s> the example of the open university is a good one <e> <s> clearly until we had it we could not measure the demand <e> <s> the noble lord will be as aware as i am that the demand did not in fact come altogether from the quarters whence it was first thought it would come <e> <s> it has in fact recruited a student body which is rather different socially from what was envisaged in the literature of the early period <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord wish to interrupt again <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course the case <e> <s> as the noble lord has raised the question of the open university i shall refer to one point that he made in his speech which i think is rather important when we are discussing wider access <e> <s> i yield to no one in my detestation of the a level criterion for university admission <e> <s> it is not a good predictor <e> <s> but there is something other than prediction in relation to previous studies at a school or pre-higher education level and that is the degree to which one has something upon which to build <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal will not expect me to follow her speech which dealt with matters upon which she is an acknowledged authority and which was given to us with her usual combination of hard-headed facts and generous emotion <e> <s> housing is a grave and important subject but it must be for others <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is general agreement in the universities in industry in this house and on the part of the government that we wish to see science talent retained in this country <e> <s> will the minister accept that what we are complaining about is that the government seem to take little account of the views of these other bodies as to how this desirable end is to be obtained <e> <s> if the <e>", "<cs> i have not heard any members of the committee who have spoken on this amendment so far answer what seems to me the very valid point made by my noble friend lord morris that subsection of the amendment asks that the french government amend the treaty <e> <s> that is asking a great deal of this government and they would be asking a great deal of the french government <e> <s> presumably these issues were thoroughly canvassed when the treaty was negotiated <e> <s> one might add that while the concept of an eminent or cloutworthy person independent of government may be a familiar feature in this country in relation to certain aspects of government it would be rather unfamiliar to the french government <e> <s> i have never met an eminent frenchman whom i would describe as wholly independent of the french government <e> <s> i doubt whether such a person exists <e> <s> is it then perhaps intended to suggest to the french government that a person of another nationality be appointed <e> <s> he could hardly be an american because with the difference in time his ability to ring up the secretary of state at the right moment would be very hard to calculate <e>", "<cs> i feel that as has been pointed out appendix and the other measures proposed to be taken by eurotunnel are an adequate safeguard against animals finding their own way <e> <s> however i remain worried about part of the amendment now before us that is to say animals carried to a number of different railway destinations <e> <s> it is probably very difficult to have adequate provision at all the railway stations at which trains may call in the end <e> <s> a far simpler method of dealing with this severe risk is to say that no live animals may be transported on vehicles or trains travelling through the tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords if an author could ever find it possible to say something nice about his publisher i would begin by congratulating the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> as it is i must limit myself to congratulating the noble baroness lady blatch which i do with great enthusiasm because i not only learnt a great deal from her speech as i am sure did many noble lords but also agreed with it <e>", "<cs> my lords as this debate among others has illustrated it is characteristic of political debate that people who disagree question each others good will or question each others ability to imagine the problems that they are asked to confront <e> <s> i suggest on the contrary that failures in politics and to fail to deal with the problem we are dealing with today would be a major failure come almost entirely from lack of an intellectual appreciation of what is involved <e> <s> it is failures in thinking which underlie failures in policy <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that since the main obstacle to such an embargo appears to be the position on the security council of the soviet union the noble lord might ask his noble friend lord jenkins of putney to use up some of his brownie points at the kremlin to persuade them to support the arms embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord that statements repeated in this house cannot be seen on television <e> <s> that is part of our agreement on televising the house <e> <s> his argument therefore does not apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but in fact when statements are repeated in this house as they frequently are at present the television cameras have to switch off <e> <s> that is the rule <e> <s> the public may be mystified but people would be just as mystified if the statement were not given <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that those big firms who take this problem seriously as they should tend to send their people on intensive courses in the country concerned <e> <s> one can learn more in two months in germany than during a whole a-level course in any school or polytechnic <e> <s> will arrangements be made for firms to consult each other about the best method of training for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike most speakers taking part in debates on science i am not a member of your lordships advisory committee on science and technology <e> <s> that is not of my own choosing <e> <s> however it gives me the opportunity to approach the subject in a way which implies no collective responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that deterrence depends very largely on creating uncertainty is it not undesirable that her majestys government should be pressed to make statements on matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords no one thinks it peculiar that the subject we are debating today should have been proposed by the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> it is clear to most people in this country who think about these matters that the world economy and our own prosperity are so closely interlinked that to discuss one without the other would be pointless <e> <s> however i think we have to remember as did the noble lord lord richardson in a maiden speech which illuminated so much for us that this is a peculiar feature of this country <e> <s> it is a feature of japan <e> <s> it is not a feature to the same extent of all our partners in the european community and above all it is not a feature of the united states of america <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> therefore it is enormously important that we should lose no opportunity to explain to those countries and their rulers who are beginning to feel pressure from their populations to improve their economic performance using whatever language and whatever context we can that there is a chance for the world to advance by the introduction of a new purchasing power which would at the same time provide a new locomotive if i may use a simile already heard in the debate <e> <s> otherwise it seems to me that at best we shall go around in a circle <e> <s> it is rather as though in the th century people discussing the economy were to have concentrated entirely on the exchanges between florence and flanders on the very eve of the discovery of the new world <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not disappoint the noble lord lord jenkins of putney by doing other than agree with him on one point which he made toward the end of his interesting speech namely that this is no time for euphoria <e> <s> however i agree with that statement for a rather different reason <e> <s> i do not deny that in other parts of the world there are serious and grave problems which could lead to conflict but my worry relates to the soviet union itself <e> <s> i am concerned not as will no doubt be argued by some hardline members of the senate because i mistrust mr gorbachev or doubt his sincerity and his wish to achieve further measures of disarmament but precisely because i believe that he is making a genuine effort to reconstruct i suppose that is the best <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord denning is a little unfair to your lordships in his assumption that the rest of us have not read the cases <e> <s> i read them in part because my son was unfortunately the losing counsel in those cases on behalf of the united kingdom government <e> <s> however i also did so for the more general reason that i wanted to look at an area in which the european convention has operated which was not as familiar perhaps as the question of press freedom and so on to which the other layman to take part in the debate the noble lord <e> <s> lord mcgregor of durris referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rare that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby speaks on any subject without casting new light upon it <e> <s> i am delighted with and i hope that the government have taken note of his constitutional objections to clause <e> <s> it is true that under the parliament act the house is not supposed to discuss the levying of money which is rightly the sole prerogative of the elected chamber <e> <s> however if the government and your lordships accept this point it obviously applies to the community charge <e> <s> if the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is right the community charge bill would not be a matter which will occupy us for laborious nights and days because it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i would myself have preferred the answer to be no <e> <s> in listing the ways in which the opposition has approached the bill the other point i want to raise is this continued blurring of the rightful distinction between national and local politics doing this in some cases by sleight of hand or forms of argument which are really a little difficult to take <e> <s> i know of course that it is absolutely right and the noble lord lord mcintosh is within his rights to remind us that the federal government of the united states uses contract compliance <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord mcintosh would give me his attention <e> <s> i am referring directly to something he quoted <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh is within his rights in saying that under president reagan the federal government of the united states makes massive use of contract compliance in order to bring about certain social objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords states are not parallel to local authorities <e> <s> local authorities in this country are the creation of parliament in some cases the states in the united states as the noble lord well knows regard themselves as prior to the federal government <e> <s> they certainly are not its creatures <e>", "<cs> my lords was the noble lords postman aware that only half the dogs owned in this country are owned by people who have dog licences <e> <s> those victims may well have been bitten by unlicensed dogs <e> <s> does that not make it absurd to think of licences as any form of protection for postmen <e> <s> i am all for protection <e> <s> however the licence does not give it <e>", "<cs> my lords one aspect of british culture which we have not been very good at exporting is the tradition of ordered debate <e> <s> it is practised in this country in four notable chambers the cambridge union the oxford union the house of commons and the house of lords <e> <s> our maiden speaker this afternoon has distinguished himself unusually by attaining high office in all of the first three of those <e> <s> no doubt this afternoon is the prelude to another successful debating career among your lordships <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my sympathy with the point made by the noble lord lord dean of beswick about the importance to this country of having more and more widespread facilities in a number of sports for which we cater less well than do some other countries <e> <s> in this connection i should like to ask the minister whether supposing that sport and leisure were added to the bill in the way that is being suggested it would be possible for a local authority to make it a condition of a contract to run a sports centre or similar installation that the contractor must also put in a capital sum and add to the facilities available <e> <s> if such a condition were imposed and if it could be made into a profitable concern there is no reason why capital should not be invested from the private sector <e> <s> if this were to be a possible item in a contract it seems to me that some of the anxieties of the noble lord lord dean may be met <e>", "<cs> i should not like it to be thought that in order to oppose this amendment it is necessary to carry admiration for the apartheid regime in south africa to the extent that the noble lord lord paget has done <e> <s> the trouble is that abhor that regime as we must we do not know how to improve the situation there <e> <s> what is being urged upon us by the so-called anti-apartheid movement is counter-productive and bound to be so because the refusal to buy goods whether one calls it sanctions or not is of little moment <e> <s> the refusal to buy goods as has been said by other noble lords can result only in unemployment whatever country one applies it to <e>", "<cs> the speech just delivered by the noble baroness is the best argument that i have heard against the amendment now before us <e> <s> she is saying that individual employers in parts of the country will increasingly need to make use of women in their employment <e> <s> if that is so the law does not need to intervene <e> <s> everyone is out to get the best possible employees <e> <s> everyone is out to give the maximum training to those who are insufficiently trained <e>", "<cs> there is another answer to the extraordinary argument just advanced by the noble lord <e> <s> after all we are talking about schools which are fundamentally at the root of this clause as i shall endeavour in a moment to demonstrate <e>", "<cs> i was hoping not to have to intervene again but after the speech we have just listened to with its farrago of insinuations which repeat some that were made by the noble lord and his colleagues yesterday i feel that i must come back to express the genuine anxieties on this side of the committee about the campaign that is being waged against this clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misrepresented the noble lord <e> <s> i would hate do that <e> <s> i am delighted to know that the interests of the child are paramount <e> <s> my view is that to make it possible for homosexual couples without any form of conscience to inflict an <e>", "<cs> my lords while we must all sympathise with seor mayor in his endeavours to cleanse the augean stables of unesco is it not a fact that the money we have saved from our subscription to that body is being more usefully and directly employed in the commonwealth scholarship scheme <e> <s> is it not important that we should consider matters of that kind before any question of rejoining the organisation is taken up <e>", "<cs> my lords quizzes are rather fashionable at the moment so i will begin with one <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be a mistake to use our question time for trespassing on matters which we shall be discussing in great detail when the bill referred to comes before us <e>", "<cs> my lords this house has many merits and it has certain defects <e> <s> the principal defect in my humble view is a tendency to self-congratulation <e> <s> it contains we contain among ourselves persons who have held high office in the service of government heads of notable departments of state and other persons with great and valuable experience in public life <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead when he put forward his motion was hoping to generate a debate which would enable us to call on their experience as well as on that of the two or three holders of high ministerial office who have graced our proceedings this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i do not interpret clause to the same extent as noble lords opposite suggested <e> <s> i believe everyone here agrees with the noble baroness who moved the amendment that the trade union movement like any other important national institution which seeks efficiency must be able to employ persons of competence and expert knowledge to perform both the advisory and in some cases the administrative tasks which are called for <e>", "<cs> i was not straining at the leash as the noble lord lord mccarthy implied <e> <s> however after hearing the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton it is worth pointing out that the arguments of the intellectual gymnasts who oppose this clause need to be looked at <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will accept this amendment <e> <s> indeed i hope that everyone will accept it for one very simple reason which has nothing to do with the possibility of manipulation ballot-rigging or whatever it is called <e> <s> it is normal and customary in all elections in all bodies and the noble lord lord wedderburn is keen to call our attention to bodies other than trade unions that the function of issuing ballot papers and compiling a list of candidates is the responsibility of the same person who is responsible for seeing that these are collected and properly counted <e> <s> in parliamentary elections the returning officer has been a major feature of the british scene for a century and more and other smaller electorates for example clubs normaly follow the same procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords after a most interesting debate i am sure that your lordships would not wish to stand further in the way of the noble lord lord mayhew in his efforts to bring peace to the middle east <e> <s> i shall not endeavour to go over any of the ground that has been covered except to say that even so a great deal has not been covered <e> <s> in regard to energy resources no one has mentioned biologically produced energy <e> <s> there is for example methane from waste which may become and in some countries is already an important energy source <e> <s> perhaps most surprising of all no one has mentioned the experiment on nuclear fusion which has been going on at great expense only partly covered by this country at culham in oxfordshire <e> <s> the fact that we could spend the afternoon on energy and not discuss something which if it happened would revolutionise all our thinking on the subject shows what there still would be if we had a further debate <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the thrust of these amendments i rise to express a nagging fear that the noble lord lord mottistone to continue with our nautical metaphor may have muddied the waters by saying that persons who had been appointed from pepys onwards to boards in service departments and so on took an active part in policy-making <e> <s> it seems to me that though this would depend on the personalities involved when jackie fisher was first sea lord he had a considerable input into naval policy <e> <s> but there has always been in our system the ultimate responsibility of the minister concerned and his cabinet colleagues to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the criticism that has been directed against the teaching of history for the gcse especially in east sussex <e> <s> will she ensure that history is taught in a way which leads children to know about the past and not just to sympathise with the so-called empathy of their teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of the anxieties which the noble lord lord swann has expressed <e> <s> as with other issues involved in the universities part of this bill it seems to me that the proper procedure is to continue the negotiations putting forward constructive suggestions which allowed as the noble lord agreed a considerable measure of improvement in another place <e> <s> we hope when we come to committee stage that these suggestions will enable some of these problems also to be solved <e> <s> the difficulty is as the noble lord agrees largely a question of finance <e> <s> to what extent should the financial controls which central government operate elsewhere be applied <e> <s> can they be applied to institutions of higher education and particularly to research <e> <s> i believe we may still have to face a total recasting of university finances and at that point perhaps some of these problems will seem less acute than they do to us in the universities today <e>", "<cs> i find it extraordinary that once again the noble lord lord glenamara gives away his case <e> <s> he says and is probably right that our education at the primary level is the best in the world <e> <s> one then has to ask how enormously bad must education be at the secondary level when it fails to achieve on this fine basis the kind of results which as the noble baroness lady young pointed out seem available to children of equal ability in our neighbouring countries <e>", "<cs> the case for dealing with gifted children if the noble baroness wishes me to extend my remarks can be met by flexibility in the time taken to cover the foundation subjects <e> <s> if a child is able enough to reach the year-old standard at the age of in for example history he can then study physics or latin <e> <s> that is the way to treat the able child not by removing the foundation subjects which should be the subjects for the whole school <e> <s> on the whole i believe this to be a basic concept with perhaps bureaucratic problems arising from children with special needs and so on directed towards a perceived need <e> <s> both sets of amendments which seek to change it seem to run against the main aims of the bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord joseph on thinking over where his true allegiance lies educationally that is to those with whom he is most concerned will see that he is not doing his best for those children by opposing the bill <e>", "<cs> if i had been trying to keep out as the noble lord suggests any form of ideology from a discussion on this point i would hardly have quoted professor ted wragg who is a notable exponent of a perfectly legitimate left-wing ideology as regards education <e> <s> that does not fortify in any way the noble lords case <e>", "<cs> then the noble lord is in favour of imposing a national curriculum <e> <s> if i have been mistaken perhaps he will explain where he stands on the national curriculum otherwise it is very hard to deal with his amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case let me confine myself to the amendment as it is put down <e> <s> i find it difficult to reconcile the speech made in its favour with the text of the amendment since the speech indicated that the noble lord believes that the national curriculum should be imposed on all schools outside as well as within the maintained sector <e> <s> however he talks about the duty of the proprietor <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> i believe that one of the tasks of education in this country must be whether or not we put it in the bill in so many words to improve relations between the races <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> my point is rather that where we see in the world within a single political structure genuine multi-culturalism in its full sense we have a recipe for political disaster or at least for political tension <e> <s> no one has yet found how one can have a working democratic political system if supreme power is held in a few hands one can do anything which is not underpinned by the sense of having a single culture <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall be forgiven if i do not immediately follow the train of thought of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby because after our marathon last night i have not the mental agility to cover so many themes in so short a time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to return to a point which has been raised by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne which concerns the responsibilities of the house in relation to legislation of this kind <e> <s> i have to take issue with the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead but i told him that i proposed to do so <e> <s> although he is not in his place i intend to make the remarks i have in mind <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled about whether the amendment which relates to the most important question of open enrolment in a way goes too far in this sense <e> <s> if the noble lord lord stewart is right there is a danger that in choosing a school parents will take their ethnic or indeed their religious convictions into account <e> <s> for example moslem parents would prefer their children to attend school where they would be surrounded by other young moslems and the same situation would apply to white and black children <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is a singular difference between the two halves of the noble lords argument <e> <s> he talked about a constitutional change as though the vote of the parents is the final settlement of the issue <e> <s> then he went on to expatiate on what is more important the role of the secretary of state in considering among other things when asked to make such a decision what the voting of the parents had been <e> <s> it is important to remember that this initial ballot by whatever majority and out of whatever proportion is a triggering instrument for a process that is likely as the noble lord said to take considerable time and bring other voices into its consideration <e>", "<cs> i think that if a member of the ethnic minorities were to have a voice and not just be spoken about it would be a good thing <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with everything which has just been said by my noble friend lord st john of fawsley <e> <s> he pointed to a possible way in which this matter could be resolved <e> <s> i am not privy to the current views on this amendment but the speech of my own spiritual leader the noble lord lord jakobovits the chief rabbi has been referred to <e> <s> but i do not believe that his important speech was intended as a backing for this specific amendment <e> <s> as i understood it it was rather giving a backing to the right reverend prelate in his search for a formula which could appeal to those of all religions in this country <e> <s> to press it beyond that beyond the statement that clearly all religions benefit if religion is taught and understood is unquestionable <e>", "<cs> it seems only yesterday that the noble baroness and i were debating this subject and that i pointed out the folly we had entered into in allowing continental jurists with no knowledge of our own institutions to decide on the method of discipline in our schools <e> <s> i maintain that position <e> <s> i am rather surprised that the noble baroness has not shifted a little in that direction <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble baroness is aware that the chairmanship of the headmasters conference is an office that rotates annually and unless there is a resolution of the conference the chairman for the current year speaks only for himself <e>", "<cs> having been involved in discussions on the bill for so long i find myself somewhat divided on the present subject in the sense that i think that there are reasons for believing i agree here with the noble lord lord trafford that persons from the industrial and commercial world would be incapable of exercising a beneficent influence in this way and that the recruitment of such persons in any numbers would constitute a considerable difficulty <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am like the noble lord lord annan extremely worried after having read the des document to which he referred <e> <s> it was the understanding of many of us that our anxieties about excessive control by the funding councils had been met by the amendments moved at report stage in another place <e> <s> moreover one thought that the secretary of state was now convinced of the necessity to preserve within the scheme of public funding which obviously has its limitations the effective autonomy of the universities <e> <s> one thought that contract might merely be a way of saying that if public money is given to an institution there is clearly some reciprocal duty on the part of that institution to perform the functions for which the money is received <e> <s> no one could possibly object to that requirement <e> <s> indeed it has even been suggested that the present system under the ugc consists of an implied series of contracts <e>", "<cs> after the interesting <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i am a little worried about certain points that have been made from the benches opposite <e> <s> in the first place there has been some exaggeration of the degree to which tenure is applied in american universities <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge the formula of the american association of universitiy professors recognises the subordination of tenure to i think they call it programmatic exigencies <e> <s> that is to say it is not proof against major changes in university policy whether or not induced by financial stringencies <e>", "<cs> i am terribly worried once again <e> <s> i am probably the only person left in the chamber at this hour of the night who has been both a junior lecturer and a professor and who has run what became a university <e> <s> i can find no similarity in my experience of over years in universities with what the noble and learned lord has described <e> <s> when first appointed to the great university of manchester as an assistant lecturer in i was asked to take three courses of lectures <e> <s> one of those was on a special subject <e> <s> and a special subject lecture could have been given by a professor <e>", "<cs> for the record i should point out that although it is true that sir mark richmond held a post in a scottish university some years ago he has long left scotland and is not in a position to speak from first-hand knowledge of a scottish seat <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully disagree with the noble lord lord flowers and the other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> it seems to me quite extraordinary that universities or colleges should carry on their functions not knowing where their students can be reached <e> <s> after all they have to inform their students one hopes about many things connected with their studies <e> <s> they are responsible for paying to them grants or other means of support <e>", "<cs> i have only two brief reasons for supporting the amendment <e> <s> the first is that many of us were asked to support the government in passing the legislation now in force on the basis of what an excellent thing ptas would be and how they would enable the more rational planning of transport to go on <e> <s> i do not like having to turn a somersault unless the evidence can be produced that we made a terrible mistake and that in fact transport is in disarray <e> <s> no such evidence has been produced <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has been a great improvement in bus services in the two towns in which i live brighton and oxford <e> <s> this is very largely due to frequent and well-publicised minibus services <e>", "<cs> the case that has been made by the noble baroness and the noble lord lord carr is unanswerable <e> <s> i think that the government have accepted this <e> <s> i urge upon them that the solution they produce when they come back with one is capable of being generalised and is not too particular and specific <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend lady carnegy of lour made a very important point <e> <s> i do not believe it removes the argument for this particular amendment to the limited extent to which it has been proposed in favour of two major national companies for the very cogent reason advanced by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding that this was an undertaking given <e> <s> all that is being suggested is that it is carried into a new situation in regard to the way in which local finance is raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be aware that there was on the statute book a crime known as infanticide which related to a mother suffering from post-natal depression who put an end to the life of her newly-born infant <e> <s> i cannot imagine why the noble lord lord joseph should wish to commit such a crime <e> <s> we owe the concept of raising education standards in this country by a determined effort of central and local government and the education professions to the noble lords pioneering work when he was secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in the absence through illness of the noble lord the chief rabbi in order that the religious minorities so frequently referred to in this debate may have a voice <e> <s> we remember his earlier speech on the bill and the emphasis that he laid on the need for religion to be taught pure rather than mixed <e> <s> although i have no authority to speak for him it seems to me that the right reverend prelate has come a long way to meet those needs <e> <s> i feel that any member of my faith would be justified in supporting the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there will be no support for the amendment because it has a tendency to push into an inferior position the ethnic and religious minorities which exist in this country and to encourage prejudice against them <e> <s> there is a great difference between saying what is obvious that we have become a country of many races and religions and saying something different that it is multi-cultural because we are then suggesting to those minorities that they cannot participate in the mainstream of the culture in which they and their families will live <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that the government will take this occasion to accept something which comes from the house because unlike possibly some other amendments against which the noble baroness has been obdurate this amendment is squarely in line with the governments philosophy <e> <s> they have said that one of the purposes of the bill is to widen parental choice to increase variety and to improve standards <e> <s> i should have thought that the freedom to choose a better syllabus compared with a poorer syllabus would fit squarely with all three objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the motives of the movers of this amendment understandable but i find the amendment itself very peculiar in the light of what two of the movers have said <e> <s> they talk about race discrimination which is covered under existing legislation and they then state in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is precluded by the rules of the house from replying to the noble lord <e> <s> we are at report stage and not the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most puzzled about the idea of one vote per child <e> <s> what happens if the child has two parents and the parents disagree on the matter which is normal in family life <e>", "<cs> my lords interesting as one finds the proposal of the noble lord lord st john of fawsley i think the house should realise that it is suggesting yet another type of school <e> <s> to put forward at the report stage of a bill of this kind a suggestion that was not tabled either at second reading or at the committee stage puts members of this house at something of a disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that in opposing this amendment i shall not be thought unsympathetic to the idea of scotland as a nation <e> <s> if the noble lord were to bring forward a bill to repeal the act of union or to rebuild hadrians wall he would find no greater supporter than me <e> <s> however we are dealing with something quite specific and concrete namely the application of this principle of scotland being a nation to the present system of universities and their funding <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment if only to make it clear that support for the movers is not confined to the cross-benches and the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> the position of the university of buckingham was raised by the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> it receives no money from central government and indeed is pledged to central government never to ask for money <e> <s> it seems to me that the work of the comptroller and auditor general is to follow the expenditure of money from public funds <e> <s> that point would be met by the amendment moved by the noble lord lord adrian <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before deciding how to vote on this amendment i should be grateful for some clarification <e> <s> it has been suggested by certain proponents of the amendment that what we are dealing with is various categories of poor people who are unable to pay <e> <s> none of us would wish to see a penalty exacted from the kind of people about whom the noble baroness lady faithfull has been talking <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the proposal for a general teaching council was urged in upon sir keith joseph the then <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to touch on only one of the many themes which the noble lord lord stewart of fulham introduced and that is the relationship of the bill to higher education and in particular to universities <e> <s> when the bill was originally published it was greeted throughout the university community irrespective of political party or other allegiance with total dismay <e> <s> it seemed to show an inability to understand the way in which universities function and the kind of atmosphere that is required for them to play their part in the nation s life <e> <s> since then as the noble baroness reminded us we have worked long and hard at those clauses as well as at other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only a couple of remarks to make in joining with the noble lord lord swann to thank the lord chancellor for having improved on our original amendment <e> <s> i am delighted as is he and as i believe the universities will be that this important point has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the benefit of our recess is rapidly receding <e> <s> the house spent the summer protecting the universities against one government department <e> <s> we are back here needing to protect them against another <e> <s> in spite of the remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i must make it clear that the universities as a group as set institutions are extremely worried about the import of this clause <e> <s> it is by no means something confined either to the political opponents of the government on the other side of the house or indeed to persons individually concerned with medical research <e> <s> the reason has partly been that touched upon by the noble lords lord adrian and lord winstanley that free publication is of the essence of academic work <e> <s> one recognises that there are matters concerned with vital national security for which particular arrangements are made <e> <s> however it is difficult to think of anything in medicine which we would not wish to see circulated freely <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who have signed this amendment perhaps i may say that i do not share the approach of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway because it does not seem to me that the financial aspect is at the heart of the matter <e> <s> i think the intention of those who moved the original amendment last week and who took part in the discussions with the minister which have been referred to was very much the same point that was made in this house during the passage of the education reform bill as it referred to universities that any government intervention which may be necessary in the affairs of bodies such as universities or research institutions should normally be made only after consultation with those affected <e> <s> ultimately that was written into the education reform bill and in the form of this amendment will now apply to the department of health in its relations with these bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i share with the noble earl lord halsbury considerable admiration for the paper produced in the london school of economics <e> <s> it offers i believe the possibility of an advance from a system of student funding which sooner or later in one way or another will be reformed <e> <s> however that enthusiasm does not spread to the scheme before us this evening <e> <s> as this is an educational occasion perhaps latin may be permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to agree with the noble lord lord bonham-carter as to the governments action in offering something of a brake to the illusions widespread in europe but existing in this country as to the malleability of the situation that we face in central and eastern europe including the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> will he also confirm to the house that the ufc will be bound by two undertakings given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in the course of the passage of the bill when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords our thanks to the noble lord lord blake must be added to by the fact that it has enabled the house to hear a number of your lordships who have had or who still have particular responsibilities regarding the conservation of historic buildings and treasures both ecclesiastical and secular <e> <s> i believe that i am the first speaker who can claim no such expertise <e> <s> therefore i do not propose <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while it is perfectly true that in japan over per cent <e> <s> of pupils stay on at school after the age of they do so because their parents pay for their education <e> <s> does the minister believe that that is what the party opposite now advocates <e>", "<cs> my lords it is years since i wrote a book on the subject which the noble lord lord jenkins has invited us to consider the general conduct of foreign relations by democratic governments and the relationship of the conduct of such policies to the opinion and political processes of those countries <e> <s> i do not believe that this is an occasion to suggest the outlines of yet another work on the general subject <e> <s> in part i have been convinced by the noble lord and by other noble lords that it is difficult to separate the general question of how the conduct of foreign relations is organised and carried on from specific issues which illustrate the strength or the weakness as one might see it of that particular system <e> <s> i have informed the minister therefore that i shall concentrate on a subject which was touched upon today during question time but which has not so far figured in our debate <e> <s> it is the proposed mediation or intervention of the government of the united kingdom in the making of peace in the arab/israeli dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will permit me to intervene <e> <s> i did not intend to suggest that britain should offer israel arms at the moment <e> <s> i said that after israels withdrawal to frontiers which might appear less defensible britain should make it clear that she would then be impartial in arms deliveries between israel and her neighbours <e> <s> that is an entirely different point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the extreme care taken by the authorities in the united states over the preservation of battlefields of a much less important civil war than ours <e> <s> moreover is it possible to teach children not to commit acts of vandalism when they are set such appalling examples by government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that question time in this house is too valuable to be used for second reading debates on legislation which has not yet come before us <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the british commercial theatre at the moment is enjoying great prosperity and bringing in a great deal of money some of it as we have been told in foreign currency <e> <s> can it not afford to keep a library which is primarily of use to the theatre itself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister in his confidence in the new council agree that as a first step to establishing its confidence more widely it should stop the abuse of university time by sending round silly questionnaires <e> <s> those questionnaires are designed by people with no understanding of how universities operate and they take away time that should be devoted to teaching and research <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred in the statement to meetings or consultations between ministers of the interior of the governments <e> <s> but the statement suggested that these were restricted to looking at the movements of iranian diplomats <e> <s> since it is more than likely that any projected assassins would not be members of the iranian diplomatic corps can we be assured that the interior ministers will look at international cooperation in pursuit of any possible murder squads who may be trying to enter this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend share my bewilderment that noble lords opposite who constantly refer to the damage caused to society by unemployment seem so averse to every measure taken to spread skills in society and so diminish unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that members of both houses of parliament who have been foremost in trying to protect the finance of the universities have been hopelessly frustrated by the actions of university teachers under the aegis of the aut who have imposed a boycott on examinations thus threatening the careers of an entire generation of students <e> <s> is he further aware that in the view of the general public such conduct would suggest that their salaries should be docked rather than increased <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by reassuring the noble lord lord goodman that like other noble lords i have no intention of casting any doubt whatever upon the integrity and competence of my noble friend lord windlesham or of his colleague from the bar <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to accept the view that they honestly came to that this film with one or two omissions or distortions which they refer to was made fairly and was properly commissioned <e>", "<cs> my lords in expressing my gratitude to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for introducing this subject i have the additional pleasure in an education debate of being able to agree with much of his argument <e> <s> it seems to me that we have probably neglected the importance of the supply of teachers particularly in crucial subjects in looking at general reforms with which many of us are in sympathy <e> <s> there is clearly a serious situation to which it is desirable that we should return from time to time with various suggestions put forward as to how to remedy it for example those which have just been put to us by the noble baroness lady lockwood <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> when the noble lord lord stewart and i were pupils at an independent school our teachers came direct with first-class degrees <e> <s> they never underwent any training at all <e> <s> i owe everything i have done in life to those teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply will cast further gloom into an already gloomy university world <e> <s> it is simply untrue that universities need to fill in endless forms in order for public money properly to be controlled <e> <s> the governments purpose in getting universities to teach more students and to do more and better research is being frustrated by the need to switch people from their proper jobs to unnecessary form filling to please the bureaucrats in elizabeth house <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a point that has not been fully ventilated <e> <s> there is a great deal in what the noble lord lord jenkins had to say about the desirability in the last resort of not preventing some great damage to the nation as a whole by concealing a misdeed on the part of a public servant <e> <s> if the matter had stood there i should have thought that one could go along with this amendment <e> <s> however having heard the noble lord lord hatch of lusby i am now convinced that we cannot accept the amendment because it is suggested that it is to be taken much further <e> <s> i say that for this reason <e> <s> if one envisages the situation in which great damage has been averted by some act which is itself unlawful no sensible government would prosecute and no imaginable court would convict <e> <s> in that sense public interest is always implicit in the laws that we make <e> <s> however if we write it into the law and say that there is something very special about public interest which is not the interest as defined by ministers or the civil service superiors of the individual in question but is something about which he should make up his own mind we are doing the opposite of what i am sure the noble lord lord jenkins <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and i have faced each other across this floor in education debates more than once <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure that for once we are agreed although we did not necessarily come to these conclusions by entirely the same route <e> <s> certainly the

lectures and discussions called by the british academy to meditate once more on the great events of <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the speeches of the noble baroness lady blackstone the noble lords

his neighbour on the ministerial bench and said you must answer this for i cannot <e> <s> i do not believe that a case can be made to defend much of what is going on either in respect of the

of alloway is to introduce into this country the system of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow at this hour the agreeable flights of fancy of the noble lord lord paget of northampton because we

he said twice that any future labour government would restore the water industry to public control <e> <s> did he mean by that public ownership because the two things are not identical <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble and learned friend studied the paper by that most distinguished free market economist professor basil yamey of the london school of economics who points out that the probable result of the removal of these so-called restrictions would be to increase the costs of litigation to the ordinary person <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble viscount with respect that when the scheme was originally announced to this house i pointed out that it was a very outline affair in which the collaboration of the financial institutions had not been attained <e> <s> i further pointed out that

improbable event of my finding my way to the horniman museum what will i find in it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that not merely is this accommodation largely used by postgraduate and overseas students with no home in this country and so on but universities and other institutions of higher education are compelled to charge an economic rate <e> <s> they are compelled by the grant-giving bodies to make the best possible use of their accommodation throughout the vacation <e> <s> that leads to the letting of accommodation for conferences and other needs <e> <s> so the amount earned is already known and no special return is needed <e> <s> the grant-giving bodies are already aware of any university that is failing to meet the demands made on it to make the best possible use of its grant <e>", "<cs> my lords sympathy has been expressed and rightly expressed for two admirable teachers who through no fault of their own have been deprived of an opportunity to exercise their professional skills <e> <s> in addition i have a little sympathy for one other person the noble lord on the front bench who will be replying for her majestys government because the record of the department of education and science with regard to this long drawn out problem hardly bears examining <e> <s> as my noble friend lady cox said there are ample opportunities in our legislation for the department to inquire when something appears to be going wrong and it is difficult to think of anything which has gone more wrong and more obviously wrong in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but to live or so miles from a town does not normally lead one to have in the forefront of ones mind the names and occupations of school governors in that town <e> <s> i did not know them myself until i did a little work for the secretary of state preceding his own <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give way <e> <s> did the department inquire into the circumstances of the last election of parent governors <e> <s> it was then strongly stated that some nominations were ruled out because they came in late while others were not <e> <s> i know that that information was conveyed to the department of education and science and it casts a different light on the freedom of election by parents <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is reading his brief i do not know whether he is aware that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to keep interrupting the minister but he seems to have been so badly briefed that it is only fair to do so <e> <s> is he aware that an arrangement was made by the local education authority with dr freeman that he would be offered the post provided he immediately resigned it and did not take it up <e> <s> it was not a question of taking a post

london was devised when very few people required passports <e> <s> however they are now required by almost the whole population <e> <s> therefore why should they not be available at every central post office for example in any town <e> <s> why should their availability be limited to three or four centres when we have not only computers but also fax machines <e>", "<cs> my lords without following the noble viscount down the unprofitable by-ways of comparing unlike with unlike perhaps i may ask him whether he is aware that at their recent meeting the universities totally rejected the current proposals of the universities funding council as inapplicable <e> <s> is he further aware that far from increasing their ability to take on new students the absurd administrative burden which these proposals put on them would mean that all university teachers would have their time wholly taken up with filling in forms and none would have time to teach students <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that in looking at the proposed growth of tourism her majestys government will bend themselves to protecting the amenities of the ordinary citizens of this country <e> <s>

in this debate and no doubt those who will be taking part later have assumed that the holocaust is a fact <e> <s> in particular the noble and learned lord lord hailsham has spoken about the impact that it has made on the jewish mind <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister observed that whenever there is an interview with a representative of one of the reformed movements in eastern europe the person speaks english most fluently <e> <s> does that not make us feel ashamed of our performance in the teaching of languages <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the greatest

profession but the teaching of british government and the british constitution <e>", "<cs> what in fact we had was the traditional home office view the lawyers are a nuisance and a bore and should be sued if they get things wrong but our civil servants immigration officers and all those who answer to the permanent secretary at the home office are men of such incalculable genius confidence and

journey on the london underground in order to familiarise himself with the problems which many of us face more frequently <e> <s> will other members of her majestys government follow that admirable example <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that the effect the summer term has of lowering the status of cricket as our national game is due almost entirely to the

the citizens whom we hope to serve <e> <s> i find this unconvincing <e> <s> it reminds me of the east german playwright bertolt brecht who said the people have lost confidence in the government <e> <s> we must get rid of the people <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that although the noble lord lord peston is entitled to say that he does not like city technology colleges it is a bit much to say that no one likes them <e> <s> i have a great deal of evidence to show that they are widely appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords as another possible consumer i would not venture to be as categorical as the noble baroness but i should like to ask for some explanation <e> <s> let us take the current situation of someone who is possibly involved in litigation and who goes to a solicitor <e> <s> the solicitor tells him that he requires a barrister to be his advocate in court <e> <s> the barrister is then bound by the cab rank rule however interpreted or modified <e> <s> the proposed amendment does not as far as i can read it though i am not a lawyer impose a duty on a solicitor to look into my case as a potential litigant <e> <s> all it says is that if i insist that the solicitor himself acts as my advocate he is entitled to refuse to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps not surprising that i should rise to support the noble earl lord russell the last tory supporting the last whig <e> <s> i speak foremost as a member of my party who is deeply distressed at having to take this line <e> <s> for the past two or three years as many noble lords who are my friends will be aware my principal purpose in attending your lordships house speaking in debates and meeting members of her majestys government has been to try to prevent the growing breach between the academic community at all levels and the government <e> <s> the introduction of the bill into the house after the mauling it received in another place suggests that i have totally failed in my objective and that the government are indifferent to what may go on in the minds of the academic community <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would give way for a moment <e> <s> i thought i had made clear but i thought it was not necessary because the noble lord must know it that even if no maintenance grant is paid a great deal of public money goes into educating anyone who goes to university because the fees come nowhere near the expenses of teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on commonwealth day th march i shall be addressing a seminar of the commonwealth parliamentary association on the subject of the role of a second chamber <e> <s> does he consider that useful <e>", "<cs> there appears to be an inclination on the part of the bills few supporters in this chamber to put forward factual points which are invalid <e> <s> i do not wish to deal with the graduate tax which will be the subject of the final amendment to the bill <e> <s> however there is no question of hypothecation <e> <s> a hypothecated tax is one directed to a particular form of expenditure <e> <s> the universities propose an alternative form of contribution to the general income of the treasury <e> <s> therefore it is misleading and prejudicial to call it a hypothecated tax <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a small point in relation to what the noble baroness lady carnegy said about open university students <e> <s> there is the problem that we are dealing with a bill about student maintenance <e> <s> however i should have thought that attendance at a summer school involves costs largely <e>", "<cs> having put my name to amendment no i should like to make it clear that i support the entire group of amendments <e> <s> on the face of it amendment no <e> <s> seems to be so unexceptional that i cannot even imagine the arguments that the government might have for not accepting it <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies to that invitation perhaps i may make one point which has been borne in upon me during our proceedings today and which has just been reiterated <e> <s> a great many matters will be debated on the regulations and we know that these are now to be under the affirmative procedure <e> <s> while these pledges have been made i wonder whether anyone on the government front bench has worked out the amount of time we shall require on the regulations <e> <s> we usually deal with an order of delegated legislation in a dinner hour <e> <s> sometimes if it involves northern ireland it is a slightly prolonged dinner hour <e> <s> however it would take all our dinner hours for the whole of the summer if all these detailed issues were to come before us in regulations which we are entitled to debate <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have given any thought to the timetable <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to follow the logic of the noble baroness <e> <s> we know that a very high proportion of students at oxford as elsewhere live for the whole or part of their studies in rented accommodation <e> <s> it is not merely as my noble friend lord eccles said a couple of heads of houses who have told him of their anxieties <e> <s> the university of oxford has looked into this <e> <s> the vice-chancellor himself communicated with me and said that this is the immediate issue that is the most disturbing <e> <s> it is not a question of the future but of what happens this autumn <e>", "<cs> the problem we are discussing was brought to my attention not by an academic but by a head mistress from manchester <e> <s> representations from manchester always go straight to my heart <e> <s> her school is a comprehensive which has both boys and girls <e> <s> she pointed out that when pupils wish to go on to higher education she regards herself rightly as she is a graduate from oxford as one of the people in the school to whom they would naturally turn for advice that is advice as to whether they <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give way <e> <s> there is a little matter of house of commons privilege which prevents any member of this house from proposing a tax <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to detain the committee <e> <s> my object has been achieved <e> <s> we have at long last had a discussion on possible alternatives and it may be that in a year or two the government will turn back to the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord dacre has demonstrated that a professional historian need not be timid <e> <s> however some of us are timid and i do not propose in my remarks either to venture to advise her majestys government and in any event they do not often take my advice or to prognosticate <e> <s> that which came most powerfully from the speeches of my noble friend lord home and the noble lord lord cledwyn and other noble lords has been to point out how unexpected in themselves and unexpected in the pace have been the events which we have witnessed in the past few weeks months and couple of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene and i have no views on the amendment which i have only just seen <e> <s> however i respectfully point out to my noble friend the leader of the house that a bill of this kind is not simply a matter for the two main opposition parties <e> <s> it has largely been conducted by noble lords on this side of the house and on the cross-benches <e> <s> i imagine that most noble lords like myself left the house on thursday in the late afternoon or early evening not having had the opportunity of seeing this amendment <e> <s> it had not been brought to our notice and was not so far as i am aware among those which i picked up in the printed paper office <e> <s> i first heard about the problem this morning when i read a report in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the point made by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i happen to agree strongly with the noble baroness lady young that if one were to start again with a system of student support one would not bring in social security <e> <s> one disadvantage of the fact that the social security system is involved is that we have no opportunity and have had no opportunity even during our lengthy discussions to look at the situation of students as a whole particularly the situation of postgraduate students <e>", "<cs> my lords i briefly emphasise the points made by the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> governments of all persuasions tend to underestimate the administrative costs of the policies they adopt <e> <s> this is possible either when those who have to carry them out as the noble earl lord russell said have the means of raising funds to do so or when they apply to institutions which themselves are in an expansive mode as was true of the academic world in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware to take up the point made by the noble lord lord peston that i and no doubt others of my age who were at fee-paying schools a generation or two ago was very satisfactorily taught by teachers whose only satisfactory qualification was a good degree knowledge of the subject and a proper allowance of carrot and stick for those who as the noble lord lord ritchie reminded us may not want to learn at all <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from something that the noble baroness lady young said i think there is a further way in which my noble friend the minister could assist the house <e> <s> the noble baroness said that doubt had arisen because the money that is repaid might be a larger sum in view of inflation than the original sum borrowed and thus people could consider that the student loans company was making a profit <e> <s> however i do not believe that that is a factor that causes anxiety <e> <s> i think it is universally accepted that the student loans <e> <s> company as a wholly government-owned company is not in the business of making a profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to know that the matter is on the agenda and that there is not time now for it to come off <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend was right in assuring us that that was the case <e> <s> he has also said perhaps it goes some way to meeting the point made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock that the government contemplate in the course of those negotiations making a contribution towards the cost <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to this further exchange <e> <s> i think that the noble earl misunderstands the amendment <e> <s> the amendment does not commit the government either to a particular sum of money or and this meets the case put by the noble viscount lord eccles prescribes any particular way in which it should be administered <e> <s> it merely puts on record the fact that the government are committed to meeting the costs of the universities which as the noble lord lord grimond says is what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i cannot understand why the noble earl will not agree to an amendment which does not bind him to more than what he has stated especially in view of the remarks of my noble friend lord renton that this would enable the issue to be considered when the bill returns to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> required means required by her majestys government in order to carry out her majestys governments intentions <e> <s> in the light of that answer <e> <s> i must seek the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the british genius for understatement the noble lord lord peston remarked that i dislike this bill <e> <s> i am afraid that my dislike of it has at times been apparent and may even have caused some irritation among my noble friends <e> <s> on the other hand i do not wish to pursue and it would be wrong to pursue at this stage the reasons for the objections that have been voiced <e> <s> i should rather repeat what i said on second reading namely that my worry was largely that the bill would contribute to the alienation that has taken place <e>", "<cs> before we leave the series of amendments i wish to put forward a point raised most recently by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> there is a confusion which my noble friend has not <e>", "<cs> my lords as some people may believe i differ from my noble friend who has just spoken in that i have never wished to see this bill operational <e> <s> i still prefer that it should be delayed in the hope that even at the last possible moment the government will see the folly of their ways <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in new york yesterday there was an event in central park in honour of earth day <e> <s> i take that to be an environmental cause <e> <s> as a result of the event grave damage was caused to the vegetation of the park and four and a half tonnes of non-recyclable litter was left behind <e> <s> is not the best way of protecting the environment to be very wary of environmentalists <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all had frequent occasion to thank the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for guidance on our constitutional position and the proper practices of this house but this afternoon we are grateful to him again in another respect for raising this as a general issue of national policy and for his cogent suggestions as to possible change <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me to be not uncommon in this house to ask questions of representatives of political parties about documents to which they are publicly committed <e> <s> i have not made and would not venture to make a speech for the noble lord lord mishcon but he often asks questions of this side of the house and that is after all common form in our procedure <e> <s> it would certainly not be for me to speculate on what his answers will be <e> <s> so much then for her majestys would-be government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i brought with me in case someone said that the <e>", "<cs> this might be an opportunity for a member of the jewish community to which the noble lord so generously and feelingly referred to make a few comments <e> <s> i do not differ from him substantially in that it is always desirable that we should consider the present and the future rather than the past <e> <s> however my difference from him and from the movers of the amendment which we are discussing that is the amendment moved by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway may be that we risk confusing ourselves about the present and the future by a too ready acquiescence in the obliteration of the past <e>", "<cs> alleged offences refers to the possibility of the prosecution of alleged offenders <e> <s> it is true that until persons have been prosecuted and conceivably found guilty what is against them is the allegation that they have committed offences <e> <s> to use the words alleged war crimes particularly in the light of some speeches made when the hetherington-chalmers report was debated in this place seems to me to call into question the veracity of those crimes as detailed at considerable length by sir thomas hetherington and mr chalmers <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear and i hope that the committee is delighted to hear that statement <e> <s> the question then arises would it not have been better to put the amendment in that form or to have made the amendment refer specifically to the procedures to which the noble lord objects <e> <s> i do not wish this afternoon to return to or prolong the debate about those crimes <e> <s> it may be more appropriate to so do if and when we have a second reading <e> <s> to have tabled the amendment in those words today prejudices the issue and i hope that the commitee will agree with my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press my noble friend the minister a little further on the issue of western hostages <e> <s> will he confirm that the israeli government have publicly stated more than once that they will return these prisoners if israelis held in arab hands are returned <e> <s> does he agree that this really has nothing to do with the question of western hostages <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me on behalf of your lordships to thank the right reverend prelate for raising a matter that takes us a little above our normal passion for exchanging statistics across the floor of the house <e> <s> the subject that he has raised is an important one and we look forward to it being further illuminated by our two maiden speakers one ecclesiastical and one lay person <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this matter came before her department before she became a spokesman for it in this house and that far from the secretary of state needing to be informed the case has been before him for a long time supported by the union to which the two teachers belong <e> <s> is she also aware that far from the proper procedures having been followed the director of education for east sussex wrote to the press to say that he could understand why other schools would not wish to employ them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the good fortune to live near a marina <e> <s> does my noble friend the minister not agree that one of the great pleasures that affords is to be able to watch people working hard on their boats and then going to sea without having to do either of those things <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord irvine of lairg not only for having brought forward this interesting subject for debate but also for giving the house such an extraordinarily able presentation of the reasons why some noble lords on the benches opposite are removed from the feelings of the mass of the electorate <e> <s> i could not believe that he was serious when he began by quoting professor dworkin <e> <s> i do not suppose that the name of professor dworkin is familiar on the streets of bootle where the electorates temperature is being taken at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may coin a phrase he is the epitome of what new yorkers style radical chic <e> <s> his belief that this country is suffering under some extraordinary tyrannical government is so remote from reality that i was surprised that the noble lord began his speech in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise how difficult it is for a supporter of this bill to address your lordships after the powerful speech that we have just heard from the noble and learned lord lord shawcross and others and before the speeches that we are likely to hear <e> <s> i also accept that those like myself who have lost family friends or relations in these events enter upon this debate with a certain degree of inevitable prejudice <e> <s> that point was put very eloquently by the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> however what i dispute is the use made by the noble and learned lord lord shawcross of the word revenge <e> <s> when john milton said <e>", "<cs> people may not like the company into which they fall my lords <e> <s> i shall therefore attempt to answer a much more serious question <e> <s> it was raised by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> why should we consider this matter now <e> <s> when we last debated it i said to your lordships and i now repeat it that it would probably have been better for everyone if no one had been found as a result of these inquiries if the matter had lapsed by time and if divine vengeance alone was at stake <e> <s> but we are living in the present <e> <s> if i may say respectfully to noble lords who have spoken i believe that there is a certain rip van winkle notion at large here <e> <s> we are talking as though nothing has happened since <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be nice if i were allowed to make my speech <e> <s> i did not interrupt the speeches to which i am opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that although there may well be a prospect of serious arms reductions on the part of the united states the form that those reductions might take could mean greater calls rather than lesser calls on the armaments of britain and her european allies <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that were the royal shakespeare company to put on shakespeare properly it would attract large audiences particularly from the schools <e> <s> it would then perhaps be able to manage without a subsidy altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that britains interest in tibet arises from the former existence of our indian empire and that we have no possibility of affecting events there <e> <s> the only powerful adjacent country is india <e> <s> is it not undesirable that we should raise hopes of self-determination in a people for whom we can alas do nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to take up a point made by the noble baroness lady david about postgraduate students <e> <s> of all the categories that we are considering not from the point of view of human <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point about the imf are we to understand that the soviet union will co-operate in this inquiry <e> <s> it is one thing to send the imf to look at some developing country of small size and limited resources but to expect a report on the economic affairs of nearly million people is quite another and could only be done with the active co-operation of the soviet union <e> <s> has that co-operation been sought and given <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to be the first speaker on this side of the house to welcome the accession to our ranks of the noble baroness lady brigstocke <e> <s> it gives me enormous pride to think that only a few years ago i was one of her governors <e> <s> i feel now that she is launched on her own <e> <s> we have listened to a contribution on the practical aspects of the problem that we are discussing which has been invaluable <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house perhaps i may join in congratulating my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls always displays a lively interest in what goes on at the other end of the palace <e> <s> he may therefore have noticed that there has been a government reshuffle <e> <s> in the light of that i come this evening to bury robert jackson not to praise him <e> <s> it is no good saying that the good that men do is interred with their bones unless they do some good <e> <s> it is difficult to see in his record any good <e> <s> on the other hand the evil may survive but is capable of correction <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that we have a lot of ground to make up <e> <s> this country had a very good system of soviet and east european studies in the immediate post-war years thanks largely to languages learnt in the services which with great lack of foresight we allowed to decline <e> <s> the noble lord lord callaghan has therefore raised a matter which goes far beyond merely additional language teaching in schools <e> <s> in so far as concerns the economic and social research council which as my noble friend informed us has responsibilities in this area will the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway asked for comments on his proposal for a convention against hostage taking but like jesting pilate he did not stay for an answer <e> <s> my comment is that desirable though it may be the length of time it would take to pass such a measure through the united nations which would require a meeting of the assembly as well as the security council with the various questions that one could imagine raised by particular countries with particular circumstances would make it something hardly directed towards alleviating still less solving the present crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few points to the powerful remarks made by my noble friend lord whitelaw <e> <s> i did not intervene on the subject when it was previously debated because being a flat dweller i had no opportunity to watch sky television <e> <s> whatever else may be said all we are <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i should just like to bring him up to date <e> <s> the programme was due to be shown soon but i am now informed that for technical reasons no doubt the cameras have gone to the party conference it is unlikely to be shown before february <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is also attached to amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to speak briefly to it <e> <s> there is an additional argument to the ones put forward by the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford <e> <s> the feeling of any complainant in the case of a broadcast particularly a television broadcast is much more difficult to meet than in the case of the printed page <e> <s> if an editor refuses to print a rebuttal he must give some reason other than the fact that he has no space for instance that there are technical problems which prevent him from printing it <e> <s> on the other hand this arose in earlier exchanges of this debate when one is dealing with a broadcasting organisation it can always use the difficulties of technique or the need to assemble crews and producers as a reason for not allowing rebuttal <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that since professor cox was chairman of a so-called working group which recommended the elimination of the study of grammar and spelling from the teaching of english his views on reading are not to be taken all that seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords when i ventured to address your lordships house in the debate for which we were recalled early in september i put forward the suggestion that we must above all be careful not to delude ourselves as to the realities of the situation which was developing and with which we were confronted <e> <s> her majestys government had by then set out a policy and that policy has in essentials been repeated in the interim period <e> <s> the words which one might use to describe it are steady and collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression <e> <s> those are not in fact the words of the present foreign secretary they are the words used by sir samuel hoare at the united nations assembly on th september <e> <s> sanctions were adopted in a spate of enthusiasm and we know what happened to sanctions and to ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome my noble friends reply can she take this occasion to inform my noble friend lord onslow and others that it is very unlikely that any government in the foreseeable future will have the financial resources to enable universities to extend three-year courses into four years and four-year courses into five years <e> <s> that would be the inevitable result of a lowering of a-level standards <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that these constant attacks from the opposition benches on the city technology colleges show up the hollowness of the labour partys claim to care about the relationship between education and our industrial performance <e>"]
