["<cs> my lords i wish to express my gratefulness for the courtesy which has been shown to me since my introduction and to ask for it to be extended in a way traditionally accorded to maiden speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords the reform of local government finance is long overdue <e> <s> a radical change has been necessary for a long time <e> <s> i wish to make it clear that i am absolutely in favour of such a change <e> <s> further i certainly pay tribute to the contribution made by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding who spoke earlier in the debate <e> <s> of course there are many ways in which that reform can be carried out <e> <s> now we have to consider this particular solution <e>", "<cs> there is no dispute about the need to get rid of rates and to replace them with something else <e> <s> there are many good features about this bill including the extent to which the community charge improves accountability <e> <s> but long before this debate began it was obvious that the ability to pay factor in the community charge is a very controversial and difficult issue <e>", "<cs> my lords east-west relations remain the dominant feature of the world scene and provide the basis for this defence debate <e> <s> those relations are going through a period of remarkable turbulence the long-term significance of which cannot yet be foreseen <e> <s> of course we all hope that the outcome will be an altogether different relationship resulting in less <e>", "<cs> all the controversy surrounding the official secrets act over the last decades and in particular over recent years is surely evidence enough of the difficulty of legislating in this area <e> <s> there is no ideal way of doing so let alone a perfect one <e> <s> there is a conflict of interest between the government the press and the media and the public interest <e> <s> in my view and i share the views of the noble lord lord home the bill succeeds in making as clear as possible what the government believe is in the public interest for the protection of official information <e> <s> it sets out specifically the categories of activities where disclosure of information would damage the public interest the work of the security services the capability of our armed forces the nations interests overseas the fight against crime and so forth <e> <s> it is all set out in the early clauses <e>", "<cs> it has to be established <e> <s> somebody might take the view that there was an act of misconduct and he might not be right about that <e> <s> that is my feeling about this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords many features of this bill are a very necessary advance and much to be welcomed <e> <s> for example i think of the measures for dealing with pollution and the establishment of the national rivers authority <e> <s> as an incidental consequence of that there is the appointment of my noble friend lord crickhowell who made a powerful speech this afternoon <e> <s> his enthusiasm will be a great asset so long as he is there <e> <s> despite the undoubted advances i am one of those who would have preferred that this bill had not come forward in its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords i join all those who have expressed their gratitude to my noble friend lord home for initiating this debate and for giving us in his opening speech the benefit of his immense and unparalleled experience <e> <s> at the time of the th anniversary of nato it seems quite right that we should express our profound gratitude for the farsightedness of natos founders and to all those who have sustained and managed the alliance ever since <e> <s> it has achieved its objective of safeguarding the peace in europe <e> <s> through all the anxieties of the cold war and the ups and downs of east-west relations the alliance has stood steadfast united and effective <e>", "<cs> i am one of those who does not think that the proposed plc structure is the appropriate one for the water industry with its peculiar characteristics <e> <s> water is not a suitable resource to make money out of so it does not seem very sensible to introduce into its management entrepreneurial concepts that have money-making as their object <e> <s> in any case the opportunities for profit are small partly because the growth potential is at least small it is not nothing but it is small <e> <s> under the bill those opportunities will in any case be created arbitrarily by the decisions of the director general of water services <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever else can be said about the gorbachev era in the soviet union it heralds a period of great political change that is not only in the soviet union but also in eastern europe and further afield as we have seen in southern africa and the middle east <e> <s> no one knows how far the radical reforms of the present soviet leadership will go or whether they will turn out to be a success or a failure <e> <s> but either way the political scene is altered dramatically <e> <s> no longer are the countries of eastern europe in the iron grip of the soviet union as they have been for nearly years <e> <s> of course they still live much under the shadow of the soviet union but it is difficult to imagine the reimposition of iron control except at a political price so high as to be self-defeating <e>", "<cs> my lords the revolutions in europe in show very clearly that the consequences of the two great wars of this century have far from played themselves out <e> <s> the fact that those revolutions have happened much earlier than expected is due to mr gorbachev <e> <s> our immediate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare an interest as chairman of the english speaking union <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that at this point in history when such enormous changes are taking place there ought to be an increase in our own investment in teaching and spreading the english language by means of the british council and through the world service of the bbc <e> <s> does he further agree that it would be quite wrong to sit on our laurels complacently content with the present levels and that if we were to make such a further investment the return would be very handsome indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour after a long and exceptionally impressive debate i shall try briefly to summarise my views <e> <s> with regard to the constitutional aspect i agree with my noble friends lord carrington lord windlesham lord boyd-carpenter and others as well as with the noble lord lord callaghan and the noble and learned lord lord shawcross who have expressed their opinions <e> <s> i do not accept that a constitutional <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour for me to speak after the noble lord lord inglewood and to congratulate him on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was very authoritative well informed and attractively made <e> <s> i am sure that every noble lord looks forward to hearing him again <e> <s> he is a man of wide experience and will be able to contribute to our debates on a whole range of issues <e> <s> we look forward to that very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house appreciates the authoritative speech made by the noble and gallant lord lord bramall <e> <s> i thought that his reference to a quotation from churchills book <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel fortunate that the privilege of being the first to congratulate the noble lord lord haden-guest on his maiden speech falls to me <e> <s> it was an authoritative speech based on a lifetime of experience in international affairs <e> <s> i am certain that i speak for everyone in the house when i say how much we look forward to his future contributions <e> <s> following the admirable maiden speech of the noble baroness lady dunn the house has today enjoyed two maiden speeches of exceptional quality <e>"]
