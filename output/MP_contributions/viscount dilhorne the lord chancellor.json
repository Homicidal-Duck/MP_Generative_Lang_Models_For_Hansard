["<cs> first of all i should like to thank my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches for the trouble he has taken over this matter for bringing it to the attention of the committee and for putting down an amendment <e> <s> i hope i have played absolutely fair about this business <e> <s> i do not find it at all as easy as perhaps one often does in the case of highly technical matters <e> <s> as i said on second reading my judgment was rather against an amendment of this kind and i think it probably still is for reasons which i shall elaborate <e> <s> but the weighty authority of my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches and i think he was supported by the noble and learned lord lord diplock i think he said that on second reading obviously deserved a airing of this matter in one way or another so i lent him the full resources of my office and so far as i was able the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> this amendment is therefore what has emerged and i hope the committee will think that in that respect i have acted fairly <e>"]
