["<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord gibson has explained i have been closely involved with this proposal for the last two or three years <e> <s> i have lived in the chilterns all my life i know the valley intimately and i think it is my duty to do what i can to reassure your lordships <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord brockway has raised this matter in your lordships house <e> <s> none of us likes it <e> <s> it has been an extremely difficult exercise for those of us concerned and i need hardly say that we have only taken the position that we have in the national trust for the reasons that the noble lord lord gibson has suggested namely that any alternative would almost certainly be worse <e>", "<cs> my lords as an original member of the advisory board for redundant churches since it was set up in and its chairman over the last four years or so i have listened with great interest to the introduction of this subject by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> let me say straight away that my board welcome the whole of the amendment measure particularly provisions such as those which allow it to have regard to the condition of churches where a demolition is proposed rather than simply their architectural quality in particular the provision which allows us to take account of the contents of churches and churchyards which are obviously so vital a part of their ambience and character <e> <s> but there has been one section of the measure which as the right reverend prelate has indicated we have not been happy about <e> <s> in fact we have never been happy about the loss of the boards veto on demolition in section cases <e> <s> those are cases where the demolition of an old church is proposed in order to make room for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say straight away that i am glad that in introducing the subject the noble baroness spoke of the over-building of offices in london <e> <s> i am sure that this is going on and has been going on for a generation <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord kilmarnock that we are undoubtedly moving into a period in which technology will reduce the number of clerks and secretaries perhaps by more than the percentage that he had in mind which will leave us with a large number of white elephant buildings in this city <e> <s> the trouble is that there are great areas of london where it is very difficult for planning authorities to designate land for any purpose other than offices <e> <s> i am thinking of sites which do not possess the kind of characteristics that residential land must have such as accessibility to parks schools and so on <e> <s> inevitably a great deal of land is designated for offices because there is no other sensible use for it <e> <s> the trouble is that land so designated at once establishes a value which means that it is very expensive to buy back and undoubtedly the site that we are thinking about this evening comes into that category <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of the noble baronesss point there <e> <s> that the final choice should be made by the people who have to do the building provided the three architects are all equally acceptable to the assessors seems to me to <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the noble baroness lady denington with her long experience of london and with whose speech i wholly agreed i shall not talk about london but only about <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i support this group of amendments without any great enthusiasm <e> <s> one cannot regard them as anything better than an exercise in damage limitation <e> <s> if the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord molson had been carried and it very nearly was my noble friends and i would have been only too pleased not to have proposed this group of amendments at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we would all agree with what the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said about the objectives of this bill <e> <s> we are all agreed with its aims <e> <s> it is a question of means and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that <e> <s> my own feeling about local government is that it is increasingly moving away from its primary role which must surely be to coincide with the places with which people identify <e> <s> if you are a londoner and you live in golders green you can identify with either london or golders green but you cannot identify with brent or camden <e> <s> what liverpudlian ever claimed proudly to be a citizen of bootle <e> <s> what mancunian would feel intense loyalty to the borough of tameside <e> <s> in recent and i am afraid misguided experiments in local government i feel that we have lost sight of this essential characteristic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble and learned lord lord denning supports the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that i have been unable to attend earlier debates on the bill but i have read them with great care having myself as a young architect many years ago been through this mill and wishing to do what i could to support the position taken by the professional people in the building industry and people speaking for the industry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord hacking could make this plain <e> <s> i hope i am speaking to his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the law reform committee referred to the difficulty of ascertaining exactly when damage occurs which is critical in this bill <e> <s> noble and learned lords will be familiar with the latin maxim <e>"]
