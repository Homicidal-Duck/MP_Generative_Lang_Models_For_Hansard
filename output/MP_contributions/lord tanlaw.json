agricultural industry whatever the price there is no option but to buy diesel in order to keep the tractors running during the critical few weeks that lie ahead of us <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on

debate on the three reports put before us today <e> <s> i am particularly disappointed to hear what the noble lord lord lovell-davis had to say about the european efforts regarding conservation <e>

the house and the noble lord how perhaps some steps forward can be taken to improve our thoughts at least on conservation <e> <s> however before doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we thank the noble earl for his statement and we arc grateful too that the government have had some second thoughts about cutting bnoc right back to the bone <e> <s> there is perhaps one false assumption which the noble earl may be able to clear up <e> <s> the implication in the statement is that the serious decline in offshore activity is primarily due to the embryo state oil company bnoc but what about low prices <e> <s> not so long ago there were low prices and there was an excess of oil in the world before the troubles in iran and exploration declined because it was not worth the candle for the oil companies to explore the high cost north sea <e> <s> from these benches we too welcome the fact that bnoc is to continue its trading activities and i feel that this would be the appropriate place in the statement to indicate some form of congratulations on the success of those activities up to now <e>", "<cs> my lords we too from these benches are grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for raising this question at this time <e> <s> for my part i really want to speak on the second part of the question about the further decisions needed to ensure that the united kingdom has an adequate and effective energy programme at the end of the th century <e> <s> i am not sure if the noble lord lord campbell of croy has not jumped the gun a bit in putting forward some basic assumptions regarding the need for a nuclear industry at all and for how many and what type of reactors <e> <s> it may be a little premature when in my opinion the government have yet to prove their case for the need of nuclear energy <e> <s> i think there is a real need for this because the gross energy demand figures have not been fully worked out <e> <s> as we all know the nuclear option in the energy equation can only contribute electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham for asking what is a very timely question concerning public debate <e> <s> i believe that the report <e>", "<cs> my lords we too from these benches wish to thank the noble earl for giving us the governments statement on the nuclear programme

country <e> <s> we are also pleased to recognise in the noble earls statement that there are some issues here which will revitalise the nuclear industry in this country <e> <s> there is one point on which i must disagree with the noble earl when he said the government have therefore held urgent consultations with those most directly concerned <e> <s> we accept that this <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome this statement from the government and would thank the noble earl for the way in which he has presented it but unlike the last speaker we from these benches would create some doubt as to whether the financial discipline referred to in the statement is perhaps as soundly balanced as the noble earl might consider <e> <s> while expressing concern for the consumers of gas throughout the country and we will have an opportunity to debate this later i will not go further in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord lord ferrier for withdrawing his question and for allowing this debate to take place <e> <s> may i also say that we on these benches would like to add our congratulations to him on his birthday <e> <s> those of us who listened to the debate yesterday in another place must have been struck by the very poor attendance it attracted <e> <s> i feel that the social conscience of members of another place is rather thinly spread <e> <s>

auspices of the royal society of arts in june last year and who then heard the keynote speech of the noble lord lord dulverton will realise that what he said this afternoon was an expansion and extension of the policies put forward at that time <e> <s> at the conference the interests of the farmer the forester and the environmentalist were expressed and expressed without any form of prejudice <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the point i was making <e> <s> i was merely asking for liaison between the forestry commission and the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> i was not questioning its constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful for the noble earls statement on behalf of the government <e> <s> i think we might take up the point made by the noble lord lord peart that after two days of inconclusive discussion no conclusions were reached <e> <s> the statement goes on to say that there must be substantial savings in agricultural expenditure <e> <s> my view is that it is rather a waste of money if they are going to sit for two days and come to no conclusion <e> <s> while my noble friend lord mackie of benshie will be able to advise noble lords on the non-decisions taken on the milk price perhaps the noble earl will confirm that there will he no price increases on those items in surplus to encourage yet further surpluses in the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government take into consideration some of the omissions of the brandt commission report in particular rural electrification of the developing world and will this appear on the agenda which the noble lord has discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords we too from these benches are most grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for bringing this report before your lordships house <e> <s> i agree with his comments and what he said in view of his disappointment about the apparent lack of urgency that has been shown by the commission in bringing this report further forward <e> <s> a time-lag of a year is one which in our view cannot be overlooked because it is the lack of the sense of urgency which is the main point of the intervention i make today <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches welcome the noble earls statement on behalf of the government <e> <s> i think noble lords will agree that this is a much better statement than the last one which was read out in your lordships house and which said absolutely nothing <e> <s> this statement is coming to grips with the reality of trading with europe in the way that has been set out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in this period when every local authority and building company is trying to cut costs the absolute minimum of insulation will be incorporated into new buildings unless the building regulations are changed <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord have any discussions with his right honourable friend the minister of energy about the implementation of this policy which does not seem consistent with that of the conservation of energy <e> <s> will he confirm that this means overloading a route with aircraft and more <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the field of

lords i think we on these benches should be grateful to the noble lord lord buxton for introducing what is a prophylactic debate in the sense that we are concerned about the problem before it arises and not after the event <e> <s> i am certainly impressed by the examples he has given <e> <s> this debate even though it is one of many that we have had before is timely as i think still more assurances are required from her majestys government that all possible is being done to prevent the sort of disasters we have had in the past <e> <s> there is only one point where i think i might disagree with the noble lord although i think not in any serious degree <e> <s> in his final sentences he said with regard to pollution that the human casualty aspect seems to have been overlooked and it is this side that i want to emphasise <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to give a general welcome to the bill which should be an essential step forward in the implementation of a capital investment programme to safeguard the future of the british coal industry <e> <s> the spirit of the bill reflects the views of the community that were expressed at the summit in venice <e> <s> these were that coal not only has a future but must have a future as part of the community energy policy and for the national energy programme that exists within it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl for the presentation of this bill that starts in this house <e> <s> we on these benches are pleased to give a welcome in principle to the technical parts of the bill which conform to one of the liberal partys resolutions at conference which urged her majestys government to introduce energy performance standards for domestic and industrial appliances <e> <s> also as the noble earl has said this bill is a response to the communitys legislation in this field and although its implementation may be time expired from the community point of view i feel certain that there will be no serious objections in its late arrival on the statute book in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken on this subject before in your lordships house but i have been forced to do so on the basis that i have two interests to declare in support of the international year of disabled people <e> <s> my first interest is a commercial one and my second interest is a personal one and covers really more the aspect which the noble viscount lord mersey implied in his very sensitive maiden speech namely the stigma of disablement <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what has been said by the noble earl that we can have a general discussion as the amendments are relevant one to another <e> <s> i think it will be seen that in suggesting the removal from the bill of the term gas-powered i am attempting to retain the wide powers which i believe her majestys government are intending to seek under this clause <e> <s> it is easier if i explain that by removing the words gas-powered paragraph <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl has said obviously i shall have to reconsider the position <e> <s> however what lie has been trying to say is that the appliance of science to the statute book is a difficult process <e> <s> especially when the second law of thermodynamics is used it produces odd results <e> <s> we were hoping to strengthen his hand in the bill but the noble earl desires not to have it strengthened in this way by these amendments <e> <s> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> in view of those remarks i do not wish to press either of the amendments standing in my name and i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i really wanted to get the noble earls view on this amendment and obviously the governments reaction to it would influence my views on amendment no <e> <s> which in fact is slightly different in the sense that it involves electricity and gas meters <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely clear about what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> if as i understand it there will be no need for inspection of these certificates unless for very major installations and therefore it is not necessary to display them or indeed to produce them except under very special circumstances then obviously there has been a misunderstanding on my part in interpretation of the bill <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble earls very helpful explanations i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble earl for his response to this <e> <s> i appreciate that this may not be the right part of the bill or even the right bill <e> <s> i can simply assure him that this is a matter which bothers a large number of people <e> <s> as to how to bring it to pass i am not clear <e> <s> i found that this bill was the nearest one could get to doing so <e> <s> i must warn the noble earl that it would be difficult for him and for the general goodwill of the government if he categorically said no i shall not look at this whether or not this is the right bill or whether there should be a separate arrangement for it <e> <s> if he can take on board that this does worry a large number of the public and will have another look at it i shall be very pleased to withdraw the amendment and be encouraged by his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must regret that my noble friend lord simon who is temporarily indisposed is unable to take part in this debate which is about a subject dear to his heart <e> <s> we on these benches are most grateful to the noble viscount lord sid-mouth for introducing the motion at this time <e> <s> the fact that the terms of this debate call for a transport policy implies that it is far from clear what her majestys governments intentions are with regard to a current transport policy and more particularly their objectives for long-term investment <e> <s> but it should be made quite clear that for some time we from these benches have called upon successive governments to outline and implement an integrated transport system and that government transport policy should be directed towards achieving an energy-efficient society by the year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads the papers he will see that the merchant banks have already offered complete private finance for the channel tunnel and that is one project <e> <s> secondly regarding interest rates if these are the interest rates under the present government then if this government are allowed to remain in power much longer i do not know what they will be in five years time i am not <e>", "<cs> it was a very welcome intervention my lords and i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say that while it is possible for the british railways board to sell capital assets to the private sector it is also going to be possible for the british railways board to borrow capital from the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us the average length of time between the application for a grant and its receipt <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl very much for his expression of the government view i am a little surprised to take one of his major points first that he used the full figure of million to prove the point <e> <s> the point of this amendment as i am sure the noble earl appreciates is that it would be at the request of the owner when this is required i do not think every single householder wishes to have his meters moved <e> <s> secondly it is the special category of householder the elderly the lonely and so on who would require this <e>", "<cs> my lords we too from these benches wish to thank the noble earl for his statement and welcome the effects of it <e> <s> we have no intention to point out the causes of it but from these benches we would like to put this question to the noble earl <e> <s> can all the parties involved in the events which brought about this statement learn some lessons lessons of co-operation fuller consultation and greater information <e> <s> anything that goes wrong with the coal industry affects the whole of british industry and is a very serious matter <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl can tell the house how much money or extra money will be involved in the effects of this statement <e> <s> thirdly will the noble earl be able to reassure the domestic <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches must thank the noble lord lord sherfield and his select committee and the noble lord lord dulverton for bringing our attention today to the whole position of forestry both scientific and political <e> <s> i think it is right to say at this stage that one can only congratulate the members of the select committee under the direction of the noble lord lord sherfield on the quality of the reports before us <e> <s> they are remarkable documents and i believe that for many years to come they will be used as a reference or as a handbook by all of us who declare an interest in forestry <e> <s> the present report is particularly useful in showing the very large number of organisations universities and government departments which are making scientific studies into and contributions to forestry and its related industries and skills <e> <s> i think there is absolutely no question of our support for the noble lord lord sherfield in asking her majestys government to reduce this report to a white paper with their very clear-cut views on the implications contained in the views put forward by the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl say what is the position regarding battersea power station which had a district heating system <e> <s> could he also say whether or not there is a case for using the fluidised bed system in order to resuscitate battersea power station and at the same time burn and absorb a great deal of greater londons rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble ministers answer about telecommunications would he be able to say to the house that it is now the governments policy to assess financial assistance to nationalised industries on the basis that capital programmes are distinct from expenditure programmes <e> <s> in which case would he also give an assurance that the british rail electrification programme will be judged on exactly the same terms in which he described the capital programme for telecommunications <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches wish to thank the minister for the statement <e> <s> while agreeing with the principle of cost effectiveness for both the local and the central executive we have some doubts about the method outlined in this statement <e> <s> would the noble earl the minister perhaps be aware that certain quarters in scotland interpret this statement in its present form as no more and no less than a threat from south of the border to the authority of locally elected councillors as well as creating doubts as to their competence in budgetary matters <e> <s> the noble earl is well aware that the scots have a tradition of competence in this area to the extent that we are often a butt of jokes but i am afraid this is not a subject for much humour for those councillors in scotland who will receive the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to thank the noble earl for his very careful and clear description of the bill in his introduction <e> <s> i only regret that i have been unable to look at the documents to which he has referred as placed on the library table <e> <s> it is also with regret that my noble friend lord mackie of benshie is unable to take part in this debate today due to a longstanding engagement <e> <s> from these benches we welcome the principle of parental choice contained in this bill <e> <s> throughout the lengthy debates and committee sittings in another place there appears to have been an underlying assumption which was referred to by the noble earl that the choice for parents was automatically from a state school to an independent school because all independent schools somehow gave a better education than the state equivalent in their district <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give a decision as to whether the computer language being taught to children which is basic is the one which will be used for further adult education in the open technical colleges that have been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government in a position to say that whatever computer language is chosen will be a standard one used for both elementary and adult education <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches wish to welcome the committees report and to congratulate the noble lord lord sherfield on his brilliant introduction to what is a complex subject <e> <s> it was a pleasure serving with him on this committee <e> <s> i too look forward very much to hearing what the noble lord lord kearton has to say in his maiden speech when his wisdom and experience in this field will be available to our own benefit and education <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say that perhaps the main reason for delay is that her majestys government are giving serious consideration to dismantling the forestry commission based on proposals put forward in a paper published by the institute of economic affairs and entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble baroness in her amendment and in the thinking behind it i wonder whether for those businessmen working overseas one of the problems today is perhaps not having the correct documentation of proof during times of international and national stress or during hi-jacking and two of my friends were hi-jacked recently in india <e> <s> sometimes for one reason or another best known to themselves the parties or the revolutionaries involved separate people of different nationalities <e> <s> if businessmen abroad exercise some of the options which the minister has put forward i am not clear whether they will have documentary proof for instance if they are waiting for registration and taking one of the chances that the noble baroness suggested that their child is british <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord geddes and insert this new clause <e> <s> other speakers have said and i feel that it will maintain the vital link of nationality between britain and the british dependent territories <e> <s> above all however this is where it affects my own amendment which is the last one on the marshalled list as the noble and learned lord has said the title of the bill states that this is an act to make fresh provision about citizenship and nationality <e> <s> first the inclusion of this new clause would make my amendment superfluous because there is no other reference in the bill to nationality <e> <s> i trust the noble and learned lord will look very carefully at the reasons why the noble lord lord geddes is asking that this new clause should be inserted <e> <s> secondly it makes the bill much more honest certainly in its title and in its interpretation by those who live in the british dependent territories <e>", "<cs> my lords the worst has happened <e> <s> the noble lord has avoided the question as indeed it was avoided on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord geddes <e> <s> i must take up the noble lord on one point <e> <s> he will no doubt recall that in the very early stages of the bill i put down two other amendments which referred to nationality <e> <s> the word nationality appears in one other place in clause as well as in clause <e> <s> if the noble lord will read it more carefully again he will see that it does not refer to british nationals it refers to other than british nationals <e> <s> it deals with foreigners <e> <s> that is why i did not add those amendments to the ones at third reading <e> <s> i felt it was wrongly presented as an amendment <e> <s> the other two references to nationality related to people other than british citizens subjects or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will follow the advice of other noble lords on this side of the house and will accept this amendment which will go a very long way to satisfying some of the doubts and worries which british overseas citizens have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not normally have intervened in this debate if i did not feel so uncomfortable about the passing of this bill mainly because of the misunderstandings that will arise overseas as a result of its passing <e> <s> there are very great worries in that we can pass a bill in this country which concentrates entirely and solely on what appears to be a british problem and which the bill sets out to solve but which inadvertently perhaps creates great doubts and uncertainties for some of our friends and indeed our best friends overseas <e> <s> i want to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord kadoorie of kowloon on his remarkable maiden speech to which i shall have great pleasure in referring later <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his answer which i regret may not be received with thanks by a number of parents of mentally handicapped children <e> <s> can he therefore say whether in the public transport industry there is in any way discrimination in outlook between physically handicapped and mentally handicapped passengers <e> <s> i understand that british rail took advice from the department of health and social security on this matter of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl consider it to be a little unfair that customers who purchase soap powders and other sundry consumer items are offered free tickets by british rail <e> <s> could not this possibly be extended to the escort of mentally handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too wish to thank the minister for his statement his first in the new year and would wish to repeat what was said to the families of the workforce there <e> <s> the message that the statement contains will bring no joy to the new year in that district and far beyond it <e> <s> i will not repeat the questions already raised and to which we shall be interested to hear the answers <e> <s> i have three questions for the minister <e> <s> i cannot understand how calculations can have gone so far out of kilter as to create a sudden closure of the smelter <e> <s> smelters operate with hydro-electric plants because one can forecast the cost of electricity for many years ahead <e> <s> it is not related to opec prices <e> <s> the first question is this <e> <s> how do other smelters with their costs of electricity manage to continue and how does the north of scotland hydro-electric board base its charge for hydro-electricity <e> <s> is it on a cost-plus basis or has the company tried to relate the cost of electricity to the consumer to opec prices <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the noble minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> however we have considerable doubts as to whether the contents of the statement will be either welcomed or understood by the ratepayers of the glc <e> <s> could the noble minister explain to the house whether the government intend to give a grant to mr livingstone and the glc which in net terms is either less or more than before the fares fair policy came into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords we too wish to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement given in another place <e> <s> we also appreciate the delay that is built into moving the inquiry back to january <e> <s> can the noble earl say whether as the statement says that it will be a full and wide-ranging inquiry if it so happens that it appears that the pwr is not a suitable reactor and indeed is not necessary by the time the inquiry is finished it will not be pursued or continued with <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister <e> <s> will there be an independent inquiry before the ben ocean ranger puts to sea <e> <s> is he aware of the reports which appeared in the media after the sinking of the ocean ranger of the unhappiness of the skipper in charge of the vessel who said that there were approximately design defects in his craft <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister then confirm that the ben ocean ranger will put to sea before the final reports and conclusions have been reached by the american bureau of shipping as to the causes of the catastrophe that occurred to the ocean ranger <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer one final question are the government prepared then to accelerate the developments in free-falling safety capsules and lifeboats which have been worked on in order to look after the safety of crew members of these very high structures which appear to be causing considerable danger to those who sail in them <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish to add our gratitude to the noble earl the minister for presenting this bill and we also wish to confirm that it is not our intention in any way to obstruct it during its passage through your lordships house <e> <s> however in view of the total lack of debate in another place on this bill i am tempted to go into more detail than possibly i should normally have done on a bill of this kind which is primarily a monetary bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl can clarify one point for me <e> <s> the accounts appear to show that the net current assets of the national coal board are outweighed by far by the net current borrowings <e> <s> this is not normal commercial practice in a company which is to be considered solvent and it is not normal commercial practice to use this formula for return on capital employed <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement to us <e> <s> certainly the statement will be accepted with some relief in some quarters and not least by the noble duke the duke of rutland who i understand had threatened to prostrate himself in front of a steamroller if in fact permission were granted <e> <s> but i do not see why the government should prostrate themselves in front of the noble duke despite his threat <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for raising this subject because it is about time the government responded to the armitage report and recommendations and made clear what is their attitude to those recommendations <e> <s> indeed i am not sure why the government are apparently so hesitant about committing themselves to the armitage proposals <e> <s> perhaps they are backing away from the apparent conflict of interest between those who are part of the environmental lobby and those who wish to see an efficient and integrated transport system in britain <e> <s> i should be grateful if when he replies the minister would spell out clearly whether it is the governments policy to have integration in all sections of the transport industry for that is the attitude of these benches which is based on the urgent need for integration of the interests of both the environment and an efficient transport industry <e> <s> of course that means compromise but it need not necessarily mean confrontation or in this case inaction on the part of the government or an inefficient road transport industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may have misunderstood <e> <s> my suggestion was that the government owned the railway tracks as the government own the motorways so that it gave some sort of parity to rail freight <e> <s> it would be a government body <e> <s> that was the main purpose of my argument and not just the setting up of an administrative body <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches wish to express our gratitude to the noble earl for his presentation of the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i am rather inclined to agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that it was a low key approach but gratifyingly short and helpfully split up into the three different parts of which this bill consists <e> <s> we are not at this stage going to take the approach that the noble lord lord bruce has just taken of robust confrontation <e> <s> we shall attempt perhaps more constructive interrogation of the government in some of the matters of principle that are contained in the bill and which will reflect very clearly what will be our attitudes towards it in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should wait <e> <s> mr wedgwood benn who is known to the noble lord has declared that compensation would

been stripped because the money has left the corporation and gone elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has just described it happening <e> <s> i will not argue with him now just let us let it

enterprise bill and now as some noble lords will be gratefully concluding am ending with a debate on privatisation <e> <s> this subject was discussed in considerable detail and with some force from the labour benches yesterday and it would be unproductive to go over the whole area again <e> <s> but for the sake of noble lords who were not in the chamber yesterday i wish to restate the liberal view which is simply that we are against nationalisation that we are against monopolies and that we have based our policies for many years on those facts <e>", "<cs> that was a bit before my time my lords and i thought that by talking about i was going back far enough <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that that volume did not belong to anything produced by the young liberals of whom i am still one <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i was going to be fairly brief but the noble lord did mention the public accounts committee and nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully heard those remarks but we have not yet heard from the government on these views so it is a little difficult to put my own view <e> <s> unless the noble lord lord beswick thinks somewhat <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord and to the house if i appeared to be derogatory of the public accounts committee <e> <s> i was not being derogatory i was merely saying that the civil servants had a better hand of cards than those whose duty it was like the noble lord to interrogate them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord because i think that he was referring to me <e> <s> the noble lord also said that there was a great case against renationalisation which i think was the main tenor of his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the moment to <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble lord lord bishopston in this amendment i should like to begin by saying that as the noble earl the minister is aware there was no liberal representation during the committee stage in another place <e> <s> therefore i thought it would be for the convenience of those taking part in the committee stage in your lordships house that i should add my name to a number of the amendments set down by the noble lord lord bishopston and that that would assist in terms of efficiency of business <e> <s> i hope that that will be appreciated <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> if in any other company on the stock exchange a block shareholding of per cent <e> <s> is represented by two directors on the board those two directors are expected to take part in the policy of the company <e> <s> is the noble earl saying that this is the case with the governments per cent <e> <s> of the shareholding or is he not <e>", "<cs> from these benches we wish to add our support to the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> we do not wish to add any further questions to the rather long list that the noble lord has put forward since those questions cover the questions which we wish to ask <e> <s> in particular we are interested in the mechanism which the government are to use for the participation agreements and i hope the government will explain whether in this instance there is to be used a different mechanism that has not been used previously <e>", "<cs> i wish to expand on what i said in my second reading intervention in support of the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> i gave an example of possible middle eastern investment interests having adequate funds to purchase the complete per cent <e> <s> from the government holding <e> <s> some noble lords expressed surprise that this was possible <e> <s> but it is possible in two contexts one is that there may be a desire through political or social unrest in the middle east to diversify the energy investments held by companies and individuals in that area <e> <s> furthermore exactly the same reason could be given for the united states to diversify or secure its overseas oil sources by making a large investment of this kind <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord bishopston that this amendment goes somewhat beyond this particular bill to matters of principle about where the house should stand in relation to powers given to the secretary of state <e> <s> it is certainly the view on these benches that the secretary of state has in this instance over-armed himself with almost too many powers in some areas where it is quite unnecessary to do so <e> <s> yet he seems to have under-equipped himself in those areas in which in the previous amendments we believe protection is necessary <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment put forward in my name as well as in the name of the noble lord lord bishopston may i raise again the timing of this issue <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl in his reply to this amendment which does not specify this will reassure the committee that the government will take into consideration market conditions at the time which this amendment is about <e> <s> i support entirely the noble lord lord bishopston in amendment no <e> <s> that the comptroller and auditor-general should look at the valuation of the shares and give a second opinion apart from those who are the merchant banking advisers of the government <e> <s> this would give some reassurance that there will not be a repeat of what happened before <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me two questions <e> <s> i have said that the wording is not perfect <e> <s> the point is that the government have two director appointees on the board and only one of them should be elected and appointed by the employees <e> <s> i think that there may have been a slip of the tongue the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i think that it is with the consent of the secretary of state if i said would be appointed by the secretary of state my intention was to imply that the directors were already appointed by the secretary of state and it was one of his appointee directors who should be elected by the employees <e>", "<cs> i particularly left this point open <e> <s> he need not necessarily be an employee <e> <s> i do not see why it should be restricted to an employee provided that he is elected by the employees <e> <s> i would hope that he might be an employee in fact perhaps he should be <e> <s> but i do not necessarily see why he has to be an employee as long as the employees can choose a director with the consent of the secretary of state to represent them on the board of the company <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat disappointed by the noble earls response <e> <s> first i must apologise to the committee for what is perhaps rather poor wording in the amendment but i do not think that that in any way takes away the principle which lay behind my moving it <e> <s> judging from the support received from other sections of the committee it is quite clear that many noble lords consider that there is here an opportunity for the government to take <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick was absolutely correct <e> <s> how many prospectuses of new companies contain an insistence that the employees must have a proportion of the equity or the capital <e> <s> none that i can think of <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has been most helpful over this <e> <s> as i said because of the slightly poor wording he could have been much harsher in his criticism than he was <e> <s> in fact he has been extremely constructive because i think there are two main points here on which we wish to have clarification from the noble earl that is whether a director of the company should not really buy up with his opportunity large tracts of the employees shares <e> <s> he has said he is against that in principle which is common sense and i am delighted to hear it <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i should like to ask him one question on <e>", "<cs> may we support the words of this amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> i think some balance is required from these benches to show that we are against the monopoly of british gas in the showroom area and we think it could be beneficial indeed should be beneficial to consumers once this has been de-monopolised <e> <s> there are just two points that i would ask the noble earl to confirm <e> <s> i hope the government will support the findings of the monopolies and mergers commission in its report <e>", "<cs> if it is correct that i may speak now on my amendment i wish just to return to this one simple point of why this amendment was ever put down <e> <s> it was not intended as a wrecking amendment attempting to stab the bill in the heart so to speak it was merely intended to raise the issue that british gas are operating in competition efficiently and successfully in the oil business and are being penalised i think unfairly if this aspect is taken away from their business whereas the oil companies who are at present in competition with british gas operating these fields are allowed access to british gas interests or to act as competitors to british gas <e> <s> therefore although i am afraid i disagree with the principles put forward by the noble earl the minister if he advises me that this amendment is a wrecking amendment in the sense that the bill would be destroyed by it which was not the intention i would perhaps wish to come back to this matter when we reach clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl clarify one point for us on these benches <e> <s> if like in any normal company there is a disposal of assets this must of course decrease the borrowing power of that company <e> <s> i do not know whether this applies to the british gas corporation but can the noble earl the minister give an assurance that if the future financial policy of the corporation is such that it requires money the disposal of these assets will not in any way decrease their bor <e>", "<cs> these benches will be most interested to hear the noble and learned lords reply <e> <s> i hope that his reply will be in some detail as to what are the safety regulations in terms of manpower equipment and specification if any <e> <s> it is sometimes very difficult in a bill of this kind when we move into the technical area of safety regulations to know what these really mean <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord can reassure us on this side of the committee and all those who have some doubts that the technical side which is covered under the very broad spectrum of safety will be looked after adequately <e> <s> there are limits to what we can do with our knowledge in terms of the technical aspects of gas supply and applications <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble lord lord beswick in this amendment <e> <s> i raised this on second reading <e> <s> we from these benches were also concerned about a depletion policy <e> <s> perhaps when the noble and learned lord replies he will throw some more light on what actually are the reserves <e> <s> i understand that there is even some possible doubt that the figures given in the brown book may have to be revised or altered <e> <s> some suggest they may have to be revised <e>", "<cs> while thanking the noble lord very much for his reply to the three amendments i hope to be able to clarify one or two points which he has raised with me in order to be of assistance <e> <s> before giving my view on these amendments however i should like to express the difficulty that we have not only from these benches but that we all have when dealing with what are broadly called technical amendments <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord again for that helpful comment and with those encouraging words about further consultation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords reply <e> <s> i think it has been helpful <e> <s> on costs i am assuming that they are recoverable and open to negotiation between the parties concerned <e> <s> i interpret his answer in that way <e> <s> he says that he does not want to put it in the bill because it is too minor an affair <e> <s> i think costs are not minor affairs <e> <s> if i understand aright the costs are negotiable and recoverable from the proper parties <e> <s> i like to feel that that answer is quite helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl the minister for his answer may i ask whether he will now say whether the government will reject the advice given by the advisory council on the basis that it was a non-representative decision due to the managers of the research programmes being no party to it and that the research programmes themselves have not reached the stage of proper evaluation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the private sector members of acord who co-operated with the government in good faith in the belief that renewable energy sources were part of the governments policies will be disappointed by the noble earls reply <e> <s> will he also say whether there will be simultaneous cuts in the department of energy of a balancing kind to match those which are being made by the government in renewable energy sources <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister could answer one question <e> <s> how many extra staff if any are going to be required in the department to write these directions <e> <s> this is one of the questions we have asked before on other occasions <e> <s> is the minister going to say that no further staff will be required in order to implement this amendment <e> <s> if extra staff are required can he estimate how many <e> <s> are these included in those numbers stated in the introductory memorandum to the bill <e>", "<cs> can the minister in his reply answer the question about the extra numbers that i asked on lord beswicks amendment <e> <s> we are getting worried not only about the tangle of pipes and the other things we are getting into in the intricacies of the various government amendments but as to whether the bill is workable at all in this clause <e> <s> it would appear so far that more and more requirements from the department are necessary to make the bill workable <e> <s> this means more and more forms applications and directives <e> <s> this fits in with our view that the secretary of state has over-armed himself with powers <e> <s> if he so wished or if members of the department so wished they could make this bill unworkable <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord lord beswick in this what i would call helpful amendment mainly for the reason he has given and because from our point of view we are not clear how the department or the secretary of state are going to operate their authority on these particular occasions bearing in mind that the main trunk system will be run by the corporation and we are almost certainly here talking about a spur or branch pipe-line <e> <s> can the minister say that the secretary of state and his department are not merely drawing lines on maps but will have to have a team of people able to go out on to the site to check the location for one reason or another mainly no doubt to satisfy the environmental and other departments <e> <s> but they also have to have people technically equally as capable as lord beswick has said in order to ensure that what the corporation are suggesting is both safe and correct and so on <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have a slightly different approach from lord bishopstons and it goes somewhat deeper <e> <s> the concern expressed to us by both the oil and shipbuilding industries on the implications of clause is slightly different <e> <s> it is about the extended meaning of the term offshore installation <e> <s> these industries are worried that this meaning has been extended too far <e> <s> in the bill there is the rubric to clause <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to speak in support of this important amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may reassure the noble lord opposite about the nonparty element of giving extra power to the secretary of state <e> <s> our main contention has been the weakness of the bill in overburdening the secretary of state with unnecessary powers <e> <s> i believe that the matter should from time to time come back to parliament to check that those powers are not being abused or taken too far <e> <s> by that i mean simply that whether the government of the day be from either side of the committee if the department concerned wished to use this bill as an empire-building exercise in departmental terms there must be an opportunity for parliament at least to restrain it from so doing <e>", "<cs> it is most unfortunate that the noble earl lord mansfield brings in these expressions because i was listening with great attention to what he was saying <e> <s> if he wants to score cheap party political points at this time of night in the course of this bill he will get plenty in return <e> <s> i hope that he will not make these asides as he continues to give us what i hope is an informative helpful and instructive side to this bill <e> <s> if he wishes to continue in this vein we can certainly make life a little more difficult than we have hitherto <e> <s> we have been trying to assist him <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches are most grateful to the noble baroness for the way she has introduced this debate <e> <s> her presentation really reflected the spirit of the conference at which i was present and which to me indicated just a beginning of the recognition by public and private carriers of the problems of carrying disabled passengers <e> <s> i think the attitude of public and private carriers to disabled passengers must be dependent rather in the way that the noble lord lord underhill spoke about just now on the extra facilities required and at what cost in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> the noble lord is saying in effect how long is a piece of string <e> <s> that is the departments answer to the list of specific questions <e> <s> is he saying that that is an answer or that they have not anticipated a zero medium or full response to this bill and therefore not allowed numbers to be given as some estimate of what would be done in any normal company <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in some ways this has been an embarrassing debate because i did present this amendment as shortly as possible and i really think there have been rather hard criticism from the benches opposite by the noble lord who i think was not in the chamber when the presentation was made <e> <s> secondly the noble lord lord bishopston gave perfectly adequate time i would have thought for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought this is what i understood that the british gas corporation were entitled to ask for a deposit or for front money before they undertook any such work <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that they are not entitled to do so then it is an extremely serious matter and goes against all the commercial relationships of companies as between the private and public sectors <e> <s> i should have thought that this rather simple solution would overcome some of the difficulties that the government appear to be having <e>", "<cs> my lords we also are grateful to the noble and learned lord for clarifying the bill by the introduction of this clause which we shall support <e> <s> there is one small point and i regret that i have not had time to study the petroleum production act about this <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord could clarify one point that is the use of petroleum in this context when the bill itself refers to oil and gas <e> <s> is there any legal distinction between petroleum in the new clause and oil and gas <e> <s> this is really a matter of education from my point of view but i should be grateful if the noble and learned lord could clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i believe that there are a number of loose ends which keep appearing as various amendments and various debates have taken place throughout our discussions on the bill <e> <s> i think that it was significant that in our recent debate on amendment no <e> <s> a reference was made by the noble and learned lord to the powers of the secretary of state that on different days he may appoint for different provisions and for different purposes different parts of the bill <e> <s> i should think that in particular in relation to the amendment of the noble lord lord lovell-davis some of these are very important commencements and it is only right that they should come back for parliament to have at least a brief debate and discussion on them to see whether any factors have changed before they are incorporated in the bill and that is apart from deep democratic principles which the spirit of this bill seems to go against by giving so much power to the secretary of state <e> <s> so we shall continue to support as we have done throughout the bill the spirit of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches want to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his very clear presentation of this bill and for a number of reassurances which he has given in so doing <e> <s> nevertheless i think we must consider this to be a patchwork quilt bill a mixture of doctrine and pragmatism <e> <s> unfortunately it is a bill which does nothing to take up the challenge of creating a fully integrated public transport system in this country <e> <s> instead the bill only attempts to introduce private capital into the national bus company to privatise vehicle testing stations for heavy vehicles to alter the fixed penalty system for motorists and finally to recognise environmental factors before licensing areas for road haulage operators <e> <s> i regret that i cannot identify any coordinating factors in these objectives which could be described as steps towards an integrated transport policy <e> <s> the principle that we from these benches shall apply in committee is that the ownership of the transport system is unimportant it is the service to the travelling public that matters so the measures contained in this bill will be judged accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak in support of the amendment which certainly makes a <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to thank the noble earl lord mansfield for his kind words directed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord can give a further reassurance since think he gave an assurance during second reading of the bill <e> <s> the disposal of properties in order to raise finance for both <e>", "<cs> i think we on these benches would like to have just the same assurances as have been asked for by the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> i think this is a very important amendment if assurances cannot be given in more precise terms than those used so far <e> <s> i think the industry itself has clearly shown that it is worried and somewhat depressed by this aspect of government thinking but it is prepared to accept it unwillingly if the safeguards are there for the system to operate efficiently and effectively and fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that british oil companies have to give returns to the department of energy as to where the stocks of oil are and including stocks actually carried on the water <e> <s> therefore is the noble lord in a position to say whether any british oil companies hold stocks of oil in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord give an undertaking that once this dispute has been settled there will be no further delay in the investment programme of railway system modernisation in this country <e>", "<cs> may i point out to the minister that we have had no knowledge of these groupings and hence our bewilderment on these benches <e> <s> this has possibly been overlooked <e>", "<cs> i have an amendment to leave out clause <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has said for the same reasons as he advanced <e> <s> the noble earl will recall that on second reading of the bill i was not happy with the present clause for technical reasons and i am still not happy with it since i have heard nothing to convince me that the clause can work <e> <s> i also believe in regard to the experimental aspect that a period of even up to two years will not provide the information that is required for the reason that i am about to give <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that you can move the car to the car pound but the police will be unable to move cars fitted with electronic locks <e> <s> this is not the point i was making <e> <s> the point that i was making was that there has been an apparent lack of liaison between the metropolitan police engineering division the metropolitan police and the glc on this technical matter which has not been raised by the government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his response to the amendment and i was pleased to hear about the activity that is taking place in looking at how bikeways cycle paths cycle tracks can be created by local authorities <e> <s> i hope that while there is enthusiasm towards the creation of bikeways as i like to call them information will be given to local authorities to enable them to make decisions <e> <s> there are worrying factors about the category of vehicle and the category of path on which the local authorities might like help from the department of transport and i hope that that will be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord underhill in the way that he presented his amendment and on the content of it <e> <s> the only worry i have is whether it is necessary at all <e> <s> i am equally worried that the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to support the noble lord lord underhill in the principle behind this amendment which was covered well in committee it expresses the doubts and concerns which the industry and many of us have about the possibility of the format of the testing organisation not being one single body but with testing offices in different parts of the country <e> <s> the governments position here is somewhat strange <e> <s> it needs clarification <e> <s> by all means let this matter come before parliament but we do not have anything before parliament <e> <s> there is no blue print as the minister has said <e> <s> how can you expect lloyds register vehicle testing authority to come into a contract with government when they do not even have a blue print of what the testing authority is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not realise that <e> <s> the point i was making was how can lloyds register vehicle testing authority give any indication that they are prepared to take on this job if they have not been given sight of the blue print <e> <s> if lloyds have not been given a blue print and we have not been given a blue print when is such a blue print going to be put forward <e> <s> what is the timescale that the noble lord is expecting <e> <s> are we talking about one year or two years <e> <s> there is a lot which has not been put before us <e> <s> i am supporting the noble lord lord underhill here because i feel that this bill at this stage needs an insurance policy and his amendment gives it one <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support this amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord lord underhill and also for a couple of other reasons <e> <s> in clause the bill says this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a technical question in which i have a declared interest as the manufacturer of electrically-driven vehicles for the disabled <e> <s> as the noble earl is well aware for these a driving licence is not required <e> <s> for the record can he clarify that no clamp will be put on such a vehicle used by disabled people and that the various regulations on motor vehicles contained in this bill do not apply to those electrically-driven vehicles for disabled people who in certain circumstances are allowed to drive on the main highway <e> <s> i am sure that it is not the intention of the bill to cover this aspect but i think it would be worthwhile for the record for the noble earl to give some indication to reassure drivers of those vehicles in urban areas where the clamp is going to be in use <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment but i feel that it may need some <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord could tell us if the appliance of the type approved by her majestys government is british-made or is it of foreign manufacture <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked that question of the noble and learned lord because i was under the impression that the device which both he and i saw was of american manufacture <e> <s> i may have misunderstood but that is why i asked for some clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord a similar question to that which i asked in the debate on a previous amendment concerning the type approval by the secretary of state <e> <s> is the noble lord able to say what percentage of the existing apparatus or instruments used by the police are of british manufacture and what percentage are foreign-made and what percentage of the devices which will be type approved by the secretary of state will be of british manufacture <e> <s> i ask this of all the devices referred to in the bill i forgot i regret to say on the clamp because i feel that british manufacturers should have a chance at least to participate in the various devices which are recommended and indeed made law under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i have been asked to apologise on my noble friends behalf who omitted to give his apologies in advance that he could not attend the rest of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to support the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i believe that the government have changed their argument <e> <s> i was quite convinced when the noble earl put forward the case about the procurator fiscal during report stage and i am slightly confused now as to what is the reason for the noble earls answer of not accepting the basic argument by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i have possibly misunderstood and stand to be corrected but it seems to me that there has been a slight change of view <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl will correct me <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e> <s> i agree from these benches that these devices are the modern equivalent of the stocks and we feel that they must be used by the law <e> <s> i would ask the noble earl whether these regulations will make it possible for british manufacturers to be able to submit designs and manufactures of these devices which i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord underhill in moving this amendment has given so much trouble and research to it that i am quite persuaded that the term performance standard is a reassurance to a motorist who will be convicted by this equipment <e> <s> i give just one example <e> <s> will this equipment show the same speed in all weather conditions <e> <s> electronics are particularly susceptible to weather conditions <e> <s> a performance standard of the kind mentioned in the amendment would be a reassurance to a motorist that the device used is going to register the same numbers regardless of the time of year or the weather <e>", "<cs> my lords i want very briefly to endorse the words spoken by the noble lord lord underhill which were certainly the same as mine <e> <s> this has been my first transport bill as a liberal transport spokesman so i have been running in during this period partly with the assistance of the noble lord lord underhill with some of the joint amendments <e> <s> from these benches i should like to say that i very much welcome the attitude of noble lords opposite and the way in which they listened to what we had to say and indeed accepted some of our amendments <e> <s> i had only one slight disappointment <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to echo the remarks which have been made by the noble lord lord strabolgi to the noble lord lord kings norton <e> <s> it has been a privilege to serve on his committee and to be part of this really excellent report <e> <s> i think the staff who helped prepare it deserve considerable congratulation on the way it is presented and on the way it can be read <e> <s> i think that the speeches will be extremely short because virtually everything we should like to say has almost certainly been said rather better in the report which is before us <e> <s> i should like also to say how much i am looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord torrington because he made some very high-quality contributions to the subcommittee and i look forward particularly to hearing what he is going to say to us in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we too wish to thank the noble lord the minister for giving us this statement which was made in another place <e> <s> i think that the statement shows all the problems of a government that wish to make a commercial business proposition for political reasons the point taken up by the noble lord lord bishopston about subject to market conditions is one on which i should like clarification <e> <s> as the noble earl is aware the oil sector of the share market relative to the <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the noble lord lord bishopston from these benches i think we should make it quite clear that the reason we do so is that as far as i understand it these orders are the technical enactment trigger that will start making the privatisation process a reality <e> <s> all we are asking the government in this case if you call this the first pressure as i believe it is called in military terms is to restrain their finger on the trigger until perhaps the market conditions are a little better <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for answering this private notice question <e> <s> from these benches we should like to ask two questions <e> <s> as government policy is attempting to <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful from these benches that the noble lord has repeated the statement made in another place <e> <s> the question that i would like to put is this <e> <s> i wonder how the statement would have read if the issue had been a success <e> <s> i think this is the best they can do in the circumstances and for the term success to be used probably means that it has got into the guinness book of records <e> <s> from information i have received i believe that no new issue put forward on the stock exchange either in this country or elsewhere has met with such devasting non-success though in this way it may have a claim to fame <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to follow the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth in his homage to the heavy lorry <e> <s> i feel that the lorries versus people argument is often wrongly put not by the noble lord but in front of the general public <e> <s> that is why i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord underhill who has sought in his motion to annul the regulations to allow us all to question the government about these regulations in this more general context of lorries and people <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have temporary leave to exceed the speed limit my lords <e> <s> what is the speed limit for long-distance buses on such routes and how well is it monitored <e> <s> i ask that because it is difficult for private vehicles to proceed along motorways often in difficult conditions when as i say buses are travelling in excess of mph <e>

happened in stranraer <e> <s> there is no railway between stranraer and dumfries <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the most interesting debate which the noble earl lord halsbury has put before the house this afternoon <e> <s> we on these benches are very grateful that he has done so and that he has attracted as he himself has said an extraordinary list of most distinguished and articulate speakers <e> <s> for my part i am sad to see two names not on that list names of speakers who in the past have contributed so much to these debates lord wynne-jones and lord ritchie-calder <e> <s> it is a disappointment that they are no longer here but their words have always remained with me from the past debates that we have had on this subject <e> <s> i think that it is also worth saying that the more technical a subject and especially a subject like nuclear power the more one has to seek advice from technical people and the higher one goes the more difficult it is to comprehend the advice that one has been given <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury is an exception in that his brilliance is also that of a communicator as he has proved this afternoon <e> <s> other speakers on this list also have this same gift of communicating to the world at large what is a very technical subject about which many people have worried or enthused <e> <s> i think that this debate today will help a lot in clearing the air as to what is a fast reactor and what may be its potential in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl also to accept my congratulations <e> <s> at the same time may i ask him whether or not he agrees that this is the role which britoil should be performing exploring the waters around our shores and not those of other peoples shores in the middle east and the far east <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> we are also relieved that the leaks have stopped and that the report has at last been published <e> <s> indeed at one stage the leaks became a positive deluge and it was difficult to know how to react <e> <s> to add a further discordant note as the noble lord lord underhill mentioned the report to which we did not have access was discussed on the radio programme today this morning <e> <s> when a controversial report of this importance is published and we do not have access to it though journalists have and we are expected to comment on it outside the chamber we are in very great difficulty <e> <s> the government should prevent that from happening and perhaps they will give an explanation as to why it happened this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for drawing the attention of the house to this complaint which it is from industry about making us uncompetitive with our overseas competitors <e> <s> i have already given the noble earl my congratulations rather hastily during the flurry of question time but if i may repeat them again in the calmer waters of the evening and an unstarred question i look forward to some interesting debates on his new subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord ferrers for his presention of this bill which will we hope become a very useful one <e> <s> like the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble earl i am looking forward very much to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord northbourne and to hearing his expertise on this subject <e> <s> my noble friend lord mackie of benshie is unable to be present today but i know he would be particularly interested to take up the point which was made by the noble lord lord john-mackie about potatoes <e> <s> i have no doubt he was right in what he said although my own technical knowledge of that subject is small <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to follow the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and perhaps i will take up a little later his remarks about derelict farms <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lord mackie of benshie for bringing the houses attention to these new pressures affecting future land use and population in the rural and upland areas of britain in which i have a declared interest as a producer of scotch lamb and scotch beef <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships house is grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for drawing our attention to this important question <e> <s> her presentation this evening clearly shows that there is an even stronger case than that which was made many years ago in this house for i recall as far back as taking part in a debate initiated by the noble lord lord ohagan who has done so much for this cause <e> <s> i must also apologise to the noble baroness for the fact that my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley is unable to be here due to a long-standing engagement and i am taking his place on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also grateful to the noble earl for repeating that statement and we welcome the fact that the cross-channel electricity cable project is clearly and at last getting under way <e> <s> may i ask him to answer two question that could be worrying <e> <s> first how will this charter appear in the cegbs books how will it be shown on a discounted cash flow basis that it really is a step towards cheaper electricity than an outright purchase as has already been stated <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful from these benches to the noble lord lord nathan for drawing the attention of your lordships house to the subject of this unstarred question <e> <s> certainly i think that a commission on energy and the environment as a monitor of what we are doing in the energy field can only be beneficial <e> <s> the only question i have is as to whether this is the right vehicle for monitoring the principles upon which the noble lord bases his intervention <e>", "<cs> i was referring to disabled people driving powered cars <e> <s> in this context they would be quite safe from bicyclists <e>", "<cs> i fully accept what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has said but this is the second time that i have produced this amendment and the second time that i have been told that it is attempting to amend the wrong bill <e> <s> i am not entirely clear about it <e> <s> the enthusiasm with which the government go about this is all on paper <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter really presented my amendment better than i did <e> <s> the excuse is given that there is no money for cycleways and that there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord marsh for using the cross-bench day to put forward a motion which not only i but many other noble lords have wanted to debate in your lordships house <e> <s> the debate has attracted a wide list of speakers including two maiden speakers and i am privileged to be taking part on the occasion when my noble friend lord ezra will be making his maiden speech <e> <s> in that regard i cannot recall having heard more references to a maiden speaker than were made by the noble lord who moved the motion today <e> <s> i also look forward to hearing what the noble lord lord prys-davies with his experience in the principality has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister would give way on a point of clarification when he quoted his right honourable friend in another place and in answer to the noble lord lord bruce of donington he made a clear statement that they are not even a basis for decisions <e> <s> was he referring to the options to which the noble baroness lady stedman referred or was he referring to possible ways in which to reduce expenditure <e> <s> because in another place the minister seemed to say that the report is no basis for decisions of any kind whatever <e> <s> that seems to be contrary to what the noble lord has just said to the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> i should be grateful if he could clear it up <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way just so that there is no misunderstanding i did explain very simply that a bus should meet a train and that there should be interchangeability of ticketing and so on <e> <s> i think that we are in complete agreement with that kind of integration <e> <s> however i totally disagree with the other interpretation <e>", "<cs> i would like to speak strongly in support of the noble lord lord underhill in the thinking behind these two clauses being put down for consideration by the committee <e> <s> in the debate which we had only last night we had a definition of integration from the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth which i am sure the noble lord lord bellwin will recall <e> <s> transport integration was considered to be something which divided us depending upon where we sit in your lordships house <e> <s> i am glad that the situation has been clarified because that is not as i understand it the governments view and they are going to consider integration between bus and rail services <e>", "<cs> i too support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> it applies far beyond the scope of the bill <e> <s> the problem with two bureaucracies one centralised the executive and one decentralised is that when conditions like this are called upon nobody knows into which column the money should go <e> <s> this matter should be cleared up because exactly the same relationship occurs with the department of transport the british railways board and a hundred and one <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the noble earl lord mansfield for putting forward the motion and we shall not oppose it <e> <s> we have a certain wry amusement as we listen to the two parties labour and conservative concentrating on the minutiae of the boundary commission and their work determined not to look over their shoulders at the wider problem of electoral reform which is the only way to produce some form of proper representation in this country <e> <s> but i shall not dwell on that <e> <s> my noble friend lord mayhew pointed out the anomalies and mentioned the problems that we on these benches and certain others have in trying to get democracy into an outdated voting system <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to put the record straight <e> <s> he is quite correct <e> <s> i made a slip of the tongue <e> <s> the mileage to which i referred was undertaken during the course of the campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wondered on a technicality this being report stage whether the noble lord should have prefaced his last remarks with the words with the leave of the house <e> <s> i am not entirely clear whether or not he should be able to speak without that formality <e> <s> i always enjoy listening to the noble lord the minister but if we are to get on perhaps he could confirm that he was a little out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege to serve under the noble lord lord kings norton on his committee and be a part of this report <e> <s> congratulations are also due and other noble lords have given them to the staff who made this report not only readable but also a very important document <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to hear the noble earl the minister in his opening contribution to this debate make reference to company reports and the fact that there should be some mention of energy saving made in them <e> <s> on the qustion of the statutory prompting of companies to do this i had a slight disagreement with the committee because i thought companies would not do so and that this requirement should go straight on to the statute book <e> <s> but as the noble earl has said that he will persuade companies i shall be happy merely to hear those words at this early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches also wish to thank the noble earl the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i should also like to add our tribute to mr norman siddall for the work he has done as well as to my noble friend lord ezra <e> <s> we also must congratulate mr macgregor for taking on what is clearly going to be a difficult and onerous task bearing in mind his age which is that of an old-age pensioner <e> <s> i must say that we from these benches also believe in flexible retirement that people have different abilities at different ages <e> <s> i do not think that old-age pensioners on a week will grudge mr macgregor his or his million compensation given to a merchant bank <e> <s> what they and we would like to know is will the earnings rule apply to mr macgregor as it does to other old-age pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we wish first to take the opportunity to congratulate the noble earl the minister on piloting his first energy bill through your lordships house <e> <s> we are looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord taylor of hadfield <e> <s> in this connection i would suggest to the noble earl that it is rather late in the day to have a second reading debate which includes a maiden speaker bearing in mind that another maiden speaker the noble baroness lady cox is to take part in the debate on the unstarred question which is to follow later this evening <e> <s> it is rather unfair for maiden <e>", "<cs> in proposing the amendment to leave out clause i appreciate that it may appear at first glance to defeat itself and by removing this clause one would be removing an important safeguard in the bill in which the secretary of states consent will be required for the building extension or operation of nuclear-powered generating stations and it would be an offence to proceed without such consent <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble earl the minister has said and i accept most of the points he has raised except perhaps one major one <e> <s> i fail to see how if this clause was removed from the bill anyone would wish to make a nuclear power station generating fewer than megawatts in which case he would be forced to come under scrutiny and prevention under clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak briefly on clause which determines how charges are to be made for the electricity supplied by an electricity board to a private generator or supplier <e> <s> while a considerable amount of information is presented in the cegb accounts it is not clear what the cost of electricity from each power station is when both fuel and capital and maintenance overhead costs are taken into account <e> <s> there is bound to be a variation between some nuclear plants which are very efficient and some nuclear plants which may not be so efficient <e> <s> the same variation will apply in the case of coal plants either because of technical problems or because some of them are running very well or because some of them are old while others are new <e> <s> there is bound therefore to be a quite considerable variation in the efficiency of plants <e>", "<cs> i will have to read <e>", "<cs> i was not sure of the formal order of speaking but if i may repeat what the noble lord lord strabolgi said and put words into his mouth in view of what the noble earl said and the very helpful way in which he has taken to the thinking behind these amendments which we on these benches greatly appreciate i shall be pleased to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i cannot ask for much more than that apart from the committee accepting the amendment <e> <s> the noble earls words are good enough for me at this stage and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for submitting an amendment in the wrong place <e> <s> as the noble earl has pointed out it should have come after the word financial in line <e> <s> it is possibly by chance that financial viability came under the scottish section <e> <s> as the south of scotland electricity board has per cent <e> <s> over-capacity of electricity it shows that assessment of viability or future projections cannot necessarily be perfect in the electricity industry <e> <s> indeed if the noble earl is saying that district heating is not viable through chp i become worried about department of energy paper no <e> <s> which shows that it is viable <e> <s> its popularity has been proved in denmark <e> <s> to take up lord strabolgis point i was informed only today that cities in denmark have had to be zoned because all the inhabitants wished to have chp district heating <e> <s> it was however the wish of the government to introduce gas in certain areas which costs more <e> <s> there was no choice about the use of gas <e> <s> the government insisted that in certain zones gas had to be used even when the citizens would have preferred to use chp district heating systems <e> <s> it works effectively <e> <s> people like it and it is cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the noble lord lord kirkhill for instigating this debate <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord gormley who was due to speak before me is not in his seat <e> <s> i believe that he would have had a major contribution to make but i understand that he has been delayed in his journey from the channel islands <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches want to welcome the statement of the noble earl the minister and briefly ask perhaps two questions <e> <s> first is this a statement at all <e> <s> it would appear from the way that it is written that it is a statement of intent subject to satisfactory negotiations confirming the figures in it <e> <s> i should say that my noble friend who would normally be putting the questions on this statement is not in the house today <e> <s> i feel that the figures included in the statement will have to be clarified and confirmed when the negotiations have been completed <e> <s> i would ask the noble earl to confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friend lord ezra may i clarify one point to the noble earl <e> <s> i do not think we are asking for charity that is not the point of this amendment <e> <s> we are not asking for any special or lower rate of return <e> <s> we are asking for recognition by the generating boards that different criteria are applied to chp schemes than those which are applied to straight generating schemes <e> <s> the noble earl referred to waste <e> <s> the whole point of a combined heat and power scheme is to prevent the waste of excessive heat going up the chimney into the atmosphere <e> <s> in terms of efficiency and lack of waste i should have thought that the recognition of this alone would have meant a different type of criteria in order to judge such a scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware especially in view of the reply that he has given to the noble lord lord boothby that on every standard bottle of whisky purchased over the counter per cent <e> <s> of the retail price or goes to the exchequer <e> <s> can the minister identify any other consumer product on sale during this festive season on which more tax is paid <e> <s> will he therefore agree that surely the time has come for her majestys government to reconsider their taxation policies which discriminate against the scotch whisky industry and employment in rural scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord fanshawe for giving us an opportunity to express our views and hopes about the future of hong kong <e> <s> it is a special pleasure to speak after the noble lord lord shepherd with his knowledge and confidence in the good intentions of the government of the peoples republic of china which i completely share and indeed his emphasis on the need for a broad agreement first before we get down to details <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we wish to echo the thoughts and good wishes that have already been given to the state of brunei and to the maldives <e> <s> i should also like to add my own personal statement to these general good wishes <e> <s> as regards the maldives these small islands have the most formidable navigators and sailors in that part of the indian ocean and in many ways they are highly independent <e> <s> given their new status we wish them every success for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> of course we endorse wholeheartedly the thoughts and sympathy expressed at the horrendous accident that has occurred at bhopal <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the debate on the future of hong kong and the draft agreement that has been placed before this house <e> <s> like the noble lord lord cledwyn i am looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble earl lord birkenhead <e> <s> i had hoped to be able to listen to the noble earl before making my intervention but at rather short notice i have had to speak somewhat high up the list and so although i was going to make a mere personal statement i shall now have to make a much wider speech and i hope that that fact will not be overlooked <e> <s> therefore i was not in a position to receive many of the submissions from umelco and various other representations which have been made but i have received reports of those submissions to my noble friends and colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i want to thank the noble viscount lord torrington for his dispensation that allowed me to take part in this debate although i may perhaps be unable to listen to his winding-up speech <e> <s> having once sat with members of this committee i must congratulate him and his sub-committee f on producing one of their finest if not the finest report that i can recall being produced by them <e> <s> i must admit that i agree with almost every word spoken by the noble viscount in his opening speech which set the theme for this debate <e> <s> the only point that i shall take up and on which i slightly disagree with him concerns his remarks about the political conferences <e> <s> if i may pick up something that the noble lord lord dean said i think it is possible to have underestimated the very deep concern of the public at that time and their feeling of slight bewilderment because they were not nearly so well informed as we have been in preparation for this debate <e> <s> delegates at those conferences including my own delegation and i disagree with their conclusion which i felt was possibly due to the lack of information that is now available to us felt that the decisions were a reaction to the feeling of the time experienced by most people in the country regardless of party loyalties <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble earl i queried that figure <e> <s> i was given it by the cegb information officer <e> <s> i was astounded by it <e> <s> i wait for any further correction from any noble lord who may be more scientific than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to make a correction <e> <s> the noble earl queried the statistics about carbon dioxide which i gave <e> <s> i have checked and the noble earl is quite correct <e> <s> it is tonnes per person per annum and not million tonnes per annum as i mistakenly said <e> <s> i apologise to the noble earl and to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to follow the noble lord lord derwent <e> <s> i have listened with interest to his contribution which was based on his valuable experience in the business world <e> <s> in what i hope will be a brief intervention this afternoon i wish also to emphasise that side of this topic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord somers for bringing our attention to the situation existing on the railways and <e> <s> above all for affording us the chance to try to obtain from her majestys government their attitude in general towards rail travel and the future of the rail system in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords like many other speakers i wish to thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> in the late seventies the subject was greeted as science fiction <e> <s> i looked at my notes <e> <s> on th november i asked an unstarred question on the subject <e> <s> at the time the reaction of noble lords on the then labour government benches was one of bewilderment <e> <s> from the conservative benches it was of unrecorded merriment <e> <s> as a result i did not go too far with the subject because i had begun to doubt the whole issue myself by the time i reached the end of the unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords as a non-scientist it is a privilege to take part in a debate based on the brilliant report produced by distinguished noble lords under the guidance of the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> i do not wish to take any advantage of my amateur status but i must be at odds with the conclusions of the report on the grounds of what was intimated by the noble lord lord dainton <e> <s> i am a fatalist and i believe that whatever we may try to do it will not be enough to prevent some of the physical processes that we have discussed this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord geddes and other noble lords who have much experience of hong kong <e> <s> as a result most of what i have prepared has already been said by other noble lords including the noble lord lord holme of cheltenham in his marvellous maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure we all look forward to hearing more of what he has to say on future occasions <e> <s> the noble lord made reference in particular to the new airport <e> <s> i hope to mention it also a little later on <e>"]
