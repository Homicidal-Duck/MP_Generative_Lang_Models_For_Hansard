["<cs> my lords it will be remembered that for a short period after the last war this chamber was used by the members from the other place and in asking for your lordships indulgence as i do i should perhaps explain that this will in fact be the second maiden speech that i have made in this particular chamber <e> <s> the first was made in support of the attlee government <e> <s> i see now that my speech was rather poor but i believe that it was a very good government and i am sure that my noble friends will allow me to say that <e> <s> it was a very good government if for nothing more than its handling of defence <e> <s> mr attlee who was a strong leader with plenty of robust common sense not only committed this country to producing nuclear weapons but did so without consulting his party or parliament <e> <s> mr ernest bevin another strong man of great integrity and character probably did more than anyone else to unite the west against the menace of stalinism <e>", "<cs> my lords i must wait until an occasion other than my maiden speech to give my views on the governments plans for trident and the navy <e> <s> on this occasion i would rather make a few comments about our defence problem in europe and to ask what lessons if any we can learn from the past <e> <s> i am following to some extent the admirable speech made by my fellow maiden speaker the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the very critical question of a cease-fire in lebanon while paying tribute to the tireless work of mr habib would not the chances of success be better if he were empowered to negotiate with both parties to the dispute and not only with one as i understand the position to be <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount give an assurance that there will not be built abroad for the royal navy submarines which might be built at home as a result of the governments proceeding with the trident project <e>", "<cs> my lords since withdrawal would disrupt not only our own economy but also the economies of our partners can we rely on them renegotiating with us in a thoroughly dispassionate spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the leader of the plo has recently explicitly and publicly endorsed the proposal for a peaceful settlement put forward by the government of saudi arabia which involves among other things the right of all countries in the region including israel to live in peace <e> <s> will he agree that this is an important and hopeful development and that the leader of the plo should be encouraged in the line he is taking <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that a major difficulty has been the soviet reluctance to accept effective measures of verification <e> <s> after years of discussing verification with the soviet government have the government reached any conclusions about the reasons for this obsession with secrecy <e>", "<cs> my lords in the meantime would the noble lord confirm that the only assessment of soviet conventional forces and nuclear forces in europe which has ever been used by any soviet spokesman is the assessment made by the institute of strategic studies in london <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the government are proposing to deploy trident missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord further why the government are so confident that the soviet union cannot deploy space based laser weapons by the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the chief whip for his wisdom in inviting the noble lord lord brockway to wind-up this debate from the back benches <e> <s> it is plain that the later the hour the greater the vigour and passion with which the noble lord speaks <e> <s> we are all extremely appreciative that he could give us his speech tonight no doubt shortly before moving on after this debate to some other disarmament discussion in some other place <e> <s> he is indefatigable <e> <s> may i say as a former very old colleague of his how delighted i am to follow him in this debate and how deeply all of us admire his amazing vigour and sincerity after so many years of campaigning <e>", "<cs> perhaps not yet but i hope the noble viscount has studied very carefully the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the saudi rgime has invested a great deal in this plan which has received wide and well-deserved support and that nothing could unsettle the gulf more seriously or help the russians more than if this plan were simply brushed aside by the israelis or by any other government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is quite unrealistic to expect either side to recognise the other unilaterally <e> <s> was not the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords like every previous speaker in this debate my noble friends and i most warmly welcome the proposals of president reagan on disarmament and arms control <e> <s> i think we probably all agree that a major positive statement of this kind was very badly needed from the united states in order to bring nato together and to hearten the multilateralists and those who are resisting the challenge of soviet communism <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord cathcart in his extremely persuasive and informed speech dealt faithfully with the demand for unilateral disarmament and of course it is true that the initiative of president reagan his offer of the zero option has caused a good deal of division and confusion in the <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am not sure i think that we are all very worried about the prospect of having to use these bombs in any circumstances against any target of any kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble viscount is very well aware of the important difference between being informed and invited to make comments on the one hand and being given observer status and being able to make up ones own mind from ones own observations on the other <e> <s> i ask why the european allies are refused the second status <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to that bracketing of the labour and liberal conferences is the minister aware that pending multilateral disarmament the liberal conference supports natos established nuclear deterrent and is therefore not unilateralist and is associated with the british atlantic committees position and not with that of the labour party <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that the liberal assembly takes its decisions by democratic methods and not <e>", "<cs> by methods which have made the labour conference an object of universal ridicule <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that for some time now the noble lord lord kennet has been pressing both the united states government and the british government to accept this change in terminology and that the description of the geneva conference as the intermediate range weapons conference is a considerable personal success for him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount lord trenchard whether the government will take into account the very heavy cost of chevaline and also the very heavy cost of replacing the motors in the polaris missiles when they come to consider whether they should proceed with the trident project <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the noble viscount the minister to clarify his answer to me <e> <s> did he say the government are proposing to carry on with the trident project <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is surely to be congratulated not only for introducing this subject so well this evening but for his long-drawn-out and persistent campaigning on this very distressing issue <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington described the opposition to the government on this point as non-party <e> <s> i think that as the debate goes on it will be seen also to be all-party because certainly from the liberal benches the noble earl has our support <e> <s> he may have noted that our party leader has already raised this issue in another place <e> <s> i also enjoyed the references of the noble lord lord bruce to his meagre pay as a major in france <e> <s> how enviable he seems to me who at the beginning of the war in france was paid in the ranks i think s <e> <s> d <e> <s> a day <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said and refunded <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> perhaps he will elaborate on this because i have here a suggestion that and not all by any means failed to get refunds there is evidence which i would be glad to send to the minister that some of these protected personnel did not get the refunds <e> <s> perhaps he could deal with this point <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord give way on that point <e> <s> he has referred to two meetings one of the cabinet and another a departmental official meeting at which these decisions were taken of which we are so critical <e> <s> will he also have copies of those documents placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> while it is obvious that the events in poland make such negotiations more difficult may i ask the minister to give an assurance that the intention of the americans to press on with these negotiations is unchanged <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not to know the answers to questions of this kind <e> <s> can we be told for example whether the agenda has been agreed and if there is a calendar of future meetings <e> <s> shall we be informed about such matters during the process of the talks <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with the spirit of the question of the noble lord lord shinwell may i ask whether it is not a fact that her majestys government already accept dual key arrangements for a number of nuclear weapons on the continent <e> <s> therefore in that case is it not self-evident why there is not a much better case for having dual key where the weapons are stationed in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords might it not be helpful however if when the noble viscount places in the library the three service documents to which he referred he also places the minutes of the crucial interdepartmental committee to which he has referred which took the decision which is so widely criticised in many parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount noted the opposition to trident expressed this weekend by the former navy minister mr <e> <s> speed and his preference for one of the cheaper alternative systems <e> <s> will the government not recognise that to press ahead with trident to completion will require over the years much wider support in parliament and in the country than it is likely to get <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has in this house frequently referred to the cost of trident as being per cent <e> <s> of defence expenditure but has he worked out in round terms what that cost is and if so may we know the total <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has already been organised in this country a world disarmament campaign to which many important bodies and several political parties have affiliated including my own and that of the noble lord lord jenkins <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount seen the evidence of the comptroller and auditor general to the public accounts committee which suggests that per cent <e> <s> is too high and is often being exceeded <e> <s> the government have committed them-selves to the principle of comparability with the rest of british industry <e> <s> why do they not stick to that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister noted the recent statement on chemical warfare of president reagan and would he not agree that we are now faced not only with a nuclear arms race and a conventional arms race but a race in producing and stockpiling new chemical weapons <e> <s> is it quite impossible to persuade the russians and americans to try to deal with this particular problem separately from their other disputes and discuss it together <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i welcome the rather positive approach of the government to the reserves contained in the statement and we welcome also the concept which runs through the statement that the reserves constitute something of a bridge between the military community and the civilian community <e> <s> it is in that context that while i believe we would all wish that the young people could be training for permanent employment nevertheless since the prospects facing young people today are what they are we welcome the scheme suggested by the government <e> <s> we look forward to further details about it being given to the house and we hope that it succeeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount will very kindly give us the overall costs of the measures he is proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that in spite of the points that he has made the competitive development and production of chemical weapons by the russians and the americans is a fresh and deplorable escalation of the arms race <e> <s> secondly will the noble viscount be more specific <e> <s> he referred in his reply to the fact that the government are willing to support measures in suitable disarmament forums <e> <s> can he assure the house that the government are going to take an initiative in a particular forum of a particular kind in order to try to check this arms race <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that this project is absurdly unsuitable and extravagant for this country <e> <s> is he also aware that greater priority will be given to our conventional forces by an alliance government which would have little hesitation in cancelling this project <e> <s> is he aware that three of the four political parties in this country strongly oppose the project that not all the members of his own party are supporting it and that strong reservations are felt about it in the armed services which have the closest understanding of the disastrous effect in the long-term that it will have on our conventional strength <e> <s> will the minister tell the house not what proportion of the cost of the total budget it is but what proportion of the total equipment budget it will be in which year that proportion reaches its maximum and what that maximum is <e> <s> finally is the minister aware that it cannot be right to launch a hush national defence project like this on the basis of such narrow political support <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the foreign secretary is not proposing a visit of friendship to iran or to poland but is about to visit israel <e> <s> may we have an assurance that when he is in israel he will represent to the israeli government the damage done to israels reputation in this country by the repression of human rights on the west bank and in particular by the use of firearms against unarmed demonstrators <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say what will be the rank of the continuing head of the british delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government the question of which i have given private notice namely <e>", "<cs> my lords for a second time i beg to ask a question of which i have given private notice <e> <s> the question is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord may i ask whether he is aware that the foreign secretarys efforts to promote a peaceful settlement in palestine have been widely admired but that no matter how toughly he talks when he gets to israel the mere fact that he is willing to make a courtesy call at this time is bound to help mr <e> <s> begin to resist his critics and to continue colonising and oppressing the arabs in gaza and on the west bank <e> <s> is it really appropriate that a british foreign secretary should pay a friendship visit to a government whose international conduct is so widely condemned universally condemned and which is indeed so outrageous <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are distinctions between not making a courtesy visit and cutting off all communications which is not i think suggested by anyone <e> <s> but is he also aware that his replies about the need for reciprocal recognition will be very warmly welcomed the plo must of course recognise israel but reciprocally the israelis must recognise the plo and that in this context his statement in striking contrast to the statements of the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies and the noble lord lord shinwell produces a hope for the future <e> <s> but really one cannot expect the plo to recognise israel when mr <e> <s> begin says repeatedly that even if they do the israelis will never recognise the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we all look forward to an indefinite future for the noble lord lord shinwell <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say what procedural or institutional reforms in the community the government are supporting in order to put an end to these repeated nationalistic dogfights which bring no credit to any country and certainly none at all to the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there are really two processes involved dissemination and declassification <e> <s> what arrangements are there in the ministry for the regular declassification of secret research just as there are for the declassification of secret papers <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago on a visit to the argentine as a back-bench mp i was invited to address the argentine assembly and for several minutes after i reached the rostrum i was unable to make myself heard for shouts of malvinas malvinas give us back the falkland islands <e> <s> until one deputy stood up interrupted and shouted in spite of the falkland islands we have the greatest admiration for britain <e> <s> that shout i think received the loudest cheer of all the proceedings from all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer will give great reassurance <e> <s> would he agree that in recent years no one has worked more patiently and positively for a settlement in palestine than the noble lord lord carrington <e> <s> the ministers statement indicating a continuity of policy will be warmly welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not perfectly plain that on both sides there are strong elements whose views are quite incompatible with a peaceful and just settlement <e> <s> is it not quite plain that the literal interpretation of the plo charter and the literal interpretation of resolutions of the knesset and declarations <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have detected in the debate some feeling that since we last discussed the falklands on the whole on balance events have developed favourably rather than unfavourably for our cause <e> <s> if so i think that this is fair <e> <s> since we last discussed the subject the blockade has been operated quickly and efficiently and is respected by the argentinians <e> <s> our support worldwide has been remarkably satisfactory <e> <s> not only has there been that of the commonwealth and the european community i think that we can be moderately satisfied with the reactions of the organisation of american states <e> <s> our success at the security council and with american public opinion has been very reassuring and such criticisms have been made recently of the foreign office that i should like to pay tribute to the work in the united states of sir anthony parsons and sir nicholas henderson <e> <s> i think that they have both done the country extremely well <e>", "<cs> it is extraordinary that the key foreign policy issue for the labour party her majestys opposition is to quit the common market now <e> <s> of course i exempt the occupants of the opposition front bench <e> <s> in fact i am bound to say that in the short time that i have been a member of this house i cannot recall any one of them on any issue actually defending the policy of the party to which they belong and for that they are widely respected in this house i have no doubt <e> <s> but the attitude of the european community has been magnificent <e> <s> for the opposition to accept the support of our friends and allies at considerable cost to themselves at our time of danger and then simply to kick them in the teeth is to me incomprehensible <e>", "<cs> no my lords he would never have stopped the fleet now <e> <s> he understood that diplomacy needed to be backed with power and he would never have stopped the fleet <e> <s> surely there is some midway <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord george-brown when he goes home and studies my words in <e>", "<cs> may i come now to what the noble lord lord shinwell called constructive suggestions and i am sorry to say this to the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> i do not wish to give offence but i thought his speech was full of constructive suggestions which he very much suggested we should not make <e> <s> the noble lord lord duncan-sandys made one of the constructive suggestions <e> <s> he said to my great surprise that the falklands should become independent and should rely on the oas for protection <e> <s> i could not have heard him aright <e> <s> how can people become an independent country and how can the oas protect anybody when it is so divided and unreliable <e> <s> i could not understand that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> that is the second occasion on which he has said that negotiations are now taking place <e> <s> could he clarify whether this is the official position of the government that negotiations are already taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether it is not a fact that substantial injustice was done to a large number of ex-officers and instead of allowing this unhappy matter to drift on should not the government make perhaps a modest <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount to explain to the house the reasons given by the americans for adjourning the negotiations on these weapons for two months against the wishes of the russians <e> <s> may i also ask him whether or not he agrees that the reasons given were surprisingly insubstantial <e>", "<cs> my lords has the ministers attention been drawn to an admirable leading article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich could have pointed out that in article it is the interests of the inhabitants which have to be paramount <e> <s> the language used by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that xerxes would have done much better with a nuclear-powered fleet submarine he would have had far more success <e> <s> with regard to the question of blockade i must say seriously that i thought that the noble lord lord paget did far from justice to the royal navy in regard to both its achievements and its capacity to sustain the air and sea blockades <e> <s> however i think that some of the noble lords remarks were made in a scholarly and detached manner and without very serious reference to the important naval problems in the falklands area <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords but the fact that a territory is far from its motherland or from the capital city does not measure its right of self-defence under article of the united nations charter it is too obvious <e> <s> i have yet to see on the tape any announcement that the argentine government have rejected mr haigs terms though this might be due to the quite extraordinarily complicated structure of power within the argentine government to which the noble earl lord onslow referred <e> <s> it also suggests a degree of uncertainty a degree of division which i think is encouraging even if eventually the terms are turned down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the noble baroness was absent during the speeches of some of her noble friends because some of her noble friends spoke about this subject in the same rather <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had three debates on this subject i have made three speeches and lord gladwyn has made three speeches <e> <s> i wonder whether i could refer the noble lord to these long expositions of liberal party policy on this subject which we have already given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i associate my noble friends and myself with the expressions of sympathy for next-of-kin so well expressed by the noble lord lord peart and by the noble viscount <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that the admiration of my noble friends and myself for the navy is entirely undiminished at this time <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether he agrees that if hms sheffield had been equipped with the stretched version of sea dart with the new radar tracker it might well have survived this attack <e> <s> may i ask him why it was not so equipped <e> <s> may i also ask the noble viscount whether he is entirely satisfied that the exocet was fired from a high level by a mirage and not from a low level which might perhaps explain the failure to intercept the missile <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble viscount to restate the circumstances in which her majestys government have authorised attacks on argentine ships and aircraft and to confirm that the policy of minimum force remains absolutely valid and that no attacks will be authorised in argentine waters or on the argentine mainland <e>", "<cs> my lords this statement appears to my noble friends and myself to be rather more positive and hopeful than earlier statements of the same kind made recently by her majestys government <e> <s> it is informative about the machinery of negotiations but it is not informative as to what those negotiations are about <e> <s> it tells us that there is similarity between the secretary-generals thinking and the points that the government are pursuing with mr haig <e> <s> if we knew one of them we would have some clue about the other <e> <s> but as we know neither it does not really inform us very much more about what we know already <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the camp david autonomy talks have been going on for several years and that no progress whatever has been made <e> <s> is he also aware that the foreign ministers of the community will be meeting this weekend to discuss the report of their president on his return from a visit to the middle east <e> <s> will he give the house the assurance that the british government will take an initiative so that peace can be achieved in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the israelis are at present impeding the camp david autonomy talks by requiring as a new departure that they should take place in jerusalem thus requiring the egyptians and the americans to recognise jerusalem as the capital of israel <e> <s> will he also say whether this subject was discussed by the community foreign ministers last weekend and whether the community are proposing to take a new initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the falklands crisis has reminded everyone that for whatever reason in the past arms sales have been generally far too undiscriminating and that there must be some review of the situation <e> <s> why should the community not for example at least keep a register of arms deals being negotiated so that in appropriate cases member states could make representations about them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i share to the full the heartfelt sympathy that has been expressed for the relatives and friends of those who have been killed or wounded in this action <e> <s> that need not i think prevent us from taking note of the success with which the task force has pursued its objectives with the minimum loss of life <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that too <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness saying that the summit confined itself on the middle east to diplomatic activities and to endorsing the united nations resolution <e> <s> did no one for example suggest to president reagan that the americans might make their lavish provision of money and arms to israel conditional on the observance by the begin rgime of civilised international conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that my noble friends and i share to the full the sympathy that he and the noble lord lord peart have expressed <e> <s> i think that we also feel for the force commander who up to this point had handled these difficult disembarkations with brilliant success in spite of a failing of aircraft early warning for which he himself cannot possibly be blamed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord brockway not only for introducing this subject this afternoon but for giving us an eyewitness account of the opening of the important special session of the united nations general assembly <e> <s> as a pioneer of peace campaigning the noble lord was i felt fully entitled to take credit for the remarkable performance of the peace demonstration at the special assembly opening <e> <s> though he did not say so i think

zuckerman for his intervention <e> <s> i hope that i conveyed in my speech that i sympathise very much with what the four distinguished americans were saying <e> <s> i tried to show that some of the assumptions behind the flexible response are quite mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me if he does not agree because they are strategic with the british and french nuclear deterrents being included in the inf talks should they be included in the start talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord is not attributing to the british navy the extremely cruel and brutal behaviour of the israeli army today <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of points about the speech of the noble lord lord elystan-morgan puzzled me very greatly <e> <s> he began by reminding us of the

would the noble lord agree that political parties which receive large sums of money from trade unions should be particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords while the statement may well have been right is there any reason to suppose that condemnation and exhortation whether by the community or by members of the united nations will have the slightest effect on people like mr <e> <s> begin and mr sharon <e>

my lords is not the noble lord going a little far in saying that the production on a large scale of chemical weapons by the united states and the soviet union is simply a matter for those countries <e> <s> surely that is going too far <e> <s> the british government are i hope already playing an active part on this subject in the united nations disarmament conference <e> <s> is the noble lord really right to say that the production of any form of weapons even though not for deployment outside the united states is not a matter for her allies in nato <e> <s> surely he is going too far <e>", "<cs> my lords granted that the venezuelans have no right to veto the application to the world bank do the government regard it as significant that they should have attempted to defeat the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not the position that any small improvement that the government achieve in productivity will be offset by the eager support given by the opposition to damaging national strikes <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that possibly the most promising disarmament negotiations at present are those taking place in vienna on mutual and balanced force reductions <e> <s> would he agree that although these have been going on for a long time substantial progress has been made and might it not be that if the foreign secretary and his colleagues now took a strong personal interest in these negotiations success might come <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but is the noble lord aware that my question is not addressed to the council of ministers but to her majestys government <e> <s> will he give the assurance that her majestys government like other governments concerned will stand by their commitment in the treaty of rome to use a common system <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the last system used was completely idiotic and seriously distorted the political balance of the european parliament to the advantage of the conservative party <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to give a plain answer to my question <e> <s> if the other governments agree are her majestys government going to stand by their commitment in the treaty of rome to accept a common system <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been many recent debates and government statements on defence in your lordships house and in another place and these have revealed clearly the basic weakness of the governments defence policy <e> <s> it emerged clearly again from the speech this afternoon of the noble viscount <e> <s> it is that ministers are committing the traditional crime of peace-time british governments in taking on too many defence commitments for the resources they are capable of mustering <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i would dispute this point with the noble viscount and i shall be coming to it very shortly <e> <s> i think the conclusions must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when the noble lord reads the account in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the implication of what the noble viscount is saying is that we do not need a special capacity or a special budget for this capacity <e> <s> we can muddle through on what we have for nato <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is his implication we must muddle through with what we have already assigned to nato <e> <s> but what happens if our next independent military operation coincides with an increase in east/west tension <e> <s> it may well happen <e> <s> how can we go on taking away from our troops and our resources assigned to nato dispensing with extra expenditure on the role the noble viscount is looking for in the future <e> <s> he said that we had what we needed we had the right mix of forces by chance in the falklands <e> <s> that is not strictly correct <e> <s> there was a grave lack in the falklands there was a lack of airborne early warning and a lack of large carriers <e>

days <e> <s> i would ask the noble viscount when he winds up to tell us a little about this role <e> <s> has he studied the political implications <e> <s> have the government worked out the cost and the logistics <e> <s> i think that parliament is entitled to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would not agree that some commitments can be transferred or shared as a result of diplomacy <e> <s> we do not have to take them as given for ever do we <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord seen the estimate that in the event of conventional war in europe per cent <e> <s> of american reinforcements of men and materials will have to be transported across the atlantic by sea <e> <s> will he agree that the aim of raising the nuclear threshold which is agreed by all parties could not be better forwarded than by greatly increasing the anti-submarine capacity of the british navy in the east atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask her majestys government a question of which i have given private notice <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition will the government make urgent representations to the united states government to stop the flow of arms and in particular phosphorous shells to israel <e> <s> will he agree that quite apart from considerations for humanity nothing suits the russians better than the spectacle which is watched by the whole world of natos most powerful member facilitating what amounts to war crimes against the people of west beirut <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to consider again whether or not the delivery of arms including phosphorous shells by the united states to israel is a matter for her majestys government <e> <s> are not her majestys government a permanent member of the security council and did they not vote for a resolution of the security council condemning israel as an aggressor <e> <s> are not her majestys government a close ally of the united states <e> <s> why then do the government just wash their hands of this profoundly worrying phenomenon the continuance of the selling of arms and phosphorous shells by the united states to israel <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say why the position of the different powers on the question of verification is considered to be confidential <e> <s> are we not entitled to know what form of verification would be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that owing to the limited size of the existing multi-national force there is a real danger of further massacres among the palestinian refugees in southern lebanon <e> <s> even though as she says we may not have <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to intervene in order to say as a former navy minister in a labour government that of course the attitude that the government are now taking is identically the same as that taken by the labour government when i was a navy minister <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate began with a distinguished speech from the noble viscount a feature of which was his bold and fresh defence of natos flexible strategy <e> <s> i think that it was the first time that a british minister argued that in the event of imminent defeat in conventional war in europe a single nuclear shot carefully selected as to its size and as to its target possibly accompanied with a warning in advance might not provoke nuclear retaliation and might bring the fighting to an end <e> <s> i hope that i am doing the noble viscount justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble viscount is being needlesssly defensive because i was going to agree to the extent that it is impossible to say that retaliation would be certain <e> <s> it would be impossible to say that such action might not in fact bring the hostilities to an end <e> <s> what i missed in the speech of the noble viscount was a declaration that it was the policy of her majestys government to avoid being placed in a situation where such a decision might have to be taken <e> <s> i missed in his speech any argument that a nato strategy which has to rely on the first use of nuclear weapons is an unsatisfactory strategy which needs to be changed <e> <s> that is certainly the position of those of us on these benches <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble viscount might agree with the supreme allied commander general rogers when he drew attention to the unsatisfactory nature of having to rely on the possibility of using nuclear weapons first <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing i want to do is in any way to misrepresent the noble viscount but i want to make it perfectly clear that we on these benches regard this strategy as wholly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount what is he arguing <e> <s> is he arguing that if you already have a fantastic overkill of fifty times the deterrent needed the fact that the other side has sixty times means that you must have sixty times <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble viscount how likely is it that this build-up of overkill on both sides creates the conditions for multilateral disarmament <e> <s> does it not increase tension increase suspicion on both sides <e> <s> how far is it possible for people who believe in the necessity of their own countrys overkill to go to the negotiating table and negotiate it away with the other side <e> <s> i think it very unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a little over-simple may i come to that later <e> <s> what i am arguing is that the building up of fantastic overkill both by the soviet union and the united states is not as the noble viscount suggested a happy prelude to multilateral disarmament but it creates exactly the opposite atmosphere and what is more that people soviet and american leaders who are supporting the overkill who are dedicated to creating the overkill are on the whole by that fact less well qualified to get rid of the overkill by negotiations at the conference table <e> <s> it means in my view that any soviet or american negotiator who thinks that his countrys overkill adds to its security should not be allowed within miles of geneva because he does not understand the way that nuclear weapons have transformed the whole problem of disarmament and security he does not <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that none of this mans visits to vienna or to eastern europe was known to the authorities at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the report is most unusual in having been produced and signed by people of real standing on both sides of the iron curtain <e> <s> can he say which of its specific recommendations the government now accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the main objection to this bill is that its provisions are wholly incompatible with britains continued membership of nato <e> <s> but i should like to begin if i may by clearing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness to give the reasons for the shift in the governments attitude on the palestine problem which was evident at copenhagen and for the hardening of the governments line on the subject of palestinian representations which led to the cancelling by the government of the visit to this country of king hassan of morocco and his delegation which has given grave offence to a number of moderate arab leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what evidence he has of the use for military purposes of advanced technology of a non-military nature that has been exported <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches there will be a welcome for a number of the points in this detailed and important statement for the second thoughts of the government which no amount of careful drafting can conceal about the future size of the frigate fleet also for the emphasis on greater mobility and in particular for the remarkable suggestion of increasing tanker capability <e> <s> the noble viscount has already mentioned the very necessary improvement in aircraft early warning <e> <s> we on these benches also congratulate the government for rejecting all proposals for thinning out baor or raf germany which we should have regarded as a very serious error of judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords has it emerged in these meetings that her majestys government agree with the french government on the crucial question of the geneva negotiations namely that an agreement that fell short of the zero option might still be well worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has referred to me would he be good enough to give way <e> <s> if it were my motivation as he suggests to appease the cnd elements surely i was greatly mistaken in attacking the unilateralists with the vigour that i did in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the falklands campaign was of course a brilliant victory and a due share of credit should go to the two senior defence ministers at the time sir john knott and the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> after all if things had gone wrong they would certainly have had their share of the blame <e> <s> we on these benches regret the departure from office of those two able and patriotic ministers <e> <s> we were glad to hear the arrangements which the noble baroness lady young outlined to us for handling defence questions in this house <e> <s> we are naturally disappointed that neither of the two new defence ministers sits in this house and so they are deprived of the advantages of participating in our well-informed defence debates but we very much hope that the new arrangements will be as good as the old <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of the strongest supporters of nato in this country have become thoroughly dissatisfied with the handling of disarmament questions by the united states government <e> <s> will he draw the attention of the prime minister to the possibility that she might summon a meeting of the nato foreign ministers to review the geneva negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the government might combat unilateralism more effectively by taking a more positive attitude to negotiations than that represented by the scandalous proposal to spend million of taxpayers money on advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is aware that the propaganda put out by the labour government in the late sixties was of a vastly superior quality compared with anything put out by either the government or the conservative party <e> <s> will he consider republishing this excellent propaganda with the cost to the conservative party <e> <s> no one would object to that <e>", "<cs> my lords even if it is true that organised civil defence may be of limited value in an all-out nuclear war is it not clear that in other likelier circumstances such as conventional war accidents natural disasters or the dropping of a single demonstration nuclear weapon civil defence can save a vast amount of human suffering <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that people should wish to sabotage what is essentially a humanitarian service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not strange that ministers should continue insisting at some cost to the country on getting a formal renunciation of terrorism from the plo when as the noble lord shows they cannot specify if asked any act of terror committed by this organisation within the last three years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware of the significance of his reply which corresponds with other replies he has given to parliamentary questions recently in that the government are unable to name a single specific act of terror committed by the plo in the past three years <e> <s> is he further aware that acts of terror are constantly wrongly attributed to the plo and that an instance of this has been given in the house this afternoon <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble lord not to apply double standards in this matter and whether it is the view of the government that members of the plo have worse records of acts of terror than members of the israeli government <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support the motion so far as it goes but we feel it is too negative and altogether too bland <e> <s> of course we agree that natos deterrent has been needed in the past and is needed now that is its conventional deterrent and nuclear deterrent <e> <s> but in our view natos deterrent strategy is wholly unsatisfactory and needs to be radically reformed <e> <s> similarly we agree that unilateralism is mistaken and that it undermines the multilateral approach but we are far from satisfied with the energy of the government and the administration of the united states in pursuing multilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount explain a little his quite extraordinary statement that a non-first-use strategy would require nearly a doubling of natos conventional arms <e> <s> will he make clear that this is not an official or a considered calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord may i ask whether he recalls that last year the soviet and american delegates to the intermediate range talks agreed on a compromise proposal for deploying missiles on both sides <e> <s> was it not regrettable that the american and then the soviet governments rejected this <e> <s> can he say whether the british government supported this admirable proposal and if it is revived whether they will support it in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the government deserve congratulations on their robust handling of the affair of mr lankin <e> <s> will he confirm that no one with a terrorist record no matter what his nationality should ever be accepted as ambassador to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords our present constituency boundaries give a flagrantly unfair advantage to two classes of electors <e> <s> the first class is electors in small constituencies <e> <s> when there are electors in newcastle and electors in buckingham it means that the influence of the vote of a newcastle elector is worth more than four times the influence of the vote of a buckingham elector <e> <s> also our constituency boundaries which by international standards are absurdly confined and elect only one mp give a flagrantly unfair advantage to another class of electors namely those who support the conservative and the labour parties <e> <s> in electors were enough to elect a conservative mp electors were enough to elect a labour mp but it needed electors to elect a liberal mp <e> <s> thus the vote of a tory or a labour supporter was worth nearly times the influence of a supporter of the liberal party <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to be fair will the minister answer the question that i believe three speakers asked whether the votes of electors of different political convictions should be of equal importance <e>", "<cs> what about that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say whether the billion pounds is simply an estimate made by the british government or whether it is an estimate agreed between the two governments <e>", "<cs> my lords is this billion pounds simply an estimate by the united kingdom government or has it been agreed between the two governments <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lords attention been drawn to an interesting leading article in this mornings edition of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the view of the government that the international trade in arms should not be carried on with countries which persistently and brutally reject human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords is not a main feature of the commission that it has some independence from the corporation and the authority <e> <s> therefore is it not a perfectly proper organisation for members of the public to write to with complaints about balance and standards <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is a considerable difference of principle here between the rights of the british government and the british police and the rights of agents of foreign governments to photograph legal british peaceful demonstrations <e> <s> will he say plainly that he regards the second category as improper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that whereas this visit was indeed normal our relations with spain at present are unfortunately not normal <e> <s> will the noble lord give the assurance that in future these visits will or will not take place with proper reference to the state of our relations with spain <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins opened by saying that he would speak in a conciliatory and non-controversial manner on two very narrow issues the issue of the number of american bases in this country and the issue of dual safety-catches on missiles <e> <s> for several minutes the noble lord stuck to his good resolutions but as the speech developed more familiarly we had an attack in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house the assurance that it is the hope of the british government that the americans will in due course make a positive response to this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not remarkable that not one of the elected members of the supreme soviet has ever asked a question critical of the defence policy of any soviet government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that it has always been extremely difficult to balance the needs of security against civil liberties <e> <s> will he give the assurance that no significant changes will be made to the well known established procedures without parliamentary debate <e>", "<cs> my lords from the noble lords answer to the first question would we be right to assume that in fact the prime minister is expecting to discuss this subject with president reagan at the forthcoming summit <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make clear under what resolution of the united nations these troops are operating <e> <s> is he quite sure that the facts he has given us are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the good record of this country under successive governments in banning tests will the government consider taking steps to commence effective negotiations for a comprehensive ban on tests <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall take up the remarks of the noble baroness and the noble lord lord cledwyn on the subject of defence and particularly on the subject of the inf talks at geneva which it is generally agreed are extremely urgent and important and on which we on these benches have some strong criticisms to make of the position of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to explain that all those who support the zero option and i believe that i could include the noble lord among them automatically dispense with cruise and pershing <e> <s> this suggests very seriously that if one supports the zero option one cannot think that they have an indispensable decoupling role to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to the noble lord lord hatch for making his case tonight without repeating some of the wilder and more <e>", "<cs> my lords before leaving that particular point could the noble lord tell us what impact the falklands operation has had on recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i come rather fresh to this subject although i have from time to time drunk wine by the glass <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the introductory speech of the noble lord and came to the conclusion that there is not much here to cheer or safeguard the simple consumer of wine <e> <s> first of all there is no obligation whatever as far as i can see on any seller of wine to use a standard glass at all <e> <s> it is precisely those sellers of wine against whom complaints have been made in the past who will continue to sell short measures despite anything that the government are doing with the added advantage to themselves that the government will be giving a false sense of security to customers with all this rigmarole which we have just heard about <e> <s> listening to the noble lord anyone might think that the consumer was being safeguarded but there is nothing in what the noble lord said which safeguards the consumer against the dishonest retailer <e> <s> his words will as i say merely give a false sense of reassurance <e>", "<cs> we are already confused in this house my lords <e> <s> even noble lords do not know the difference between and ml glasses <e> <s> again listening very carefully to the noble lord another thing which struck me was that the group to which he referred the trade and the minister had taken their decision about metric plus imperial measures after and not before the consumer interests had been consulted <e> <s> i should like reassurance on this point <e> <s> the consumer interest to which he referred and which was consulted has approved the final complicated conclusion which was put forward by the interested group <e> <s> i have no doubt that the government have the best of intentions but i cannot say that anything in the noble lords speech convinced me that much is to be done for the consumer by this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lords answer the first part of the question <e> <s> do the government reject the widespread view that the election result was unfair to the alliance parties <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> perhaps i may press the minister on this question <e> <s> will he give a straight reply and say whether the government share the view which is very widely held in this country that the election result was unfair to the alliance party <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the position that the present electoral system is widely disliked as the public opinion polls show <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that it is widely disliked as the public opinion polls show except by the majority of sitting mps who owe their power to it and are determined to cling to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that even before the launching yesterday of the campaign for fair votes the opinion polls showed a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that he won widespread respect in all parties for introducing proportional representation in northern ireland <e> <s> does he recall that the system which he chose the single transferable vote perhaps for brevity we might call it the whitelaw system meant that if a party had fewer votes it had fewer seats <e> <s> why has the noble viscount now changed his mind and why is he supporting a system which as he saw at the election enables a party to get three-quarters of a million fewer votes and yet many more seats <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> may i ask first for some detail about the redundancies <e> <s> how many redundancies will there be <e> <s> how many of those made redundant will be taken on by the united kingdom government especially in the base at gibraltar and how many will be taken on by the new company <e> <s> may i ask what is to be the future position regarding local employment in the base <e> <s> and how does nato view the base <e> <s> have we had assurances of the value that nato places on the naval base <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments view that even at this late hour in order to reach agreement in the inf talks in geneva the united states should show flexibility in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness stated that the purpose of the mnf is to give general support to the lebanese government did that exclude military support <e>", "<cs> my lords the house may wish to resume the debate at this point and i should like to begin on behalf of my noble friends by thanking the noble viscount lord whitelaw for his clear and comprehensive survey of british defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friends would wish me to add our voice to that of the noble lord lord mishcon in expressing our extreme disappointment that the government have found it necessary to debate this important question at this extremely late hour <e> <s> it seems to us that once again the government are showing a faintheartedness a lack of determination in this field of civil defence <e> <s> however although i shall have some criticism to make of the governments position at least i could understand what the noble lord the minister of state for scotland was saying <e> <s> i understood the policy on civil defence of the government <e> <s> with the greatest respect when i listened to the noble lord lord mishcon i was completely at a loss to understand the policy of the opposition in this regard <e>", "<cs> for the liberals my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me my point was that lives could have been saved had there been an effective civil defence organisation at hiroshima <e> <s> of course that would not apply in the blast area but it would apply on the fringes <e> <s> i think that is self-evident <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me he is saying that people suffered because they went into the area afterwards <e> <s> one of the purposes of civil defence is to prevent that kind of thing to warn people and to monitor radiation <e> <s> for the noble lord to suggest that lives have not been lost because there was no civil defence seems to me to be quite irrational <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as he referred to me many times i wonder whether i could ask him this question <e> <s> he has made it quite clear as his colleague the noble lord lord mishcon made it clear that we have no choice either we must renounce nuclear weapons or we must build deep shelters <e> <s> that is quite plain from both speeches <e> <s> i ask him which alternative he would choose <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> is he aware that his statement quotes as a reason for deployment the failure of the soviet union to accept the zero option <e> <s> but was this not the original demand of the united states when the negotiations began two years ago <e> <s> is that not proof that any changing of the offer by the united states since has been purely cosmetic <e> <s> can the noble lord give any precedent in international negotiations for a country stating its requirements and its first negotiating position and negotiating or pretending to negotiate for two years then restating the original demand at the end of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kennet set out very clearly and persuasively the case for dual key <e> <s> as he said in the house of commons a few weeks ago this was the central feature of a comprehensive amendment covering the problem of cruise missiles which was put forward by the alliance and supported by all the alliance members of parliament though unfortunately not supported by the labour party <e> <s> however one of the dangers of discussing the dual key as intensively as we have in this debate is that we may lose sight of what is the bigger objective of us all to create the conditions in which the deployment of these missiles either the deployment of the first flight of missiles which have arrived or the deployment of the later flights which will arrive as the months go by is no longer necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seemed to complain that i was straying from the question of dual key control to more general questions on the cruise missile <e> <s> in the light of the noble lords admirable comments on grenada and the korean airline disaster i wonder whether he would like to offer some explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall the repeated statements of the government over the last two years that it was only when the missiles were being deployed that the soviet union would start negotiating seriously <e> <s> does he recall the very opposite predictions made by my noble friends and myself repeatedly in this house and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kennet has done a service by putting these important questions clearly to the government <e> <s> it is a convention of the house that in reply to an un starred question the government reply ends the debate <e> <s> normally this is satisfactory because one knows what the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he confirm that since the operational use of the raf regiment at the missile sites is subject to joint control there is no sense in which one can say that the raf regiment

and can he also say whether the army is making a bigger demand on the civilian medical services <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has detailed a number of acts of violence against libyan nationals for which the libyan government are responsible but he has not referred to the aid given by the libyan authorities to the ira in the past <e> <s> these are acts of violence in effect against nationals of this country <e> <s> in what sense is it possible for the government to tolerate aid given to the ira by foreign governments <e> <s> will he say something about this <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i do not believe that it has been denied by the libyan authorities that they have given arms and other assistance to the ira <e> <s> this is a most important aspect of the case and i should have expected him to refer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the vast majority of moslems and arabs regard gaddafi as a disgrace to islam and to the arab world and that there is a fair prospect in due course that he will be overthrown by his own people <e> <s> indeed the wildness and violence of his attacks on his enemies is significant from that point of view <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that policies of intervention designed to destabilise the regime perhaps led by the united states are unlikely to succeed and might well be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not clear matters up if the noble lord were to quote from some official united states statement which is more recent than conceding that in fact these weapons cannot be fired without the british prime ministers consent <e>", "<cs> my lords might not a great deal of government correspondence be recycled before being dispatched to recipients <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware of the warm respect in which he is held in all parts of the house for his personal role in introducing proportional representation in northern ireland <e> <s> why does he discriminate by giving justice to minorities in northern ireland and not in the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on these benches are grateful for his statement which corrects an earlier statement which he made to me in the house a short while ago <e> <s> is he aware that the understandings to which he refers have never been published and will he give an assurance that they will be published <e> <s> finally is he aware that on several occasions president reagan has declined to acknowledge that the british government have a veto of the firing of these weapons and that reasonable people are bound to conclude that he does not do this because he does not want to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that one of the lessons of lebanon was that the european countries should have acted together instead of being drawn in one by one and then leaving one by one <e> <s> first what action are the government taking to prevent this happening in the gulf <e> <s> secondly are the government proposing to raise this matter at tomorrows meeting of the foreign ministers of the western european union <e>", "<cs> my lords must we take it from the reply of the noble baroness that there is no understanding between the european members of nato about intervention or non-intervention in the gulf or related questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am truly pleased to follow the noble viscount <e> <s> lord trenchard because so many of your lordships who intend to speak have personal experience of this difficult and sometimes emotive subject but i think the noble viscount must have the most recent experience of all and that gave his remarks particular weight <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i feel sure that many of us on all sides of the house will agree with the point that the noble lord lord ashbourne has made about the need to match commitments to resources <e> <s> i would also strongly agree with the noble lord that the white paper is very much at fault in not dealing with this point at all <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we can leave this argument to the future but it will be interesting to see whether there turns out to be substance in what i am suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that a freeze on the deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems would be inconsistent with the removal of nuclear bases from this country <e> <s> would he also agree that there is now no check whatever on the arms race no talks on nuclear weapons and no progress on conventional weapons <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he will discuss with the nato allies the concept of a freeze on these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that these marines bands are the smartest and best that anyone could want <e> <s> will he say what is the cost of a marines band compared with for instance the cost of trident <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness please explain this a little further <e> <s> the foreign secretary checked back with the white house as to whether there were preconditions on the holding of the conference in september <e> <s> is the american position therefore now that they are not insisting on broadening the agenda for the conference but are willing to go to the conference on the basis of the agenda suggested by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the statements of both governments on this subject have shown a notable lack of candour <e> <s> would it not be better if the government plainly acknowledge that political and constitutional difficulties make it impossible for the president to acknowledge a veto on the firing of these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we were all glad to hear the tribute to the forces paid by the noble lord lord graham in which i warmly share <e> <s> i felt reassured because for understandable reasons a great deal of his intervention was of a very proper but negative and discouraging nature <e> <s> i was glad that at the end he was able to pay tribute to the quite extraordinary record of the armed services recently not only in the falklands and northern ireland we are accustomed to paying tribute there but also in the lebanon where the professional conduct of our forces was extremely good <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be so kind as to answer the particular question and assure us that there are already under the discipline acts entirely sufficient powers to handle the difficult problems he has been talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that i am speaking for a number of my noble friends in saying that if we had an adequate system of state finance as the noble lord lord houghton suggests we would be far less inclined to keep the house up tonight on an amendment about contracting in rather than contracting out <e> <s> as it is although i am diffident about intervening in a debate on industrial relations i have been rather provoked by the remarks of the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i meant the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> both are former colleagues of mine who i am afraid i have failed to identify <e> <s> the point about the speech of the noble lord lord mccarthy as far as i was concerned was that he stirred echoes <e> <s> he reminded me that four or five decades ago i was myself using the same arguments in favour of contracting out <e> <s> indeed i have to confess that in another place in i actually voted for contracting out <e> <s> this is what diplomats call an <e>", "<cs> my lords my contributions in this house on the subject of industrial relations are extremely few and very brief indeed <e> <s> what i am saying is very relevant to the amendment <e> <s> i am arguing that contracting in would reduce the political power of the unions and the labour party and i believe that to be right at this time <e> <s> i believe that great changes have taken place in the past years <e> <s> instead of greater political power for the unions being in the interests of most working-class families in this country it is against their interests today <e> <s> in those days and when i was campaigning with the unions in the countryside before the war a person could be sacked for joining a union <e> <s> now people can be sacked for not joining a union <e> <s> the whole thing has changed completely <e> <s> arguments that were relevant and important or years ago such as those used now by the noble lord lord mccarthy are no longer relevant useful and valid today <e> <s> therefore i very strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments plans in this field were very <e>", "<cs> my noble friends i know would want me to express our warm support for this amendment <e> <s> following the argument of my noble friend i ask the government what are they afraid of in allowing us an affirmative order <e> <s> this is not a paving bill <e> <s> they will not be defeated in the house of lords if an affirmative order comes before us <e> <s> they will not be defeated in the house of commons <e> <s> the truth is i am afraid that this whole bill is designed precisely to prevent us from exercising any parliamentary influence on the things that really matter in the privatisation of the rofs <e>", "<cs> may i ask a single specific question <e> <s> if these articles of association are on the same lines as <e>", "<cs> if i may briefly add some words of support to what has already been said in the house from various quarters and in support of my noble friend lord diamond i do not think that the debate could possibly have more conclusively challenged the remark of the noble earl lord onslow that these amendments are not important <e> <s> i would assure him that to the people in the services or with service experience these are profoundly important matters that we are discussing in this amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord just clear up one point <e> <s> he argued quite correctly that directors are not supposed to represent either the shareholders or the workforce but to take the general good of the company into consideration <e> <s> he then objected to my noble friends suggestion of two directors being elected by the workforce on the grounds that inevitably they would be considered as representing the employees <e> <s> why does the same argument not apply to directors elected by shareholders <e> <s> will they not widely be regarded as representing the shareholders <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may remind the noble lord that when i asked him whether the golden share controlled the sale of assets worth less than per cent <e> <s> of the company he said that i was mistaken and that the golden share did in fact control the disposal of such assets <e> <s> will he now acknowledge that it is perfectly possible for a foreigner or anybody else to buy without any control at all any assets provided that the amount is less than per cent <e> <s> of the assets of the company <e>", "<cs> if i heard the noble lord aright he said that the government would expect the board of the company concerned to lay on a share ownership scheme <e> <s> surely the government should require the board to lay on such a scheme <e> <s> that is the difference between us <e> <s> i would find it quite intolerable if when the government dispose of the securities no scheme is drawn up <e> <s> if the governments intention is that a scheme of this kind should be devised they should require the board to which they are disposing of the securities to make sure that that happens <e> <s> i find the noble lords answer very disappointing <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we on these benches certainly do not wish to oppose the amendment but it gives the minister an opportunity to clear up the uncertainty which has arisen as a result of the decisions of the committee today <e> <s> in the light of those decisions what is the intention of the government with regard to a timetable for vesting and for the introduction of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this week the government will be formally condemned by the president of the european assembly for having used an electoral system of advantage to themselves which has seriously distorted the political balance of the assembly <e> <s> is he aware that of the parties in the assembly only one the british conservative party is greatly overrepresented and that this is directly due to the actions of a conservative government <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that he does not know which system the alliance supports will he consult his noble friend the noble viscount because of course we support the system introduced in northern ireland by the noble viscount himself <e> <s> we oppose the israeli system and we oppose list systems <e> <s> we have made our position completely clear and we have the noble viscount on our side in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there will be widespread agreement that the system used in northern ireland was practical fair and democratic <e> <s> can the noble lord explain what drawbacks the government saw in extending that system to the rest of the united kingdom apart from the fact that it would have robbed the conservative party of its surplus seats <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of great importance to the affected minority <e> <s> there has been a tradition among british governments of different parties of paying some respect to the electoral rights of minorities <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the system in northern ireland did so pay respect to the rights of minorities whereas the system in britain meant that more than half the parties represented in the european assembly scored fewer votes than the alliance which is not represented at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl explain a little more clearly the governments objections to the proposal for a secret ballot put forward by my noble friend <e> <s> it is well known that the principle of one man one vote is anathema to the labour party but could the noble earl explain why such a ballot should be regarded as a vote for or against the government and why then the government lose <e>", "<cs> my lords there appears to be a typical conflict here between the convenience of the government and the rights of parliament <e> <s> on this issue my noble friends and i know well where we stand <e> <s> it was a little reassuring to hear in his reply to an earlier amendment the minister stating that before any privatisation will take place parliament will be informed <e> <s> it is the natural and proper course of events to give parliament the opportunity of expressing its view on privatisation <e> <s> the government have to admit that resolute as they have been in resisting amendments throughout the passage of this bill they have on one or two occasions taken parliaments advice notably in relation to the ministry of defence police <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord would reassure the house on one or two points which arose out of his statement <e> <s> it is quite plain from his statement that a whole mass of work and agreement needs to be done which has not been done <e> <s> he said that it is just on the verge of being agreed but i recall that he said that at committee stage <e> <s> i am not sure that he did not say it at second reading <e> <s> may we please have from the minister a clear statement as to what now has been first of all agreed with the trade unions pensions redundancies and other matters and second what is the state of play with regard to the memorandum of understanding <e> <s> is that finally drafted <e> <s> can he please tell us in relation to each of these important matters where the government have got <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of the bill the government have made some concessions to the pressure of the opposition my noble friends and my honourable friends in another place and have come some way to meet us on this security issue <e> <s> it is a little difficult now to define exactly the difference between the position of the government and the position which some of us on this side of the house should like to see adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i should like to begin by associating myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i think that her majestys government and the chinese government are entitled to considerable credit for the successful negotiation of this agreement <e> <s> in its style and content the agreement shows admirable sensitiveness to the fears and hopes of the people of hong kong and also to the very different ideological standpoints of china and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to associate my noble friend and myself with the tribute paid to the noble lord lord boothby <e> <s> some of us recall the many expressions of opinion by the noble lord in another place often controversial but always eloquently expressed and in a surprisingly large proportion of cases fully justified by subsequent events <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware and there will be widespread agreement with this point that it is too early to assess the level of the share price <e> <s> the price of shares may well go down but equally it may well go up still further <e> <s> is it not plain <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the experience of the bt flotation may i ask whether it would have been right to have made this scheme which includes the basis of valuation of the assets subject to approval by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that the government still support the principle of the venice declaration in particular the recognition of israel by the arabs and on the other hand self-determination for the palestinians on the west bank and the participation of the plo in peace negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins for the extremely stimulating and original debate that he has introduced <e> <s> as i understand it we are faced with the fearful prospect of becoming annihilated before our children have left school unless we take one of three courses <e> <s> the first is to become a member of the united states as the nd state <e> <s> the second is for the united states to join the commonwealth <e> <s> the third i forget temporarily but it will come to me in the course of my speech <e> <s> what i wish to draw the attention of the house to is that the noble lord overlooked the obvious solution to our problems which is to become one of the federated states of the ussr <e> <s> from here we could surely influence the kremlin a great deal more effectively than speaking in this noble chamber for all the influence that we have as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a strange kind of nato speech <e> <s> i have heard a lot of nato speeches in a long career in this field <e> <s> i have to say with great regret to the noble lord that the content and tone of his language was not that of any ally of the united states <e> <s> one could listen carefully without detecting any sense of obligation loyalty or affection for the major participant in the nato alliance the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misquoted the noble lord especially after i went to the trouble of consulting him about his words <e> <s> but let us take it then that we agree that the two systems are irreconcilable <e> <s> of course that is a different matter <e> <s> i would though very strongly urge on the house that to say that we cannot co-exist with the soviet union is a dangerous and unconstructive point of view <e> <s> it is in fact classical marxism <e> <s> it is marxism itself which says that the world is divided into two opposite social systems and that these social systems are inevitably destined to conflict and one will supersede the other <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will give way i must reply that when i belonged to the labour party it was a loyal supporter of the nato alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords since the minister in quoting president reagan agreed that there can be no complete verification but only adequate verification is the position of the government that there may be some agreements which are acceptable even though they in fact involve an element of trust <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the attitude of a number of local authorities to civil defence is deplorable <e> <s> would he not also agree that the government have been at fault in presenting their civil defence proposals in terms of a nuclear holocaust where civil defence would admittedly be of limited value instead of in terms of natural disasters a nuclear accident or the dropping of a single nuclear bomb which are more probable or at least less improbable and where civil defence could have a very important role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that my noble friends and i will have a more jaundiced view of his statement than the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> would he say first whether these regrettable delays mean that the government can only maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the first question that i asked and reassure the house that these delays will not mean any threat to the governments pledged fleet of destroyers and frigates <e> <s> will he agree that this will not be maintained simply by keeping on ships that otherwise should retire from service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this interesting debate <e> <s> i thank the minister for setting out the position of the government in his usual careful and accurate manner treading his usual narrow path between the platitude on the one hand and the indiscretion on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say why these european governments are not meeting to consider the important implications for europe of the american strategic wars initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the existing united nations force bearing in mind all the restrictions and difficulties has succeeded in limiting the killing and disorder in southern lebanon <e> <s> would he also agree that while the strengthening of the united nations force is urgently needed it is important that its role should be extended to the southernmost part of lebanon <e> <s> otherwise it will remain as a kind of buffer betweeen the lebanese army in the north and the israeli-sponsored south lebanon army in the south and that would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that my noble friends and i do not share the casual attitude to law-breaking of the labour party nor their prejudice against the police and the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords neverthless will the minister give this assurance to the house that there will be no restrictions whatever on peaceful lawful demonstrations at molesworth by whoever wishes to conduct them <e> <s> will he make it perfectly clear that there will be no harassing <e> <s> may i ask the minister this <e> <s> if the government were going to take this action would it not have been wiser to take it earlier before these protesters had dug themselves in as they did <e> <s> i should be grateful for clear answers to those two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord renton and also to the noble lord lord mishcon for introducing this debate and for doing so in such a thoughtful and unideological manner <e> <s> over past years in this country the subject of civil defence has attracted a wholly inappropriate amount of political controversy to itself <e> <s> at the beginning the blame was on the government <e> <s> civil defence as the noble lord lord renton showed us is basically a humanitarian concept aimed at reducing suffering over a wide range of possible catastrophes <e> <s> but when the government made their start after coming to office and decided rightly to increase civil defence capacity they made the mistake of linking civil defence with their defence policy even arguing that civil defence would increase the credibility of the independent nuclear deterrent and stressing that civil defence could make a contribution to saving life even in a nuclear holocaust <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say how far this is a genuine reduction in defence manpower <e> <s> has he any figures for the number of people now classified as civilians who are in fact doing the same work as they did when employed by the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall statements in this house and elsewhere that trident would not take more than per cent <e> <s> of the defence budget over a procurement period of years <e> <s> how does this square with the recent statement that it would take per cent <e> <s> of the defence budget over a procurement period of years <e> <s> is he not aware that this is for practical purposes an increase in the percentage of the defence budget taken by trident <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there will be a warm welcome for his assurance that in the view of the government the development of the sdi will be a matter for negotiation not only under the anti-ballistic missile treaty as the statement said but also in the current soviet-american arms negotiations <e> <s> can he say whether the prime minister gathered that that is also the view of the united states <e> <s> is there not a serious danger of some division here between the views of this government and other european governments on the one hand and the views of the united states government on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might just ask a supplementary question on that <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> i think that everyone agrees that the launching of the sdi led to the soviet union resuming negotiations on a wide field of nuclear disarmament <e> <s> i believe that it is also the view of the government and certainly of european governments that this should be a matter for serious bargaining in the soviet-american negotiations <e> <s> can the noble viscount assure the house that that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to tell us the value of the bids that have so far been accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be right to say from the figures that the noble lord has given that the value of the bids so far accepted is less than per cent <e> <s> of what is to be the total expenditure in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that whereas everyone will regret the failure of repeated peace initiatives the present deadlock is at least a considerable improvement on what went before <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it is the governments intention to assign the trident fleet to nato as is done with the polaris fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords should not some part of the cost of the strike be borne by the political parties which supported it <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the fact that the russians have deployed new intermediate-range missiles since the breakdown of the talks can the minister say how the balance today compares with the balance when those talks broke down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the proceedings of this committee of which i too was a member would not have been reported to moscow by mr philby <e> <s> this task would have been entrusted to mr <e> <s> guy burgess whose work was very closely associated <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the likelihood of chemical attack is somewhat greater than the likelihood of nuclear attack <e> <s> are the government not giving too much priority to defence against nuclear attack as compared with defence against chemical attack <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is widespread support in this country for the statement of the foreign secretary on the strategic defence initiative and would it not be quite inconsistent to take decisions about participating in the initiative before some of the very pertinent questions raised by the foreign secretary are answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there was some truth in what the noble lord lord reay said that the european governments reacted spasmodically and uncertainly to the presidents initiative <e> <s> he will agree with me that the initiative is of the greatest importance to europe and is also very controversial <e> <s> would he not go further and agree with me that it really was extraordinary for the president to launch this initiative without any consultation at all with his european allies <e> <s> it really was extraordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i seriously doubt whether one would hear nonsense of that kind from a white russian taxi driver in paris <e> <s> i think that would be an insulting suggestion <e> <s> a white russian taxi driver unlike miss decter mrs kirkpatrick mr perle and others attending this strange conference would at least be able to see the soviet union and the soviet challenge against some historical background <e> <s> he would be aware that although the international conduct of the soviet union under mr gorbachev is bad enough it is a good deal better than it was under stalin and that was a good deal better than it was under lenin <e> <s> it is quite comforting and interesting to understand these matters because they encourage us to believe that if the nato countries keep calm and firm and reject the hysteria of the so-called committee for the free world we may be able to master the soviet challenge without war <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble and learned lords explanation may i ask whether in amendment no <e> <s> in place of the word section should be the word schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this iron-fist policy involves indiscriminate shooting at civilians and sometimes the killing of women and children <e> <s> is she aware that the governments excuses for not condemning this at the security council were wholly unconvincing and brought no credit on themselves or the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that there would be a wide welcome for effective measures to secure economies in the royal dockyards <e> <s> we shall be looking very carefully at the ministers proposals from that point of view and asking questions about overtime demarcation between trades security and a number of other matters of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord seen the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last two hours we have heard from the benches opposite a series of profoundly depressing and doomladen speeches <e> <s> i am not challenging the facts put forward by for instance the noble lord lord on-ewing and yet i think we have had an unduly depressing impression <e> <s> i do not recall any reference in any of these speeches to the successes of the democracies over the last years in meeting this challenge of soviet subversion <e>", "<cs> my lords i attended carefully to the noble lords speech and of course i agree <e> <s> i shall come later to the miners strike <e> <s> but if i may say so the noble lord was very undiscriminating <e> <s> did he not suggest that the red front in italy and baader meinhof in germany were soviet led <e> <s> i shall come to this point later but in the meantime i want to say this <e> <s> i believe the danger of putting all this emphasis on soviet led subversion is that it distracts attention from those subversive activities which are more dangerous and do not owe their origins to the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of special reasons for being grateful to the noble lord lord reay for introducing this subject <e> <s> first of all i agree with the noble earl lord fortescue that this subject is far too little debated <e> <s> it is extraordinary to contrast the amount of discussion and debate that there has been on nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament compared with the equally apocalyptic concept of chemical warfare and the need for disarmament <e> <s> we should also be grateful because there are a number of points of straight information which the government can give us and which we need <e> <s> there are a number of grey areas in this sphere which need clearing up <e> <s> i look forward to some specific answers to specific questions from the noble lord when he winds up <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i am asking the government to explain it <e> <s> i believe there was one estimate of tonnes and another of tonnes and a median figure was taken <e> <s> would the government assure us that this is not the kind of basis upon which they have reached the figure of tonnes <e> <s> we were told about the use of poison gas by the russians in afghanistan and by the vietnamese government in south-east asia <e> <s> this had a considerable impact on public opinion <e> <s> i was myself influenced by that <e> <s> but i now think that was untrue <e> <s> those statements were put forward by the president himself and were untrue <e> <s> i ask the government again what is the view of the government <e> <s> do the vietnamese government use chemical weapons <e> <s> are the russians using them in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords let us hope that the minister will show us the basis on which the estimate is made not the source but the basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept entirely what the noble lord says and i am grateful to him <e> <s> is this a british intelligence assessment or an american one <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say what the answer was <e>", "<cs> my lords do we understand from the first answer of the noble baroness that the european governments are continuing to try to reach a collective view on the strategic defence initiative and that when they do so it will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords the strategic defence initiative has found very few friends indeed in the course of this debate <e> <s> indeed after listening carefully i can recall only one substantial argument against the very powerful and well-informed case put by my noble friend who introduced the debate <e> <s> this is a point which the noble lord lord home raised in an intervention which was followed up by the noble earl lord bessborough namely that the russians are going ahead with their research and the west cannot be left behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak for the noble lord lord zuckerman and so i shall simply say this <e> <s> whoever is right even if it is right that the soviet union are ahead it is all the greater reason for reaching an agreement with the soviet union to stop the development and testing of these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has corrected me quite properly <e> <s> president reagan cannot have a third term <e> <s> some will be disappointed at this and some will be perhaps reassured <e> <s> he cannot have a third term and therefore i should have said the united states president <e> <s> no united states president in these circumstances will turn and change his mind and abandon the project if the research has succeeded <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to create a precedent in keeping to my time in this debate a very valuable precedent which has not been observed by every previous speaker <e> <s> therefore i do not propose to give way again <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i agree with every word spoken by the noble lord lord chelwood when he introduced this debate <e> <s> i would particularly urge the noble baroness the minister when she replies to give specific answers to the very specific questions that the noble lord put to her suggesting a weakening of the british government on a number of important issues <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down can she explain the qualification she attached when giving the assurance that the government still support self-determination for the palestinians <e> <s> i believe she said that that meant the palestinians had the right to choose whatever constitutional arrangements were available whereas i would have expected her to say that they

appreciate her original answer may i ask the noble baroness whether she agrees that there is a sad contrast between the positive part played by britain in the middle east at the time of the venice

"<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in regard to gun running and other ira activities in the united states members of the fbi have been showing great courage and skill <e>", "<cs> i think

a reference to two years in the sense that it is something that one might try without necessarily prejudicing for instance the fourth option that the noble and learned lord lord denning has so

amendments which we are now discussing have i think a slightly hypothetical and academic feel about them <e> <s> if the noble lord lord graham is of the same mind my feeling would be that we might come back to this on report <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has assumed as did the noble lord lord barnett that the government were going to proceed in the manner in which they have so far intended to proceed namely by offering contracts to a commercial manager to manage the dockyards <e> <s> i am not sure that i was wholly with the noble lord lord barnett when he said that the complaints which he very justly advanced in respect of the arrangements for public supervision of a management company would not need to be different for in the case of a

european members of nato to what amounts to the abandonment of the treaty by the united states and whether these countries should not have met together to concert a common view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opened by saying that he was surprised that the noble lord lord graham and i should have put down this amendment again in view of the assurances that he gave at report stage <e> <s> but i think i speak for the noble lord lord graham when i say that it was precisely because he gave no assurances in the statement on report that we have put down this amendment again <e>", "<cs> my lords this was very fully discussed at the report stage and there was very widespread support for dropping this clause altogether <e> <s> i see no reason to add to the arguments made then and i warmly support the statement of the noble lord lord graham <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recall her reply to a recent parliamentary question that if negotiations were to be resumed questions

monopoly of nuclear weapons it might not use them <e> <s> certainly if it was winning a conventional war it probably would not use them <e> <s> but let us suppose it was losing the conventional war

that i was responsible for building the strategic deterrent when i was naval minister and i was a member of this commission <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would clear up one point <e> <s> we are much obliged to him for making clear the labour view that britain should dispense with nuclear weapons even though the russians retain them <e> <s> but is it also the labour view that nato should dispense with nato weapons even though the russians retain them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just make my question plain <e> <s> the noble lord has plainly misunderstood my question <e> <s> my question is is it labours view that nato should dispense with nuclear weapons while the russians retain theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness yet studied the statement in moscow yesterday that the russians propose to end their moratorium on testing at the end of the year <e> <s> in view of the decisive improvements in verification techniques that have been discovered recently will the government suspend their ban on negotiations and make a final effort to reach agreement in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the question of verification do the government need to make further tests of the trident warheads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand by that that if the russians and the americans agree to halve their strategic conventional forces we shall not increase our forces by per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that when he says that trident is only an escalation of two-and-a-half times he is in fact equating the polaris warhead which is not independently targetable with the trident warhead which is <e> <s> even on that very questionable basis can we assume that if the russians and the americans halve their strategic nuclear forces we shall not increase ours by more than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords a third question if i can remember it <e> <s> when the noble lord concedes as he has that the government are not going to develop trident to its full capacity does this not vindicate those critics who complained that the original trident programme was much too expensive and much too big for britains needs <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that it was precisely when the plo shared the premises of the arab league in london that its director sahid hamani was assassinated by the abu nidal group <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the reason for these assassinations is that the plo representatives support the idea of a negotiated settlement in palestine <e> <s> therefore should we not do what we can to help these people in the courageous job that they are trying to do in order to achieve a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is arguing that the majority of electors get the people and the policies that they vote for but he must surely know that the majority of electors get the people and the policies that they have not voted for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tribute to the number and variety of misdemeanours of the delinquent councils that after five and a half hours of debate in which a mass of information has been produced about the misbehaviour of these councils the noble lord lord charteris can still come forward with new evidence which commanded the alert attention of the house and which dare i predict it <e> <s> will command the attention of the tabloid newspapers tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that very clear and interesting answer <e> <s> i think that the fact that the official spokesman for the labour party in the

the opposition the electors of these delinquent boroughs are being urged to vote against the delinquent councils <e>", "<cs> well they are being urged to vote for the delinquent councils <e>", "<cs> lady davids eloquent appeal to the electors is to vote either for or against the delinquent councils <e> <s> this is the only practical course that i have heard from the opposition benches in this debate <e> <s> it is a fact that there is only one electoral system in the world which could confer so much power on such unrepresentative people <e> <s> no other election system in the world can do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i too for perhaps years of my life inside the labour movement have been fighting this <e> <s> this is not something new <e> <s> the year was the first

will the noble lord give an assurance that if the soviet threat and the danger of war in europe recede in the years ahead the policy of a fivefold escalation of nuclear weapons will be modified by the

trident fleet will carry not more than two and a half times the number of warheads carried by polaris the level of nuclear escalation is two and a half times <e> <s> that ignores the greater size of the trident warhead its greater accuracy its greater range and its ability to be independently targeted <e> <s> will the minister look into this matter more carefully including ministerial statements

this is a drafting error for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this interesting debate <e> <s> on these benches we have listened with the greatest care to the arguments used on both sides about the alliances policy towards the deterrent and particularly to the noble baroness the minister <e> <s> i think we can say that the nature of the arguments used and not used has been a source of great encouragement to those who sit on these benches <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question

deterrent <e> <s> is it simply the ability to inflict unacceptable damage or is it also related to the increasing size of the soviet nuclear stockpile <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that there is a dividing line between conveying information and conducting political propaganda <e> <s> is she aware for example that in the recent government open document called <e>", "<cs> my lords while adding a tribute to the skill frankness and stamina of the prime minister on this visit perhaps i may ask the noble viscount to clarify one point <e> <s> in her remarkable television interview the prime minister appeared to suggest that the british deterrent is not in any circumstances negotiable <e> <s> is this now the governments position <e> <s> if not in what circumstances would the government be willing that our deterrent should go into the disarmament negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords does fylingdales have a strategic defence capability <e> <s> if not could it be given one <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for putting this subject on our agenda and no one is more grateful than my noble friends and i for this unexpected and welcome opportunity of reaffirming the message of the liberal and social democratic alliance a message which is increasingly understood and accepted by the electors namely that the two major obstacles to unity in this country are the two class-based political parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble viscount for introducing this motion and for the extremely informative way in which he did so <e> <s> my noble friends would i feel support all the recommendations that he put forward for the attention of the government <e>", "<cs> what <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my old friend <e> <s> however he surely is not suggesting that i am racially prejudiced against the jews <e> <s> that is a very serious accusation and he has no evidence <e> <s> i am willing to prove the contrary <e> <s> if i may remind him there is a grove of trees planted in my honour in israel <e> <s> it is called the christopher mayhew grove <e> <s> perhaps he can answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the statement vindicating the conduct of officers of the security services tends to support rather than quash the numerous allegations that have been made against named people that they are security risks <e> <s> i think that it tends to increase fears about the vulnerability of no <e> <s> to the intelligence services of foreign governments during this period <e> <s> i am not now speaking about a conspiracy against the prime minister but is there not a need to clear up these apprehensions and to draw lessons from them to make sure that such a thing does not happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to point out that the new electoral system which the russians favour is the one favoured by the british conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble viscount for introducing this important subject this evening <e> <s> i suppose that we all in principle accept the case he makes that we need an effective civil protection organisation in this country <e> <s> yet i was a little surprised at the manner in which the noble viscount set out to persuade the recalcitrant local authorities of the error of their ways <e> <s> he argued that in a nuclear war there will always be a fringe area <e> <s> there will always be people on the margin who can and must be helped <e> <s> there is logic in that argument <e> <s> yet of course it is also possible to imagine a nuclear exchange so great that really it made civil protection and civil defence useless <e> <s> this was a mistake the government made many years ago <e> <s> it recommended its civil defence proposals to the country in terms of protection of the population in the case of nuclear war <e> <s> that was a mistake <e> <s> it appeared so much as though the government had thought that a nuclear war was winnable and that it could be coped with <e> <s> it even appeared as though the government were putting forward their civil defence proposals as a kind of excuse and defence for their obsession with nuclear weapons which is a feature of their defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that defence planning necessarily involves making some provision for spare capacity in the defence industries <e> <s> is he satisfied that the redundancies now being made in the newly-privatised industries are not just commercially profitable as they no doubt are but are in the national interest <e> <s> surely it is the governments duty to bear that in mind and not just to remove themselves from this problem altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give an assurance that no plutonium or enriched uranium of british manufacture is missing <e>", "<cs> my lords while the ministers reply to my question was reassuring can he say how much of such material of british manufacture is missing in total <e>", "<cs> my lords on east-west relations the two noble lords who have spoken seem to me to have trodden a judicious path between the extremes of wishful thinking on the one hand and undue scepticism on the other <e> <s> no one supposes that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course a difference between us in that i am referring to independently targeted warheads <e> <s> that is the thing that matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rennet has introduced a subject which deserves an earlier hour and a fuller house and he has put forward a clear and interesting inconsistency in the attitude of the government on sdl when the russians improve their anti-ballistic missile defences the government use this as an argument to increase the strategic capacity of the british deterrent first by chevaline and now by trident and that is logical <e> <s> when the americans propose to construct an anti-ballistic missile system the government reject the right of the russians to raise their capacity for offensive weapons to match <e> <s> this is a clear inconsistency and i am bound to say that i see the logic of the soviet position <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there was great merit in the proposal of mr gorbachev to extend the reduction zone to the area between the urals and the atlantic <e> <s> can he say what is the difference between that and the definition of the zone he gave in answer to the question of the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would not be appropriate for mr shamir to visit this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i was following the noble lord lord kennet with considerable sympathy until he reached the proposition that nato should undertake the verification of the inf <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the noble lords first reply that the question of stationing fs in this country has been informally discussed with the americans <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree however that in the gulf as in lebanon the americans take unilateral action and european governments are dragged in one by one without any apparent co-ordination of policy <e> <s> would he say whether the government are satisfied with this <e> <s> have they raised questions of policy co-ordination early on and did they do so in the western european union <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in the ilea election the labour party won less than half the votes but more than three-quarters of the seats <e> <s> perhaps some of the problems of ilea like some of the problems of local labour authorities are created by its unrepresentative nature which is due to the addiction of the conservative party to a preposterously undemocratic electoral system <e> <s> will the minister assure us that her party will learn from experience and that the idea of representative democracy will carry some weight in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly feel that in calling for a new harmel-type report the noble lord lord kennet is on the right track <e> <s> whether such a review would have the priorities that he gave i am not so sure <e> <s> i can think of things still more important than the economic problems to which he referred with which this report would deal <e> <s> nor am i convinced yet that his views that the inf treaty should be verified by nato and not just by the super powers is really practicable <e> <s> in principle we have to agree with him that the interests of europe are bound up with verification of the treaty <e> <s> but when we think of the problems of getting the inf treaty ratified and executed i think it is asking a lot to inject at this stage the idea of verification in the soviet union by nato and verification of american weapons by the warsaw pact <e> <s> that might complicate matters a great deal <e> <s> however the noble lords concept of a new review is certainly right because existing nato strategy is in a considerable mess <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we shall all agree that such statistics are very difficult to handle <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will say whether the million manpower figure for the warsaw pact includes the rumanians and if so which side the rumanians are on <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer the second part of my question as to whether he considers the rumanian forces loyal to the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords do the options which the government are considering include updating the battle tank which vickers are now making for the indian government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that in very difficult circumstances unrwa is doing a first class job and fully deserves the support of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to intervene <e> <s> my point was that that is a requirement unilaterally imposed on the plo <e> <s> if israel and the plo agree to recognise each other and jointly rejected violence and terrorism that would be splendid <e> <s> why do the government put those conditions only on the plo and not on the israeli government <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble baroness in this debate i have the pleasure and honour of congratulating her most warmly on her maiden speech <e> <s> it may be that in the history of this house there have been less controversial maiden speeches but i doubt whether there has been a speech which has been listened to with greater respect and attention <e> <s> when i say that we hope to hear her again i do so with a special meaning <e> <s> i imagine that the subject that she raised so interestingly of the balance between preserving confidentiality and access to information will be discussed further and that in june when the government issue a white paper and soon afterwards perhaps when there is a bill we shall have endless debates in committee and at second reading we look forward to the contribution which we are certain to hear from the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords if the reason was not dissatisfaction with the fao what is the reason for changing what was previously a perfectly civilised means of payment <e> <s> are we here in line with the ec governments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is quite relevant to the question that in spite of the welcome increase in the amount of competitive tendering the most outrageous overcharging still goes on in many parts of defence procurement <e> <s> can he say whether there has been an increase in the proportion of contracts awarded to the smaller firms <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers statement was understandably low key <e> <s> the content is extremely encouraging <e> <s> a remarkable advance in east-west relations is reflected in what he said <e> <s> my noble friends and i are worried about the possibility of circumventing the inf treaty under the guise of modernisation <e> <s> we have made that point before <e> <s> but we find the order in council a very cheering matter particularly for elderly people who remember the state of east-west relations many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the speech of the noble viscount who introduced the question <e> <s> i can happily associate my noble friend and myself with every point that he made <e> <s> we are grateful to him for raising this important issue at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that if we are ever to have peace in the region <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask what was the governments reaction at the meeting of european foreign ministers to the italians proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that although it may not be the governments intention to circumvent the inf treaty that is the practical effect of the decisions about weapons that they are taking <e> <s> there is for example the effect of taking cruise missiles from the ground at greenham and putting them on planes <e> <s> the effect is the same <e> <s> moreover not only the west but also the soviet union are taking this action <e> <s> one has a treaty such as the inf treaty but would it not be better to have treaties which provide against the substitution of other weapons <e> <s> why was that not done more effectively and is it too late to try to get agreement on something on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords on the subject of the kuwaiti hijack will the minister admit the very grave difficulties for the algerian government in rescuing the passengers and at the same time bringing the hijackers to justice <e> <s> will he say how many governments supported the prime ministers demand for the imposition of sanctions against the algerian government for not succeeding in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> does he not agree that it is quite unacceptable that israel should enjoy full access to ec markets while preventing producers in the west bank and gaza from having the same access <e> <s> will the government strongly support the efforts of commissioner cheysson to end this thoroughly unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords in november last in this house during his masterly survey of the privatisation proposals of the government my noble friend lord ezra made a prediction <e> <s> he foretold that when the governments proposals for the electricity supply industry were published in practice they would not provide effectively for competition <e> <s> had my noble friend not been unavoidably absent today an absence which is keenly regretted he might claim to have been a true prophet <e> <s> i and my noble friend support most warmly the principles of breaking up monopolies increasing competition and redressing the balance of power in favour of consumers but we are not convinced that those principles will be put into effect by the proposals put forward by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards joining the ems does the noble lord agree with the right honourable sir geoffrey howe when he stated that the government cannot carry on indefinitely giving the reply which the noble lord has just given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friends would wish me to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for initiating this timely debate and to associate those on these benches with his call for an international conference <e> <s> we entirely agree with him in the respect we feel for the patience and persistence of mr shultz in his four visits to the middle east <e> <s> on the other hand we would not share the hopes about the shultz initiative just expressed by the noble lord lord thomas <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that apart from any question of the presidential elections prospects for sdi have become uncertain <e> <s> what arrangements have been made to cover british firms with sdi contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord remind the house briefly of the reasons why the government are not more enthusiastic about european monetary union <e>", "<cs> my lords a large number of the points made by the noble lord lord irving will be welcomed by my noble friends and myself <e> <s> the inadequate provision for the royal navy and the total impossibility of fitting all the governments proposals into the defence budget is something to which every independent expert bears witness <e> <s> his references are less sceptical and therefore more realistic about the changes in the soviet union <e> <s> scepticism is not necessarily realism <e> <s> sometimes it is realistic to take a positive view of the kind of changes which are occurring in the soviet union today <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes we pass orders without any discussion <e> <s> sometimes as the noble lord lord irving has just done we raise a wide range of matters affecting the armed forces <e> <s> i have decided to ask questions on the subject of setbacks in the polaris production programme <e> <s> i do so because of the unwillingness of the government to answer questions about the matter candidly <e>", "<cs> my lords are the prospects for conventional disarmament more promising than usual <e> <s> does the minister agree that the threat of financial penalties as suggested in the question may do more harm than good <e>", "<cs> i speak as a very old member and supporter of the electoral reform society <e> <s> is the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister will bear in mind that it might easily be that the electoral reform society has not fully understood the significance of what it has taken on <e> <s> perhaps if it were shown the debate we have had this afternoon in the committee it might wish to reflect on its position <e> <s> all of us who have had to fight parliamentary or local government elections may have the advantage of the minister here <e> <s> we know that a big poll always helps one side or the other <e> <s> we also know that there are certain sections of the constituency where one wants a big poll and certain other areas of the constituency where one wants a small poll <e> <s> i think this is a commonplace to all old hat politicians of whom if i may say so there are many at least on this side of the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords as might have been predicted the debate has been largely dominated by discussion of the changes in the soviet union and the impact on east-west relations <e> <s> noble lords will have noticed a considerable spread among speakers between hope and scepticism <e> <s> the noble lord lord reay who has just spoken will not i am sure object to being classed on the sceptical side of the balance but undoubtedly the most sceptical of all the speakers was the noble lord lord beloff who in an extremely well-informed speech if i may say so argued not only that the changes were not fundamental but that fundamental change was not possible and that power would revert inevitably to the soviet communist party <e> <s> i hope i do not do him an injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that the government welcome the pnc decision and think that arafat should have been able to address the general assembly <e> <s> can it therefore have been right for this country to take a lone stand and isolate itself from the european community and from some other governments on the difference in the communique between the words regretting and deploring <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the ministers reply <e> <s> i did not specifically ask that the secretary of state should meet mr arafat but that he should meet appropriate representatives of the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he will answer the question of my noble friend lord tordoff as to why as he mentioned in his introductory remarks other european countries have been waiting for us to act <e> <s> why are we last <e>", "<cs> my lords may we be sure that ministers who meet mr shamir will impress upon him that there is no chance of peace unless both sides renounce terrorism <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that last year as prime minister mr shamir was responsible for the assassination in tunis of mr arafats deputy and of two other plo leaders in cyprus and also for the killing or wounding of thousands of people in occupied palestine including hundreds of children <e>", "<cs> my lords most of this debate focused understandably on the conduct of british policy in relation to europe until the noble lord <e> <s> lord beloff introduced a very relevant alternative topic namely that of british policy in the middle east <e> <s> i should like to follow him in making one or two comments on that and in particular on that part of the palestine problem which relates to the question we are discussing the relationship between the prime minister and the foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i have misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> i understand his position <e> <s> i still feel that a more constructive and practical approach by the british would be to say to the israelis we are working with our community colleagues and inside the united nations to ensure that after the withdrawal there will be security guarantees on the ground in the form of an international peace-keeping force with teeth to which britain could and should contribute <e> <s> in addition there should be a treaty which would neutralise and demilitarise the area to give so to speak an austrian-type status of neutrality to the new state of palestine <e> <s> those are more constructive ways of dealing with the situation than offering to deliver arms but of course it is a difference which is not so very wide <e>", "<cs> and the excellent and well-informed support of mr gerald kaufman <e> <s> therefore they deserve the support of the prime minister too <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether mr waldegrave was intending to go to israel to forward an international conference <e> <s> is that visit still on <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the comments of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham i must ask the minister whether he does not agree that the european community is widely admired in the moslem field not least by a number of moslem governments <e> <s> they bitterly resent the pretensions of the ayatollah khomeini <e> <s> has the community any plans to discuss with such governments what might be the best way forward perhaps towards the kind of action suggested by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords happily we have had very little shakespearian discord in this debate though i must say that i doubt whether all noble and learned lords would agree with the strictures of the noble lord lord annan on the detachment from life of the legal profession <e> <s> nevertheless there has been a large measure of consensus <e> <s> i think every speaker has agreed that the three new reforms contained in the bill are very welcome so far as they go <e> <s> in particular the noble lord lord dacre so rightly pointed out that at long last and very welcome too mi is being put on a statutory basis <e> <s> again as he suggested to the government not only would there not have been the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must interrupt <e> <s> i think on reflection that i perhaps got into deep water provoked by the remarks of the noble lord lord dacre who is not a politician <e> <s> i have to concede to the government that a review body would be much better composed of people i mentioned them who had been home secretaries secretaries of state for northern ireland foreign secretaries and so on <e> <s> that would have the confidence of parliament without worrying mi or the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that quite apart from the political factor in germany chancellor kohls objections to deploying a replacement for lance are very widely shared by others including the french government <e> <s> would <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the fact that it is possible to withdraw those troops is extremely welcome and that that trend should go on if possible <e> <s> did i understand him to say that he is now calculating the impact on the defence budget <e> <s> surely the right procedure is to make that calculation before reaching a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords while everyone agrees that nato needs a powerful strategic lift will the minister bear in mind that it is the habit of military men in all countries to make rather alarming statements for largely budgetary reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also feel some sympathy for those people in cornwall who object to the arrangements made but we find the orders in themselves unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that in spite of the extraordinary and welcome changes now taking place in the soviet union and eastern europe there is still a fair case for britain maintaining her present nuclear capability <e> <s> however what possible reason can there be at this time for multiplying our nuclear capability several times if not eight then certainly four or five times <e> <s> what are the reasons for that <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the noble lord said that if we do not have trident then we shall have no nuclear capability <e> <s> i specifically said that there was a good case for maintaining our nuclear capability at its current level <e> <s> however i asked the noble lord what reasons the government have at this moment for multiplying by several times our nuclear capabilty <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how far this building programme is designed to fit in with the american maritime strategy and how far this strategy is supported by britain and nato <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble and learned lord does not wish to be unfair <e> <s> i made the point perfectly clear there is no question of equal sharing of responsibility <e> <s> even an advisory committee has a degree of responsibility for a final decision <e>", "<cs> if the figures for interceptions are published as they are i should have thought that they would be the most sensitive of all the forms of information that we are considering <e> <s> the point made by the noble and learned lord against paragraph a the number of warrants scarcely applies to paragraphs b and c <e> <s> yet he ruled out the whole proposal on the basis of a not tremendously persuasive argument about security <e> <s> at no time either in another place or in this chamber have the government given way on any amendment <e> <s> of all the amendments which face the government this one might be conceded with the least discomfort to ministers <e> <s> i urgently ask that this be thought about again before the next stage <e>", "<cs> as one of the few people present belonging to the category of persons described by my noble friend as honest and disinterested compared with the legal lights here i wish to support the amendment moved by my noble friend and to inquire by what reasoning the noble and learned lord is supporting a legal monopoly <e> <s> fortunately he has the reputation of being against legal monopolies and we look forward to his explanation of his <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that proposals were brought forward to loosen the control over our newspapers and television of the two or three thoroughly unsuitable persons who exercise it at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friends will want me first to express our appreciation for the positive manner in which the noble lord introduced the motion this afternoon and in particular to express our agreement with his comments on the importance and hopefulness of the talks on conventional disarmament which have just started in vienna and with the list of priorities he laid down for those talks <e> <s> i think we also agree warmly with the striking expressions of the noble lord lord cledwyn about the sea change the enormous importance and far-reaching nature of the changes initiated by mr gorbachev <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to intervene <e> <s> he says that there is no alternative <e> <s> the alternative is to maintain ones nuclear armament and not as the government suggest under the term modernisation to escalate its power <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would explain whether he means escalation as well as modernisation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister agree that hope for the future rests on reaching agreement on the terms of the referendum <e> <s> will the government encourage the united nations to enter into the dispute concerning the terms of the referendum <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the unilateral efforts the government appear to be making would they not act more effectively through the european community as well <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he detailed a number of points on which there is general agreement in nato <e> <s> however he omitted the major issue on which britain is isolated namely the desirability of having negotiations to reduce short-range nuclear weapons <e> <s> why is britain holding out against this if it is true as the noble lord lord renton says that there is a major preponderance in conventional forces on the soviet and warsaw pact side <e> <s> why not start now on a negotiation about short-range nuclear weapons related to the success of the conventional arms reduction talks <e> <s> that is what nato wants <e> <s> why is britain isolating herself <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome cautiously the answer given by the noble lord <e> <s> why is there no reference to the brigade of gurkhas and recruiting difficulties in this years white paper <e> <s> is he aware that the defence white paper this year is quite exceptionally skimpy and uninformative <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the problem of recruitment and retention of servicemen is of tremendous importance and of great interest to parliament <e> <s> i ask again why is there no reference to this problem in this years defence white paper <e> <s> is he aware that year by year this white paper is becoming less and less valuable for informing parliament and more and more of a public relations document <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that despite the impressive figures that he has given for the increase in defence expenditure in monetary terms since that expenditure has declined in real terms since <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that no one is challenging the rise in expenditure in real terms for the dates that he gave <e> <s> i asked whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i specifically asked whether expenditure had not fallen in real terms since <e> <s> may we have that figure if not now will the noble lord send it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords it would surely not be appropriate for a bill of this kind to receive its second reading without a word of support from the democrat benches <e> <s> of all the political parties the old liberal party was the greenest the earliest although others are now trying to follow its lead and to catch up with its record <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless has not the minister noticed that since gorbachev took over the assessment of his actions and of the actions of the soviet government made by the german government have proved a great deal more realistic than those made by the british government <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that some of the suspicions voiced perhaps quite naturally by ministers from the government benches have proved in effect to be completely unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords while i warmly welcome the answers she has given on this question does the noble baroness agree that it was the arab league which invited the syrians into lebanon in the first place for the protection of the christians <e> <s> does she also agree that it is very unrealistic for arab governments to urge the syrians to leave while the israelis stay as she said in the south <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the statement announces a major decision next year as regards the battalion to be withdrawn from hong kong <e> <s> in view of the very positive and welcome nature of this statement can we assume that this is a decision about the role and function of the battalion and not about its continuance as a battalion <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that as politicians go mr gorbachevs words have been followed by deeds to a remarkable extent as regards afghanistan elections human rights namibia disarmament proposals and unilateral withdrawal of tanks from eastern germany <e> <s> one after the other his statements have borne fruit <e> <s> why then should we not take very seriously his statement that within a remarkably short period of time there will be a cut of one-seventh in defence expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords if those short-range nuclear missiles were negotiated away nato would still have thousands of short-range nuclear warheads in other forms <e> <s> as the warsaw pact has that huge lead in short-range nuclear missiles is it surprising that every other nato government wishes to negotiate upon them <e> <s> why are the government holding back <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness bear in mind the fact that the british government are not being asked by their allies to scrap the short-range nuclear missiles but simply to negotiate upon their reduction <e> <s> they are not even being asked to agree to the reduction unless there is substantial progress first in conventional disarmament <e> <s> to divide nato on that point is very hard to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that since the death of the ayatollah khomeini it has been made clear that the threat against mr salman rushdie still stands <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in spite of the increasing value of the peacekeeping forces the arrangements for organising them at the united nations are thoroughly unsatisfactory which is evident from his replies <e> <s> have the government any proposals for improving this <e> <s> for example now that the russians are more co-operative have the government considered trying to revive the military staffs committee and giving it responsibility for organising peacekeeping forces <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the fact that action is being considered is very welcome and that help for the work of that admirable charity would encourage it a great deal <e> <s> is he further aware that it has won worldwide respect for the courage and good spirit of its doctors and staff <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is widespread agreement that the european community is right to give whatever help it can to the arab league initiative especially to its very able chief negotiator mr lakhadar ibrahimi <e> <s> does he agree that success depends not only on the withdrawal of the intervention of syria and iran but also of the government of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the denial of education which i believe has lasted now for months does the minister recall stating recently that the israeli army has killed children and wounded others by beating and shooting <e> <s> will he give the assurance that while that treatment of children continues there will be no official educational or cultural links with israel <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the government protest but do nothing <e> <s> further is it right at this time that we should continue the normal relationship with the israeli ministry of education as though nothing was going on and as though we approved of their conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that not only the british government but the european parliament and the council of ministers have all strongly condemned the fact that those palestinian children have been prevented from having any education for months and have equally condemned the killing as he stated of children and the wounding of others by shooting and beating <e> <s> does he agree that it is extraordinary that such conduct can find defenders in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord point out that all submarines to which he referred were presumably ordered by mr gorbachevs predecessors <e> <s> it would be interesting to know what has happened to the rate of new orders since mr gorbachev took over <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been a little less misleading for that answer to have been made clear to begin with <e> <s> what is the advantage of making things look worse than they really are <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord referred to a flea bite was he referring to the withdrawal of tanks including the most modern types from east germany <e> <s> do they not number more than <e> <s> is that not a fair start in any case and something not to be derided <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that since mr gorbachev came to power the prospects for disarmament have vastly improved and the possibility of soviet aggression in europe has greatly diminished <e> <s> when will the government and some of their supporters start looking pleasant facts in the face <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin with a word of congratulation to the noble lord lord irving and to his colleagues on the opposition front bench <e> <s> the defence policy that they have been advocating for years in this house has now been adopted by their party <e> <s> it is not a very good defence policy but what an improvement it is on what went before <e> <s> now we must look to the opposition front bench for guidance as regards labour policy instead of to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding i said that the proportion of per cent <e> <s> of gnp was excessive at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while warmly supporting the appeal of the noble lord lord cledwyn unfortunately it seems that the israelis will stall the mubarak initiative <e> <s> in that case will the government consider very carefully the proposal bearing in mind the encouraging precedent of namibia that the secretary general of the united nations might go to palestine and make recommendations about an election <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question put by the noble lord does the minister not agree that at the moment the eyeball to eyeball confrontation of nato and the warsaw pact corresponds less and less to political realities as they are developing in europe <e> <s> is he aware that it is now years since the harmel report and surely the time has come for nato to have a new review of its long-term aims <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that we were the first to start the withdrawal process <e> <s> further will he say exactly why this was decided <e> <s> what was wrong with the specification <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord ross has been unavoidably called away <e> <s> however he would want me to express his appreciation of the remarks which the noble lord the minister made on this motion and to associate himself with many of the points made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it is a matter of regret to me that i was not able to hear all the speeches made by the minister on this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is refreshing to hear the governments opposition to a test ban treaty explained not in terms of the unverifiability of such tests they have been verifiable for many years but that they wish to be able lo test our new warhead for trident and no doubt the new warhead for the short-range nuclear missiles <e> <s> however do i understand from the noble lords original answer that the governments position is that in order to deter aggression by the warsaw pact this country now needs a major increase in its nuclear capability <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that quite apart from the universities apparently the schools will be closed again <e> <s> is he aware that the community has protested many times in the strongest terms not only against the closures but also against the killing and wounding of many thousands of palestinian children by shooting and beating <e> <s> does he think that it would be appropriate for the community perhaps next month at the summit to consider suspending the economic privileges that it gives to israel while these outrages continue <e>", "<cs> my lords will separate ratings be published measuring relative popularity <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say what the cost would be presumably the decreasing cost of bringing the pre- war widows up to the level of the post- war widows <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has revealed some sharp differences of opinion sometimes brilliantly expressed on britains role in the community <e> <s> i thought that the balance of argument went in favour of the position set out at the outset of the debate by my noble friend lord bonham-carter <e> <s> but at the same time it seems that there has been a total consensus on the reality and importance of the gorbachev revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain more fully the reasons those statistics are not compiled and if they are why he has not announced them <e> <s> what is there to stop their publication apart from the risk of embarrassing the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl quite rightly said the governments arguments have been stated clearly and repeatedly by several ministers <e> <s> however is he also aware that those arguments are <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has set an example to all of us in the appeal he made to our sense of justice but not in any sense to emotion or prejudice of any kind <e> <s> like him i shall speak for myself in this debate <e> <s> in the autumn of i was appointed a junior minister at the foreign office and i was given some responsibilities for war crimes problems <e> <s> i am sure that other speakers will talk about the legal difficulties in the recommendations of the inquiry and about the practical difficulties of bringing these people to trial <e> <s> i think my best contribution will be to try to explain why in we decided to end war crimes trials investigations and extraditions and to show how the policy we then had differs from the policy now recommended by the inquiry <e> <s> i shall also explain the reasons why speaking for myself we should reject those recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> since speaking it has occurred to me that i confused the word retaliation with retribution <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that satisfactory answer <e> <s> is he aware that it will give considerable reassurance to the other community foreign ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too welcome the statement <e> <s> it is little more than half <e>", "<cs> my lords we all seem to agree that a new secure system is necessary to replace the present system which is crumbling <e> <s> however even if we were to start work on it now the negotiations for the treaties there will be several of them the erection of the institutions there will be several of them and the arrangements for peace-keeping perhaps involving military decisions will take many years <e> <s> before then nato will be faced with very difficult problems in connection with the reunification of germany about which i should like to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what the programme of scrapping has been during the period to which he referred <e> <s> would the soviet union have scrapped fewer than major ships in that major two-year period <e> <s> how many submarines has it scrapped <e> <s> will the minister confirm the american view that a very great proportion of the soviet fleet is obsolescent <e> <s> finally will he further confirm that during this period the wests considerable lead in naval power has not been eroded in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the minister implied that naval disarmament is not included in the current talks <e> <s> is he not aware that this is because of the western attitude <e> <s> some russians are perfectly willing and have been for some time to include those talks in the disarmament negotiations <e> <s> if he is so worried about the naval shipbuilding of the soviet union will he explain why the british government and the west resist disarmament negotiations on naval weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the present level of defence expenditure was decided some years ago to meet a threat from the warsaw pact which has since ceased to exist <e> <s> does he further agree that the new threats call for a budget of a different kind which is smaller in size <e> <s> is it not preposterous now to increase in real terms the level of defence expenditure <e> <s> is there not an overwhelming case for an immediate defence review <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to clarify one point <e> <s> the noble lord stated that a number of governments feel that the time is coming when sanctions can be abandoned <e> <s> could the noble lord answer the question that has been put to him from both front benches <e> <s> does any other government agree with the british government that the time has now come when sanctions should be abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that these submarines and in particular the polaris fleet have a marvellous record of reliability <e> <s> does he agree that in the present circumstances there is plainly a case for maintaining our nuclear capability <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that until agreement has been reached in the cfe talks in at least a years time we shall be continuing with the same structure and balance of our forces as we did before any of the revolutions in russia and <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in december at the general assembly of the united nations nations voted for progress towards a comprehensive ban and only two voted against of whom the united kingdom was one <e> <s> when the noble lord says he is working for the success of the non-proliferation conference is he aware that a key to non-proliferation would be the comprehensive banning of nuclear tests <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand that it is the governments policy not only to increase defence expenditure but to increase manpower in the defence industries <e> <s> should not the government have extensive contingency plans for a substantial cut in manpower in those industries <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome that slight move in the direction of the advice tendered to the government from these benches <e> <s> but may i ask again whether the government have contingency plans for a substantial drop in employment in the defence industries <e> <s> they certainly should have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government take note of two recent resolutions by the european parliament both of which detail the ill-treatment of palestinian schoolchildren by the israeli authorities and recommend the kind of action which i suggest in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the suggestion that educational institutions are used for terrorism reflects strangely on the israeli closure not only of universities but again of schools and kindergartens and on their arrest of people who organise education for children in private homes <e> <s> is he aware that that is simply an excuse for another damaging attack on the education and the national traditions of palestinian children <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether the government are seriously considering ways of lessening the burden on the polaris fleet during its last years <e> <s> there are ways of doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is almost impossible to judge the amount of chemical weapons or to monitor the amount <e> <s> can he reassure the house that as regards disarmament mr gorbachev has been extremely positive in words and deeds for a considerable period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a major problem that a signature to the treaty is manifestly not enough <e> <s> iraq is a signatory of the treaty <e> <s> is it not further sad to hear from the international inspectorate that it had no evidence whatever that iraq was building a nuclear weapons facility <e> <s> does not that strengthen the view that the best way forward might be the signing of a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the two nations who are above all preventing that are the united states and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the taking of hostages by the israelis is one of the reasons given for not releasing western hostages in lebanon <e> <s> further should not the government make quite clear to the israelis that their hostage taking is not only a crime in itself but is also making the task of obtaining the release of western hostages more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the difficulty in which the minister finds himself in fully answering these questions <e> <s> however does he recall the official statement from the iranian foreign minister that the kidnapping by the israelis of sheikh obeid and others is a relevant part of the question of solving the hostage problem <e> <s> further is not another obstacle to obtaining the release of western hostages the substantial evidence which has now been accumulated that the israelis are condoning the systematic use of torture in this prison <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that an important section of opinion in this house considers that the handling of inflation by both main parties has been grossly incompetent <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord monkswell for introducing this debate <e> <s> some of us may have felt that his tribute to the influence and achievements of cnd was a trifle over-generous but at least it reminded us that the organisation continues to exist a fact of which otherwise not all of us might have been aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is not rather a high figure for a polish applicant and an outrageous figure for an application that has been refused <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the speech of the noble lord lord irvine a little puzzling and a little disappointing <e> <s> in the first half he explained with the greatest wealth of detail that in his view it would not be possible under this bill to give a fair trial to suspects <e> <s> in the second part of his speech he argued that because a different view was taken in the house of commons he himself felt that we should respect the views of another place rather than the view that a fair trial was not possible under the bill <e> <s> if we sincerely believe that a fair trial is not possible under the bill surely no power on earth should persuade us to support the bill no matter what the opinion in another place may be <e> <s> it must be a priority that the man charged with these dreadful of fences is fairly charged <e> <s> no considerations of politics should stand in the way of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will agree with me that there is no better sign that the other place agrees with something but that no one asks for a debate and no debate takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> does he recall that a few months ago the government were declaring that a full-scale defence review was not desirable <e> <s> have they had second thoughts on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say when we shall be told of the governments decisions on these matters and in what form <e> <s> meantime is he aware that it is difficult to avoid the impression that the government are being rather limited slow and secretive about what they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is now the governments view that the soviet threat is as the minister said alarming <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree on reflection that despite the views of some noble lords opposite it is not helpful or realistic to describe the soviet threat to this country as alarming <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not recognise that the fact that the government have made serious mistakes in this field is in no way exonerated by the fact that a previous labour government made equally bad mistakes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that there would be less disruption if these companies could be given more notice of changes in procurement policy <e> <s> further is he aware that it is difficult to see why the tornado decision could not have been taken earlier <e> <s> indeed many of us on this side of the house wonder why the defence review was not started earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a short question designed only to avoid future misunderstanding <e> <s> will the minister explain the difference between the defence review and the <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the noble lords replies that in his view the secretary of state kept parliament properly and fully informed about this transaction <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of what the noble lord lord williams has said would be acceptable on these benches although i was surprised by a few of the matters that he raised <e> <s> he said that we knew nothing about <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister also tell the house whether the order has been considered by the joint committee on defence and whether it made any comments <e> <s> as regards the question asked by the noble lord lord williams if we do not pass the order we shall not have an army <e> <s> therefore perhaps he will not divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we thank the minister for repeating the statement and associate ourselves with the warm and well deserved tribute that he paid to the armed services <e> <s> i wish that i could be as complimentary about the statement as the opposition front bench <e> <s> possibly because on these benches we do not have to live down a long record of lunacy on defence matters we feel freer to criticise what is now put before us <e> <s> the fact is that in the light of the extraordinary changes in europe of the collapse of the warsaw pact of the withdrawal of soviet troops of the announcement of very great reductions in the german armed forces and of american forces in europe a reduction of per cent <e> <s> in overall manpower over five years is extremely modest <e> <s> it is too modest <e> <s> why have the government turned down proposals for a faster run-down for example the proposals made by the minister of state for defence procurement <e> <s> was it because of the practical difficulties of the run-down or was it because of worries about the remaining threats in europe <e> <s> i should be grateful to the noble earl if he could answer that specific question <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble earl will forgive my intervention but can he explain whether this is an increase in our provision for out of area capability <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that this question refers to the labour partys policy of the total elimination of nuclear weapons by the end of the century <e> <s> whether or not that is desirable it is plainly entirely impracticable <e> <s> the implications of verifying all the countries of the world make the mind boggle <e> <s> does the noble lord also agree that in addition it is impossible to separate out the elimination of nuclear weapons from the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction <e> <s> it cannot be expected that israel would abandon its nuclear weapons while the iraqis keep their cw capacity and the reverse is true <e> <s> the whole thing makes no sense <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that the british government had no evidence that the iraqis are attempting to build nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords was not my noble friend right to draw attention to the fact that the statement does not cover the very important but disappointing events that followed a remark made by the foreign secretary to some knesset members when he visited israel <e> <s> the remark implied rightly or wrongly that the government were antipathetic to the idea of a palestinian state <e> <s> can the noble lord clarify that <e> <s> he said that the government support self-determination for the palestinians <e> <s> that surely must mean that when the palestinians are free to decide if they decide on a independent state then the british government believe that they have a right to do so <e> <s> is that not the case <e> <s> can the minister say how it came about that the foreign secretary was misunderstood as being antipathetic to the idea of an independent palestinian state <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to press the noble lord on the very disappointing answer he gave on the question of the governments attitude to self-determination for the palestinians <e> <s> from that answer it follows clearly that the government believe that the palestinians right to self-determination is qualified <e> <s> it is qualified by the noble lord stating that their right to an independent state is subject to agreement between the parties concerned <e> <s> that is the only possible interpretation of the answers he has given <e> <s> in effect therefore the state is subject to an israeli veto <e> <s> that is a serious falling back by the government on previous policy statements <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hard to wind up a debate consisting of interesting and well-informed speeches on entirely disparate subjects <e> <s> today we have had speeches on latin america cambodia poland south africa the sudan israel development aid northern ireland the commonwealth terms of trade and of course europe and the gulf <e> <s> we also had a truly memorable speech on hong kong <e> <s> we had a speech on personal relations social relations community relations and international relations and also on white hats black hats and blue hats <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that there is another example of double standards <e> <s> the government have rightly required unions to hold ballots before making political levies but they oppose any requirement of shareholders to hold ballots before making political donations <e> <s> does the minister agree that that is a rather discreditable example of partisanship <e>", "<cs> my lords what are our commitments in the interim <e> <s> will the minister assure us that the united states will not take military action against the british governments advice <e>"]
