["<cs> my lords i am very glad to have the opportunity to express the full support of the government for my noble friend lord onslows bill and to thank and congratulate both him and my noble friend lord renton for their enthusiasm and diligence in taking this measure forward <e> <s> i feel it is important to note that what is being sought here is a measure which found enormous support when the principle of the protection of homes from intrusion was raised for comment in the governments consultation paper <e> <s> it was quite clear from the response to this paper that people felt that it was both necessary and desirable to extend the protection of the criminal law to people in their own homes and to punish intrusions into such homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords it is entirely appropriate that the noble lord lord rea should have agreed to promote this bill <e> <s> the noble lord who as we now know has himself dissected a body will appreciate that as it says in the preamble to the act which was quoted by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for health when he spoke on th february in committee in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords officials of the two governments have been engaged in technical discussions about the possible basis of a future more comprehensive social security convention between the united kingdom and canada <e> <s> these discussions are continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords question successive governments have taken the view that our social security system is designed primarily for people living in this country <e> <s> the cost of increasing pensions falls mainly on contributors and employers here and it would be unreasonable to ask them to bear the cost of increases paid to people who have left the country <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble baronesss question the question of the united states of america is a different one from that on the order paper <e> <s> with regard to the second part of her remarks i have listened with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the beginning conversations are still continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend australia does not appear in the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords in the year after march some three million people who would at present be entitled to receive an average subsidy of on lenses supplied under the general ophthalmic service will become private patients <e> <s> information on how many are retirement pensioners is not available <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is beyond me why the noble lord rejoices in being a prophet of doom and gloom <e> <s> in four years time he too will become a pensioner <e> <s> our proposals to relax the opticians monopoly and to allow advertising will increase competition <e> <s> a competitive market is the best price regulator <e> <s> the important point is that people should get the glasses that they need <e> <s> it does not follow that the state should supply them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i hope that his specs fit him to an i <e>", "<cs> my lords a tiny minority of about per cent <e> <s> are subsidised by or more because they need more powerful or complex lenses <e> <s> we are considering the possibility of helping them without subsidising those on substantial incomes who are well able to afford their glasses <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not <e> <s> free spectacles as of right are at present given to the following categories the under s the over s and under s still in full-time education those receiving supplementary benefit or family income supplement those receiving free milk and vitamins and/or free prescriptions on income grounds <e> <s> i only revealed the noble lords age because mine is the same <e>", "<cs> my lords because they do not fall into the categories that exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for the very kind remarks which he made about my noble friend and myself <e> <s> both he and the noble baroness are well aware of the governments attitude towards his bill but i should like to congratulate him on the perseverance he has shown in pursuing a matter which i know is near and dear to his heart <e>", "<cs> my lords before the debate is resumed i should inform your lordships that the revised time for the end of the debate is pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to extend to the house the apologies of my noble friend lord glenarthur who unfortunately cannot be here to attend this third reading <e> <s> the change of represent-ation of the government front bench does not indicate any mellowing <e> <s> we recognise the admirable and positive intentions behind the bill and have followed it with very great interest <e> <s> we share the same aim of eliminating unjustified discrimination against disabled people but my noble friend is well aware that at all stages we have made it clear that the government will not provide sustenance for it in any way at any further stages and i will not repeat any reasons for so doing except to reiterate that the new commission would cost money <e>"]
