withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in order to avoid any doubt may i once again declare that i have an interest in breakfast <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that my noble friend the

present domestic passengers are paying an extra on a round trip for security and both airlines and passengers are constantly complaining about the seemingly unrestrained growth of the brown army of

of people <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that all the figures that he has produced are really guesstimates bearing in mind the vast number of people who are not registered drug

as many steps as i can with the minister and having been to see him as recently as last week about this matter i therefore look forward to his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords as we all know from the point of view of the falkland islanders this bill creates a parallel citizenship as it does for the other british dependent territories but it in no way weakens britains moral and constitutional responsibility for those in the dependencies and this must never be forgotten <e> <s> it must be right that the government have taken the view that it would be invidious to devise separate and special citizenships for some dependencies and not for others <e> <s> making an exception for some dependencies would create the very type of anomalies which the bill is designed to erase and would lead to demands for equal treatment from those dependencies who might consider themselves less well-treated <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that it might be a good idea if the subject matter

myself in the impertinent position of disagreeing with the most reverend primate and others of great eminence <e> <s> this bill was entirely necessary and despite what the noble and learned lord who moved this amendment has said his party certainly did recognise the need for change when they were in government <e> <s> it is rather like the days when the commonwealth bill was opposed by the labour party and then brought in by them two years later a switch when it seems necessary to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the government in their wish to prolong this order <e> <s> none of us who is in a position to send or not to send someone to prison does so or does not do so as a matter of convenience for the administration <e> <s> it is a matter for the protection of the public or of the degree of seriousness of the crime <e> <s> it is not an administrative convenience to send someone to prison or to remand in custody <e> <s> getting back to what the noble lord lord foot has said it has been my experience in pentonville prison that the workshops have suffered considerably due to the escort duties carried out by prison officers which means there are not enough staff to man the prison workshop <e> <s> this means that the workshops are closed and the prisoners remain in their cells <e> <s> this has been given officially as one of the reasons for the closure of many workshops in prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done much heart-searching over this amendment partly because it is natural to uphold the rights of people to appeal against a decision affecting them

the lord bishops <e> <s> but speak against them i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i might be allowed to reply on that point <e> <s> i did begin by saying that i had thought long and hard about

work done by the united nations voluntary fund to which i think i am right in saying this country is the second largest contributor <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first what are the government doing to encourage the work of voluntary bodies as regards child abuse <e> <s> secondly will the forthcoming restructuring of the national health

report particularly in the case of a serious crime which would place the magistrates in an extreme dilemma <e> <s> would she perhaps like to comment on that before the minister replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill which is before your lordships for its second reading today represents a fundamental effort to change a bad law an unenforced and unenforceable law and points the way for freedom for shops to open and close when they wish <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to listen to a maiden speech and i am particularly honoured that my noble friend lord mackintosh should have chosen my bill as a starting point to what i know will be a distinguished career in this house <e> <s> perhaps i should declare some sort of interest

premature to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply may i ask him whether he is surprised that i am surprised at the excessive delay in ratifying this convention bearing in mind that the leader of the united kingdom delegation announced in her speech to the nations at the united nations world mid-decade conference in copenhagen in that the united kingdom did not sign conventions unless they intended to ratify them <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend be aware that his reply alas <e> <s> will be most disappointing to many womens organisations and to the un agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords if the suggestion of the noble lord lord jenkins was carried out would it mean that london bridge would have to be returned to us from america <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble baroness <e> <s> i do so because it is nice to know where your friends are <e> <s> i would take issue with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> i do not believe that people who do not want mentally handicapped people to live in their area are

ministers statement may i ask him whether it would not be in order to praise highly the standard of teaching which goes on in prisons and the results which are achieved regardless of numbers of staff or indeed of prisoners who are benefiting from the staffs work <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in saying that if nurses by their free will choose to work in private institutions they will not get pensions whereas those who work in the health service do get pensions <e> <s> so what one loses on the swings may be gained on the roundabouts <e>", "<cs> my lords other speakers in the debate have

result of my bill <e> <s> having said that i find that in practical terms i cannot commend this amendment to your lordships on the following grounds <e> <s> terms of employment are not regulated by the home office and my bill is entirely a matter for the home office <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply first to the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i hope she will forgive me i agree that i made a mistake <e> <s> i am so very young in this house but i take her point <e> <s> i tried to bring out the point made by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> why shopworkers and why not all the others

new prisons will result in the business of slopping out becoming a thing of the past in the as-near-as-possible future <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is as has been explained a revised version of the amendment which the noble lord lord robertson moved in committee <e> <s> in its revised form i say at once it is a significant improvement on the amendment we had before us then and i congratulate and thank the noble lord for the effort he has made to meet some of the objections to his amendment some of them made by me which in part gave rise to his withdrawing the amendment at that stage <e>

authorities the means to carry out their responsibilities effectively or to provide the advisory services which are needed on residential care <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i said that significant encouragement to private donors had been given by changes in the taxation rules concerning covenants and by raising the exemption limit on capital transfer tax <e> <s> i have no further

<e> <s> it is up to the voluntary homes to provide fire precautions themselves <e> <s> i think the noble lord really makes the point himself when he says that the homes have been running for years or more <e> <s> plans for fire regulations and fire prevention arrangements in homes have been in force for many years now <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to section grant aid for installing fire precautions having been discontinued the main purpose of grants made by the dhss to voluntary bodies under section was to help with the administration costs of the headquarters of national organisations or to help with experimental projects of national significance <e> <s> past demand on the section budget has been such that the dhss has been able to find a small amount to help meet the cost of fire precautions in individual homes <e> <s> current demand for the headquarters costs and experimental projects is unprecedented in spite of an per cent <e> <s> increase in expected

charming and able representative proposing this amendment not to mention the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> the noble lady has suggested that clause of the bill as drafted might create an anomaly in respect of prosecutions for offences under clause committed in scotland as against those committed in the case of the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> while the bill expressly provides for the appropriate director of public prosecutions to give his consent to proceedings in england wales and northern ireland clause makes no mention of scotland <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill as presently drafted provided for an exceptions order made under clause to be subject to the negative resolution procedure in parliament <e> <s> such an order might exempt from the need to hold a cable authority licence certain services or classes of service which would otherwise require a licence <e> <s> this provision follows the precedent of part iv of the post office act which contains the home secretarys existing power to license cable programme services and of part iv of the telecommunications bill which will replace part iv of the act until this bill comes into force <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to continue i think he will find that i shall eventually come to the bit to which he is referring <e> <s> i hope that he will allow me to carry on <e> <s> i think that what i will do is to read the bit concerned with the standard negative resolution procedure <e> <s> in the view of the government there is no need either to strengthen or weaken the standard negative resolution procedure in clause <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that bald statement <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i have found another piece <e> <s> there is absolutely no point in

another little piece <e>", "<cs> the bill as it stands allows both houses of parliament to debate any exceptions order which the home secretary may make under clause <e> <s> the procedure provided for is the standard negative procedure whereby the debate takes place only if the order is objected to <e> <s> it then takes place in either house or both according to who objects to it <e>", "<cs> no i did not <e> <s> i never mentioned clause <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for saying that he is not going to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that i can go along with his suggestion that clause goes very wide <e> <s> the point is that clause <e>", "<cs> the bill as it stands enables the cable authority to charge fees on the grant and during the term of its licences <e> <s> these fees will supply the authority with the income it needs to carry out its functions <e> <s> the amendment provides that the authority should also be able to charge an application fee in respect of any application for a licence <e> <s> the proposal has its attractiveness from the point of view of the authority and its licensees <e> <s> it would add to the authoritys sources of income and it would be advantageous to its licensees since it would help to keep down the level of their licence fees <e> <s> on the last point it has of course to be remarked that it would not be all saving for the licensees as they themselves would have been liable to pay the application fees but obviously it would be of some benefit to them <e> <s> more generally the existence of application fees might serve as the noble lord lord aylestone said to deter frivolous applicants with no serious intention or ability to provide cable services whose applications would needlessly waste the authoritys time <e>", "<cs> i hope for every reason that we can avoid making heavy weather of this because i think that there is nothing between the government and my noble friends on the substance <e> <s> the problem arises simply from a difference of view of what clause means <e> <s> the amendment seeks to make it clear that the enterprising friend of my noble friend lord mottistone can apply for a licence to provide a prescribed diffusion service without having to wait for the authority to solicit applications <e> <s> in the governments view the amendment is otiose because the bill already achieves that objective <e> <s> the important point which my noble friends may have overlooked is that where a statute creates a licensing procedure it is open to anyone at any time to submit an application unless the act specifically says something different <e> <s> there is no need to state that someone can submit an application because by definition he can <e> <s> as paragraph of the white paper made clear the government accept that the market-led nature of cable will mean that the initiative for applications must rest largely with those who wish to make the investment <e> <s> the authority too will be able to generate interest in particular areas if they wish but there is bound to be a two-way process <e> <s> all that clause does is to require the authority to give in all cases a general opportunity for applications to be submitted whether or not one has already been made <e> <s> in the light of that reassurance i hope that my noble friends will feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> in answer to my noble friend lord mottistone the authoritys general duty to promote cable means that it would not be at all proper for them to sit on applications and do nothing about them <e> <s> but it must be right to leave the authority some discretion in the organisation of their workload <e> <s> obviously they will not be able to do everything at the same time <e> <s> may i suggest that my noble friend reads in <e>", "<cs> my lords hunger is getting the better of us all <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> it

act have done much useful work in advising the iba in the exercise of its duties particularly as has already been said in local radio <e>", "<cs> i think that i answered the noble lord lord aylestone when i said originally that there is nothing to stop people from forming local committees <e> <s> the noble lord has made clear his intentions but i did say that cable television was not a public service and that it is different from local <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for giving us the opportunity to discuss the way in which the cable authority should publish their advertising code and for the brief conversation i had with him before he actually did so <e> <s> there are however reasons which i believe to be sound why the amendment should not be made <e>", "<cs> so far as the question of timing is concerned the bill places an obligation on the authority to draw up a code so the authority will be under a duty to do so that is as soon as the bill comes into force <e> <s> on the question of publication the authority will have to make the code generally available so that licensees can comply with it <e> <s> it is relevant that there is no obligation on the iba to publish its code <e> <s> i hope that answers the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what my noble friend said and as a further answer to the noble lord lord mishcon may i say as i said originally that until the code is available the cable authority may wish to apply the iba code <e> <s> the home office has required interim licensees to do so <e> <s> some of the services already being offered now are on existing systems <e> <s> one cannot comply with a code until it is actually set up <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has obviously forgotten the second amendment to which my noble friend lord elton gave in willingly and with great graciousness <e>", "<cs> it is with pleasure that i say hooray hooray <e> <s> i confirm exactly what the noble lord lord mishcon said and i await his pleasure <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend lord de la warr will be so kind as to take his next amendment at the same time as this amendment because the two amendments go together

broadcasting mould <e> <s> i can assure him that the government accept that there will be forms of advertising on cable which have not been appropriate within the confines of public service broadcasting <e> <s> that does not mean a lowering of standards <e> <s> it is simply a recognition of the fact that where there is an abundance of channels new approaches can be tried <e> <s> cable will not be confined to spot advertising <e> <s> there may be longer advertising features <e> <s> there will be a place for sponsorship subject to certain safeguards and we have recognised that by making a specific mention of sponsorship in clause <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord glanusk has made clear his fears that in time the number of dbs channels included in the must carry rule might rise to more than five <e> <s> he submits that this would place an unreasonable burden upon cable companies and his amendment seeks to limit the number of dbs services which might be included in the must carry rule to a maximum of five <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mottistone has most eloquently moved his amendment expressing the view that it should be for the person providing a diffusion service

replacing references to the bbc and the iba in all other statutes by references to people <e>", "<cs> that is as may be but the point is that if the supposition which the noble lord earlier presented materialised in the future there would have to be new legislation <e>", "<cs> while i accept that in the context of dbs the possibility of new arrangements in our broadcasting structures may not be quite as hypothetical as i may have suggested nevertheless i think that we should be unwise to provide for the future until we know a little more clearly what it will look like <e> <s> i take the

noble lords amendment and also flesh out the information that he gave us from the governments point of view <e> <s> the government agree that it would be inappropriate for cable operators to enjoy the

unchanged <e> <s> to extend such a grant to cover areas where at present no grant or only a reduced rate grant is payable would cost a further million and the total cost including administration involved in paying grant would be about million <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to that is that i could not possibly give answers to that before my noble friend in another place has considered

cost of a funeral at that price <e> <s> the further cost of extending this increased grant to cover all deaths where at present no grant or only half-rate grant is payable would be about million and the total cost of paying grant at this level to everyone would be million <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in the supplementary benefit single payment limit from to and other changes in the supplementary benefit capital limits announced in the last budget will help to ensure that people receiving supplementary benefit are not required to draw on personal savings or other provision

noble friends bill thus far is broadening my education all the time i have more than a passing interest in horse racing <e> <s> it may come as a surprise to some noble lords to know that i serve as a local steward at folkestone racecourse <e> <s> i gain nothing financially from my connections with the folkestone course but it gives me a tremendous amount of pleasure <e> <s> that experience has also given me something of an insight into why my noble friend lord newall has brought forward his bill designed to remove some of the restrictions which do not apply to horse racing or at any event in the case of the limit on betting days do not represent a difficulty to individual racecourses in practice <e>", "<cs> we welcome the new clause which apart from overcoming the drafting problems of the original clause embodies some important safeguards <e> <s> i should perhaps add a word or two <e> <s> my noble friend lord newall has referred to the dog racecourse totalisator regulations and to the need to amend those regulations so that the procedure for carry-forward pools as envisaged in the bill can start up in practice <e> <s> if the bill makes progress in another place it will be the intention of the secretary <e>", "<cs> the long title proposed in this amendment gives a very good indication of the purpose and effect of the clauses in the bill <e> <s> we welcome the amendment <e>

presentational purposes the scope of the film must be limited but in the absence of a ban on chemical weapons we acknowledge the increased importance of these matters and we shall look very carefully at my noble friends suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper deals with a film about civil defence <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness actually asking a question <e> <s> i believe that is the custom on a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord rugby for what

answer to the second part of the noble lords question i would say that our approach to private health care is based on two beliefs <e> <s> one is the fundamental principle that people should have the

seems to me that the noble lord lord kilmarnock has just himself answered the question that he put that discussion in order to get it right is exactly what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a

friend lord nugent <e> <s> i must say at the outset that acceptance of my noble friends amendment would not be in keeping with the fundamental principle of this bill and for reasons i shall explain would be likely to require radical alteration to the financial arrangements for water fluoridation in a manner which would i believe be unsatisfactory for the water industry <e>", "<cs> first of all in answer to my noble friend lord nugent on the question of indemnity it would be very difficult to draft the bill to allow for variation in the arrangements which were mutually desired by the government and the water industry for instance change to indemnity and payment arrangements <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter hit the nail on the head when he talked about undermining the situation for the water authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may end this private argument before it moves any further away from the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> with regard to the toothpaste point that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter raised it is too late by the time they are using toothpaste <e>", "<cs> in immediate answer to the noble lord lord moyne i wish to say

friend sits down perhaps i may add a further comment <e> <s> although i realise that people hold pretty entrenched positions over this matter has it occurred to my noble friend that every time a county or district council changes its political complexion or every time a vast body of councillors changes at election time great expense will be incurred due to this stop-go possibility <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord is not quite correct because what has replaced it still contains the same measures <e>", "<cs> i believe that i ought to apologise to the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> the information that i was given originally was not correct <e> <s> this amendment seeks to leave out words which are already left out <e> <s> i fear that my noble friend lord kinnoull ought to discuss these matters when we reach amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it is when we reach amendment no <e> <s> that my noble friend should make his points <e> <s> i am very sorry <e>", "<cs> yes it is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord sandys for moving this amendment in as much as it gives me the opportunity to clarify again a misunderstanding which may have arisen as to the manpower implications of the bill and as to the purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend suggesting that one man is going to rush round the country with tonnes <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will explain what he means <e>", "<cs> no not with modern machinery but as i have already said this must be a judgment for the water undertakers <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady gardner of parkes knows perfectly well that i am not a financial genius but i am grateful for her intervention <e> <s> fluoridation schemes currently cost an average of to install <e> <s> full coverage of the united kingdom

circumstances as i am sure my noble friend would agree <e> <s> incidentally to return to the manpower issue the manpower used in transporting fluoride is private not public sector manpower <e>", "<cs> once again i recognise that this amendment reflects the views of those who feel strongly that fluoridation should not be introduced unless it has the agreement of locally elected representatives <e>", "<cs> of course i have listened with enormous care and respect to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> we have already been through this argument this evening <e> <s> i cannot take the matter back <e>

local councils certainly have a duty to monitor the wholesomeness of the water supply <e> <s> that is a function which they carry out irrespective of whether or not the water supply is fluoridated <e>

wish to make and i have no intention of getting up again after this whatever anyone may say <e>", "<cs> absolutely all the way except as regards fluoridation <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether noble lords think that we are now going through what i might call acts and having dealt with act <e> <s> it may be that your lordships have made up your minds and that we could do something about this situation <e> <s> perhaps the amendment could be taken back or action could be taken on it and then we can move on <e>", "<cs> i urge my noble friends and noble lords opposite or wherever they may be not to allow this clause to be incorporated in the bill <e> <s> we have already agreed to place a duty on health authorities to undertake general public consultations prior to taking a decision on fluoridation <e> <s> however we see no reason to allow bodies without any direct responsibility for fluoridation to have a veto <e> <s> the government do not believe that decisions on fluoridation should rest in the final analysis with bodies other than those who have the statutory responsibilities for carrying out the functions inherent in fluoridation <e>", "<cs> always with a smile but i am sorry to tell my noble friend that i would ask the committee to reject this new clause <e> <s> i would say at the outset that this is not because i do not have any sympathy with its basic purpose <e>

alternative practitioners would do well to consult their family doctors and to find out whether the practitioner concerned is a member of a well-established group with professional standards <e> <s>

these make administrative sense <e> <s> family credits is an example of this <e> <s> the possibilities opened up by computerisation of the two systems are also being looked at and further ideas will be put forward in the green paper on personal income tax later this year <e>", "<cs> with regard to the second point i think i am right in saying that the younger woman with children will get protection but if she has no children she will not get the same protection as the older woman because she can go out and get a job <e> <s> that is the principle of it <e> <s> in reply to the noble baronesss first question the one-parent family benefit is to continue to aid one-parent families <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be for the usual channels to decide when there would or would not be a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have to wait and see <e> <s> the cookie has not crumbled the yeast is rising <e> <s> with regard to the first question that the noble lord asked me the

up-ratings that will be a matter for consideration at the time and priority will be given to more money for low-income families through the family credit arrangements which i have already referred to in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord roberthall who i hope has practically finished this sort of baking session on a very happy note <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take separately the three points that have been made by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> with regard to his first question about the pensions act we made clear at the time our reservation about pay-as-you-go schemes which are a blank cheque drawn on the future <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state warned specifically that the financing of serps could become extremely onerous if the assumptions in the governments actuarial paper at the time changed <e> <s> they have done so and it was only right in the light of experience since then that my right honourable friend should look again at the state earnings-related pension scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may <e> <s> i will remind your lordships of what the prime minister said in that there were no plans to change the pension <e> <s> i think i have her words correctly <e> <s> that was true and had we had any specific plans at that stage for changing the pension structure there would have been no point in setting up the inquiry <e> <s> we did so against the background of public concern on a number of aspects of pension provision and not only in regard to serps <e> <s> it was in the light of detailed evidence and discussions during the inquiry that it became clear that radical change was needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend and i will see that her point is passed on as part of the consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene very rudely to say that that was in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite an afternoon full of variety and interest and we have had a very thoughtful and constructive debate on this bill <e> <s> i shall do my best to respond to the points that have been made and to reply to the questions that have been asked <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the purpose behind this amendment and admire the ingenuity of its drafting <e> <s> yet i have to say that it is not acceptable to the government <e> <s> if the amendment were carried then the bill would interfere with what is now quite ethical and legitimate surgery <e> <s> the medical advice available to me is that there are some operations that can be judged to be clinically necessary for a patients mental health that are neither minor nor cosmetic even by generous interpretations of those terms <e> <s> it would be quite unacceptable for this bill to interfere with the patients right to have that type of operation even if it is judged to be clinically necessary for her <e>", "<cs> it is not my bill <e>", "<cs> i agree <e>", "<cs> no i was going to say that it is very difficult for the government when at second reading two organisations are said to be asking for help and now three organisations are asking <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why it would be premature to say how help could be given if it is given <e>", "<cs> once again i have been challenged <e> <s> we are discussing this particular amendment <e> <s> i have no intention of giving reassurances to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> once again i have been challenged <e> <s> the last time i spoke i said that the noble lord lord richardson with great authority and medical knowledge answered various questions far better than i that is the only mention i made of the noble lord lord richardson and i was most interested to hear his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the words of praise given by the noble lord lord hunter <e> <s> in order to reassure people the terms of reference of the review were that it was done as part of its normal accountability responsibilities towards non-departmental public bodies <e> <s> the dhss commissioned a comprehensive review of the phls with the following terms of reference to review the effective efficient and economic operation of the phls including its functions and its most appropriate organisation and staffing in terms of numbers grades and manpower costs <e> <s> but it was not a money-saving exercise <e>", "<cs> i think i have already reiterated the original expressions of congratulation to the service in my reply to the noble lord lord hunter <e> <s> if the noble lord would care to look at my original reply he will find the answer to the other part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said no decisions are being taken until the consultations are complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised at the question put by the noble lord lord ennals because i have already said that no decisions will be taken until consultation is complete <e>", "<cs> my lords questions as i have already said relating to the implementation of the report are hypothetical and should not be prejudged <e> <s> however we can see no reason why any of the reports proposals need adversely affect the ability of the public health laboratory service to act effectively in any future outbreaks <e> <s> i would also say that there is no question of dismantling the service <e>", "<cs> my lords the report does not make any recommendations for changing the relationship between the public health laboratory service the national health service and the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely sure of the mechanism for this but i would prefer the noble lord not to withdraw his amendment but rather that he should put the matter to the test <e> <s> it was discussed in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords to borrow from a remark of the noble lord lord houghton if ever there was a steamroller to crack a nut then this is it <e> <s> this new clause would impose upon health authorities a requirement which is as cumbersome as it is unnecessary <e> <s> health authorities under the bill as it is currently drafted will remain free to reconsider their policy on fluoridation at any time <e> <s> i cannot see what can possibly be gained by obliging a health authority to do this every five years from the time of making or withdrawing an application for fluoridation <e> <s> indeed this could lead to quite ridiculous results <e> <s> for example if health authority a requested water fluoridation from water authority b and then withdrew its application having been told by b that it was technically impracticable in that area then under the noble lords amendment health authority a would nevertheless have to review fluoridation every five years until eternity <e> <s> this cannot be regarded as sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to shifts in public opinion evidence on this can be presented at any time to health authorities <e> <s> in particular the community health councils which parliament has established to represent consumer opinion on the health service are free to make representations at any time <e> <s> that said fluoridation to be fully effective requires that children drink fluoridated water for the whole period of tooth formation from birth to the age of years <e> <s> it is simply wasting health service money to seek to operate fluoridation on other than a long-term basis <e> <s> hence i do not see why minimal and transitory shifts in public opinion whether for or against fluoridation should be regarded as justification for operating a stop-go policy every five years <e> <s> fluoridation should be regarded as a long-term investment and there should be very strong grounds for any decision to withdraw from fluoridation once it has been initiated <e> <s> in the governments view this amendment is fundamentally misconceived and would serve no useful purpose <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will be withdrawn but if not i must ask your lordships to reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sat down and the noble lord is not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask my noble friends and noble lords opposite to reject this new clause <e> <s> i have to say that i think it is completely unnecessary to place this statutory obligation upon health authorities <e> <s> under the governments own new clause on consultation the health authoritys plans for fluoridation will be fully publicised in newspapers and indeed many health authorities may choose to take that opportunity to inform the general public when and where their decision is finally to be taken <e> <s> moreover i understand that it is a common practice for health authorities to make their meeting agendas and venues available to the local press as well as to interested bodies such as community health councils health service trade unions and local councils <e> <s> local interest in fluoridation will certainly be reflected in the press which may be relied upon to publicise the matter widely and to report the outcome of health authority discussions on the issue <e>", "<cs> i am allowed to speak again i think and if i am wrong i apologise but i believe that the noble lord has not understood what i said <e> <s> may i just say again that under the governments own new clause on consultation the health authorities plans for fluoridation will be fully publicised in the newspapers and i went on <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that the most speed could be gained if the matter were put to the test <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful and i think the house would be grateful if the noble lord could get to the end of his remarkable speech <e>", "<cs> my lords he has moved it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships still have a sense of humour at this time of night because i am afraid that i have to start with an apology <e> <s> it is most extraordinary that when i was going through all my notes and words of so-called wisdom i noticed a mistake in the typing <e> <s> it was i thought taken out but in the stress of combat this evening it went in <e> <s> it is ridiculous and i not only have to put <e>", "<cs> my lords i must stress that the words in subsection of our new clause on consultation which this amendment seeks to delete have been inserted for a specific purpose <e> <s> that purpose is to ensure that health authorities are free to judge the representations made to them on their merits and not simply according to the volume of voices in favour of a particular standpoint whether for or against fluoridation <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to say that i welcome in principle the amendment of the noble lord lord houghton in relation to the proposals on consultation and publicity which are very similar to my own proposals although i hope to persuade the noble lord to withdraw his new clause in favour of mine <e> <s> i should like to put on record my personal satisfaction that it has been possible to achieve so much common ground be it never so late <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise that i took the clause on publicity with the clause on consultation so i have already spoken to that <e> <s> this gives me the opportunity to answer my noble friend who asked me why the scottish health boards are not required to consult their local councils <e> <s> the purpose of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has had his chips <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question the survey carried out by the college of occupational therapists of the number of vacant posts health authorities were prepared to fund indicated the shortfall of per cent <e> <s> however officials have experienced difficulties in validating these data <e> <s> results of the sample survey carried out by the nhs suggested the per cent <e> <s> figure which i have already given <e> <s> her majestys government recognise the key role that occupational therapists play and will increasingly play in the future particularly in furthering policies for the treatment and care of the mentally ill and other handicapped people <e>", "<cs> my lords there are occupational therapy schools and some places <e> <s> some bursaries are provided and some students receive sponsorship from health authorities or local authorities <e> <s> the remainder are self-financing <e> <s> i hope that answers the noble baronesss point <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness please repeat the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much <e> <s> i do not have the answer to that <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the estimated average size of the in-patient waiting list in england for may to may was <e> <s> over the period the actual number waiting on lists rose to at th march <e> <s> the estimated average for the period may to september was <e>", "<cs> my lords the higher average recent figure arises from two causes first the all-time high figure for waiting lists that we inherited from the previous labour government and secondly the sharp increase caused by the industrial action in which the labour party supported <e> <s> under this government waiting lists are falling <e> <s> under the last labour government they rose by almost a quarter of a million <e>", "<cs> my lords on th september there were some people on in-patient waiting lists for all specialties which is almost fewer than at march <e> <s> this shows that there is a continuing downward trend following as i said the disruption caused by the industrial action which was backed by the labour party <e> <s> during the period of industrial action between march and december the total increased by more than <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of my noble friends question is that to some extent waiting lists including those in rural areas represent the problems of success <e> <s> the wider range of treatments available greater life expectancy and the increasing proportion of old people have all added to expectations and thus demands on the national health service <e> <s> however we all want shorter waiting lists and that is why the government have concentrated the attention of health authorities upon the need to make the best possible use of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot answer about particular hospitals in the framework of this question <e> <s> but with regard to available beds in there were some available beds in the acute sector and this compared with just under in <e> <s> the fact that the national health service has been able to treat extra cases in fewer beds is a sign of greater efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords i beliese that i have already given the answer that the waiting lists have gone down since we took office as opposed to the situation when the labour party was in office when the figures went up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble countess for what she has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have already answered the question put by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baroness it is always open to a general practitioner to seek to refer a patient to a hospital which may be able to treat the patient sooner <e> <s> the department is funding a pilot scheme in the west midlands to give general practitioners more information about waiting lists at more distant hospitals <e> <s> we hope that this will establish the value of this approach in providing more equal access to hospital services across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the numbers are going down <e> <s> but i have no figures for after september when the number was <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that beds have been approved for permanent closure and new beds have been provided in major schemes which does not take account of the smaller ones <e> <s> the fact that beds have closed is not the point it is the number of patients who are treated <e> <s> for example in the acute sector as i said earlier this week more cases were treated in than in though fewer beds were available <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no truth in that <e> <s> health service expenditure has increased by about per cent <e> <s> over and above general inflation since <e> <s> no closure is approved by ministers purely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for most of the remarks made by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> the only figure i am able to give him is that in england in the average daily number of national health service beds available was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> up to march of this year major hospital schemes had been completed and nine more are expected to be completed this year <e> <s> in addition many smaller schemes have been completed for which we do not collect centrally information on the number of beds involved <e> <s> i have to add that i cannot personally be responsible for whether the beds are in use or are empty <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to regional variations i would point out that there are many factors that lead to variations in the number of available beds in different health service regions <e> <s> largely these are historical but they also include the use made of day care community care efficiency in bed use differences in population profile or differences in patterns of referral <e>", "<cs> my lords between may and march of this year hospitals have been approved for closure under this government <e> <s> this compares with under the previous labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that mentally disordered people should be able to lead as normal a life as possible <e> <s> that can in most cases be best achieved if they can live at home or in homes which are part of the general community <e> <s> even when continuous health care is needed it can often be provided in a small local nhs unit rather than in a large hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would care to write to me on that matter i should be delighted to give him an answer <e>", "<cs> no my lords i certainly do not accept that <e> <s> we have more doctors and nurses now than there were under a labour government <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the closures are necessary because of the need to replace outdated <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little outside the question but i know that if it is their wish wherever possible women are treated by women <e>", "<cs> my lords yes yes yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot answer that question because it would be a matter for my right honourable friend to decide this <e> <s> however it is envisaged that million will be saved <e>", "<cs> my lords it is envisaged that the committee would meet once a month at the beginning and less frequently as needs declined <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble countess the annual conference of local medical committees has rejected the concept of a local appeal mechanism as has the british medical association <e> <s> clearly doctors do not think such a mechanism essential for the wellbeing of their patients which would be the only justification for introducing an appeal mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords i must just say how much i agree with the wise words spoken by the noble lord lord mcnair the noble lord lord coleraine and the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> i can well understand the purpose of this amendment which avoids the need to refer to custom or ritual <e> <s> but i have to say as the noble lord lord hatch himself said would in fact be said that it is very vague and would not be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords on the other hand the courts could decide that this anxiety about the acceptability of appearance to others was a medical factor <e> <s> in that case this amendment would make legal female circumcision in circumstances where it is not legal now <e> <s> that too is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully accept that this bill of itself will not eradicate female circumcision <e> <s> it is a part albeit a necessary part of the wider campaign that includes education and counselling <e> <s> that education is happening now <e> <s> it does not await the passage of the bill although we all hope that it will be greatly assisted by it <e> <s> we must do what we can to help this wider campaign and here i agree with the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i know that officials in the department are having meetings with organisations in this field of interest to see what can be done to help them <e> <s> it would be of no assistance to those organisations or to anyone else to delay this clarification of the law <e> <s> if delay encouraged anyone to perform female circumcision then it would do a great disservice <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord ennals could have made that point in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not lonely <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do so gladly <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a long on occasions it has seemed very long and interesting debate <e> <s> the contributions of those whom perhaps i could name collectively as a modesty of maidens fulfilled all the traditions of this house <e> <s> they displayed eloquence brevity and charm <e> <s> but did i detect the slightest evidence of iron hands in velvet gloves <e> <s> i should like to join with those who have offered their congratulations and to say that perhaps if the gloves come off i would rather be in a neutral corner <e>", "<cs> no my lords i will not give way <e> <s> time is much too pressing <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard raised a number of detailed points concerning housing benefit <e> <s> he will forgive me if i write to him and do not go into them now <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth was concerned that new pension arrangements will be too complex for small employers <e> <s> the new norm for occupational schemes is much simpler than the present contracting-out arrangements <e> <s> making personal pensions easy to handle is a priority in our discussions with employers and the pension industry representatives <e>", "<cs> it was not a joke <e>", "<cs> my lords i see on my brief that i am meant to thank the noble lord lord harris of high cross for bringing this debate before your lordships <e> <s> of course i do so unreservedly <e> <s> let me make the position quite plain <e> <s> some noble lords detect an inconsistency between our proposals for the pharmacists contracts and our policy elsewhere on deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to wait for me to make my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not intend to play big brother with regard to private enterprises <e> <s> contributors to this debate have suggested that the market could safely be left to take care of such matters as the number of nhs pharmacies and no regulation of any kind was necessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris knows that i am sympathetic to that point of view myself <e> <s> but a free market in the true sense is not operating here and so the comparison is not valid <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise that guys is a centre of excellence <e> <s> it is not our policy to interfere with regional health authorities but in relation to the staff savings the dha plans to save the posts in guys acute unit in <e> <s> the vast majority of savings in regard to these posts will come from cost improvements in support services <e> <s> many posts should be saved by a freeze on recruitment and from voluntary redundancies but compulsory redundancies cannot be ruled out <e>", "<cs> my lords the lewisham and north southwark health authority is as the noble lord will be aware considering rescinding its policy of making no compulsory redundancies <e> <s> the measures it will have to take to recoup unplanned overspending in the past two financial years will involve staff savings which cannot be guaranteed to be met entirely by voluntary redundancies <e>", "<cs> my lords decisions on the opening and closing of pharmacies are not for the government <e> <s> we wish to ensure a more cost-effective service for the taxpayer and a better nhs service for the patient <e> <s> the new contract will achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am amazed at the noble lord lord ennals asking all these questions when last

prefer to be known as pharmacists <e>", "<cs> following comments made in another place we consulted the main pensions interests about the effect of reducing the five-year qualifying period but we decided that we should not make any change in the bill <e> <s> any change would increase the administrative costs of schemes which would have to provide a greater number of comparatively small pensions <e> <s> what it means is that when the provision comes into force schemes will have to preserve benefits for anyone with five years service irrespective of their age <e> <s> this is a small but i believe a worthwhile change <e> <s> if the qualifying period was reduced to three years the number of preserved pensions would increase by something like a quarter <e> <s> removing the qualifying period altogether could double the number of preserved pensions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord to speak up because it is terribly hard to hear him <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord swann is just old enough to know what i mean when i say that i feel in his yes minister syndrome just like mrs mopp can i do you now <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mottistone said

lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister for social security on board and lodging payments under the supplementary benefits scheme <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for a kind of half-hearted welcome to these new proposals <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble baroness lady jeger did not see fit to be gracious about the fact that we had speedily recognised as we said we would that there was a need for greater flexibility <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger asked what happened to people while appeals were being heard <e> <s> the situation is exactly the same with any appeal against a benefit decision <e> <s> there are no provisions for changing an adjudication officers decision on entitlement until new facts are known or until an appeal tribunal overturns that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor

children with parents <e> <s> if i am wrong i apologise to the house in advance and i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is not entirely correct <e> <s> of course unemployment comes into the picture but there is also the question of population movements and where these young people are finding it most attractive to go regardless of work opportunities <e> <s> it is definitely wrong that young people should be occupying accommodation which they would not be able to afford if they were in work and which other people who are in work cannot afford <e>", "<cs> my lords i am lucky enough to be able now to correct myself in what i said in answer to the question of the noble lord lord banks about foster-children <e> <s> they are not covered under the specific change to the exemptions but that is one group we may well want to cover by the use of my right honourable friends discretionary powers <e> <s> i am sorry if i misled the house earlier

effects of the married womens half test from nd december <e>", "<cs> i regret that i must disappoint the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to fix the amount which the wife of a retired pensioner or invalidity pensioner may earn and still keep the dependancy increase at an amount even higher than it is now this at a time when one of the reasons for changing the provision is that it does not provide a realistic measure of dependancy <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer both noble lords together <e> <s> as has been explained the amendment would abolish the middle and lower rates of statutory sick pay with the result that all employees would receive the top rate when sick no matter what their normal earnings <e> <s> the middle and lower rates of ssp which this amendment seeks to abolish were introduced in order to preserve an incentive to return to work <e> <s> this is important <e> <s> it is still open to employers to pay more to their employees if they choose and many of course do so under their own occupational sick pay schemes <e> <s> but it would be wrong to compel employers to pay ssp at rates closely approaching or exceeding normal earnings <e>", "<cs> i shall ask your lordships to resist all the words of the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> as your lordships know clause extends the duration of statutory sick pay from eight to weeks <e> <s> as some doubt has been expressed about the advantages of the ssp scheme and the wisdom of extending it i should perhaps say a few words about this <e> <s> the move to weeks liability is not as considerable as it may at first appear <e> <s> employers are already dealing with nearly per cent <e> <s> of short-term sickness spells <e> <s> the average length of a spell of sickness is about days <e> <s> only about per cent <e> <s> of sickness lasts longer than eight weeks <e> <s> of those spells around half last no longer than weeks <e> <s> we do not therefore expect the ongoing administration costs of extension to be large <e> <s> i would however stress that we are very conscious of the need to keep procedures as simple and flexible as possible <e> <s> this is certainly our aim <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will remember that we looked at this at second reading and i have to tell him that i am not persuaded by his arguments <e> <s> this whole subject was looked at in depth by the occupational pensions board and they came up with a per cent <e> <s> ceiling <e> <s> we think that is about right <e> <s> we have been criticised for being too generous to the early leaver and criticised also for not being generous enough <e> <s> so we find ourselves in the middle <e> <s> that as much as anything leads me to believe that per cent <e> <s> is a fair and reasonable ceiling <e>", "<cs> may i say that the noble lord lord banks is quite right in what he said <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady turner who leads me into answering my noble friend when i say that we believe that early leavers are in a different position from stayers <e> <s> once somebody has left early there is no one to fight for his interests <e> <s> that is why we believe that early leavers have been given such a poor deal in the past <e> <s> they have in effect been subsidising the benefits of stayers and that is unfair <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment i hope i can make some remarks that apply equally to other amendments that have been put down by noble lords to the new section c <e> <s> i refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i have nothing further to add <e> <s> i have already given my reasons for asking the noble lord whether he would kindly not press these amendments <e>", "<cs> i listened with enormous interest to what the noble lord lord swann said <e> <s> he is i know chairman of the company pensions information centre and therefore brings all their expertise to bear as well as his own <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by saying that there is nothing in the bill to prevent revaluation applying to people who leave on or after th april <e> <s> the starting date for these provisions will depend upon a commencement order <e> <s> but the government have said that they intend to bring these provisions into effect on st january and that is still our intention <e> <s> i agree that there is some attraction in linking increases to tax years because that is how increases in guaranteed minimum pensions are calculated <e> <s> but equally there is no compelling reason why increases to benefits in excess of gmp should be treated in the same way and using tax years has a positive disadvantage <e>", "<cs> i am so grateful to the noble lord lord banks for bringing forward these amendments <e> <s> we think that the bill as drafted may well have the desired effect but i agree that it makes sense to put this beyond doubt <e> <s> the government are therefore pleased to be able to accept the amendments <e>", "<cs> before i answer my noble friend i cannot resist a little tit for tat <e> <s> last wednesday i endured the taunts from the noble baroness about the absence of people from my benches <e> <s> i have to say that i outnumber her representation this evening <e> <s> it may not be great but it is a damned sight better than on her side <e>", "<cs> yes i totally take the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> he must remember that the bill has flexibility for requiring any kind of register <e> <s> i cannot really say whether i shall be in a position to put down an amendment at report stage <e> <s> however when i am writing to him on the first point i shall include the information he has asked for and if the noble baroness wishes to see a copy of the letter it will be in the library but i shall see that the noble baroness and perhaps the noble lord lord banks have copies of any such letter containing that information <e> <s> we shall then have to take the matter from there <e>", "<cs> the point is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> i must say my lords that i have had my doubts about the noble lords carryings on during the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords no i really do not think i would <e> <s> the whole point is that the argument went on and on over every small matter concerned with this bill when all we really wanted was a straight bill to outlaw female circumcision <e> <s> i stand to be open to correction but it seemed to me that noble lords from the alliance benches had got themselves into such an infernal mess over their ideas of having a time-lag changing clause that they were really risking the bill <e> <s> it seemed to me that their obsession with changing the wording had overcome their desire for the actual bill <e> <s> if i am wrong i am sorry but that is my own personal feeling <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords between st april and st march sales of surplus national health service land and property in england amounted to some acres realising million <e> <s> there is much to be done but we are generally satisfied with the progress being made <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right the money will go to the appropriate health authority <e> <s> with regard to the efficient management of the estate we are making increasing efforts to improve this <e> <s> a computerised management information system is being developed to present all managers with data needed for cost-effective management of the estate <e> <s> this system is the first of its kind in the world and has already been adopted by the majority of health authorities as well as being sold here and overseas for both commercial and health work <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend the proceeds do go to the appropriate health authority so presumably the million has been received between the appropriate health authorities <e> <s> receipts from the disposal of hospitals for the mentally ill or the mentally handicapped are used to develop new services consistent with our policy of care in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly not <e> <s> we are talking about the disposal of surplus property <e> <s> there is evidence that as the delivery of health care changes for instance the progressive rundown of large psychiatric institutions much surplus property can be identified <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes one sometimes the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had already answered the latter part of that question but with regard to particular instances i cannot answer <e> <s> if the noble lord has any particular instance in mind perhaps he will let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords i should love to answer that in french <e> <s> our policy nationally is based on the principle that receipts from the disposal of surplus property should return to the district health authority involved where they can be used to improve or expand existing services or to initiate new developments but sometimes the receipts will go appropriately to the regional health authority as opposed to the district health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends whether the sale of property and the proceeds come within the appropriate scope of a district health authority or a regional health authority <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information immediately available to give the noble lord an answer on that point <e> <s> the noble lord may wish to raise the matter with the regional chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell my noble friend that the government consider that this amendment really is unnecessary because in the wholly hypothetical event that fluoridation were found to be unsafe the secretary of state already has the power to direct health authorities to terminate their fluoridation schemes and to withdraw the indemnity to statutory water undertakers <e> <s> no additional statutory power is required <e> <s> however i stress yet again that the government are convinced that fluoridation is an entirely safe procedure and that the amendment is unjustified to the extent that it seeks to suggest to the contrary <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that more research has been carried out on fluoridation than on any other public health measure <e> <s> most of the evidence on this matter comes from detailed surveys of the health of communities which have been drinking either water with a natural fluoride content of around one part per million or artificially fluoridated water at this level for many decades <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying to this amendment i should like to make it clear at the outset that the government already accept that they have a duty to keep under review all the relevant medical and scientific evidence on the effects of fluoridation <e> <s> this has been the position of successive governments in this country since the s when fluoridation was first considered and then introduced <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton is quite right <e> <s> there is no statutory obligation for water authorities to accept applications for fluoridation from a health authority <e> <s> however the secretary of state already has a clear obligation to monitor the safety of any public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely delighted to repeat what i said for the benefit of the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> i said that the dhss will also undertake in the guidance that is to be issued to health authorities following enactment of this bill to bring to their attention any significant new developments regarding the safety and efficacy of fluoridation and we shall of course ensure that parliament is also made aware of these <e> <s> i would add that studies of fluoridation commissioned by the department are published and will continue to be published <e> <s> anything of interest would naturally be taken up by the press <e> <s> i hope that that answers the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord burton has raised with this amendment a point that we have not discussed in detail before as he said and i welcome the opportunity to do so now <e> <s> am equally grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for his helpful remarks <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble viscount lord monckton of brenchley who looks so incredibly well that i feel that he must live in a fluoridated area <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ennals is precisely the same as was moved and discussed quite extensively at <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility has existed before the bill <e> <s> the responsibility is there <e>", "<cs> my lords on the water authority not the local authority <e> <s> i will repeat what i have just said <e> <s> moreover as i pointed out in our last debate it should be pointed out that the cost of fluoridation is borne by the water authority i am sorry <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i want to get on <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am <e> <s> as the noble lord will know in scotland the local authority is the water authority <e> <s> i must repeat this once again <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to say this <e> <s> he was kind enough to give way <e> <s> all the financial expenses come under the health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords no it comes under the health service act <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down may i just say that the governments concern is that final decisions on fluoridation should be taken by those bodies which are qualified to do so and which will have responsibility for implementing the decisions <e> <s> the question of whether or not these bodies are elected is immaterial <e> <s> indeed in scotland the final decision on fluoridation will be taken by elected bodies as the water authorities there are the regional islands councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that i do not go to an undertaker if i want a loaf of bread <e>", "<cs> impudent <e>", "<cs> my lords we have debated this amendment before at report stage and nothing that has been said by any noble lord has changed the view of the government <e> <s> i would reiterate that the words in subsection of the clause on consultation have been inserted for a particular purpose <e> <s> that purpose is the very important one of ensuring that health authorities remain free to judge on their merits all the representations made to them and can exercise a proper discretion in weighing up the various arguments that will be put to them <e> <s> we particularly seek to avoid that health authorities should have to judge the issue purely on the volume of voices in favour of a particular standpoint whether for or against fluoridation <e> <s> we believe that this would be a very serious limitation on the exercise of their statutory responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already stated what the scots have <e> <s> the local councillors there are particularly appointed <e> <s> my noble friend will correct me if i am wrong because he is a scotsman and a former minister and knows better than i but my understanding is that the local councils who make up the water authorities are therefore experts at the job <e> <s> i shall give way <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am continuing <e> <s> the views of local authorities will represent an important test of public opinion but they will not be the only such test as health authorities will also have to consider the views of community health councils which have been appointed by parliament to represent consumer opinion in health service matters as well as the results of local representations by other local bodies and individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already debated during earlier stages of the bill the relative efficacy of fluoridated milk as opposed to fluoridated water <e> <s> as my noble friend lord campbell of croy has already pointed out fluoridated milk has the great disadvantage that it does not reach the recipients at an <e>", "<cs> to allow fluoridated milk to qualify for subsidy <e> <s> i hope i am correct on that point <e> <s> the noble lord will know already that all the european community has done is to allow fluoridated flavoured uht milk to qualify for the same subsidy as similar non-fluoridated milk <e> <s> this hardly constitutes positive promotion of fluoridated milk <e> <s> the governments position is simply that while fluoridated milk can certainly be of value in reducing tooth decay it does not have the same demonstrated potential for improving the health of local communities as fluoridation of the water supply has <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the government are unable to discern any merits in this amendment and i would suggest that the movers withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay tribute both to those who have supported the bill from all sides of this house and indeed to our opponents for the very high standard of debate we have enjoyed <e> <s> it has been let me remind you a free vote throughout <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord banks asked why new section c is restricted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock has been a member of this house much longer than i have <e> <s> however it seems to me that even in the short time that i have been here i have heard more arguments on may and shall than on any other subject <e> <s> i hope that i can answer the whole question that the noble lord has put before me very <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> i am my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that this has been a most courteous civilised good-tempered passage of a bill through your lordships house until i heard the purple prose of the noble baroness lady jeger but i shall not rise to that bait because i still believe that we have had some extremely useful and interesting discussions on this bill <e> <s> we have made amendments which i believe have improved it <e>", "<cs> my lords the wide-ranging nature of the noble lords supplementary question is such that it would take a number of government departments a great deal of time at quite disproportionate cost even to attempt the kind of comprehensiveness invited <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the remarks of my noble friend lord renton with which i entirely agree <e> <s> he may be interested to know that the royal commission on the national health service took three years to complete its work at a cost of at todays prices <e> <s> that was only one part of the welfare state <e> <s> i leave it to your lordships to hazard a guess as to how much longer it would take and how much more it would cost for a commission on the whole of the welfare state <e>", "<cs> my lords not only has there been a massive increase in spending on the health service on personal social services and on social security during the present governments tenure but we have also undertaken radical reviews of many aspects of the welfare state in our search to improve services and attain better care and greater benefits for people <e> <s> we have a record of which we are proud and to which the opposition have no parallel <e>", "<cs> my lords arrangements already exist for the safe disposal of clinical waste from hospitals and in some areas from general dental practices by incineration <e> <s> the departments guidance however requires that all sharps from general dental practices should be disposed of in suitable puncture-proof containers specifically designed for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the conservative party has always welcomed competition <e> <s> with regard to bottles which are rather wide of the question i am sure that the idea that they be refilled regardless of what they may have contained would strike noble lords as a bad one <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord ennals i am not sure about legislation <e> <s> general dental practitioners are required by their terms of service to provide their surgeries with suitable equipment <e> <s> the departments dental reference officer will draw the attention of the dentist to inadequate sterilisation equipment for example if the officer observes such in use during a visit to a surgery <e> <s> officials will discuss with the appropriate professional dental bodies what action should be taken <e> <s> one will always have goodies and one will always have baddies i fear <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course ensure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state learns of the noble lords comments <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that the dentist is as much at risk as the patient <e> <s> it is therefore in the dentists own interest to make sure that everything is hygienic <e>", "<cs> my lords i expect that that is in the eye of the beholder <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft supplementary benefit requirements amendment regulations laid before your lordships house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble baroness in this good-humoured moment by quoting once again the noble lord lord shinwell <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all those who have taken part in this short debate and i shall endeavour to answer as many questions as possible <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger asked what action is being taken to ensure that the people who need to be exempt from time limits are covered <e> <s> as i have already indicated i believe that most vulnerable cases should be covered by the exemption categories <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the statements made by the noble baroness <e> <s> the working party was set up in order that a decision could be reached as soon as possible <e> <s> the question of any closures is a matter for local health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to funding each option for a screening service has implications as the noble lord will know for national health service manpower and financing <e> <s> we cannot decide what resources health authorities will need until the implications have been assessed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord the information i have and let us not split hairs is that women died from breast cancer in england and wales in <e> <s> i agree that a significant number of those deaths might have been avoided if cancer had been diagnosed sufficiently early <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt that is one of the matters which might be discussed by the working party <e>", "<cs> my lords i will see to it that my right honourable friend reads the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the previous studies in the united states produced conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of mammographic screening but the recent swedish study which i know the noble baroness is aware of has removed many of the doubts previously attached to the value of mammographic screening <e> <s> however it is right to ask leading united kingdom experts to confirm its scientific validity and that screening would be similarly effective in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the working party has taken evidence from a wide range of interests <e> <s> it has received more than pieces of written evidence from voluntary professional and other organisations concerned with the service and also from users individual doctors therapists and manufacturers <e> <s> a number of these have also given oral evidence <e> <s> the amount of consultation that has gone on is one of the reasons the report has taken time but we will consider whether further consultations are necessary when we have received the report <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baroness i am looking forward to visiting roehampton in the near future and i shall certainly take on board her remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the members of the working party are already aware of those facts but i shall see to it that they hear the words of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords question we will consider the question of publication when we have received the report <e> <s> in answer to his second question i am unable to comment until the report has been received <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for west lambeth health authority to devise a strategy for the future of these hospitals within resource assumptions set by south-east thames regional health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally reject the noble lords final remark <e> <s> with regard to st thomas hospital maintaining its role as a major international medical centre the answer is that yes it will <e> <s> the strategy of the west lambeth health authority is likely to involve rationalisation of local services and their concentration on

authority in the country has a statutory obligation to stay within its cash limit <e> <s> we believe that the current problems in that particular authority are a matter for managerial action by

sure that the noble lord lord cledwyn will agree that the subject of other hospitals is a little wide of todays question but i will certainly see that his suggestion is passed on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the regional health authority has agreed to provide some capital for the move of the phipps unit to st thomas hospital <e> <s> provided the district health authority produces a proper strategic plan and the patients association is able to meet its fund-raising target there is reason to be optimistic about the proposed move <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is not for me to answer this question of whether or not the big hospitals should be treated nationally <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord cledwyn i shall certainly pass on the remarks made on

lambeth health authority like other london districts is still over-provided with acute beds to meet the need of its declining population while its priority services need considerable improvements <e>

great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is a little wide of the original question but i thank the noble baroness for asking it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lady sharples for those supplementary questions <e> <s> in answer to the first one we wholeheartedly support the freedom of the individual to seek the benefits of alternative medicines and therapies <e> <s> it is not

benefit <e> <s> the noble lord conveniently overlooks the improvements we have made to the scheme <e> <s> for example on the introduction of the scheme we improved the tapers below the needs for

improvement p in the childs addition to the needs allowance <e> <s> we shall be improving it again this november by p <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall write to the noble lord on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken on this important matter <e> <s> i am glad to say that the answer to the first point raised by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway is a simple yes the amendment does what my noble friend requires <e> <s> as regards the first point of which my noble friend was good enough to give me notice my answer is no my lords <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in his reply to a debate on compensation for personal injuries initiated by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale on th may this year made it quite clear that the government do not accept the recommendations of the report of the pearson commission on this matter <e> <s> i do not think that i could usefully add to what my noble and learned friend said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord lord ennals that he was once my mp but for a very short time <e> <s> the need to save money in lewisham and north southwark district and in guys hospital in particular does not relate primarily to rawp reductions nor to the review body pay award but to an overspending in the last two financial years of million on multi-district services whose budgets are set by south-east thames regional health authority <e> <s> the problems have arisen because the district health authority refused to take action to keep spending on these services within cash limits and it now faces the difficult task of repaying the deficit by march <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her supplementary questions <e> <s> i cannot answer for the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> but in answer to one of her supplementaries the south-east thames regional health authoritys policies which we support are to move resources in line with the population movements of recent years <e> <s> districts like medway have been relatively deprived of local health services for many years and need extra revenue <e> <s> lewisham and north southwark health authority must reduce its acute beds in line with its future <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend special financial recognition is given to teaching hospitals within rawp <e> <s> the service increment for teaching is an allocation for the extra costs of medical teaching <e> <s> the specialised supraregional and multidistrict services often provided by teaching hospitals receive protection from the redistribution of resources through rawp <e> <s> rawp targets are adjusted for the costs of in-patients coming from outside the district <e>", "<cs> my lords although radical changes are now required because of the difficult problems that the dha has caused for itself by not taking earlier management action there is every reason to be confident about the future of guys hospital which at the end of the -year planning period will still be an bed hospital providing excellent facilities for patient care and teaching well into the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords final supplementary no <e> <s> in answer to his point about waiting lists the total waiting list for lewisham and north southwark district on st march was <e> <s> the district health authority has said that some doctors who have been opposed to what they regard as cuts have been over-zealous in identifying patients on waiting lists in order to inflate those figures

question on the order paper today <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for my right honourable friend but i feel sure that he abides by the wishes of the regional health authorities with regard to membership of the district health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not know why the noble lord lord ennals assumes anything like what he has just said from anything i have said <e> <s> i have said nothing about the total responsibility of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be highly inappropriate for me to discuss the reasons why a specific individual was or was not appointed general manager in a particular district health authority <e> <s> matters relating to the appointment of staff in the national health service are confidential and advice to health authorities on their appointment of certain individual candidates to the post of general manager is and should remain confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that

on the editorial advisory panel so i presume that from that he has no financial gain and i certainly did not imply otherwise <e> <s> i think that i have really answered the questions in so far as i am able in so far as this is a confidential matter and in so far as i believe that the noble lord must be going on hearsay and i wish him a very happy holiday <e>", "<cs> my lords of the district general

and in the light of this consideration is being given to strengthening our guidance on procedures and the need for further training <e> <s> thirdly a series of hygiene check lists is being introduced for use by both environmental health officers and staff in catering departments <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the minister for state for health has made it very clear that all evidence of unhygienic food handling and pest infestation will be dealt with urgently <e> <s> it would be wrong at this stage to reach the conclusion that lifting crown immunity is the only answer <e> <s> this

his notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger for the brevity of her <e>", "<cs> my lords mr justice mann clearly envisaged the possibility of amending regulations and

are now all tested <e> <s> as regards haemophiliacs all blood products for this purpose are now heat treated and therefore no haemophiliacs can be newly infected <e>", "<cs> my lords the blood which is now being given to patients is screened and is safe <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the many parts of the question put by the noble baroness i am aware of the splendid work done at the

necessary <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass the noble lords thoughts on to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the screening of blood procedure came in only last week so with any blood that was imported before the screening began there was an element of risk <e> <s> it is not actually blood but plasma which is imported because we are self-sufficient in blood <e> <s> the blood in this country now has no risk as i said <e> <s> the tests were started only last week so as from last week all blood is safe <e>", "<cs> my lords routine screening of all blood donations has been introduced as i said and all supplies of factor which is the blood clotting agent neeeded by haemophiliacs are heat treated which therefore makes them safe <e> <s> no blood coming into this country has any risk attached to it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made very clear and publicly the groups of people at high risk <e> <s> i can enumerate those or i can write to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that the house would probably prefer that i write <e> <s> we have also given money to the terrence higgins trust which is very active and very helpful in trying to put the word over to the high risk groups that they should not give blood <e>", "<cs> my lords a blood transfusion is made from whole blood <e> <s> plasma which is given to haemophiliacs is heat treated which thereby makes it safe <e> <s> i cannot answer whether stocks of blood from the past are being used which have any risk but i am assured that the risk of being infected by the aids virus through receiving a blood transfusion is now very remote indeed since routine screening of all donations started this month <e> <s> by that i feel it is implied that only routine screened blood will be used for donations <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the difference which lies between private catering and hospital catering under the crown immunity <e> <s> i can only repeat to the noble lord that local environmental health officers are welcome to visit hospitals at any time <e> <s> normally visits are made at yearly intervals when they find a problem they repeat the visit at two-to three-monthly intervals but i can go into what happens when they find something wrong if the noble lord so wishes

take place after the event and we are determined that such events simply will not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that there was no party politics in his question <e> <s> i too

no my lords i think that everybody should be equally hygienic <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have given all the information that is at my disposal this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that

permitted to reopen at midnight <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the fact that noble lords seemed to have had very little time they still managed to ask me a great number of questions <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady jeger said through the usual channels there will obviously be time for her to ask for further debate <e> <s> but it must be through the usual channels <e>

any lobby journalists yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness can have the answer anyway <e> <s> i will reply to her because i am quite anxious to get that point on the record <e> <s> we shall be aiming for flexibility in the operation of the budget so that local offices do not run out of money mid-year <e> <s> however it must be said that the idea of a budget is not new <e> <s> most

is not for me to comment on any possible debate and he will well understand that <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard gave a second reading speech i cannot actually work out how many minutes he spoke

consultant for usdaw <e> <s> plain curiosity prompts me to ask him whether he still is <e> <s> he is certainly a valiant champion for them to have on their side <e>", "<cs> may i remind the noble lord that the person who is working in a shop now is protected against working on sundays <e> <s> if she is working in a shop now she will go on being protected under the bill <e> <s> i also remind the noble lord that he should not just concentrate on married women because there are an awful lot of lonely single people <e>", "<cs> come on <e>", "<cs> my lords any manager worth his or her salt will of course want to involve key support staff in the fullest possible way <e> <s> within units the role of ward sisters will be absolutely crucial to good management and to patient satisfaction <e> <s>

closure of wards is a matter for the local health authorities <e> <s> they close them only in extreme cases and they take extreme care when they do <e>", "<cs> my lords on st march there were people

industrial action <e> <s> of course some per cent <e> <s> of all admissions to hospital are immediate and many of those on waiting lists already have a planned date of admission <e>", "<cs> my lords

lords how many more figures would the noble baroness like <e>", "<cs> my lords before i answer the noble lord perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady seear that i shall be delighted to send her

"<cs> my lords that position did not apply in this hospital <e> <s> we would have to find out the general situation in order to see how that applies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness

and always cared for the patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the point made by my noble friend lord auckland <e> <s> of course the government are taking into consideration all the issues arising from the report which include ventilation refrigeration making sure that cooked and uncooked food is not kept together making sure that raw poultry is not kept near meat and a great many other recommendations in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment crown immunity operates not only for hospitals but for prisons and indeed your lordships house <e> <s> all such places which come under

continuance of crown immunity <e> <s> i certainly do not know its origin any more than i know why no noble lord may die in the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a royal commission in which concluded that it would be inappropriate to use a national lottery to help fund services such as the national health service which have a statutory source of funding <e> <s> most speakers during the debate on the report were firmly against the idea of a national lottery because of the difficulties of control bureaucracy and especially because it would take money away from local voluntary effort

funds through lotteries and health authorities can benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remark with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords different social and cultural factors come into play in other countries which have national lotteries <e> <s> other countries treat these matters differently <e> <s> for instance they do not have any pools <e> <s> the government are not persuaded that there are sufficient net benefits to be gained from introducing legislation in this country <e> <s> i should also like to point out to my noble friend that it has not been established that in other countries the benefits from national lotteries are turned over to the health services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i prefer to ignore the latter part of the noble lords question <e> <s> even if the whole estimated yield from a national lottery which is estimated at under million a year were devoted to the national health service it would still be less than one-half of per cent <e> <s> of the cost of running the service <e> <s> furthermore there would be considerable problems in allocating what is in this field a comparatively small sum to provide any worthwhile addition to normal funding and with no guarantee of a steady income <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raised a great many questions <e> <s> i would add to what i have already said that there would be a considerable problem in allocating any money to provide a worthwhile addition to normal funding and that the major difficulty would be fluctuations year by year in the amounts raised which would cause great problems for

unit in every district there may be sufficient to care for the young people of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and the noble baroness lady seear said when moving and speaking to this amendment and to what other noble lords who have taken part in this debate have said <e> <s> i fully sympathise with the idea of a trial period because many shopworkers will naturally <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and before the noble lord withdraws or does not withdraw his amendment may i ask him two questions and point out one thing <e> <s> he is right that we spoke about the dangers to women last time round <e> <s> i always forget how young the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs is <e> <s> at that time i should have liked to say yes it was more dangerous then my lords there were bombs <e>", "<cs> there were bombs in the street my lords when women were working all night <e> <s> it was as dangerous in a different way as it is now <e> <s> by his own admissions the noble lord speaks for a minority <e> <s> he will correct me if i am wrong i am sure <e> <s> the majority of shop workers do not belong to a union i think he said <e> <s> they could if they wanted to so why do they not <e> <s> why should the noble lord and the noble lord lord jacques my old friend speak for people who do not belong to a union <e> <s> it would be very wearying for your lordships if i were to repeat the arguments that i have made before but i think perhaps your lordships should read them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have a list of amendments <e> <s> it will be very helpful from my point of view if the noble lord can tell me <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of the noble lord lord mccarthy is concerned with the remuneration of young workers in retail trades <e> <s> as such his amendment is really outside the scope of the bill which is presently under discussion <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is not in accord with the governments proposals which are set out in part ii of the wages bill <e> <s> the purpose of the wages bill is to simplify and reform the wages council system to reduce burdens on business and to promote employment particularly employment for young people <e> <s> the reforms are part of a broad strategy of deregulation designed to stimulate an environment in which job creation is more likely <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i just say that i am most grateful to the noble lord and i quite understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i just wish to confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the revised draft of schedule paragraph is omitted because we believe it is now obvious from the new paragraph that a shopworker who agrees to do shopwork on a sunday will not to that extent enjoy the rights in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> although we think paragraph is no longer necessary we have not altered the principle that shopworkers can waive their right by agreeing to work on sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on second reading and at committee stage the noble baroness lady seear put forward the proposals which she is raising again on this amendment <e> <s> her reason for so doing was that she believed it would encourage shops to employ part-time staff at weekends thereby encouraging more part-time jobs and providing an incentive for work-sharing <e> <s> i hope that my explanation will be helpful to the noble baroness <e> <s> although i applaud her sentiment as my noble friend lord glenarthur explained at committee stage we do not agree that this amendment would necessarily have the effect that the noble baroness intends <e> <s> more full-time employees may be encouraged to work on sundays and may not wish to give up this opportunity to part-time employees <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will hear me through <e> <s> i am very anxious to get this on the record which is why i am rattling along <e> <s> alternatively where health safety and welfare demand it that legislation should be replaced so that it applies equally to men and women <e> <s> not only are these restrictions discriminatory preventing women from having the same freedom of choice as their male counterparts but they are putting an unnecessary burden on employers and have little effect in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i think there is here a little bit of the pot calling the kettle black because we have had a rehearsal for the wages bill as well this evening <e> <s> we from our side did not laugh we listened with great courtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords there are vaccines available for groups a and c and they have been used with success abroad for example on british servicemen in nepal where this disease is prevalent <e> <s> unfortunately it has not yet been possible to produce a vaccine for the group b organism which occurs most frequently in this country <e>", "<cs> in this country my lords since annual notifications of meningococcal meningitis rose from about to in and subsequently fell to about in and in england and wales <e> <s> in they rose again to about <e> <s> in the past few years about per cent <e> <s> of laboratory isolations have been group b <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already expressed the governments full sympathy to the local committee from stroud who came to see me on this matter <e> <s> of course they have everybodys sympathy as regards this extraordinary incidence of the disease <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that there may have been some undernotification generally but that is not likely to occur in areas where the disease causes concern <e> <s> the communicable disease surveillance centre has it under constant surveillance both in respect of notifications to the office of population censuses and surveys and in respect of laboratory isolations of the causal organism <e> <s> all forms of acute meningitis are required to be notified under public health legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the latter part of the noble lords question no i do not think this has anything to do with the stanley royd report or outbreaks of food poisoning by salmonella <e> <s> this is quite a different kettle of fish <e> <s> in relation to the national notification rate for meningitis since there have been five similar outbreaks in anglesey plymouth devon as a whole bolton and monmouthshire <e> <s> i appreciate as i have said before the public concern and anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely sure what the noble lord is getting at <e> <s> if he is talking about research an enormous amount of research is going on throughout the world because this country is not the only place to have the disease <e> <s> all that information is freely shared <e> <s> if that is what he is talking about that is one thing <e> <s> apart from that i do not think that i have anything more to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking off the top of my head and i stand to be corrected but the outbreaks of the disease are in places as various as nepal parts of africa and parts of america so i should not have thought that the bird suggestion was possible <e> <s> but let me explain i am sorry to detain your lordships bacteria are more easily treated with antibiotics than are viruses <e> <s> if it is quickly identified antibiotics are usually successful in treating the bacterial causes of meningitis in this country where the meningococcal form is the one best known <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly shall pass on those words <e> <s> the medical officer for environmental health and his colleagues are meticulously investigating all patients reported to have meningitis together with their contacts and environment <e> <s> advice and assistance are being provided by the public health laboratory service and the communicable disease surveillance centre in an effort to discover any evidence of a link <e>", "<cs> my lords we have set up an inquiry into the future of the public health function which we have asked to report to us by the end of december this year <e> <s> we will not be taking any firm decisions before then <e> <s> i will of course ensure that the inquiry team considers the noble lords helpful suggestion when it meets <e>", "<cs> my lords it is necessary <e> <s> the other name which the noble lord may know better is district medical officer <e> <s> community medicine is a multi-faceted medical speciality capable of contributing at many points to the provision of effective health services and the improvement of the health of the whole population <e>", "<cs> my lords it is really a matter for local feeling as to the name of such a person <e>", "<cs> my lords community physicians are well represented among the ranks of general managers <e> <s> at least have taken up such posts at regional and district level <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little wide of the original question <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to ask me that question i should be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords many health authorities have retained the title of chief or district medical officer <e> <s> where this is not the case it is often to recognise the broader responsibilities that community physicians have been given under general management such as director of planning <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a danger that by insisting on a particular title being used we may inhibit community physicians from taking on new and identified roles within their health authorities <e> <s> planning is one of the roles that they are fully capable of filling <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already referred to the fact that it is often nowadays given to the community physicians to have broader responsibilities than in the past when they served under general management <e> <s> i stick by what i said such as directors of planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a whole list of figures which i shall put in the library <e> <s> i shall send the noble baroness a copy <e> <s> i am sure the house would not wish to be wearied by long lists of figures at this stage of the afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hardly for me to answer that supplementary <e> <s> it is somewhat rhetorical <e> <s> the noble lord is always full of good ideas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am appreciative of the brevity of the noble baroness and the noble lord if not of the content of their questions <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger asked when the payments will be made <e> <s> the uprating will cover the period from july to april when benefits will be increased again <e> <s> with regard to child benefits about which both the noble baroness and the noble lord asked me questions as the house will know we are increasing the benefit by per cent <e> <s> from to

lord boyd-carpenter for his remarks <e> <s> perhaps i may reiterate my comments concerning inflation which his own remarks just now added to very nicely <e> <s> i am conscious of the fact that i have not answered the question of the noble baroness opposite concerning the blind <e> <s> i will answer both the noble baroness and my noble friend by saying that that addition has not been uprated for many years but blind people receive help for special needs in the same way as other disabled people dependent upon supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unexpected that the noble lord should sit down so quickly <e> <s> i am simply not used to it <e> <s> if i may endeavour to answer the noble lords points pensioners will receive extra help in july and all movements in the rpi from january to september will be taken into account in april <e> <s> this years uprating is based upon the movement of prices as the noble lord will know <e> <s> the reason why the uprating is so low is simply due to our success in controlling inflation <e> <s> it is also because the uprating is based on only eight months price rises <e> <s> that success benefits pensioners and others on low incomes most of all <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard spoke about a cuts exercise <e> <s> how can this be a cuts exercise when it will add million to the budget in the next year <e>", "<cs> my lords screening services for the htlv iii antibody are well established across the country principally in phls laboratories <e> <s> with regard to aids taking resources away from other virology services this is not happening so far as we are aware <e> <s> we have provided an additional three-quarters of a million pounds to the phls to provide a screening and reference service for aids <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is aware that a number of pharmaceutical companies are very actively involved in research into interferon <e> <s> the supply of this material for research clinical trials and therapeutic use is therefore a straightforward commercial supply arrangement and the department is not directly involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the situation mentioned in the latter part of the noble lords question <e> <s> if he has any examples perhaps he will furnish me with them <e> <s> with regard to the first part of his question laboratories across the country have been requested to report to the cdsc the findings of positive tests for antibodies to the virus <e> <s> there are laboratories in the phls alone doing this work along with all blood transfusion centres and at least a further or more in other establishments <e> <s> health authorities have been asked to arrange for antibody testing within their districts <e> <s> it is up to the health authorities <e> <s> as the noble lord already knows the government are providing extra money <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just mention the intervention of the noble lord lord jacques he pointed out that we are now on the motion that the bill do now pass and not on third reading <e> <s> i think that i must point that out to the noble and learned lord before he pursues his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the elderly simply need reading glasses and they will be among the main beneficiaries of the more competitive private market <e> <s> for people requiring the most powerful lenses nhs spectacles are available at controlled charges as a hedge against fears that were expressed that private prices for these lenses would shoot up <e> <s> nhs glasses are still available free of charge or at reduced charges to people on low incomes and of course sight tests remain available to all free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the noble lord lord rugby that the ec regulations permit the sale of ready-made glasses and indeed these glasses might be helpful to my noble friend the very very elderly lord long <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the government attach importance to the continued link between the sale of glasses and the sight test at which eye diseases can be detected <e> <s> therefore while there is nothing to prevent the sale of ready-made glasses as such their sale by unregistered retailers must be in accordance with a recent prescription for the customer <e> <s> these arrangements have not prevented many budget ranges of glasses coming onto the market indeed i am wearing a pair myself <e>", "<cs> my lords after cataract operations patients may require frequent changes of glasses until their sight stabilises <e> <s> such patients can benefit from what is known as the technical non-tolerance arrangements operated by the hospital eye service <e> <s> under this arrangement the patient pays only for the glasses which he finally keeps and the cost of the others is borne by the hospital authority <e> <s> the usual low income remission arrangements would apply to a patient who was unable to meet that charge <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody can get spectacles on the national health service now except for the very elderly and children <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as the noble lord will know if he is suggesting that free glasses should be provided for the elderly it has not been the policy of any government since to give free glasses or help with glasses on grounds of age except of course for children <e> <s> help has always depended on the ability to pay <e> <s> the long-standing arrangements for helping those on low incomes are still available <e> <s> if the noble lord does not have a copy of the appropriate leaflet i have a spare one with me in my folder and i shall happily give it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us all of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said no government have ever provided pensioners with help for spectacles on the basis of age alone <e> <s> naturally we sympathise with those who have difficulty in paying and that is why there are long-standing arrangements giving help <e> <s> pensioners who are on supplementary benefit and certain other benefits are automatically entitled to free nhs spectacles <e> <s> others whose income is somewhat above the supplementary benefit level can also get nhs spectacles free or at reduced cost through the remission arrangements <e> <s> for instance a single pensioner whose weekly income is about after essential outgoings or a couple whose income is about after outgoings might well qualify for help <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various permutations of the answer to that question <e> <s> the government are aware of the worrying incidence of aids acquired through infected needles by sufferers in scotland <e> <s> according to the information that has been given the chief medical officer of the scottish home and health department has set up an advisory committee to review the extent of aids infection in scotland particularly among drug misusers and to consider what steps should be taken to contain the spread of infection <e> <s> the voluntary organisation which i mentioned has prepared a leaflet about it as i said <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> a voluntary system for the reporting of cases to the communicable disease surveillance centre on a confidential basis is working well <e> <s> we have no plans to replace this arrangement with a statutory reporting system <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already announced a public information campaign on aids will be forthcoming <e> <s> on the nd december my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services announced that million had been earmarked for a campaign directed at the general public to be coupled with campaigns targeted at groups known to be at special risk of infection <e> <s> the necessary preliminary market research has been completed and we hope to make an announcement on the form of the campaign and the launch date soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will have to wait until the campaign is launched and then he will be able to see for himself <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baroness the transmission of aids through contaminated shared syringes is a worrying danger and here i pick up again one of the points made by my noble friend in his first supplementary question <e> <s> however at present there is no reason to believe that if clean syringes and needles were made readily available that would necessarily deter established injecting users from sharing with other drug users <e> <s> indeed the free availability of needles and syringes could encourage drug users to experiment with injections <e> <s> effective action is more likely to result from the general improvements in services for drug misusers which the government are seeking to achieve through the local statutory authorities <e> <s> however we are keeping the situation under close review <e>", "<cs> my lords up to the end of february cases had been reported in the united kingdom and of those have died <e> <s> the majority of these were homosexual men per cent <e> <s> up to nd january two cases had been reported where infecting drug misuse was the main risk factor <e> <s> one of those has died <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to read a statement being made by my right honourable friend the minister for health in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals will remember that it was his government who introduced charges in <e> <s> we have maintained that innovation <e> <s> the first question that he and the noble lord lord kilmarnock asked concerned the increase being higher than the rate of general inflation <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> rise is exactly in line with the rising cost of medicines <e> <s> it is higher than general inflation by about per cent <e> <s> because better and often more expensive medicines are becoming available or more widely prescribed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords further questions i referred previously to the cost of medicines having increased and this increase is to match that cost <e> <s> the revenue to be raised will be million <e> <s> there is no change in the categories of people who are entitled to free prescriptions <e> <s> currently over per cent <e> <s> of all prescription items are issued free of charge and nearly per cent <e> <s> go to holders of pre-payment certificates in other words season tickets <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are all very much indebted to the noble lord lord winstanley who has brought this difficult problem before your lordships tonight <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend lord molson had to withdraw from the debate because as the noble lord said he is not feeling very well <e> <s> i am sure we would all hope that this is a temporary malaise <e>", "<cs> my lords i mentioned particularly that i welcomed the men too campaign which the family planning association has recently carried out <e> <s> i said in my early remarks that i emphatically meant both sexes <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to read my speech tomorrow he will see that <e> <s> i agree with him that as i said both sexes need to be counselled <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness lady lockwood will agree with me that this is the only matter in which there are not equal opportunities for both sexes it is only females who become pregnant <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the programme will have helped to ease many of the anxieties that people have about needing treatment in hospital <e> <s> i am sure that it will have reassured them about the care that they can expect <e> <s> with regard to the pay of nursing sisters as for all nhs and midwifery staff it is determined following the recommendations of an independent review body <e> <s> the government have made it clear that we shall implement review body reports except where there are clear and compelling reasons for not doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords there has recently been a full debate in this house on nurses <e> <s> there has been an equally full debate in another place <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that i cannot go into such detailed information and perhaps he might turn to those two debates <e>", "<cs> my lords in a totally different context i have been informed that flu vaccination is quite useless <e>", "<cs> my lords that question of the noble lord lord ennals is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> my statement came after having visited one of the government laboratories <e> <s> they have for many years carried out experiments in a certain school using flu vaccination <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware the flu bug is of a different nature virtually every year and therefore they informed me that vaccination against flu was a rather pointless operation <e>", "<cs> with gratitude my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is of the kind whom flu bugs do not love <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the government will listen <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am not condemning any flu vaccine <e> <s> of course research is being done into flu vaccine and i stand by what i was told <e> <s> if i am informed afterwards and if i have in any way misled the house i will most certainly make a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords that

information your lordships can be sure that i shall be told so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that the programme was very successful with regard to those particular hospitals <e> <s> if for any reason the health authority wishes to approach either the bbc or the department i feel sure it will <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have time i will gladly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i made it perfectly clear from the start that i was speaking as a result of a visit to a laboratory <e>", "<cs> my lords if the usual channels wish me to do so i believe that is the way i should answer i will gladly do

government took office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the latter part of the noble baronesss supplementary question i can do no better than quote my honourable friend the minister of state for social security when he said during a recent interview <e>", "<cs> my lords i have stated the case <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull has made a most helpful suggestion <e> <s> following that i am unable to suggest to any noble lord what he should tell a friend of his in a private conversation <e>", "<cs> my lords the system which operated last year and which was based on data collected from weather stations was declared invalid by the social security commissioners <e> <s> the chief adjudication officer has subsequently issued revised guidance <e> <s> it is a regulated system and ministers cannot intervene in individual decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the adjudication officers in dhss local offices <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that the proposed system of premium payments which gives extra help to pensioners the sick and the disabled in particular is the most effective means of getting help to those most in need <e>", "<cs> my lords the main help with heating is in the weekly scale rates <e> <s> they have increased by more than per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e> <s> we have also increased both the availability and value of heating additions <e> <s> they are now worth million more in real terms than in <e> <s> in particular we have extended automatic entitlement to heating additions to those who are most likely to need extra warmth the elderly the chronically sick and disabled and families with young children <e> <s> i am afraid that i have no more to offer them <e>", "<cs> my lords because the heating allowance is covered by the weekly figures that people receive and savings should be made over the whole year to cover the cold periods <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting that there may be some overprescribing of spectacles my department is seeking further independent professional advice on that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is talking about unregistered suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords unregistered suppliers can sell spectacles to anyone other than for a child or anyone whom they know to be registered as blind or partially sighted <e> <s> however they can do so only on production of a written prescription that is not more than two years old <e> <s> they must also observe certain other requirements concerning the safety and complexity of lenses and they cannot sell contact lenses <e>", "<cs> my lords from st july national health service glasses will be discontinued and children and those on low incomes will instead be able to obtain a wider choice of glasses from the private market by means of a voucher <e> <s> details of the voucher scheme and values are still under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace is quite right <e> <s> unfortunately for many years chiropody in the national health service has not been as comprehensive a service as we would wish primarily due to the shortage of state registered chiropodists <e> <s> there are now almost per cent <e> <s> more whole-time equivalent chiropodists in the national health service than in and they are treating more patients and providing more treatments <e> <s> we are making progress <e> <s> with regard to waiting lists we do not centrally collect statistics on waiting time or waiting lists for chiropody and certainly have no evidence that they are increasing <e> <s> unnecessary waiting is regrettable but it is another facet of the general shortage <e>", "<cs> my lords the

given details of the number of schools which have been opened and the one which is to be opened <e> <s> we have advised health authorities where they cannot provide a full chiropody service that they

proportion of treatment at home has declined in recent years it still accounts for some per cent <e> <s> of total treatments <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes have difficulty in finding the crux of the noble lords questions to me but with regard to privatisation of national health service chiropody services it would be open to health authorities to make arrangements to contract out provision of national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sympathy with what the noble lord said and i shall see that his remarks are drawn to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to those of other noble lords to the noble lord lord stallard for providing us with the opportunity to debate this very important subject <e> <s> i pay tribute first to the way he opened the debate and secondly to the spastics society which he acknowledged to be his inspiration <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble baroness and i am sure that her comment will appear in <e>", "<cs> in reply to both the noble lords lord ennals and lord winstanley who more or less challenged me as to when the government will bring in a bill covering the whole of the warnock report my answer is that the government are fully aware of the strongly-held views on many of the issues dealt with in the warnock report and the government intend to introduce legislation on those matters as soon as practicable <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot be more precise but this debate is helpful and all the points made in it will certainly be taken into account in considering future legislation on the issues which are raised during the progress of this bill <e>", "<cs> i feel i should point out to the committeee that if any of the amendments put down in the name of my noble friend lord cork and orrery were accepted they would have implications for the act which would need amendment in a number of other provisions thus causing further legislation in this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury for the opportunity that he has given us to debate this tightening up of the provision in section and of the act <e> <s> it is clearly right that the aim of that act to prohibit the operation of commercioal surrogacy agencies in this country should not be frustrated by obvious loopholes <e> <s> if that ever proved to be the case i am sure that the government would want to look closely at the need for amending legislation <e> <s> meantime we shall note the views expressed by the noble earl and by the noble and learned lord lord denning on this amendment very carefully when we come to consider the need for legislation to deal with the issues in the warnock report <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the arguments have changed since the last round when my noble friend lord caithness spoke but i must retreat to my neutral corner <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord campbell of croy rightly says medical exposures are much more significant <e> <s> it is the governments policy to ensure that exposure of the population to radiation from whatever source is kept as low as reasonably practicable <e> <s> the most recent survey by the national radiological protection board showed that medical uses of radiation constituted per cent <e> <s> of the total radiation exposure of the population compared with per cent <e> <s> from discharges from nuclear installations <e> <s> eighty-seven per cent <e> <s> of total radiation exposure comes from natural background sources <e>", "<cs> my lords detailed guidance is given in the

practicable commensurate with the clinical purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the health and safety executive is responsible for enforcing the ionising radiation regulations <e> <s> their inspectors visit premises and seek to agree with the health authority any action necessary to ensure compliance with the regulations and where agreement is not reached the hse has power to issue a crown enforcement notice requiring the health authority to take the necessary action <e>", "<cs> my lords while the report of the royal commission recommends the removal of crown immunity from nhs waste disposal it also points to procedures under the current legislation which provided safeguard against instances of air pollution arising from crown property <e> <s> under the procedure in section of the clean air act local authorities in the light of the findings of their environmental health officers can submit reports and require the secretary of state to investigate breaches of the regulations <e> <s> the

replied on the position of the royal commission on environmental pollution and its recommendations <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord ennals would agree that repetition is rather boring <e>",

not refer to other matters which are under crown immunity <e> <s> therefore i think that the noble and learned lords question was rather wide of the present question <e> <s> i have already said that we shall be keeping the situation under review <e> <s> with regard to the make-up of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already replied to the original question and have said that we have no current plans <e> <s> i have said that the matter is under review and i am in no position to answer for the whole of crown immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords guidance on aids which was issued to health professionals last year contained specific advice on disposal of clinical waste <e> <s> further guidance produced by the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens will be issued very soon <e> <s> this will be aimed primarily at clinical nursing and laboratory staff who might come into contact with patients who have been exposed to the htlviii virus or specimens taken from them <e> <s> the advice in the guidelines will also be relative to others as it covers such areas as post-mortems body handling disposal of waste and maintenance and cleaning <e>", "<cs> my lords the onus is on health authorities to provide their services in the most efficient and effective manner <e> <s> services to patients are paramount <e> <s> if a health authoritys incinerator has spare capacity then it is a matter of judgment for that health authority to decide whether it can increase its workload by taking on non-nhs work <e> <s> all incinerators are subject to inspection by environmental health officers <e> <s> section of the clean air act allows for breaches of the act through excessive pollution to be investigated <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness lady nicol that the department will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i referred to the report of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e> <s> i am not aware that i mentioned any further royal commission <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on the remarks of the noble and learned lord to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what hospital cases the noble lord refers to <e> <s> i am not in a position to give any answer on the waiving of crown immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i really am unaware of any cases <e> <s> if the noble lord has any particular cases perhaps he would bring them to my notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the matters raised by the noble lord are the responsibility of the west essex district health authority <e> <s> i understand that the authority held formal consultations on the proposal to close honey lane hospital <e> <s> the proposal was not opposed by the community health council which formally represents the local community and was not therefore referred to ministers <e> <s> it would not be appropriate for me to comment in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the matters raised by the noble lord are for the west essex district health authority i am confident that the dha has done all it can to ensure that no unnecessary inconvenience will occur when the agreed closure takes place <e> <s> for example the dha is providing out-patient clinics a new nhs nursing home and a new day centre for geriatric patients in waltham abbey <e> <s> i understand that mr hackford the district general manager and a near neighbour of the noble lord lord john-mackie is keen to discuss these matters with him <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows matters that take place to do with closures are matters for the district health authorities and the regional health authorities <e> <s> unless community health councils object as i said in the original answer the matter is not brought for adjudication by ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper refers to honey lane hospital <e> <s> if the noble lord would care to raise a question on any of the other hospitals which he has mentioned i shall be glad to answer it on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we must stick to the question on the order paper <e> <s> the health authority issued a consultation document in may proposing the closure of this hospital for two special reasons <e> <s> i would go into those reasons if there was more time <e> <s> but if i may say so i well remember the debate that we had on the other hospitals in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly in this case that is not true <e> <s> there is perfectly adequate provision being made <e> <s> this is a specialist hospital and other arrangements have been made for all the specialties many of which will be more convenient for the majority of patients in the future plus the new hospitals and clinics which i have already spoken about at waltham abbey <e>", "<cs> my lords out-patient clinics will be re-provided at a more central location in waltham abbey <e> <s> specialties using honey lane have a large number of in-patients from outside waltham abbey <e> <s> re-provision for the majority of these inpatient will be at bishops stortford and at epping nearest their homes <e> <s> the proposed reorganisation with gp beds staying in waltham abbey will therefore arguably be of benefit from the travelling point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the interim report there are some encouraging aspects and some that cause us concern <e> <s> i assure your lordships that the government will consider carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot anticipate the findings of the final report but as i said the government will consider carefully all comments and positive suggestions about improving the diet of our children because they recognise the importance of that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the findings of the report will be handled by coma on whom the government rely for information on this matter and that is the date that it has set <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had done so already <e> <s> it is the committee on medical aspects of food policy <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the report on the positive side the results show that our children are adequately nourished and are growing faster than ever before <e> <s> on the other hand they appear to be eating too much fat and that could have implications for the incidence of coronary heart disease in later life <e> <s> we are aware that some experts have read a great deal more into the preliminary report but i am bound to say that much of what has been said is alarmist and cannot be deduced from the information so far available <e> <s> we are however well aware of the many concerns expressed as will be the heads of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lords lord ennals and lord kilmarnock for their welcome for this discussion document <e> <s> perhaps i may point out immediately to the noble lord lord kilmarnock that it is a discussion document and not a green paper <e> <s> of course a debate is a matter for the usual channels and i have no more influence over my usual channels than has anyone else which is right and proper <e>", "<cs> my lords most authorities are i believe aware of the problems in rural areas not only for doctors but also for other primary care services <e> <s> those matters will of course be taken into account in the consultation period <e> <s> as to my noble friends question concerning nurses there are recommendations in the cumberlege report about extending the role of the nurse and about limited prescribing by nurses <e> <s> it is however important to read the supporting text so as to see these recommendations in the proper context <e> <s> then there can be an informed discussion of what it is sensible to aim for <e> <s> i must tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the expression of his views which i am sure will be listened to together with all the others when my right honourable friend the secretary of slate is examining the conclusions drawn from this discussion period <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble lords first question the answer is yes the local authorities will be included <e> <s> as regards the second part of the question we propose to launch a structured consultation exercise and use the discussion document as an extended agenda at public hearings some of which will be chaired by ministers <e> <s> we intend that these meetings will be part of a much wider public debate on the future of primary care <e> <s> given the wide range of issues the consultation period will last until the end of the year as i have already said <e> <s> we shall then enter into negotiations with the professions concerned and depending upon the outcome of the consultations and negotiations we shall introduce any necessary legislation <e> <s> all this amounts to a lot of talk it is very difficult to pinpoint time <e>",

have not been supplied by the italians with a list of individual brand names no doubt because different bottlers frequently supply the same brand name <e> <s> in order to identify the wines of those

is likely to have started at the beginning of this year <e> <s> the first illness in italy was reported on nd march <e> <s> with regard to the period over which any wines recently brought back from italy should be regarded as suspect the answer is any wines brought back since the beginning of this year <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the australian problem was different <e> <s> that was antifreeze <e> <s> that is less harmful to health i am assured <e>", "<cs> my lords the contaminant is certain austrian wines i have now found the place in my notes was not methyl alcohol but diethelyne glycol and the health risk associated with the austrian problem was very much less <e> <s> some german and other foreign wines that had been blended with austrian wines were also contaminated with diethelyne glycol <e>", "<cs> my lords the services provided at the maudsley and royal bethlem hospitals are of national indeed international importance <e> <s> it is a centre of

i understand that no decisions have yet been made except in the case of neurosurgery where short-term closures have been agreed on an experimental basis <e> <s> for the information of the house i would point out that i understand that at its meeting last night the sha decided on the first phase of a series of measures and will enter into discussions with staff on a second phase of measures to

state of health <e> <s> he will be visiting the hospitals later this week <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to neurosurgery the noble lord will recall that i have just said that no decisions were made on curtailment of services except in the case of neurosurgery where short-term closures have been agreed <e> <s> the valuable neurological services provided by the maudsley on behalf of the south-east thames region and others will continue at the present level while future services are examined <e> <s> the consultant neurosurgeons have given an assurance that the closure of the unit now proposed

present only residence in canada is counted for canadian old-age security benefits <e> <s> the canadian government would modify the residence test to the advantage of people in or from the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will have to forgive the length of my reply to that rather long question <e> <s> in principle the government accept the case for a comprehensive social security convention with canada which would enable increases in pensions to be paid <e> <s> the problem is one of cost <e> <s> with regard to the money which the canadian government quoted as being available in i understand that the million dollars is made up of million dollars for people in canada and million dollars for people in the united kingdom <e> <s> the money would not come to the united kingdom exchequer and would not affect the amount which we should have to find out of social security funds in order to finance the uprating <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to costs the

authorities to bear this in mind in setting targets <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first add my congratulations to those that others have offered to the noble baroness lady masham on so eloquently bringing this bill before us today <e> <s> this bill certainly represents a very important development of the legislative structure within which services are provided for disabled people and we are

give the noble lord the table of results <e>", "<cs> my lords instructions are now given on containers that patients should follow the entire course of a dose of drugs which is prescribed to them and doctors are also instructed to tell patients for how long the prescribed drugs should be taken and in what quantities <e>", "<cs> my lords the medical profession is anxious to control the level of repeat prescribing <e> <s> many doctors recognise the need for regular reviews of repeat prescriptions and operate their own control systems but i say again that doctors prescribe the drugs that they think are necessary to make a person well <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said but there are many reasons why people hang on to drugs and the figures in respect of the dump campaign may not relate to a specific period of accumulation <e> <s> nor is there any differentiation between whether the medicines that are disposed of come from patients residential homes nursing homes or possibly even from pharmacies which are using the opportunity to dispose of out-of-date or obsolete stock <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indicated in many cases <e> <s> i myself have had eye drops which were only safe to use for a period of one month <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend regulations require solid dose aspirin and paracetamol medicines on sale over the counter to be in child-resistant containers <e> <s> since these controls came into operation there has been a significant reduction in the number of hospital admissions of young children who are suffering from accidental poisoning by medicines <e> <s> with regard to the elderly or people who have arthritis in their hands i agree that this may be a problem and doctors are advised to ask pharmacists to avoid dispensing drugs for elderly patients in child-resistant containers <e> <s> perhaps i may return to the point that it is up to parents to keep medicines out of the vicinity of their children <e>", "<cs> yes my lords if they are asked to but they may not realise that the elderly person has a problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the points made with his usual clarity by the noble lord lord banks and by the other noble lords who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks is a most patient

less in order to improve local authority accountability for the cost and provision of local services <e> <s> this particular proposal will be developed in the light of the governments wider proposals for reforming local government finance <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a considerable debate on the principles of this bill <e> <s> i want to come to the major points which have been raised and to answer as many as possible of the queries raised by your lordships <e> <s> i fear i shall be writing many letters to those noble lords whose questions time will prevent me from answering <e> <s>

noble lord lord houghton <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness gave me advance warning <e> <s> the advisory committee considered a great deal of information about the use and therapeutic value of oral mucolytics not only from within the uk but from america australia and elsewhere <e> <s> they concluded on the basis of all the evidence available that patients suffering from chest conditions or glue ear will obtain no real advantage from taking oral mucolytics <e>", "<cs> my lords the promotion of good health is always our aim <e> <s> the aim was to save money by getting the best drugs available for the cheapest price <e> <s> by so doing we shall save million in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer any question as technical as the one the noble baroness has asked but i would point out that our commitment was never to provide exact alternative but appropriate alternative treatment <e> <s> for many scheduled drugs this means similar cheaper ones <e> <s> however where we are advised by experts that a specified drug is of no proven therapeutic value for example in the case of oral mucolytics the appropriate alternative treatment might involve a very different drug

provision of pharmaceutical services for hospital patients i am sure that pharmaceutical officers would not be slow to offer the necessary advice <e> <s> i am equally sure that the principles of wise management which must prevail in the nhs will ensure that the advice will be heeded provided it is seen to be in the interests of patients <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has shown again the deep

fears and that i can persuade her to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> once again the noble lord lord banks has raised an issue which will be crucial to the success of the new pension arrangements

be a need for extra measures because of the special position of pensions <e> <s> in the very unlikely event of the financial services bill not being passed there are fully sufficient powers in this bill to do all that is necessary to protect personal pension holders <e>", "<cs> the government share the view of the noble baroness that charges for personal pensions must be kept down <e> <s> some commentators have pointed out that charges can amount to as much as per cent <e> <s> of contributions in some section retirement annuity contracts the only type of personal pension currently available

employees share of the minimum contribution will be subject to relief just like any other sort of pension contribution <e> <s> this point was made in the white paper <e> <s> employers of course get relief on national insurance contributions from which their share of the minimum contribution is derived <e>", "<cs> with these amendments the noble lord lord banks is seeking to withhold the per cent

incentive so that it does not go to people who have been in occupational schemes for a reasonable period to time and as i have spoken at some length about the incentive and why we think it is necessary i do not propose to weary members of the committee by repeating the arguments <e>", "<cs> in our earlier debates i have stressed how committed the government are to the expansion of occupational pension schemes <e> <s> so far in my remarks i have tended to emphasise the benefits of money purchase schemes for small employers industry-wide schemes and so on <e> <s> i hope that

<e> <s> notes on clauses set out our views on the type of control we believe is needed <e> <s> we want to prevent advertisements and any other material from containing misleading exaggerated and unhelpful projections of the eventual benefits promised by a pension scheme <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord kilmarnock could possibly stand back when he is under that microphone

offence <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before the noble baroness proceeds so that i may <e>", "<cs> yes plus a day <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am a little surprised and disappointed that nearly two years after the personal pensions debate began there are still people who are not yet persuaded that every individual whether in a public or a private sector scheme a salary-related or money purchase scheme should be allowed this basic freedom of choice <e> <s> although there has been some strong opposition to certain aspects of the governments pensions proposals i think it is now increasingly recognised even by the opponents of personal pensions that this option should be available to all <e>", "<cs> it is a parallel i would say <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i hope i have already made clear today the importance which the government attach to the new right that this bill will give to members or prospective members of occupational pension schemes to opt for a personal

retirement pension but to pay it only to those who do not have any or only a small earnings-related pension <e> <s> this device is similar to the guaranteed additional component discussed during the s <e> <s> it would also be in line with the recommendations of the social services select committee in another place which in recommended action to narrow the income gap between those who had already retired with little more than the basic pension and those who would be receiving substantial extra sums under the earnings-related pension scheme <e>", "<cs> may i come back to what the noble lord lord ennals has said <e> <s> the government are certainly not complacent but as my noble friend lord vinson said it is better to take decisions on the level of pensions at the time that uprating

against inflation is the best news that pensioners have had <e>", "<cs> i think we would rather not because we have amendment no <e> <s> grouped with a different set of amendments <e>", "<cs> this

the -best-years rule <e> <s> but i have to say that we are not convinced that a case has been made for extending the protection of serps right <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try to answer a few of the questions that have come up <e> <s> may i immediately say to the noble baroness lady turner that it was amendment no <e> <s> to which i was referring when i said that i was grateful <e> <s> i thought i had better clear up that point <e> <s> the noble viscount lord buckmaster talked about people arriving in this country late in life <e> <s> proposals for serps which were based on earnings-related pensions on the whole working life bring the arrangements into line with the occupational pensions <e> <s> we are concerned here with pensions which relate to earnings and we consider that it is right that apart from the special groups that we propose to protect such pensions should be based on the earnings of those years of membership of the scheme in just the same way as occupational pensions <e>", "<cs> this came up with amendment no <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is not quoting me or paraphrasing me at all correctly <e> <s> i never said that it did not matter <e> <s> i simply said it was wrong to take judgments so far ahead when there is plenty of time for those in the future to judge what is needed in that day just as years later the situation will have changed for those same

<e> <s> one lives and learns <e> <s> at first my instinct was to go down the same path as my noble friend lady lane- fox <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot do so <e> <s> my main reason is that at

clause to the health service and to other local authority services and also that he would not drag his feet about this <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced that this amendment is necessary or desirable <e> <s> i am sure there would be scope for a lot of argument as to what constituted medical grounds and there could be circumstances where it would be desirable to withhold information on purely social grounds for example when a wife or a husband is acting as representative of a disabled person and sexual matters are at issue <e> <s> it might well be harmful to the interest of the disabled person to discuss such matters with the spouse at any rate without first getting specific clearance from the disabled person himself or herself <e> <s> but this would hardly constitute medical grounds <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord mottistone said this is the first of a series of <e>", "<cs> i take note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> extension of the representatives right of access to children in residential care would give rise to a number of problems <e> <s> in cases where a parent had appointed himself as an authorised representative he would have right of access to the child if he or she was in residential care but not if the child was placed with a foster parent <e> <s> we try to achieve equity between children in residential care and those in foster homes <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the intention behind this amendment though once again we have a few difficulties of a drafting nature <e> <s> it does not seem unreasonable for the nearest relative to have access to documents and information on the same basis as the representative if as the existing wording of this subsection already makes clear <e> <s> the disabled person wishes <e> <s> one difficulty is that this amendment would seem to call for consequential amendments to subsection of this clause which deals with the circumstances in which a local authority may refuse to disclose information to a representative <e> <s> it would seem necessary to make further provision in the subsection to prescribe the circumstances in which disclosure should not be made to the nearest relative <e> <s> that would include where disclosure would be harmful to the interests of the disabled person and perhaps also to those of the nearest relative <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that once again i am a big disappointment to the noble lord <e> <s> the line amendment would require an lea to obtain the consent of the child if or over or his parent prior to requiring the appropriate officer of the ssd to give his opinion as to whether the child was a disabled person <e> <s> the line amendment appears to require the appropriate officer similarly to obtain consent before he gives his opinion <e> <s> i am sure this is not what the noble lord intended <e> <s> i assume he intended only the one consent requirement two would clearly be a nonsense <e>", "<cs> section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act already covers the provision of practical assistance to a disabled person in his own home and the provision of any additional facilities designed to secure his greater safety comfort or convenience <e> <s> the noble lords amendment would seek in effect to add to that section specific references to a need for information about and training in independent living skills and a need for technical aids and equipment to assist independent living <e> <s> i applaud the intention of this amendment and accept the importance of the concept of independent living for disabled people which is very important <e> <s> but independent living is not a clearly defined concept and to improve the proposed statutory duty on local authorities would represent both a constraint on the manner in which they carried out their duties and in some cases a possible substantial additional cost <e> <s> the existing provisions of section are broad enough to achieve what the noble lord seems to be wanting and i hope that he will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> we acknowledge that there is a clear case for relatives particularly those who will be directly caring for the patient after discharge to be involved in the assessment process and decisions emerging from it <e> <s> but while we are sympathetic to the intention behind this amendment i think we can best deal with the issues raised in guidance to authorities at such time as this clause is implemented <e>", "<cs> i was trying to deal with this in shorthand in view of the lateness of the hour but the noble lord has challenged me and so i must detain the committee a moment longer <e> <s> this amendment presents difficulties <e> <s> on the one hand it seems to put relatives on the same footing as the authorities who are required by subsection to make the assessments which they are clearly not <e>", "<cs> this amendment is not as shipshape as i would have expected from my noble friend <e> <s> while there is a duty under section of the mental health act for health and social services to provide aftercare for detained patients there is no corresponding duty laid upon ex-detained patients to accept such aftercare services nor should there be except in the case of restricted patients for example those who have been conditionally discharged for whom provision already exists <e>", "<cs> i have the briefest of comments <e> <s> this amendment would require the collection of data on each and every assessment carried out under clauses and <e> <s> it would be a considerable task and have substantial resource implications <e> <s> i am sorry but i must resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my department i resent those remarks <e>", "<cs> northern ireland has a separate and distinctive

different from the survey <e> <s> i said that consideration of new arrange-ments will cover new claimants but not the transitional protection because they are new and are not losers under anything as

level of detail contained in this amendment is perhaps better left to the greater flexibility of regulations <e> <s> let me reassure the committee that there is nothing new in this <e> <s> regulations currently set out the detailed rules of the treatments of the various kinds of resources under the supplementary benefits scheme <e> <s> thus there is scope for dealing with the treatment of expenses for voluntary work and the new subsection of clause provides similar flexibility to make regulations for the three income-related benefits <e> <s> i can assure the committee that the government value the important work done by voluntary workers <e> <s> my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state made this quite clear in committee in another place <e> <s> i understand the concern that people should not be put off volunteering by this change <e> <s> we have a great deal of sympathy and admiration for the valuable work undertaken by volunteers <e> <s> genuine expenses will continue to be disregarded <e> <s> therefore the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> there are cases and cases and there are expenses and expenses as everybody knows <e> <s> i think the examples given are about magistrates or other people of that kind claiming expenses <e> <s> people who serve on tribunals i believe get their expenses <e> <s> genuine expenses is what i said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just follow up what the right reverend prelate has said by going back to the question of general expenses which i think he has expressed rather well <e> <s> i accept that there is a case for disregarding certain types of voluntary payment for instance the petrol expenses of volunteers who help housebound people to go shopping to visit relatives and so on <e> <s> those are the kinds of expenses i am talking about and i am happy to repeat again the undertaking of my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary in another place to look sympathetically at this whole area when drawing up the detailed regulations for income support <e> <s> there will of course be an opportunity for your lordships fully to debate these regulations before the introduction of the new scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both the noble lord lord ennals and my noble friend lord swinfen for their welcome to this amendment <e> <s> i should like to assure them both that what they have said this afternoon will be very carefully noted and will form part of the consultation process <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree that justice should be seen to be done and i have explained the public nature of this whole process <e>", "<cs> to be perfectly honest i do not know <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for disturbing his peroration but i never said that tribunals were incompetent <e> <s> i said merely that under the new system they will not be suitable <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ennals comments on the amendment i should like to clarify with the noble lord lord banks that he is speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> as we consider this important group of amendments i hope that noble lords opposite will not mind my saying that the effect of amendment no <e> <s> which i am taking in the grouping as agreed if taken in isolation would be that maternity payments which are at present non-recoverable would become recoverable <e> <s> i cannot believe that that was the intention of the mover of this amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the areas where we envisage that help will be available and indeed where grants may be made to further community care is in this field in order to enable people leaving long-stay hospitals to set up homes in the community <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness <e> <s> lady ewart-biggs has drawn attention to the position of young mothers under the age of in relation to the social fund <e> <s> i congratulate her on raising this important subject but must say at the outset that i cannot agree to the proposal <e> <s> the noble baroness asked me for an explanation and i would have thought that that was what i was going to give her when i rose to my feet <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness must forgive me if i return to the debate <e> <s> she obviously did not listen to me because i said that help was available to the families of children <e> <s> we believe that the best way to direct help to households most in need is to give the family help for a child of theirs who has borne a child <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but may i ask a question <e> <s> in the grouping of amendments that i have the noble lord is moving amendment no <e> <s> and speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> am i correct <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> has already been carried there is now written into the bill a provision for payments from the social fund to be <e>", "<cs> i am sorry for jumping up <e> <s> lord henderson of brompton i sit down at once <e>", "<cs> no hints it was a mere statement of fact <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by saying that i think the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lord lord kilmarnock are addressing the wrong part of the bill <e> <s> their concerns are to do with the arrangements for regular weekly benefit covered in part ii dealing with income support and not the social fund <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> in responding to this amendment i take up the point made by the noble baroness lady turner i must preface my remarks by saying that in the light of the debate that has just taken place we shall need to consider the issues of regulations versus discretion and appeals versus reviews following this afternoons vote <e> <s> clearly the outcome could affect the status of the budget that we envisage for the social fund <e> <s> nevertheless it is right that i should explain the thinking behind the proposals that the government have put forward <e> <s> i shall make my remarks on that basis <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord ennals i would say that the budget would operate in exactly the same way as hospital services which are cash limited now <e> <s> that is my answer to him <e>", "<cs> i have already said that we would have to look at the way it operated and see whether we have the balance exactly right in every kind of way <e> <s> of course we want the whole scheme to be utterly successful <e> <s> it would be rather stupid in our part if we did not <e> <s> therefore when it comes to the time to put it into operation we shall have examined all those possibilities always with the proviso that we can make changes if we find there is any trouble of any kind <e>", "<cs> i can only suggest that the noble lord lord banks reads what i have said <e>", "<cs> i cannot possibly anticipate what my right honourable friend would wish to do but i can certainly bring the remarks of the noble lord to his attention <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i must come back if i may and say this <e> <s> the matter of waiting lists is a totally different question <e> <s> it is a red herring which has been introduced into the debate <e>", "<cs> i am quite surprised at the words of the noble lord lord henderson because i <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ennals said confidentiality rules are exactly on the same basis now as when he was secretary of state <e> <s> therefore he is really undermining his own case in pleading for something different <e> <s> this is not a matter that is appropriate for main legislation <e> <s> what matters is how we discharge our responsibilities <e> <s> my assurance on the way we shall discharge this duty should be enough <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness must tell me <e> <s> perhaps i may give an example of what we are thinking about it was given by an honourable friend in another place <e> <s> a visiting officer may notice evidence of possible cruelty to a child and would probably refer the matter to the social services department so that it could determine whether the child was being maltreated <e> <s> it is only within such narrow confines that staff would generally breach the strict rules on confidentiality <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted it <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that the social security advisory committee was set up under section of the social security act <e> <s> it has several functions under sections and of that act <e> <s> it has the important duty of considering and reporting on regulations made under social security legislation <e> <s> it also has the duty to give advice and assistance to the secretary of state <e> <s> this duty applies whether a matter is referred to it or whether the committee selects a subject of its own accord <e> <s> your lorships will notice that this role is advisory <e> <s> it is reflected in the name of the committee <e> <s> i do not think that we should lightly alter that role to a formal monitoring duty <e> <s> this would have considerable implications for the wider relationship between the committee and the department <e>", "<cs> i shall gladly expand on my earlier remarks <e> <s> i mentioned that the committee commented on the changes to the supplementary benefits scheme in in its annual report <e> <s> your lordships may wish to be aware that in its report it also devoted a chapter to service to the public <e> <s> in this it said <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> my first answer was not a good idea but i was trying to make up for lost time if the committee knows what i mean <e>", "<cs> the present wording of clause <e>", "<cs> the bill includes some of the considerations to which the social fund officer might have regard in reaching his decision <e> <s> these are in clause <e> <s> one of these considerations is the subject of this amendment <e> <s> this simply builds on current practice although to hear some people you would not believe it <e> <s> the committee will wish to bear in mind that regulation of the present single payments regulations contains a long list of items for which a single payment cannot be made <e> <s> some of these are because it has not been felt that the social security scheme should meet the cost of a television or a holiday <e> <s> but others are clearly included because we should ensure that the cash benefit system is not used to pay for items or services which are properly the responsibility of other bodies <e> <s> thus we do not pay removal charges where someone is rehoused following a compulsory purchase order on their property or for repairs to local authority property <e> <s> this kind of provision must be carried forward <e>", "<cs> the current paragraph in the s manual states <e>", "<cs> may i remind the noble baroness lady seear that we are simply ensuring that the social fund officer has the same ability and flexibility as an officer has at present <e> <s> we are not introducing a new principle which need be routinely considered in all cases <e>", "<cs> i am very sensitive of time <e> <s> we shall be ensuring if this is helpful to the noble lord that training and published guidance indicate how the consideration should be applied <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals is being at his most persuasive but i regret that he has not worked his magic on me <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has once again touched on an important point in moving this amendment <e> <s> he has echoed reservations which have been expressed before during debates in another place <e> <s> clause sets out a number of the factors which a social fund officer should take into account when making a decision <e> <s> the particular consideration with which the amendment is concerned is one which we believe quite reasonably refers to a feature which must be taken into account when considering a loan <e>", "<cs> may i say in reply to the noble lord lord banks that the matters to which he has been referring are matters that we shall want to consider as we decide how to respond to the vote earlier today <e>", "<cs> i have never heard such a fuss <e> <s> i said perfectly plainly that this was a matter we would have to consider in the light of the vote this afternoon <e> <s> i have also explained at some length why <e>", "<cs> no the noble baroness will know that funeral and maternity payments are grants <e> <s> other things may be grants but they may also be loans <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord lord ennals simply has not listened to what i said earlier about flexibility in the early years of the budget to ensure that money does not run out <e> <s> i accept that i shall not take noble lords opposite with me on the question of the need for budgetary control <e> <s> but having decided to adopt such a system i suggest that it is only sensible to provide that social fund officers should have regard to their budget allocation when making decisions <e> <s> otherwise the effects of the greater financial control that we are seeking will be lost <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i fully understand why the noble baroness is expressing those fears but i must tell her that they are totally misplaced <e> <s> this brings us back to the budget that we discussed earlier <e> <s> we aim to set up quick and effective mechanisms for monitoring the fund but we intend to do more than that <e> <s> we will develop budget profiles so that local offices can tailor their expenditure according to the seasonal patterns of demand <e> <s> we aim to be in a position where as well as knowing what is happening to the budget we can reasonably gauge why it is happening so that we can make an appropriate response <e>", "<cs> i have given our side of the case <e> <s> i have given assurances over and over again that the social fund will not run out of money <e> <s> i am afraid that i have no more to say <e>", "<cs> on reconsideration we think that this is a useful simplification of the provisions which i am happy to accept <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for drawing our attention to it <e>", "<cs> the raising of the age range for age-related widows pension is a modest proposal in the bill which seeks to relate national insurance protection for widows a little more closely to present and future social trends <e> <s> the committee will i am sure accept that the national insurance scheme has to change with the times if it is to serve any useful function <e> <s> i hope the committee will accept also that we have to re-think benefits designed to protect against financial difficulty if the danger of financial difficulty recedes <e> <s> social change has nowhere been more marked than in the economic position of married women <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> of married women now work and nearly all women with children now return to work after the birth often quite quickly <e> <s> that enormous social change means we must look again at the rationale behind our widows benefit structure which is based on the presumption that women will have been dependent on the husbands earnings and that they will have difficulty in supporting themselves after the husbands death <e>", "<cs> i must make it clear at the outset that all existing beneficiaries will remain on any benefit they are already receiving when the new age groups come into effect and if that is what the noble baroness is seeking to achieve her amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> returning to the widowed mothers allowance which is not covered in this bill the provision is covered in regulations but it is proposed to withdraw the widowed mothers allowance from widows without dependent children <e> <s> whatever be the figure that the noble baroness quoted to me from a speech that was made some time ago i must tell her that widows will gain <e>", "<cs> while i sympathise with the aim of the noble baroness lady turner i cannot recommend the amendment to the committee <e> <s> the government have to take into account the much lower levels of benefit paid to people disabled outside the workplace especially when that disablement results in a loss of work <e> <s> we all know that disablement is difficult to bear but how much harder that burden is when combined with a low income <e> <s> that is why we propose to devote substantial additional resources to the less well off sick and disabled chiefly with the disability premium to be paid with income support <e>", "<cs> successive governments have left the main preference paid to industrial widows unchanged at p per week <e> <s> we propose to end the nonsense of maintaining a separate scheme to pay such paltry sums <e> <s> while we all sympathise with the tragic loss faced by a widow who loses her husband in an industrial accident we must remember that the tragedy is just as great for other widows whatever the cause of their husbands death <e> <s> for these reasons the government propose to treat industrial widows no differently from national insurance widows <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that the noble lord lord stallard cannot move amendment no <e> <s> a but can merely speak to it <e> <s> i shall speak to both amendments which aim to preserve universal assistance with funeral costs <e> <s> it is the governments firm belief that neither can be justified in the s and that our proposal to abolish death grant and give better and more selective assistance to those who need it most is the right and realistic course <e> <s> indeed does not go far towards the current cost of a funeral which ranges between and over <e> <s> for the great majority of people who have no difficulty in coping with funeral costs the grant makes little difference one way or the other <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord kilmarnock that i simply cannot think of how one will get the grant over a long weekend or over a long holiday <e> <s> indeed the difference between the number of deaths and the number of death grant claims suggests that about people a year do not bother to claim the grant despite the ease with which the contribution conditions can be satisfied <e>", "<cs> it is quite impossible to say how many people would be involved unless we know how many people died <e> <s> most people do not need the death grant <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> of funerals are paid for by private resources and for those who need help the amount of grant maximum is totally inadequate when compared with the cost of a simple funeral which varies widely in the range of to <e> <s> the cost of increasing the grant to its original value would be million <e> <s> the abolition of the death grant will enable the government to concentrate resources from the new social fund on more of those who really need help <e>", "<cs> the governments proposals for payment of funeral costs out of the social fund extend considerably the existing arrangements under which less well-off people are helped <e> <s> this is because these proposals will enable housing benefit and family credit recipients to make claims as well as those receiving income support <e> <s> as a result the number of people who subject to the capital rule will have full cover for the cost of a reasonable funeral will be increased from about million to about million <e> <s> i cannot give the precise cost <e> <s> we estimate that it will mean around funeral payments being made each year roughly per cent <e> <s> of the number of deaths <e> <s> this represents about a four-fold increase on the number of single payments made to supplementary benefit claimants for funeral costs at the present time <e> <s> i hope that reply satisfies the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the wish of some noble lords to link child benefit to the general level of prices irrespective of the competing claims for resources which have to be considered in the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may speak in shorthand <e> <s> proving a persons intentions is more difficult than even establishing that due care and diligence has been used <e> <s> in effect the amendment would limit recovery of over-payment only to cases where there had been fraudulent intent <e> <s> there is much more that i could say but i would ask my noble friend to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> there is a separate provision in clause to deal with recovery of overpaid housing benefit <e> <s> this provides for the arrangements for recovering housing benefit overpayments to be set out in regulations including the circumstances in which an overpayment can be recovered <e> <s> as my honourable friend the minister of state explained in another place when clause was debated we have not defined the categories of overpayments which it will be possible to recover in the main legislation because this is something we need to discuss with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> as the committee will know the concept of recklessness is not new either to social security law or to the criminal law generally <e> <s> as the noble baroness said in response to concern expressed about recklessness in another place the government undertook to reflect again upon the concept <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to report to the committee that our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that the objections to recklessness offences from both within and outside parliament are sufficiently persuasive to merit the removal of these provisions from the bill <e>", "<cs> i too am glad that we have had an opportunity however short to debate the issue of the eligibility criteria for mobility allowance because it is one which is of great interest and concern to many disabled people <e> <s> the government have great sympathy with that concern and i recognise the force of many of the arguments for change which have been put to us but i cannot advise that the committee accepts the amendment before us this evening <e>", "<cs> this debate takes us back over what is now well trodden ground but having listened carefully to what noble lords have said in support of the amendments i have to say that i do not think that we have heard any new arguments today <e> <s> these amendments would take us back to square one so far as the arrangements for free school meals are concerned <e> <s> some of the arguments that we have heard this evening are frankly alarmist and out of all proportion <e>", "<cs> i gratefully accept the suggestion made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e>", "<cs> may i first turn the thanks on to the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i should like to congratulate her on all the hard work that she has done on this bill and on the skilful way in which she has piloted it through your lordships house <e> <s> on this as on other occasions she has shown herself to be a doughty champion of the interests of disabled people themselves and those who care about their needs <e> <s> all of them owe her a debt of gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the last question first we are consulting with the pension people and the organisations concerned with pensions and with the noble lords opposite or any other person who thinks that they may have <e>", "<cs> my lords i take off my hat to the noble lord lord seebohm for his diligence and persistence in trying to persuade us that it is essential to link the rate of child benefit to the retail price index <e> <s> his proposition has now been distilled to the point of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will let me continue i may reach that point <e> <s> i believe that with regard to tax allowances child benefit is an entirely different creature than a tax allowance and on occasions child benefit has been increased when tax allowances have not <e> <s> tax allowances benefit the vast majority of working families <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull whose <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an ingenious amendment which seeks to provide that where a person is considered a householder for the purposes of housing benefit then he should not have his benefit altered by reference to his age <e> <s> in effect the amendment seeks to retain the householder distinction in the income-related benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that one-parent families will receive the higher rate <e> <s> a family includes children <e> <s> there is no age split for that group <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of benefit provision in cases of urgent need is clearly an important one and i thoroughly appreciate the reasons why my noble friend has moved the amendment and the support that she has received for it <e> <s> we have already had a substantial debate on this subject in committee but i welcome this further opportunity to reassure your lordships that we recognise the continuing need to provide for urgent needs after <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows for the social fund there will be directions for people working in local offices <e> <s> there is also a lot to be said for good common sense under these circumstances <e> <s> i think that the combination of the two answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lords lord ennals and lord kilmarnock for their general welcome to these amendments <e> <s> i should like to point out that we are a listening government and that these amendments have come about through consultation with womens organisations small businesses and other interested parties <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friend in another place will be glad to hear the remarks that have been made this evening <e> <s> to the noble baroness lady jeger about the clause the answer is nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little that i can add to what i have already said in committee <e> <s> however i shall add what little i can <e> <s> i have set out the governments conviction that it is unfair to give per cent <e> <s> guarantee of state help on mortgage interest to people out of work when others in work on comparable incomes have a much greater burden to carry themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have said that it is premature for me to answer now <e> <s> the general rule is that we do not take into account repairs to houses <e>", "<cs> my lords there has undoubtedly been some confusion between two issues here and that is why i was particularly anxious to take these amendments separately <e> <s> i hope my explanations will have the noble lord lord ennals leaping like a lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i could not be more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still so unnerved by my recent experience that your lordships must stop me if my reply does not sound right <e> <s> this issue is one that has been discussed at length during the bills progress <e> <s> indeed we debated this point in committee three weeks ago and i find myself in some difficulty because i do not want to test the patience of your lordships by repeating the remarks i made then <e> <s> however as i said in my ill-starred last few moments on my feet this amendment raises an entirely different matter from that raised by my noble friend lady faithfull in her amendment <e> <s> it is specifically directed at the cost of child care as met by someone who goes out to work <e> <s> it seeks to have those excluded from the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first occasion that the noble lord and i have discussed this subject in your lordships chamber <e> <s> he originally raised it through an unstarred question last november with particular reference to housing benefit <e> <s> since then we have as he knows partly as a result of the arguments he advanced then been able to offer an improvement in the way in which one form of life annuity the home income plan is treated in the housing benefit assessment <e> <s> the noble lord was kind enough obliquely to mention that this evening <e> <s> the noble baroness lady turner may not have been aware of it when she made her comments <e> <s> as a result of that improvement some elderly owner-occupiers will be better off from the th of this month <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down and with the leave of the house she has challenged me on several points and i feel that i should do my best to reply <e> <s> she mentioned the adequacy of cash compensation <e> <s> the figures have to be illustrative because the scheme does not start until <e> <s> the figure of in the technical annexe to the white paper should be seen as no more than illustrative <e> <s> i have repeated that several times <e> <s> it was based on the latest information available at the time relating to of the national average cost for fixed price meals converted to an average over a full -week year rather than just in term times <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords our green paper on reform of social security published early last year was a consultative document <e> <s> it was so successful that organisations authorities and individuals wrote to my right honourable friend expressing views <e> <s> they included representatives of childrens groups teachers associations and local authority bodies <e> <s> their concern was primarily with the level of the cash benefit and paying money to the mothers rather than through the <e>", "<cs> my lords our proposals for maternity expenses have been spelt out clearly in both the green and the white papers <e> <s> i listened carefully to the remarks of the noble lord lord pitt about adequacy <e> <s> i am not persuaded that we should alter these proposals now but i understand and appreciate very well his remarks about adequacy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson will no doubt be disappointed that i cannot agree to this amendment but i hope he will allow me to commend the manner in which he moved it which was gracious and compassionate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that alters what i was just saying which is that the very poor people can obtain credit only at a very high cost <e> <s> if they need something and their need is very great they have the fallback of the social fund <e> <s> to be in debt is perfectly frightful and can lead to the break-up of families <e> <s> i agree with the sentiments that have already been expressed on that subject this afternoon <e> <s> i am sensitive to the particular point that the social fund will increase the indebtedness of the poor and indeed the noble lord lord henderson has just spoken about that subject but the use of credit is and always has been widespread among all sectors of our society <e> <s> however poor people are disadvantaged i regret that i have to repeat it by having access to only high-cost credit <e> <s> the social fund will help people who are on very low incomes to budget by offering them interest-free advances of benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i get on please <e> <s> we have not finally decided on all matters of detail relating to the operation of the fund <e> <s> the full scheme will not come into effect until which is nearly two years away <e> <s> the maximum rate of recovery has not yet been decided <e> <s> the purpose will be to ensure that people who are having social fund payments recovered do not have an amount deducted which is too large and that deductions do not go on for too long a period <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down it is the word prescribed which sends us straight back into the single payments situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord lord banks a question before i begin <e> <s> in the groupings that i have i thought that he would be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to proceed in the way that the noble lord lord banks wishes <e> <s> we have already discussed this amendment at some length <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks gave fair warning that he would return to it <e> <s> i explained last time that all we are aiming to do is to ensure that the social fund has the same ability to take account of available sources of help as the current scheme has <e> <s> for example as i mentioned we do not currently pay for repairs to council houses since that is the councils responsibility <e> <s> we think it only reasonable to be able to apply the same kind of provision to the social fund <e> <s> we are not introducing some new principle <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already considered this amendment at committee stage <e> <s> it basically stems from our proposal that some social fund payments should be made as advances of benefit to help people with unexpected expenses or budgeting problems rather than necessarily as outright grants <e> <s> we discussed that issue at some length during committee including the arguments of equity in favour of our proposal <e> <s> your lordships rejected another amendment which would have called that principle into question <e> <s> i do not think therefore that i need rehearse yet again the arguments in favour of loans from the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would delete the provision requiring social fund officers to pay regard to the budget allocation available to them <e> <s> if passed it would make the social fund uncontrollable financially <e> <s> we are aiming in the social fund to give one-off payments for exceptional need related to an individuals overall circumstances rather than by set rules which can prove and have proved too rigid and too complex <e> <s> but a system operated by discretion must be subject to financial control since otherwise it is open-ended and in practice setting a budget is the only way of exercising such financial control <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house i must first thank noble lords opposite for the warm welcome they have given to my words <e> <s> however for the record i must repeat that what i said was that we have decided that the fund will not at first be subject to a formal cash limit on its introduction and i said that a decision on what will be the normal cash limiting arrangement will be taken when we have sufficient experience of the operation of the fund <e> <s> i think i must underline that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have previously given an assurance that no one will lose the category of widows benefit in payment at the time of the change <e> <s> where however a widow moves from one category of widows benefit to another after the change then the new rules will apply <e> <s> thus a widow who ceases to be entitled to widows allowance or widowed mothers allowance after the new age limits come into force would be considered on the basis of the new rules <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how grateful i am for the words of welcome from all parts of the house <e> <s> i should like to single out particularly my noble friend lady lane-fox and to say how glad i was to hear her words <e> <s> may i thank all noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> our aim is to redress the imbalance between support for those disabled at work and those disabled by other causes <e> <s> we are particularly concerned to do more for sick and disabled people on low incomes <e> <s> that is why we are proposing to devote substantial additional resources to

for up to a week extra through the full payment of reduced earnings allowance <e> <s> at present they cannot receive the allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock introduced an exactly similar clause at committee stage <e> <s> your lordships will not be surprised to hear that the government still cannot accept such an amendment because of the financial and administrative consequences and because we simply do not believe that it is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock is correct <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment is based on some misunderstanding of the rules governing entitlement to those short-term benefits and i suggest that the contingencies which the amendment seeks to guard against are already covered in the social security act and regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say to the noble lord lord pitt that we shall certainly look again at this from the point of view of regulations <e> <s> regulations as the noble lord will appreciate are always changing and are always liable to change <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will rest on what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords what is proposed in this amendment is clearly vastly different in scope from the invalid allowance which is the benefit for carers of severely disabled people <e> <s> the proposal seems to have some kinship with what the sdp had in mind when they launched their carers charter in april <e> <s> we have now brought forward the promised legislation for the extension of invalid care allowance to married women <e> <s> i hope that noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i correct myself in case i made a mistake <e> <s> i just want to make sure that i said that at for million people the cost is billion not billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lady faithfull will not faint with amazement i am happy to accept her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i just want to say that i was reading to the right amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment concerns regulations that will bring in the income-related benefits income support family credit and housing benefit set the tapers and appropriate maximum amounts of family credit and housing benefit clause and set applicable amounts and capital rules for the income-related benefits clause <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very concerned at the level of premature deaths from heart disease in this country and have accorded it high priority in our preventative programme <e> <s> your lordships are aware of the measures we are taking to tackle the known risks such as smoking and diet <e> <s> with the health education council we are intensifying the programme of health education through the issue of pamphlets posters tv programmes and publications <e>", "<cs> my lords first we have the primary health care consultative process which has started and which is the first of its kind for many years <e> <s> in recent years health expenditure here has grown faster in real terms than in many other western european countries <e> <s> the comparisons between nations are difficult because methods of financing vary and so do clinical practices and medical costs <e> <s> the government are taking full account of this report and are taking all the necessary steps <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not discussing the social security bill in this question <e> <s> examples of what we are doing to promote healthier eating habits include the revising of our guidance to hospitals and local authorities on catering to reflect recommendations in the coma report on diet and cardiovascular disease <e> <s> the hec has issued general guidance on a healthy diet <e> <s> in conjunction with a planned television series on healthier eating we are issuing new guidance for the general public on nutrition and we are encouraging the food industry to make available a variety of foods with lower saturated fat and lower salt contents <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn we have endorsed the general aims of the strategy the main strands of which are totally in keeping with united kingdom health policies <e> <s> we have not yet had time to assess fully the facultys recommendations <e> <s> many of these are not addressed to central government departments and are matters for other authorities or for the professions or teaching institutions to consider <e> <s> with regard to the statistics there is a welter of statistics which can be used to compare health outcomes <e> <s> the faculty has been very selective in what it has used <e> <s> for instance though infant mortality rates may have fallen more proportionately in other countries many countries were starting from a much worse base <e>", "<cs> my lords we have taken many steps as the noble lord will know to encourage a reduction in smoking <e> <s> some examples of this are that on st april the new voluntary agreement came into effect which considerably strengthened the rules governing tobacco advertising and promotion six new health warnings linking smoking to lung cancer and heart disease were introduced under the voluntary agreement and the duty on cigarettes was increased by a further pence in the last budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly ever disagree with the noble and learned lord and i certainly do not on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords these are two amendments to two existing regulations discussed previously <e> <s> i commend these regulations to the house and i beg to move the first of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i will of course write to the noble lord and i am very appreciative of the attitude taken by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to the second set of regulations with the first and i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a very full debate in committee about whether age relation should be introduced into the structure of national insurance rebates and dhss contributions for people who contract out of serps <e> <s> at the end of that debate your lordships views were sounded and the voting showed a clear majority in favour of the flat-rate system which the government after very careful consideration have decided to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to extend to parents who are working part time and are entitled to child benefit the special protection of serps rights which we have undertaken to provide for parents who stay at home to look after their children under age and also for disabled people and those who stay at home to look after them <e>", "<cs> my lord with the leave of the house i think i mentioned most of the arguments that the noble baroness has quoted <e> <s> however i am sure that your lordships would agree that it would be wrong to treat people in part-time work more favourably than those with the same level of average earnings derived from a lifetime of full-time work <e> <s> that would be the effect if the amendment were carried <e> <s> i think that i dealt with the other arguments during my original reply <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement on single payments being made in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows mr speaker with permission i should like to make a statement about single payments of supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start with the noble baroness lady jeger who said that we were rushing things through as indeed did the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> we announced our proposals on th february but we did not receive the report of the social security advisory committee until nd may <e> <s> since then we have been giving careful consideration to the committees report and to the representations which it received <e> <s> we have made a number of significant changes to our original proposals <e> <s> however we could not bring them before the house until we had <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had answered that we received it on a certain date i am looking back at my

clarify this point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger said earlier that they were telling people what they were entitled to <e> <s> i have a splendid letter from a lady in the north who wrote to the social security office saying that she had been urged to claim for all manner of things <e> <s> she did not want to claim for more than three very modest items <e> <s> the form filled in was clearly not filled in by her but by somebody else <e> <s> she wished to disclaim that form and claim merely for the three items that she needed <e>", "<cs> my lords for the sake of speed i shall write to the noble lord on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as the single payments scheme is in operation until the social fund takes over the single payments scheme will proceed as it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are aiming to do in income support is to set standard weekly incomes for claimants <e> <s> this is in line with the general approach in the initial scale rate now they are to meet most living expenses generally rather than to provide a detailed list of amounts for particular items <e> <s> that is a sensible approach obviously claimants actual expenditure patterns vary considerably <e> <s> but instead of the present system where we then add other individually-assessed amounts for particular further items our approach in income support is to build on the present scale rates approach by providing further general premiums for those facing particular extra pressures in families with children pensioners lone parents and disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said it will be recalled that on report when my noble friend lady faithfull tabled a similar amendment there was more than a degree of confusion over my reply <e> <s> i blush as i renew my apologies <e> <s> i have since written to a number of your lordships including of course the noble baroness lady jeger and my noble friend lady faithfull and indicated that i would put the governments position on record at third reading <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for providing me with an opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the motives that bring the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs to move this amendment today <e> <s> it is an interesting approach to the issues we discussed very recently <e> <s> but i have to say that it is an approach i cannot commend to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords we are considering most urgently the amendments to which your lordships agreed in committee and which established the right of appeal to social security appeal tribunals <e> <s> we are looking very closely at the arguments put forward by your lordships at that time <e> <s> in those circumstances i can have no objection to your lordships amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> if i may term it in that way we are now heading for the last round-up <e> <s> a total of hours in the commons and approximately in your lordships house add up to a hard-fought bill <e> <s> during the passage of the bill we have shown that if we can make improvements to our proposals without sacrificing the principles behind them we have been ready to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i was most grateful to the noble lord lord henderson for his acknowledgment that his previous amendment was too wide in its context <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson has moved amendment no <e> <s> a and has spoken to the two following amendments <e> <s> the first two of these amendments seek to write into the bill that the amount of the premium shall be determined by the severity of the disablement and the assessment of this shall be set out in regulations <e> <s> the third introduces a factor for the calculation of the amount which means regard has to be paid to the costs of a severely disabled person in a household and the costs of a severely disabled person in residential care <e> <s> these amendments are all attempts to put more detail in the bill on the nature of the additional premium and how it will be calculated <e> <s> your lordships will notice that our intention is that the first qualifying condition for the additional premium is that is should be payable to claimants in receipt of the higher rate of attendance allowance <e> <s> these are the type of severely disabled people about whom the greatest concern was expressed <e> <s> but we are managing to assist these people without a separate complicated assessment of disablement solely directed to one small element of the income support scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree to the commons amendment numbered to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no

claimed that the measure will have dire consequences for poor households <e> <s> we should be clear that we are talking about benefit rates to be set at the uprating as i said that is due to take place in the autumn of not at the next uprating <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder in moving amendment no <e> <s> a and speaking to amendment no <e> <s> is asking the house to reinstate the changes made here at committee stage and third reading <e> <s> at the same time the noble lord is seeking to correct an anomaly in the bill as it left this house <e> <s> at that stage the bill would have provided for two parallel routes for a dissenting applicant in any one case both an appeal tribunal and an inspectors review <e> <s> that would clearly not have been satisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord therefore proposes to delete the references in the bill to social fund inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had gone on long enough but i have all the information for the noble lord <e> <s> where the social fund officer cannot satisfy the applicants objections by looking at the papers we intend that the applicant will be invited to an interview where the whole case can be talked through in detail and any new information brought to light <e> <s> the social fund officers manager will then decide the case taking into account all the information that has so far been gathered <e> <s> where the individual is still dissatisfied he will have a right to a review by a social fund inspector <e> <s> however the question of how inspectors will conduct their reviews is one for discussion with the social fund commissioner <e> <s> we would not exclude discussing with him the possibility that if the inspector felt that he needed to seek further information from the applicant face to face the inspector might arrange to interview the applicant and his representative again <e>", "<cs> my lords there could be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do not insist on their amendment no to which the commons have disagreed and do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i pointed out that the appeal committee would consist of people who had nothing to do with the local fpcs and furthermore those who were pharmacists would not have the right to vote <e> <s> but the important point is that they would come from places far distant from the local committees <e>", "<cs> like journalists my lords <e>", "<cs> correct <e>", "<cs> i agree with the assumption of the noble lord lord ennals and the noble lord lord kilmarnock that the tragedy of stanley royd was a factor which contributed to the legislation in part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> with regard to the first of my noble friends supplementary questions the government attach great importance to the public education campaign <e> <s> we are concerned that it should be run as efficiently and effectively as possible <e> <s> no decision has been taken to set up a separate body to run the campaign <e> <s> as regards the screening of visitors to the united kingdom i do not have at my fingertips information about france or saudi arabia <e> <s> there has been much press speculation about this matter <e> <s> i can confirm that the present position is that visitors or for that matter those returning to the united kingdom are not screened for aids and that the government have taken no decision to introduce such screening in the future <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn at the end of september there were cases of whom have died <e> <s> the estimated number of those infected with the virus is about <e> <s> the number of cases may be doubling roughly every months but it is difficult to make longer

to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why drug addicts share contaminated needles <e> <s> it may be because drug addiction is illegal and underground and therefore needles are shared in a clandestine manner <e> <s> i did know about the baby <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation in prisons is no different from that in the outside world <e> <s> aids is not highly infectious and dedicated isolation units are not considered appropriate for aids patients <e> <s> the wide spectrum of illness associated with the infection requires the use of normal district general hospital in-patient and out-patient facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government-funded medical research council is responsible for co-ordinating research on aids in the united kingdom <e> <s> at present special project grants have been awarded at a total cost of about million <e> <s> that includes a contribution from health departments of up to per annum for epidemiological research and for the new united kingdom centre for co-ordinating epidemiological research on aids <e>", "<cs> my lords the screening of visitors whether on a comprehensive or selective basis would involve a number of formidable practical problems and its effectiveness as a method of combating the spread of aids in this country has been questioned by medical experts <e> <s> all the relevant factors will be examined before any decision on this matter is made <e>", "<cs> no my lords we are not inhibited <e> <s> one of the valuable contributions that the voluntary organisations including the gay community can make is by spreading

are following that up through the regional review machinery <e> <s> in answer to the second part of the noble lords question hip operations are performed by orthopaedic surgeons and not rheumatologists <e>", "<cs> my lords it is simply not possible to have a consultant in every specialty in every district <e> <s> in some districts a rheumatology service can be provided in other ways for instance by a general physician with a special interest in rheumatology <e> <s> as i said in my original answer it is for health authorities to plan in detail what services to provide and what staff they need to provide them <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord lord winstanley said about radiologists in the context of the question though i think he will agree that the subject of radiology is for another day <e> <s> the governments policy on medical manpower is to increase the proportion of medical care provided by fully trained doctors and to relate the number of training grade posts to the career opportunities expected to arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a table of consultant rheumatology posts <e> <s> i shall gladly place a copy of it in the library <e> <s> there are now more consultants in that speciality than there were in an increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> health authorities forward plans suggest that that rate of expansion may be maintained or

attention <e> <s> the government cannot plan in detail how local services are to be provided that is for health authorities <e> <s> in the last resort the need for additional medical staff as opposed

complete remedial action <e> <s> i repeat that since that time there has been no indication of an increase in the number of crown notices issued <e>", "<cs> we responded to a strong sense of need from

pharmacists representatives <e> <s> this amendment would restrict unnecessarily any such negotiations <e>", "<cs> let me go back to something that the noble lord lord ennals said <e> <s> he is mistaken <e> <s> only one element of the new contract has been brought before parliament and that is the control of entry provisions <e> <s> if i may go back to what i originally said it was that in scotland there is no basic practice allowance and that they were managing okay without it <e> <s> the financially enhanced essential small pharmacies scheme will give essential small pharmacies a guaranteed minimum income <e> <s> it is a matter of separate negotiation in scotland and therefore there would be a different conclusion <e> <s> but under the new contract and i fear that i am repeating myself pharmacies will be encouraged to be more efficient through the changes in the patterns of remuneration <e> <s> the point is that for two years if they see themselves as not being

arisen during this debate <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne quoted me as saying let those who know best and that was directed towards the fpcs in deciding on their locality and the services

again at the system of payments to pharmacists who wished to relinquish their nhs contract or to relocate their business to areas where they could better serve patient needs <e> <s> the aim was to ensure that the incentive payments scheme will work as intended and that there will be adequate safeguards against abuse <e> <s> possible extra safeguards were considered including changing the

he did look at it again most carefully and he was not of a mind to introduce any extra safeguards <e> <s> i rest by that decision <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat that i think there are sufficient safeguards already <e>", "<cs> in july the then minister for health announced two changes to the appeals procedure as originally proposed <e> <s> one of those changes was that members and chairmen of

the new section can only confer rights of appeal they cannot take away any right which someone may have to apply to a court <e> <s> for example they could not take away a persons right to ask for leave to apply for a judicial review if he felt that an appeal panel had made a decision which was bad in law as opposed to a decision with which he simply disagreed <e> <s> if there had been maladministration in the handling of an appeal there is a right to go to the ombudsman <e> <s> the amendment says that the regulations cannot do something which they cannot do anyway and therefore it is superfluous <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord takes my point <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord winstanley makes any comment let me just say yes <e>", "<cs> actually i would rather like to hear what the noble lord lord ennals has to say first <e> <s> i suggest that the noble lord lord winstanley reads very carefully what i have said <e> <s> if it is not clear to him then perhaps he will get in touch with me <e>", "<cs> before i answer the noble lord lord ennals perhaps i may say that the noble lord lord ross has been most frightfully decent <e> <s> however he must not forget that he is talking to a campbell-harris even though he has not got a scottish minister so do not let us think it is all south of the border here <e>", "<cs> i submit that amendment no <e> <s> is unnecessary for two main reasons <e> <s> first regulations will not be laid immediately because time is needed to prepare a national list of appeals panel members for the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> family practitioner committees will need to have that list before or at least soon after the new arrangements come into force <e> <s> secondly assuming parliamentary approval is given to clause there will need to be full consultations with the organisations which represent those most affected by the new arrangements on proposed regulations and draft guidance to fpcs <e> <s> therefore there will be plenty of further opportunity for the views of those organisations to be made known and considered <e>", "<cs> dealing first with amendment no <e> <s> to be fair and reasonable to the contractor professions means that we may have to take into account the position of the new contractor when considering past overpayments <e> <s> that is why clause has been included in the bill <e> <s> it would allow the determining authority when considering a past overpayment to have regard to the period for which a contractor had provided services <e> <s> subsection would also allow us to make a necessary distinction between the different professions to take into account their different remuneration systems <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may immediately apologise to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> at first sight the aims of the first amendment that we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> appear to be eminently reasonable <e> <s> i have much sympathy with those aims <e> <s> however when one examines more closely the effects that this amendment would have as i hope to explain to my noble friend lord mottistone a number of difficulties emerge <e> <s> first because the remuneration of all the contractor professions includes a number of different elements arriving at the right amount to be paid becomes a complex process <e> <s> therefore it is not always possible to implement an adjustment to take into account an earlier incorrect determination within two years <e> <s> for example under the balancing arrangements of the doctors and dentists review body for doctors and the dental rate study group for dentists it is not uncommon for the need for such an adjustment to take three years to come to light and no one would accuse the ddrb of skulduggery <e>", "<cs> ignoring the noble lords irrelevant remarks let me try to make the position clear <e> <s> we are not changing past settlements <e> <s> the fact that future fees reflect past under payments or overpayments is part of the remuneration system <e> <s> our underlying aim is to be reasonable and evenhanded in our dealings on the professions remuneration <e> <s> the parties involved in negotiations might have produced a mistaken result compared with what they had intended becuase of for example an incorrect forecast of costs <e> <s> if either the taxpayer owes the profession money or the profession owes the taxpayer money that should be put right <e>", "<cs> correct <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his amendment i still think i am right to stress the underpayment as well as the overpayment <e> <s> if the thoughts of the noble lord lord ennals were followed through that would mean that people who had been underpaid would equally suffer <e> <s> the adjustment of overpayment and underpayment on fees is the subject of discussion between the dhss and the opticians representatives and i really cannot preempt those discussions <e>", "<cs> if this amendment was accepted i can imagine the long arguments that would no doubt take place <e> <s> was the information available at the time of the earlier determination <e> <s> could it have been made available <e> <s> did the determining authority know about it <e> <s> is this old information re-presented as new information <e> <s> some of the data used in considering levels of remuneration are very complex even given the use of modern technology <e> <s> it could prove difficult to resolve what was and what was not new <e>", "<cs> it has been said on a number of occasions when this bill has been debated that the government are firmly committed to full and fair negotiations and consultations with the contractor professions <e> <s> indeed the health and social security act introduced a requirement for consultation before remuneration is fixed <e> <s> the need to act fairly and reasonably when considering remuneration for the contractor professions is a need of which this government are fully aware <e> <s> the secretary of state accepts that he must act reasonably when fixing remuneration just as he must act reasonably when exercising any other similar discretionary power <e> <s> while the government accept the need to consult and the need to act reasonably we do not see the need for this amendment which is i have to tell my noble friend unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my department is not party to the dispute in any way nor has the department been informed by either side of the causes of the dispute <e> <s> but we understand that a proposal by hanger management for a substantial increase in productivity at the factory triggered the action <e> <s> my departments concern is with the services to patients <e> <s> we have therefore inquired of hanger management orally and in writing what action is being taken to maintain supply and what if any long-term plans are being made <e> <s> the company has refused to reply substantively to either approach <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the noble lord lord cledwyn brings me back to my original answer <e> <s> the dispute is a matter for the company and its employees <e> <s> it is not the result of any action taken by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that vessa and hanger have initiated legal proceedings against the government to compel them to give further contracts on the same terms as in <e> <s> those terms were roundly criticised by the mccoll report <e> <s> we cannot intervene in the dispute under those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords our main responsibility is to make sure that the effects of the dispute at hangers roehampton factory on the service to patients in the country as a whole is minimal with a relatively small number of appointments being cancelled <e> <s> we do not envisage any amputee being left immobile as a result of the j e hanger dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the remarks of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the early part of the noble lords question the departments guidance to health authorities is that all women who are or have been sexually active should be screened every five years irrespective of age <e> <s> however per cent <e> <s> of deaths occur in women aged or over and screening for this age group remains a priority <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to computerised call and recall systems we are closely monitoring health authorities progress towards achieving implementation no later than march <e> <s> as at st march health authorities had implemented such systems plan to do so during and in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i answered the first part of the question by my noble friend lady macleod in answer to a previous supplementary question <e> <s> i said that we were certainly keen that all women should be screened <e> <s> with regard to paying extra to doctors who screen women surely as a gp the doctor is responsible for the whole of each patients health <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most anxious that this screening should be available to all women for whom it is considered necessary that the screening should take place <e> <s> we would do everything we could to encourage employers <e> <s> but in the end it is up to each employer <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot clarify the question of payment <e> <s> however i am aware of research work in which it has been suggested that there could be an increase in deaths <e> <s> this underlines the importance of improving the effectiveness of the screening programme <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> it is difficult to persuade women <e> <s> we believe that younger women can do a lot by asking their relatives to be screened <e> <s> we believe that doctors can do the most by encouraging their patients to be screened <e> <s> we believe that knowledge on a local basis and local advocacy of screening is the most effective <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness lady seear looks at my original reply she will see that i said that whether or not women are working outside the home in other words women who are working in the home are still working women so far as i am concerned appointments are generally available outside working hours <e> <s> there are a great many different options as to where they can have the smears taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree that that is another question entirely <e> <s> but i do not see why the women involved should not take advantage of the options outside working hours <e> <s> if they have their smears taken during working hours it is surely better for the employer to lose a little time and it does not take very long to have a smear test than to have one of his workers away very ill <e>", "<cs> my lords all women should be told how to get the result of their tests <e> <s> we are currently consulting the medical profession on draft guidelines on the follow-up of abnormal smears <e>", "<cs> my lords we are closely monitoring health authorities performance to ensure that laboratories can meet demand and avoid backlog <e> <s> health authorities annual outturn reports show that at st march i have already indicated this to the noble lord lord ennals out of a total of district health authorities health authorities served by laboratories had backlogs that exceeded one months work <e> <s> problems in individual laboratories are a matter for local management <e> <s> regional health authorities will ensure that remedial action is taken before they report to us again <e>", "<cs> my lords if i agree with nothing else that the noble baroness lady jeger has said i certainly agree with her about the temperature of this chamber which seems to be overly warm this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first point made by my noble friend i think he has said it all himself and i gladly agree with his words <e> <s> on the second point as the person responsible for war pensioners i am particularly pleased to have noted in the statement and i hope that other noble lords and noble baronesses will echo my great pleasure that the worries of the charges for a funeral and having to have it done through the department have now been relieved <e> <s> that is a step that i know my friends in the war pensions world will greatly welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather puzzled when the noble baroness lady jeger spoke about my having said there would be a debate because at that time all i had done was to repeat a statement <e> <s> in no way could i have said that there was to be a debate <e> <s> that does not lie in my gift anyway <e> <s> it is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the same point applies to the way that statements appear before your lordships <e> <s> that too is a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> this year we have effectively had two up-ratings in a year and it is for that reason that the level of the up-rating is less than the per cent <e> <s> annual rate of

debates <e> <s> i feel sure that the noble lord lord wallace will speak to the usual channels and it will be arranged in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal first with the question of finance health authorities are best placed within the framework of national priority to judge local needs and circumstances <e> <s> authorities have been told to attach a high priority to improving their cervical screening programmes <e> <s> they have the resources for example million extra cash for plus over million from cost improvement programmes <e> <s> improvements to cervical cancer screening are not expensive <e> <s> the remaining district health authorities can computerise for only million in and <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the question of call and recall is one that is actively occupying the minds of health authorities and the government <e> <s> the government have issued instructions to health authorities that call and recall systems should be implemented as quickly and efficiently as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords that is still a matter for local authorities and we are doing the best we can with waiting lists which is a different subject from the question on the order paper today <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the administration committee of your lordships house has this matter under active consideration <e> <s> the committee is considering the possibility of

job is to see that all authorities match the standard of the best <e> <s> more authorities are directly making improvements to their programmes and we have now told all of them to give cervical cancer screening a higher priority in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the figures last week <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to laboratory staff authorities are recruiting more staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for raising that point and yes i am satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords the government oppose these amendments because they are not necessary and because the present provision is clear in its purpose and easier to understand <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals is concerned that the bill as drafted puts the onus on the applicant to show to the family practitioner committees satisfaction that it is necessary or desirable for the application to be granted <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> there will be an onus on the applicant to prepare his application in the most effective way to maximise his chances of success <e> <s> there is nothing out of the ordinary in that but there will also be a different type of onus on the fpc subcommittee that considers the application <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have the last word on this <e> <s> there is no presumption against new applications in the bill as drafted <e> <s> by phrasing the relevant provision in a negative rather than a positive way refuse rather than grant the onus would revert back to the decision-making body and i think any fears expressed by the noble lord lord ennals are groundless for the reasons which i gave earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords may i do something rather unconventional <e> <s> we may take a bit more time on this group of amendments and

perhaps i may put forward our proposals in amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal immediately with the last point made by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> first of all the community health councils will be perfectly at liberty and i hope that they will do so to put an input into the family practitioner sub-committee on this subject before the sub-committee ever meets to consider the necessity or otherwise for a future pharmacy <e> <s> there is no question that they do not have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris says that he is offering me an olive branch <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is trying to offer me an apple <e> <s> i resent greatly the derogatory remarks that he made at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord lord harris is wrong to say that national health service pharmacy numbers fell until last year when they started to go up just because control of entry was imminent <e> <s> numbers of nhs pharmacies started to rise significantly from onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the last part of what my noble friend asks it is very unlikely that large multiples will be interested in less fashionable sites such as rural areas or suburban housing estates <e> <s> it is extremely important that those areas should be as well served as the areas where large multiples can and will take advantage of the system <e> <s> the government cannot support such a change <e> <s> to develop a better pharmaceutical service a better use of the pharmacists skills and better value for

lords i am glad to answer my noble friend lord cullen <e> <s> as i said in committee such an amendment would open the way for more arguments and would prove to be too restrictive <e> <s> i can see the arguments that would take place on whether or not information was or could have been available to the determining authority at the time of the earlier determination <e> <s> there could also be occasions when both the determining authority and the profession wished to use information previously disregarded if better information was not forthcoming <e>", "<cs> in reply to my noble friend i hope he will apreciate that i am using the plainest of plain words <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the latter part of my noble friends supplementary question i entirely agree with her that neighbours and friends can be of great help <e> <s> we believe that more can be done through both local and national courses and through conferences which are multidisciplinary <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services announced on th october the setting up of two multidisciplinary social worker health <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly comment on particular cases but i am satisfied that either by the application of child care legislation or with the assistance of police social workers are able to gain access to any child if necessary <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble lord in paying tribute to social workers who i believe have a raw deal often and who do a magnificent job <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my noble friends question on monitoring and research my department published in <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lords question boils down to is what more can be done to prevent child abuse <e> <s> i agree that more can be done <e> <s> much is being done <e> <s> unfortunately in the imperfect world in which we live we cannot eliminate child abuse <e> <s> we must encourage and help parents to care properly

of abuse <e> <s> but the organisation exists to ensure that help and protection are provided <e>", "<cs> my lords this support is greatly welcomed and my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for health said when she launched the self-help family centres on th october <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the legislative aspect of the noble lords question legislation will be introduced as soon as time can be found in the parliamentary timetable <e> <s> he will be aware that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services announced on th october grants totalling to

hospital are immediate and many of those on the waiting list already have a planned date of admission <e> <s> to some extent waiting lists represent the problems of success <e> <s> the wider range of treatments available greater life expectancy and the increasing proportion of old people have all added to peoples expectations and thus their demands on the national health service <e> <s> but of course we want shorter waiting lists <e> <s> that is why this government have concentrated the attention of health authorities upon the need to make the best possible use of resources <e> <s> this is one of the major tasks facing management <e>", "<cs> my lords on th september and i am doing a comparison with there were people on the in-patient waiting list for all specialties some fewer than in

use disposable syringes supplies can be arranged through the hospital service <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just indicate where our priorities lie <e> <s> we give very high priority to making

ministerial colleagues are aware of the strong feelings that have been expressed by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind my noble friend that many people do not pay for prescriptions anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are not convinced that there is a problem i see little reason for a symbol which may not be understood or obeyed or worst of all may lead to the patient

quickly and easily <e> <s> the remaining are paid by local offices and resources are simply not available to carry out the massive task of searching million records held in local offices <e>", "<cs> my lords we announced the st december deadline on th july and have since given wide publicity which produced a considerable response <e> <s> those claiming after st december will still if they fulfil the usual conditions be able to claim months arrears <e> <s> the government are not persuaded that the extra statutory concession for longer arrears should be continued after this month <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady jeger whom i nearly always respect is not fair in her assumptions <e> <s> picture a young married couple with an average mortgage the husband works overtime for a few hours to pay the bills and the wife may work part time for a few luxuries <e> <s> then as so often happens a baby arrives <e> <s> also perhaps there may not be so much overtime around for the husband to take advantage of <e> <s> what do they do if they cannot meet the mortgage payments <e> <s> they have to go to a building society or a bank to try to make some sort of arrangement <e> <s> is it fair that a family in a similar situation but receiving supplementary benefit perhaps not much below the wages in my example should be cushioned for the relatively short period they are on benefit <e> <s> the working family would certainly not think it fair <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> if i may continue weeks is a significant reduction and a much lesser impact on individuals will result <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks suggested that the proposals would worsen work incentives <e> <s> we acknowledge that the proposals will marginally reduce the incentive to return to work for those on benefits for more than four months but many people do not stay on benefit that long <e> <s> the changes should improve short-term incentives and incentives to remain in low paid work <e> <s> and the eight week linking rule should encourage people to work without affecting their benefit if the job turns out to be unsuitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am probably technically out of order even in replying <e> <s> but i cannot resist doing so because the noble lord lord sefton seems to feel that he has the monopoly of compassion <e> <s> i tell him that even those who compile statistics have compassion and know understand and realise in many cases what it is like for people to lose their job <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there are many different methods which can be applied and of course those will depend on the particular hospital nursing home or community which the nurses are visiting or are working in or out of <e> <s> local health authorities have taken many different measures including the employment of safety guards the installation of closed circuit television and panic alarms and rearranging duties in order to reduce waiting times <e> <s> however probably the most effective measure is proper training reinforced at regular intervals in the management of aggression <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the figures vary considerably <e> <s> i also urge nurses to please come forward and report any incidents of violence either physical or verbal which they may have undergone because it is very difficult for us to make a whole picture when we believe that many incidents are not reported <e>", "<cs> my lords funding is not a problem <e> <s> health authorities introduce security measures from within their existing resources <e> <s> i would add that there are very many reasons for violence <e>", "<cs> my lords from my particular situation i can only take note of the remarks of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the exact figures because as i said nurses do not always report cases of assault <e> <s> they sometimes feel that it is all part of their job <e> <s> i hope they will cease to think that and will come forward <e> <s> i cannot remember the other part of my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it is impossible to give numbers owing to the indefinite information <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that young inexperienced nurses working in accident emergency or psychiatric units and also ambulance personnel are among the most vulnerable <e> <s> i feel that this is a matter for future recruitment and i take note of my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords there are so many different kinds of cases and it should be remembered that everyone is capable of becoming aggressive <e> <s> the majority of assaults on nurses take place at the hands of people under the influence of drink or are psychiatric patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that again this depends on where the courses are held <e> <s> there is some training given in the handling of aggression during the basic nurse training <e> <s> where local situations demand it some health authorities are arranging further training for their staff <e> <s> on a national basis this month the nhs training authority is piloting a multidisciplinary training course on the handling of aggression <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that may be one of the questions that will be examined by the committee which i am to chair and which will have its first meeting at the end of this month <e> <s> we shall certainly be looking into this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords the way in which care is provided by health authorities for aids patients is a matter for them to decide in the context of their planning arrangements <e> <s> the majority of hospital admissions of aids patients result from opportunistic infections which can be dealt with by the appropriate medical specialty <e> <s> there is also evidence that for much of his illness an aids patient can be treated in a community setting <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know aids patients at the moment are not spread widely around the country they are somewhat pocketed <e> <s> it will be a matter for health authorities to decide when they should appoint such people if they wish to appoint them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows we have apportioned extra money for <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of costing is in many ways still in its early stages <e> <s> from the point of view of expenditure we expect health authorities to spend some million on tackling the problem of aids in the current financial year <e> <s> in this should increase to million <e> <s> a further million will be spent in this financial year rising to million next year on publicity for the public health laboratory service and research funded directly by the department of health <e> <s> also the medical research council is allocating million to special projects concerning aids <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy will no doubt be aware that there is a leaflet drop to million households today and following through this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that my noble friend the leader of the house is chairing a committee <e> <s> i do not think it would be for me to comment on his reporting <e> <s> i might add that the secretary of state at his press conference on th january announced that he proposes to convene a conference on the provision of care for aids sufferers outside hospital which will bring together a great many bodies and will be able to identify more clearly what our priorities and our response should be in the years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never known the box so near <e> <s> my noble friend will i believe report from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to screening we are carefully considering the many complex and difficult issues that arise both domestically and internationally with regard to the screening of entrants to the uk or indeed of any group for instance of entrants to particular employments like the armed forces <e> <s> these are far from straightforward <e> <s> the implications are profound both for individuals identified as carriers and for the general public <e> <s> those who have probed the issues will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to gaze into a crystal ball <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome help from all voluntary and other bodies and we are in touch with them as much as possible <e> <s> if they let us know of their efforts we will gladly be in touch with them <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the cost of extra doctors and nurses over per cent <e> <s> of aids patients are being cared for in three thames health regions <e> <s> in the light of this the government are considering the level of resources which they should receive in <e> <s> it is for health authorities to decide how any sums should be spent and what training staff should receive <e> <s> that includes looking out for the dangers to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are constantly looking into the cost <e> <s> they are also making available a great deal of money in the immediate present and looking into future needs to see what costings they will have to make <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the five-year-olds we considered the point carfully <e> <s> but in the light of the improvements which we have already made for this group automatic entitlement to a heating addition and an increase in the value of their scale rate of over a quarter we could not give the matter priority <e> <s> i would point out to the noble baroness that the amount spent in was about million annually compared to spending by the last labour government of under million <e>", "<cs> my lords the weather stations were chosen after consultation with the meteorological office <e> <s> we have concentrated on stations where information can be provided quickly to enable help to be assessed as near as possible to the time of bad weather <e> <s> ssac has commented that our proposals are manifestly an improvement on past methods <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking the problem of hypothermia very seriously but the underlying causes are uncertain <e> <s> we are therefore studying the available information closely <e> <s> we need the right information to produce the right effective policy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that an absolute standard means that help will go to places where at any one time it is actually coldest <e> <s> that seems to me wholly reasonable <e> <s> ssac firmly supports an absolute standard <e> <s> when there was a comparative system in it was heavily criticised particularly in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord exaggerated greatly in the first part of his question <e> <s> on the second part i would say we are already closely in touch with all the voluntary organisations with whom we are working agreeably <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important that i tell the noble lord that advertisements including claim forms will appear in the national press this week <e> <s> revised instructions have been issued to local offices on publicity when the conditions for payment are met <e> <s> this includes local press advertisements and a wide distribution of a specific leaflet both containing the claim form for help <e> <s> i doubt whether any scheme will ever be seen as fully satisfactory <e> <s> we have devised a system which provides a reasonable solution judged over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords the savings comes into the question because the people who are entitled to receive severe winter payments are those who are on supplementary benefit <e> <s> one might spare a thought for those who are just above the level of supplementary benefit <e> <s> the level was raised from to but there has to be a limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the information provided <e>", "<cs> my lords although the debate has been short the subject is of enormous interest to everyone in the country as actual or potential beneficiaries or as contributors to national insurance <e> <s> i am not sure whether your lordships have appreciated being able to consider both sides of the benefit balance sheet together but i hope that you may do <e> <s> it is a sensible procedure and reduces the burden on the house by making one debate out of two <e> <s> by the time we next debate these annual instruments we shall be faced with fewer motions <e> <s> when the up-rating legislation contained in the social security act comes fully into force it will incorporate all benefit up-ratings in one order <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that the remuneration of staff midwives and of midwifery sisters is determined in the light of the recommendations of the independent review body on the pay of nurses midwives and health visitors <e> <s> each year economic financial and other information such as recruitment and retention levels are given to the review body by staff organisations nhs management and the health departments <e> <s> it is for the review body to make judgments <e> <s> as the review body is even now engaged on reviewing the pay of nurses midwives and health visitors your lordships will not expect me to influence its recommendations by expressing an opinion on current pay levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine my reply to the question of midwifery tutors <e> <s> the reported shortfalls of midwifery tutors in some parts of the country may still be partly due to a requirement introduced in that midwives must undertake an advanced diploma course in midwifery before being eligible to take the tutor training course <e> <s> however the nursing and midwifery staffs negotiating council has reached an agreement on a more flexible grading structure for senior tutors and this may make a teaching career more attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of groups within nursing and midwifery and i am sure that the noble lord lord molloy will agree on this point which argue that their particular skills or responsibilities deserve extra financial or grading recognition <e> <s> the jobs of midwives health visitors intensive care unit nurses special care baby unit nurses theatre staff and so on are difficult and demanding as are all nursing jobs <e> <s> the right way is not to look at any one group in isolation but to consider them all in the grading review <e> <s> it will be for the review body to make recommendations on appropriate salary levels <e>", "<cs> my lords the advanced diploma in midwifery can be regarded as a means of enhancing a midwifes career prospects in clinical and managerial as well as tutorial fields <e> <s> we consider that the responsibility for funding these courses should for the time being remain with health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if my noble friend was having a baby he would need a midwife <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer there are reported difficulties in recruiting midwives in some localities but there is no evidence that there is a national problem <e> <s> the result of a sample survey of english health authorities for the review body for nursing staff midwives and health visitors showed that at march only about per cent <e> <s> of whole-time equivalent funded posts for midwives remained vacant for more than three months compared with the average of per cent <e> <s> for nursing and midwifery staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot specify the rural areas <e> <s> as i originally said we realise that there is a shortage in some places but i have not been given the information as to which places <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that perhaps the review body will read <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory serves me right i think that i have met one male midwife <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all credit should go to the government for listening and for adopting a flexible approach to an everchanging and difficult situation <e> <s> however no amount of explanation seems to enable some people to understand that the main help with heating is in the scale rates and regular weekly additions <e> <s> the statement refers to an extra amount now likely to be paid more frequently than under any other previous system <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lady in england only three areas sunderland berwick and whitehaven would not have qualified under the december rules <e> <s> i might as well put in wales where there was only one caernarvon <e> <s> all the remaining areas in great britain that would not have qualified are in scotland <e> <s> this simply reflects the fact that most recently conditions have been milder in scotland <e> <s> on sunday the mean temperature in glasgow was degree above freezing in birmingham it was degrees below freezing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all your lordships would agree that the hospice movement does wonderful work in caring for the dying <e> <s> the level of spending in support of an individual hospice must be a matter for local health authorities <e> <s> thirty-eight hospices are now entirely supported by local health authorities <e> <s> where a hospice plays an essential part in a health authoritys overall plans for terminal care services we are asking health authorities to make an appropriate financial contribution <e> <s> the relative costs of hospice and hospital care will depend upon the needs of the particular patient <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services intends to hold a conference before easter on the provision of care outside hospital for aids sufferers <e> <s> it will bring together the experience of those <e>", "<cs> my lords many health authorities local authority social services departments and voluntary bodies are already working together to provide care for terminally ill patients in their own homes as well as in hospices and hospitals <e> <s> as i said the nhs itself runs hospices as well as contributing towards the cost of many of the voluntary units <e> <s> we shall shortly be issuing new guidance to all health authorities asking them to review their services for the terminally ill and to plan to rectify any deficiencies in collaboration with the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to a register it is important that local people should know what is provided locally <e> <s> it is useless for someone who lives for example in canterbury and who wishes to go to a hospice to know that there is a hospice in glasgow <e> <s> it is the local picture that is most important <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we are discussing through the means of this conference the various ways and means in which we can improve care for the terminally ill <e> <s> i am sure that training will form <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that a variety of methods of care is needed for aids patients <e> <s> it is not necessary for them to be in hospital for the whole of their illness <e> <s> they may need very specialised care which can only be provided by a hospital <e> <s> they may prefer to be in a hospice for different reasons <e> <s> there is also care in their own homes where many sufferers may prefer to be looked after <e> <s> a variety is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have are todays figures <e> <s> there have been cases of aids of whom have died <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an awful feeling that the figure of should have been <e> <s> i apologise if there has been a slip-up in the correspondence from that point of view <e> <s> there are about hospice units in the united kingdom with between two and beds <e> <s> thirty-eight of those units are nhs-run but they may still receive some voluntary income <e>", "<cs> my lords the last commission was in which is not so very long ago <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree with the noble earl that things have got much worse in the last years <e> <s> two hundred years ago lord mansfield defined the liberty of the press as in being able <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish <e> <s> of course we would look again if there were genuine widespread public dissatisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords my immediate reaction to that is that in some way it would be a muzzling of the press to which i spoke earlier <e> <s> however i shall pass on the noble lords remarks to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord on the timing of his question <e> <s> community health councils will naturally be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two reasons why this approval has taken longer than we would normally expect <e> <s> first the health authorities concerned applied to the department for a central grant towards the medical teaching aspects of the scheme and it has taken a considerable time to secure evidence that such a grant could be justified <e> <s> secondly the department has also had to be satisfied that approving this scheme would not prejudice the outcome of another current proposal for a hospital development in an adjacent district health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a great believer in liaison with staff over any developments in their districts and regions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know there are two main acute hospitals chase farm and the highland <e> <s> both provide a range of general acute services <e> <s> accident and emergency services are available at chase farm which will also provide the districts maternity services <e> <s> acute surgery will be provided in the new teaching hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords mrsa has spread widely throughout hospitals in london and to a much lesser extent elsewhere <e> <s> for the edification of your lordships i have placed a copy of a fact sheet on mrsa in the library today <e>", "<cs> my lords high standards of hygiene for both patients and staff are very important for control <e> <s> all staff and patients moving between hospitals known to have a current outbreak of mrsa should be checked to see whether they are carriers <e> <s> thorough cleaning of infected wards is an important preventative measure <e> <s> infection control nurses have an increasingly vital role to play in the maintenance of hygiene standards <e> <s> their primary duty is the prevention of infection in hospitals through effective liaison with all levels of hospital staff including the organisation of training programmes for health care workers <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will of course be aware that the law on crown immunity has been changed <e> <s> environmental health officers will be visiting hospitals as they have always had the right to do in the past <e> <s> but it would be only sensible for hospitals themselves to take all possible precautions and of course to accept any expert advice that is offered to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the present position is that hospitals have reported isolated mrsa <e> <s> about hospitals have a continuing and serious problem <e> <s> although mrsa has spread it has done so fairly slowly and some hospitals appear to have been able to contain and eradicate the strain <e> <s> sporadic mrsa of other types continues to occur at a low frequency <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the exact number of deaths <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes i shall write to him <e> <s> however i believe that there were very few <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may write to the noble lord <e> <s> alternatively i suggest that he looks at the fact sheet <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the house why some strains have become resistant to antibiotics if that is helpful <e> <s> a naturally occurring strain of methicillin resistant <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord ennals and to the noble lord <e> <s> lord winstanley for their welcome to our initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington <e> <s> i will make sure that my right honourable friend is informed of this aspect <e> <s> i have a feeling that the noble lords worries are needless <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered reducing the period for screening <e> <s> at the moment we are not convinced that this is necessary <e> <s> the most important factor is that gps invite their patients to be screened <e> <s> the best way that this can be done is on a local basis <e> <s> it is extremely important that women take up the offers and facilities which are already available for them for screening <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point extra money comes from the allocation from the department of education and science <e> <s> as i said in the statement both the dhss and the des will be monitoring what goes on in the mrc research <e> <s> however the funding has been provided on the basis that the mrc asked for it <e> <s> it has obtained what it wants and there is no question of any treasury input into the ifs and buts of the sum of money which i have announced <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember the exchange between the noble lord lord graham and myself on the matter <e> <s> there is no reason if it suits local authorities for instance in rural areas why screening could not be done by mobile vans <e> <s> there is no reason why the mobile vans should not call at places of work if it was so wished <e> <s> it is up to the local health authorities to work out the best plan for the people who live in the area <e> <s> all areas vary <e>", "<cs> my lords it was about extra money <e> <s> the changes needed in cervical cancer screening are mainly organisational a matter of making the best use of health authority resources <e>", "<cs> i could not <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to say that i fully understand and share some of the concerns which have been so eloquently expressed by the noble baroness lady seear this evening <e> <s> the subject of benefit take-up is vitally important and i am pleased even at this late hour to have this opportunity to bring to your lordships attention some of the major steps forward which the government are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords between and thanks to the greater efficiency that this government have demanded from the nhs and the extra resources provided the number of elderly in-patient cases rose by per cent <e> <s> and elderly out-patient cases by per cent <e> <s> services in the-community have been developed to help old people to live in their own homes as most of them wish to do <e> <s> between and the number of elderly people treated by district nurses rose by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords reasons for change include the shift from unsuitable long-stay institutions to more suitable care in the community involving the loss since of beds mental handicap and mental illness beds <e> <s> there have also been changes in technique involving less open surgery and more day treatment <e> <s> other factors are efficient use of resources including high turnover rates as well as care in the community policies for long-stay patients <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that the government have recently instituted a waiting list fund <e> <s> the project has been funded and the action that health authorities already have in hand should ensure that many more patients receive the treatment they need more quickly <e> <s> the most worrying excessive waiting times will be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the waiting list and the national position the latest <e>", "<cs> my lords the regions were yorkshire minus per cent north-west thames minus per cent south-east thames minus per cent south-west thames minus per cent <e> <s> south-western minus per cent <e> <s> and mersey minus per cent <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that regions not covered by the present national rawp formula will be helped by a special fund which has been announced <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be aware that a review of community care is being undertaken at the moment by sir roy griffiths <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if i pre-empted the results of his review <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as someone who is practically toeless by now and in need of urgent treatment i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i agree entirely that it is people who matter not furniture <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a bit wide of the question if i may say so <e> <s> however above all our policy is not to put people out of beds in institutions until better alternative care is ready for them <e> <s> at the moment due to our policy of care in the community there are approximately empty beds available in mental hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of doctors and dentists has increased <e> <s> there are per cent <e> <s> more gps for example and the number of nurses has increased <e> <s> there are per cent <e> <s> more district nurses and per cent <e> <s> more health visitors than there were in <e>", "<cs> my lords some deaf and blind people do qualify for mobility allowance where they suffer from balance problems and we have expanded guidance to examining doctors to ensure this fact is fully considered when determining eligibility <e> <s> proposals by the disability alliance to extend mobility allowance to deaf and blind people among others have been under consideration for some time <e> <s> we are also committed to a comprehensive review of benefits for disabled people when we have the results of a current major survey by the office of population censuses and surveys <e>", "<cs> my lords it is estimated that about deaf-and-blind people are within the age limits for mobility allowance but the number who have already qualified for the allowance is not available <e> <s> i mentioned in my original reply the steps we are taking to review the whole situation <e>", "<cs> my lords reliable informa-tion about the numbers circumstances and needs of disabled people is required before a comprehensive review of the benefits provided specifically for them can be carried out <e> <s> the review will take place when the results of the opcs survey become available <e>", "<cs> my lords the actual timing will depend on the progress that is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the very large problems of deaf-and-blind people in getting around <e> <s> when the review is undertaken i am sure that all relevant bodies will have the opportuntiy to express themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that novel suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i did say that it was estimated that there were about deaf and blind people and disabled people are currently in receipt of the allowance <e> <s> the annual cost of the allowance is around million <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the resource implications of sections and of the act covering disabled school-leavers was also discussed at the meeting with the associations to which i have referred <e> <s> it was agreed that urgent discussions with the relevant bodies should take place to identify the resource implications with a view to a further meeting between the associations and my right honourable friend in may <e>", "<cs> my lords it has also been agreed that there should be discussions at official level to make more realistic estimates of the costs not only of section but also of section of the act <e> <s> progress in those discussions will be reviewed at the meeting in may <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that the disability organisations played a significant part in obtaining support for the act during its passage through parliament <e> <s> we intend to consult with the relevant organisations where necessary on implemention of various provisions of the act at the appropriate stage <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the minister for social security and the disabled has already agreed to discuss implemention of the act with members of the steering committee established by the interested disability organisations <e> <s> we hope to arrange a meeting with them shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the then minister for social security and the disabled stated in another place on th july that it would be wrong to impose extra financial burdens on local authorities and on health authorities in order to implement those clauses which have significant resource implications until we can be sure that sufficient resources can be made available <e> <s> that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not aware of any evidence to suggest that insects have ever transmitted the virus <e> <s> your lordships may be interested to know that i opened a scientific conference on aids last friday <e> <s> during that conference one of the scientists said that efforts had been made to infect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that there are several reasons why it is not thought that mosquitoes would transmit aids <e> <s> first only a proportion of the blood cells of an infected person contain the virus <e> <s> it is therefore unlikely that the tiny quantity of blood sucked up by a mosquito would contain the virus in any quantity <e> <s> secondly there is no evidence that the virus can multiply in mosquitoes <e> <s> finally mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects bite in order to suck blood from people and animals and not to inject blood into them <e>", "<cs> my lords vampire bats and other bats can be infected by the rabies virus and can thus transmit that virus <e> <s> however bats cannot be infected with the human aids virus and it is therefore highly unlikely that blood sucking bats could transmit the virus from man to man <e> <s> there is no evidence that this has ever happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ennals for his last remarks <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state shares his view and that my colleagues and i feel exactly the same <e> <s> we are very

opposed to the outbreak which took place in your lordships house would she have informed the public health service that she had had a very unhappy illness <e> <s> there are so many people who may have

baroness that the figures which have been given are speculative <e>", "<cs> my lords this scheme is simply designed to help the industry in what are totally exceptional circumstances <e> <s> it does not constitute a precedent of any kind <e> <s> nor does it imply acceptance of any form of liability by the government for the current difficulties in the egg market <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which can be answered only by food retailers <e>", "<cs> my lords european community rules have pi ovided since for free movement of veterinary surgeons <e> <s> this is made possible by harmonisation of veterinary education standards and qualifications across the community <e>", "<cs> my lords my department is in constant touch with the veterinary profession and the rcvs <e> <s> perhaps i may say at this point and i am sure that other people will agree with me that the veterinary surgeons in this country have the highest possible qualifications and are simply splendid people <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to say that that is a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords the scheme is still being run and we do not yet have firm figures on the number of eggs destroyed under it <e> <s> it seems clear however that the number of eggs attracted by the scheme is likely to be well below the maximum provision of million cases <e> <s> final figures of uptake will be announced as soon as possible after the closure of the scheme on th january <e> <s> i have no evidence that it favoured large producers more than small ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the last words of the noble baroness <e> <s> the output of the egg industry was worth about million a year at the farm gate and possibly twice as

above that a great many other people are engaged in distributing marketing and selling eggs after they have been packed <e> <s> in the circumstances where the sale of eggs was per cent <e> <s> of the production in the week leading up to christmas the government decided that there was no alternative but to provide some short-term help <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss memory is no doubt a little longer than mine <e> <s> i am unable to give her an example but i am sure that there is a precedent for everything <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has gone far wide of the question which i

totally disagree with both premises made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not for me to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a useful debate and perhaps i may quickly try to answer some of the questions that have been raised <e> <s> nearly all of them concerned finance <e> <s> i can say that although the bill will allow the method of funding to he altered it is neutral on the question of the level of that funding <e> <s> the funds which the government provide will he channelled direct to the museum rather than to the psa <e> <s> i would add that the national maritime museum has been allocated its share of the substantial increases in building programme funds which we have been able to make available to the national museums and galleries <e> <s> provision for the current year stands at million <e> <s> this will rise next year to million <e> <s> in addition to these public funds as i think your lordhships are aware the national maritime museum raises its own

we do not want to delay them any more <e>", "<cs> my lords care has to be taken in making comparisons regarding retail egg prices <e> <s> prices differ according to the grade of the egg <e> <s> for example size eggs are currently between pence and pence a dozen cheaper than size eggs <e> <s> prices also differ between outlets reflecting the type of eggs sold and the services offered for example by local corner shops <e> <s> as with many foods prices will reflect any promotional offers which can result in enormous variations in shop prices at any point in time <e>", "<cs> my lords support arrangements trade barriers and many other factors influence food prices <e> <s> the government believe that the determination of prices by market forces results in the most efficient allocation of resources and brings the best deal for the consumer <e> <s> in recent years significant progress has been made in that direction <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the noble lord who spoke previously assumed that a potato was like an egg since potatoes were included on my noble friends shopping list <e> <s> this governments policy of fostering free and fair competition in the high street and our policies in relation to the common agricultural policy have made a significant contribution towards containing food price increases bringing considerable benefits to the consumer who has a wider variety of food available than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to say that sales of eggs are rapidly returning to normal thanks to the measures taken by my ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords the prices of many foods are very little higher than a year ago and some foods are cheaper <e> <s> prices of lamb are per cent <e> <s> lower than a year ago processed fruit is cheaper and fresh vegetables are an average of per cent <e> <s> lower in price than a year ago <e> <s> the list is long but on average food prices are over per cent <e> <s> lower in real terms than they were years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords in point of fact egg prices are now lower than they were before christmas and as we have just heard from the noble lord many retailers are actively promoting the sale of eggs <e> <s> retail egg prices did not fall immediately following the salmonella scare because retailers have to take account of lower turnover and the need to reduce the levels of stocks held <e> <s> during this period it was not price that was restricting the sales of eggs but rather confusion in the publics mind owing to media reporting <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister first alerted the council to the problems of cap fraud more than a year ago <e> <s> he reinforced that message not for the first time last month <e> <s> largely because of the adverse publicity which reflects badly on the operation of the cap we believe that the council now understands the importance of taking practical steps to reduce the scope for fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that but it would not be right for me to comment before the report is published <e>", "<cs> my lords i can merely repeat that it

kingdom has taken the lead in denouncing fraud <e> <s> we believe however that press reports have been exaggerated <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to confine my remarks to the united kingdom <e> <s> in we reported to the commission irregular payments totalling approximately million but not all of these involved fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i answered that question in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said very large figures have been quoted by newspapers namely billion or per cent <e> <s> of the community budget <e> <s> by its nature the exact amount of fraud cannot be known but such figures are exaggerated <e> <s> however fraud is clearly a serious problem and certainly more serious than implied by the reported irregularities and must therefore be tackled seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said by the very nature of fraud it is difficult to come to any total conclusion one can only go on those matters which are reported <e> <s> moreover one realises that it may be that there is a great deal more which is not reported <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord asked whether it would not be better if more time were devoted to such matters <e>

recommendations of the commissions working group taking full account of the court of auditors findings <e> <s> we also believe that each new proposal for community expenditure must be examined so as to minimise the risk of fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be very productive for me to go into those details so late at night <e> <s> i shall therefore write to the noble lord <e>",

being followed <e> <s> just because an mrl is occasionally exceeded does not necessarily mean there is a risk to the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord but it is a free press as

paying compensation on slaughtered animals <e> <s> the government have no powers to compel the industry to finance compensation and are considering the industrys proposal for compulsory slaughter with the compensation funded by the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords as things stand the infection in five out of eight known infected herds is associated with imported stock <e> <s> there is no evidence for

said <e> <s> to date tb has been found in only eight wild deer <e> <s> as noble lords will read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for any help <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the responsibility of all involved to ensure that the requirements of welfare legislation are observed irrespective of the method of payment in abattoirs <e> <s> i was appalled by the article to which the noble lord referred and the conditions described <e> <s> anyone witnessing cruelty in abattoirs should immediately report the matter to the local authority responsible for enforcement <e> <s> i wonder whether the writer of the article did so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the legislation requires animals to be slaughtered in the most humane way possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i

reduction in funding for near market r d of million in rising to million in and million in <e> <s> in total that is equivalent to million at full economic cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation regarding near market research has been put fairly and squarely to all sectors of the industry <e> <s> i accept that there is pressure on farm incomes and that farmers and growers are often very small businesses <e> <s> however in most cases near market rd represents less than one fifth of per cent <e> <s> of the value of output of the various farming sectors <e> <s> that is a large sum in total but not in terms of individual contributions from farmers providing everybody pays their share <e> <s> mechanisms exist in most sectors for collecting levies on a voluntary basis <e> <s> that is the approach we should welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that there are borderline cases <e> <s> there always are in any categorisation <e> <s> perhaps i can make the situation clear with a few illustrations <e> <s> work concerning nitrate leaching is in the public good work to reduce farmers expenditure on fertiliser is near market research <e> <s> animal slaughter work on stunning and animal welfare is public good work on the influence of slaughter practices on meat quality is near market <e> <s> there may be elements of near market in work which we shall continue to pay for but we

i remind the noble lord that the ears are not removed until the animals are dead and it is one way of preventing fraud <e> <s> the different rules apply to animals which are exported <e> <s> the commission requires that the producers should be able to claim premium on those provided that the animals are at least nine months old and they have been kept by the producer for at least two months

restrictions <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i believe that he should be ashamed of himself for what he has just said <e> <s> however i am not exactly surprised because i do not suppose that there is much nitrate in his bathwater in haringey <e>", "<cs> subsection e of the governments amendment no <e> <s> b would enable charges to be imposed in relation to applications for or the granting of consents for carrying on activities not allowed except by such consents <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> f would delete this provision and therefore not allow such charges to be imposed <e>", "<cs> yes perhaps i may pop in before my noble friend sits own <e> <s> i should like to explain further the polluter pays principle <e> <s> we certainly agree with the general principle that the polluter should pay but todays levels of nitrates are the result of many years of farming activity <e> <s> moreover the same farming activity on similar land can give rise to different rates of nitrate leaching <e> <s> simply it is impossible to identify the polluter and quantify his or her contribution to pollution <e> <s> compensation questions do arise of course for substantial restrictions going beyond good agricultural practice <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the situation a little more for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> may i apologise to the committee because i believe i

transitional provision whereby an application by the authority shall not be required in the case of any order made within six months of the transfer date that is within six months of the establishment of the authority at the beginning of september <e> <s> my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> ca would however delete this transitional provision <e>", "<cs> i honestly do not think that this amendment to the governments proposal would be correct <e> <s> the effect of the governments proposal as contained in the proposed new schedule in amendment no <e> <s> c is to enable designation of a nitrate sensitive area either where pollution is at that time being caused by the entry of nitrate into controlled waters or where such pollution is likely at some future date <e>", "<cs> we have no intention of being secretive merely practical <e> <s> when the authority applies for an area to be designated it is not known at that time whether the application will be accepted unamended by the government accepted with amendments notably to the area in question or not accepted <e> <s> even in the case of acceptance the agricultural measures to apply would not be known at that time <e> <s> automatic publicity at this time therefore would seem to be unnecessary <e> <s> it would give rise to unnecessary concern and to questions about the possibility and nature of restrictions which could not at that time be answered <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord has seen the consultation document which we have put out <e> <s> perhaps he would like to reserve judgment until he has seen that after which of course he could put forward his views <e> <s> we are only too well aware of the effect that this serious situation will have on farmers lives but it is inavoidable <e> <s> this is a very complicated issue which we are doing our best to solve properly <e>", "<cs> the amendment that we are now studying would require us to notify every owner lessee and occupier of any proposal for compulsory agricultural measures in a nitrate sensitive area <e> <s> this would be in addition to the present requirement set out in the new schedule for notice to be given through publication in a number of local newspapers circulating in the locality and in the <e>", "<cs> the key point here is that an interested person is simply being asked whether or not he wishes to make an objection to the making of the proposed order <e> <s> he is not being asked to make out a detailed case for an objection <e> <s> in these circumstances the period allowed of days is appropriate and sufficient and follows other similar precedents for example proposed schedule relating to the establishment of water protection zones pursuant to clause i therefore hope that these two amendments will be withdrawn <e> <s> however i wish to look at this matter again with absolutely no commitment <e>", "<cs> i must say that my noble friend keeps repeating how important this matter is <e>", "<cs> i always dread a noble lord talking about a technical amendment because it means that a technical answer is required <e> <s> the amendment is unnecessary and would raise technical difficulties <e> <s> however i must take this opportunity to explain ministerial responsibility for the making of orders as set out in paragraph of the draft clause <e> <s> the relevant minister for the purposes of making orders will be the secretary of state for wales if the area concerned is wholly in wales <e> <s> it will be the minister of agriculture and the secretary of state for the environment in the case of an area wholly in england and all three aforementioned ministers in the case of an area partly in wales and partly in england <e> <s> the governments proposal in paragraph of the schedule is for any of the ministers joining in making the draft order to be able to provide on request a copy of the proposed order <e>", "<cs> in the case of one or more objections to a proposed order designating a nitrate sensitive area the government amendment c would enable the secretary of state and the minister to hold a public inquiry before deciding whether or not to make the proposed order although it would not compel them to do so <e> <s> my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> de would however automatically require such a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> the present wording of clause already allows ministers to approve by order a code of practice prepared by the nra <e> <s> clause refers to another person making a code <e> <s> schedule to the interpretation act defines a person as <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to enable the nra to give specific or general directions on the carrying out of its flood defence functions <e> <s> i must tell the committee that that would be entirely inconsistent with the provisions of clause whereby the authority is required to discharge its functions under the land drainage act through flood defence committees <e>", "<cs> i shall deal first with the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord radnor <e> <s> when the committee considered clause my noble friend lord radnor tabled an amendment which would similarly preclude nra board members from serving on the regional rivers advisory committees <e> <s> he withdrew that amendment but both he and the government agreed to reflect further on the points that were made <e>", "<cs> gladly <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a would amount to a declaration that notwithstanding the nras duty towards maintaining improving and developing fisheries it shall not be a duty of the authority to operate fish farms <e> <s> i am sure that it is the case that the authority is under no obligation to operate fish farms and this amendment is therefore unnecessary <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will be reassured on this point and will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment would change the proposed arrangements for authorising fixed engines placed or used by the nra <e> <s> we propose that instead of the present requirements for ministerial orders to authorise their use the nra should be able to use fixed engines providing they do so with ministerial consent or authorisation <e>", "<cs> i have taken careful note of the points made by the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> i should perhaps explain that a similar proposal was put to the ministry last autumn but after careful consideration we decided that there was not sufficient justification to require all existing fish farmers to install and monitor gratings at the abstraction points to their farms <e> <s> indeed this has not been an issue that has featured to any degree in the ongoing dialogue between my department and the water authorities on fishery matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first take the last point of the noble lord lord moran concerning vat and fishing licence duties <e> <s> the treatment of all the activities of the national rivers authority for vat purposes is currently the subject of active negotiations between customs and excise the department of the environment and the other government departments concerned including my own <e> <s> it is thus too early to give the noble lord the <e>",

on activities otherwise not allowed <e> <s> my noble friends amendment would delete that provision and therefore not allow such charges to be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a helpful amendment which goes a long way to meeting the concerns that i expressed in committee about the noble lords original amendment <e> <s> it now distinguishes between schemes which simply compel a farmer to follow good agricultural practice and those in which compensation will be paid in recognition of the fact that the measures are substantial and go beyond good agricultural practice and which could therefore seriously affect the livelihoods and activities of the farmers involved <e> <s> the amendment ensures that all farmers in the latter category will be made individually aware of the proposals and the scope for commenting on them <e> <s> the government can accept that approach which follows the wildlife and countryside act where it deals with areas of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my

inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the land drainage act is deleted by schedule of the bill and replaced by clause <e> <s> the proposed amendment to schedule is therefore inappropriate <e> <s> as

in amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra has proposed a general definition of food <e> <s> perhaps i may explain why we have not included such a definition <e> <s> i quite agree with my noble friend lady carnegy <e> <s> it has never proved necessary in the past and the present wording of the clause covers any reasonable definition of the word food <e> <s> however we are prepared to consider amending the clause to bring in items not normally regarded as foods but which have nonetheless been marketed for the purpose of consumption such as slimming aids <e> <s> i do not know why

controls already exist under the agriculture act the animal health act and in ec regulations <e> <s> emergency powers are included in the food and environment protection act <e>", "<cs> i add only the fact that feeding stuffs legislation has never been considered appropriate to food law <e> <s> for that reason existing controls are not found in the food act but in the other acts which i mentioned <e>", "<cs> i appreciate my noble friends concern to avoid unwarranted restrictions on those who import and export food <e> <s> however i do not believe that his proposal is appropriate <e> <s> members of the committee will readily understand why in some instances the best way to keep unsafe food from reaching consumers and thus endangering health is to keep it out of the country <e> <s> our ability to do so should not depend on being able in every case to prove that the food is intended to be sold <e> <s> such proof could be very hard to establish in some instances <e> <s> for example if contaminated food came here from abroad that is contaminated either in the country of origin or during transport by being next to something such as lead which made it dangerous there might be an argument about whether the contaminated assignment was intended for sale <e> <s> if challenged the owner might argue that he was not planning to put it on sale for human consumption <e> <s> any regulations or emergency control orders that we had made would then be ineffective <e> <s> it appears to us to be wrong to risk putting public health at risk in that way <e>", "<cs> i have no difficulty with the principle behind my noble friends amendment which would bring the bills definition of contact material into line with that in relevant european <e>", "<cs> there are horses for courses but perhaps my noble friend and i could have a chat together outside the chamber on this matter <e>", "<cs> again i understand the reason behind my noble friends proposal <e> <s> his objective to ensure that minerals intended for use in food such as salt can be subject to controls under the food safety bill is one which i share <e> <s> however the definition of food in subsection c includes substances used as ingredients for food so that minerals such as salt intended for use in food are already caught by all the main provisions in the bill <e> <s> to redesignate such minerals as food sources rather than food would weaken rather than strengthen our controls because we would have to make special regulations to apply the provision to minerals <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend sees my point on this matter <e>", "<cs> i understand my noble friends wish for clarity but in practice this amendment would weaken rather than strengthen the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i understand that there is concern that there may be a gap between food and food sources for example as regards crops such as cereals <e> <s> however i am satisfied that there is no gap <e>", "<cs> while i fully recognise the concern that ministers should not be given open-ended powers it is necessary to allow ministers to make orders which extend further the meaning of sale in order to meet community obligations which go beyond simply regulating commercial supply <e> <s> this applies particularly in the area of meat imports and exports and in relation to pesticide residues <e>", "<cs> it is proposed to delete clause b <e> <s> this power as it exists in that paragraph will enable ministers to expand by order what is deemed to be sale <e> <s> it was added because of the need to control food in certain circumstances when it is supplied otherwise than by sale or in the course of a business for example the free distribution of food which ec directives have provided for in the past <e>

noble lord for reminding me that i had said that we would consider consultation <e> <s> i stand by that <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that this proposal would give greater protection to consumers <e>

presumption provisions in the existing legislation but is placed more prominently in the bill so as to highlight their importance <e>", "<cs> despite the fact that i have not had much time to digest the amendment moved by the noble lord lord carter i know that i cannot accept it but that is not because i am opposed to consultation it is quite the reverse <e> <s> my officials have already held consultations with organisations representing authorities to discuss the probable cost of enforcing the additional requirements which the bill will introduce <e> <s> moreover if i may say so the

able to regulate the use of health claims on food labels <e> <s> however i assure the noble lord that that is already achieved by the present wording <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i cannot accept the noble lords amendment <e> <s> clause f already contains a comprehensive power which allows ministers to make regulations wherever it is necessary and expedient to protect the public health or the interests of consumers <e> <s> the government will not hesitate to use these powers whenever it is necessary or expedient to do so <e> <s> however i believe it would be quite inappropriate to allow ministers complete freedom of action whenever they considered something to be merely desirable <e> <s> who would say what was or was not desirable <e> <s> such a power would allow regulations to be made almost at a whim even when they were not necessary <e>", "<cs> i am sure of the fact that we have given a commitment that we shall include the word irradiation on menus in restaurants <e> <s> with regard to the various other aspects that could possibly be included on menus it would probably end up by being difficult to see what one was intending to eat <e> <s> however we shall be reviewing the matter and talking to restaurant owners and other interested parties <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friends lady carnegy and lord radnor for their helpful remarks and i was interested in the remarks of my noble friend lord colwyn <e> <s> he mentioned <e>", "<cs> it has been a most interesting debate <e> <s> this type of detail is inappropriate for the bill <e> <s> it is in any case not possible for the united kingdom unilaterally to make the changes proposed since food labelling legislation in general and the labelling of wines and spirits in particular is harmonised throughout the european community <e> <s> the food labelling regulations applied to alcoholic drinks although those exceeding per cent <e> <s> abv alcohol by volume are currently exempt from declaring ingredients and those of per cent <e> <s> abv or more together with wine cider and beer in bulk containers are exempt from date marking <e>", "<cs> once again i believe that this kind of detail is inappropriate in the bill <e> <s> in any case it is not possible for the uk unilaterally to introduce specific labelling rules on mrm since food labelling legislation is harmonised throughout the european community <e>", "<cs> one cannot repeat too often the fact that food should be properly cooked right through <e> <s> the words piping hot are as good an instruction as the words reheat frozen food <e> <s> chicken in particular should always be thoroughly cooked <e> <s> as a good housewife i know that <e>", "<cs> will the noble viscount tell me where the information on those well-recorded cases is to be found <e>", "<cs> does the noble viscount not even have a heading to indicate where those reports come from <e> <s> a report is usually produced by somebody <e> <s> i do not ask him to read the reports but just to give the sources <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by saying that i have the greatest sympathy with what the noble earl lord halsbury and my noble and learned friend lord hailsham have said <e> <s> this afternoon i shall have to make major remarks on all the amendments dealing with irradiation in order to answer the points that have been made by the movers <e> <s> that is not of my wish <e> <s> i am well aware that a date has been set by the usual channels for a debate on the sub-committees report but there we are <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount decides what to do about his amendment he has made a very unfair statement about the dose being times as high as in the united states because that is completely misleading <e> <s> the united kingdom intends to approve the irradiation of any food up to an overall average dose of kilograys <e> <s> the us approach is somewhat different in that it has fixed different maximums for different classes of food <e> <s> in some cases that is only one kilogray because technologically there is no need for a higher dose <e> <s> however in the case of herbs and spices it approves a maximum of kilograys which is three times the proposed uk limit <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> however i should make it absolutely clear that we will not allow irradiation to be used as a substitute for good quality control nor as a means of upgrading unfit food <e> <s> i shall explain how we intend to ensure this <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his explanation but i believe his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> regulations authorising food irradiation are likely to be made under clauses and <e> <s> as the bill stands there is already a requirement in clause for such regulations to be subject to statutory consultation <e> <s> this consultation will embrace all organisations which appear representative of interests likely to be substantially affected by the proposal <e> <s> i hope that replies to my noble friend lord montgomery <e>", "<cs> in my view the debate on these amendments has been worth while just to hear the explanation of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> however i do not believe that any of these amendments are necessary <e> <s> clause repeats the wording of the present act which has been in operation satisfactorily for many years <e> <s> it contains adequate safeguards for consumers and allows ministers the flexibility necessary in such a subjective area as the need for non-nutritional substances <e>", "<cs> there are two main reasons why i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i shall deal with the wider aspect first <e> <s> if i were to accept the amendment the result would be that whenever we suspect that plans are afoot for a new community law on any aspect of food regardless of however many years hence we should not proceed with regulations under the bill <e> <s> this would result in the british consumer waiting for possibly an unreasonably long time to be properly protected in a whole range of areas <e> <s> this situation does not strike me as acceptable and for that reason alone i find it impossible to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i wish to refer to his remarks when he said he was disappointed with me <e> <s> frankly i am disappointed with him <e> <s> he simply has not addressed the point i made that various ec countries are already irradiating food <e> <s> the noble lord has not addressed the fact that countries already irradiate food and that four of those countries are within the ec <e> <s> i believe i understood the noble lord to say that it may take years to get the money together to manufacture irradiation plants <e> <s> however if we have to wait while the politics go on we are one of and although we do our best we cannot influence all the others we shall put off even further the day when irradiation plants can be set up <e> <s> ec proposals are often under discussion in brussels for many years <e> <s> an example of that is the heat treated milk directive which was under discussion for years before it was adopted <e> <s> the jams directive was under discussion for about years <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that this amendment is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> that is all i wish to know <e>", "<cs> does any other member of the committee wish to speak on the other amendments before i reply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the amendment and those being discussed with it <e> <s> i completely share his concern that only novel foods that are safe should be marketed <e> <s> this was very much in our minds in drafting the bill <e> <s> i believe that its existing provisions cover this point adequately and that the amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i may have to write to my noble friend on the matter <e> <s> i believe that at the time the grant was given for the skoal bandit with every good intention it was not known that it was such a devilish thing <e> <s> when a company comes along with what looks like a very good product which would provide employment for many local people in a new factory there may seem to be no reason not to give a grant <e> <s> the decision was taken to ban the particular product therefore i imagine that my remarks still stand <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord both <e>", "<cs> the clause seeks to provide for arrangements to deal with the special cases of novel foods and imports <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> processes including novel processes can be regulated under clause c and can be licensed under paragraph b of schedule <e> <s> if the food produced is identical to a food already available to the public there is no special case for an additional prohibition under clause <e>", "<cs> i agree that there is much to be said for common provisions throughout great britain <e> <s> however there may be cases in which different rules are needed to reflect different production or consumption patterns <e> <s> the amendment would rule out such variation and impose uniformity <e> <s> that is why i am unable to accept it <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e> <s> i wish to say that it is simply not the case that trade in milk between scotland and england is restricted <e> <s> england sells to scotland for manufacturing and scottish milk is sold in our supermarkets <e>", "<cs> i am extremely glad to have heard the speech of my noble friend <e> <s> i am glad that he has moved his very first amendment on this bill <e> <s> i hope that it will be the first of many <e>", "<cs> i do not consider that the warranty defence proposed in the amendment is appropriate <e> <s> the warranty defence which exists in the food act is capable of abuse and could allow operations buying in food to avoid responsibility for all the food they sell <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend fights his corner very well <e> <s> i do not believe that the warranty defence has worked at all well in the past <e> <s> i do not consider that the warranty defence proposed in this amendment which repeats and indeed exacerbates the faults of that in the food act is appropriate <e> <s> the retailer will still be able to quote a warranty in establishing a due diligence defence <e> <s> however under the new system we shall be able to pin responsibility on the person who first brings the food into the uk <e> <s> i cannot give examples off the top of my head but i must tell my noble friend that i shall not change my mind on the matter <e>", "<cs> once again i am afraid i cannot accept my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it would mean for example that the owner of a pick-your-own enterprise could automatically be deemed to have satisfied due diligence and therefore escape conviction even if the food his customers had picked was unfit contaminated or injurious to health <e> <s> that would hardly be a satisfactory state of affairs <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to tell my old friend the noble baroness lady stedman that i cannot find favour with the amendments <e> <s> as the noble baroness will know courts interpret defences very widely and would accept checks carried out at the instigation of the defendant as being checks carried out by him <e> <s> similarly checks carried out on behalf of his supplier would be regarded as being carried out by that supplier <e> <s> i hope in view of that brief explanation the noble baroness will not feel it necessary to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i answer my noble friend i ask him whether there is a misprint in the amendment as printed <e> <s> should it refer to section and not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for the explanation of his proposal <e> <s> i understand his anxiety which is to ensure that people should not be convicted of selling food not of the required nature substance or quality if it contains matter resulting unavoidably from the manufacturing process <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to tell my noble friend that the bill already meets his point <e> <s> the amendment would reinstate the defence in section of the food act <e>", "<cs> in order to put noble lords out of their misery i shall tell the committee immediately without giving a lengthy explanation that i sympathise with the noble lords intention in putting forward the amendments <e> <s> we had not realised that problems had arisen in the past <e> <s> however in view of the concern expressed on the subject i am willing to take the matter away and give the issues further careful consideration <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require ministers to consult before exercising either of the two order-making powers under part ii of the bill <e> <s> the first such power allows ministers to make emergency control orders <e> <s> such orders would of necessity have to be made very swiftly and there would be no time to carry out a consultation exercise before they were made <e>", "<cs> the noble viscounts proposal is specifically to include consumer interests among those to be consulted who are likely to be substantially affected by the regulations <e> <s> i of course believe that that is unnecessary <e> <s> consumers interests are already fully recognised by ministers as being in the forefront of interests to be consulted <e> <s> an extensive list of consumer organisations is consulted regularly on a wide range of issues including food legislative matters <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the amendment <e> <s> however we do not agree that the wording in the bill should be changed <e> <s> clause is designed to prevent any public analyst being so involved in the food industry as to bring about a conflict of interest <e> <s> public analysts are holders of public office and exist to assist in enforcement and trials <e> <s> i hope that in view of that brief explanation the noble lord will feel that i have solved his problem <e>", "<cs> i hope i may write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> i shall gladly write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might intervene <e>", "<cs> what i wanted to say was that the noble earl has me and indeed the committee at a slight disadvantage <e> <s> there is a certain grouping and we are now considering amendment no <e> <s> a which stands on its own <e> <s> in the grouping amendment no <e> <s> a is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am going to tell the committee some secrets in advance which makes it even more difficult for me to speak to the grouping as the noble earl has arranged it <e>", "<cs> i was trying to be as helpful as i could to the noble earl by saying what i did <e> <s> i hope that he is not upset <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to everything that the noble earl had to say about public analysts <e> <s> i am also concerned to maintain their status and their role <e> <s> i accept that in some cases the same individuals may also be able to undertake the duties of food examiners <e> <s> i believe that the proposed amendment amendment no <e> <s> a is unnecessary <e> <s> clause of the bill provides for any person whether or not he is an officer of the authority to act as an authorised officer for a food authority <e> <s> thus a public analyst could be appointed as an authorised officer for a food authority if that authority thought it appropriate <e>", "<cs> it is clearly practicable that the same analyst should be used for the whole of one investigation when samples need to be taken in other areas <e> <s> i am doubtful whether it is essential as the noble earl lord halsbury suggests to obtain the agreement of a local analyst in every case because on some occasions that could cause difficulties for enforcement authorities especially if for example the local public analyst was absent from the area at the time the sample needed to be taken <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the proposals for which i have considerable sympathy <e> <s> instead of giving endless explanations it might be better if i simply say that i am prepared to consider the matter <e> <s> i hope we can bring forward a government amendment which will suit noble lords <e>", "<cs> i hope my explanation will satisfy my noble friend <e> <s> if it does not we will be considering many other points at some future time <e> <s> so why not this <e>", "<cs> i can assure my noble friend that we have good reason for proposing an exceptional summary maximum fine of for offences committed under clause <e> <s> this is an important provision which covers among other things the cases where false claims cause harm to those who are particularly vulnerable or with special needs such as those who unfortunately suffer from diabetes <e> <s> we clearly need an effective penalty to match the seriousness of the harm that can be caused where the product does not meet the consumers particular requirements <e> <s> that does not mean that fines of this scale will be imposed for less serious offences <e> <s> indeed the concern is normally that courts impose inadequate fines <e>", "<cs> as we have already announced we shall be setting up an implementation advisory committee to advise on the issue of codes of practice <e> <s> the committee will involve representatives of the enforcement interests as well as the main central government departments involved <e>", "<cs> i need no convincing that we should issue codes of practice in particular to ensure even enforcement of the bill <e> <s> that point was made by many interested parties during our review of food law <e> <s> however drawing up a comprehensive general code would be an enormous task for central government departments and local authority interests <e> <s> many areas of the legislation are in fact already familiar and evenly enforced throughout the country <e>", "<cs> i rather agree with the assessment of the noble lord lord tordoff of his own amendment <e> <s> however i should like to consider the matter further with a view to a possible government amendment later in our proceedings <e> <s> how about that <e>", "<cs> following the good example of the noble lord lord gallacher i too am truncating <e> <s> the amendment misunderstands the nature of both the food safety directorate and the consumer panel <e> <s> both have been set up within the internal structure of maff and are ultimately responsible to the minister <e> <s> it is for the minister to report to parliament on the activities of both bodies and to answer to parliament for such activities <e> <s> there is thus no role for either an independent chairman or for an annual report <e>", "<cs> i believe that the power included in the bill is necessary <e> <s> where charges would apply locally we would be unlikely to wish to interfere with local authorities decisions on charging but would normally leave it to them to set charges appropriate for their areas <e> <s> for example we would expect local authorities to set their own charges for running training courses on food hygiene <e> <s> however some charges will apply nationally for example charges for issuing certain licences under clause <e> <s> in such circumstances it would often be appropriate for the government to set maxima and minima or scales of charge and i believe the power to do so should remain in the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the members of the committee for introducing these substantive amendments so late in the day but i consider it proper to do so now rather than at report stage <e>", "<cs> clause provides a very useful table of definitions of certain expressions used in the bill <e> <s> the clause re-enacts many of the definitions found in section of the food act and section of the food and drugs scotland act <e> <s> there are however some additions and amendments which i hope are largely self-explanatory <e>", "<cs> my lords i have immediately to make apologies because i am under certain timing restrictions <e> <s> i should like to apologise in particular to the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> i shall write to him with i hope answers to the many questions that he asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the first part of the noble lords question in the affirmative <e> <s> i believe that we have gone about as far as we can but i shall take note of what the noble lord has said because as he will be well aware there will always be chances in another place to add or take away from whatever is written <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends wish to narrow slightly the scope of the order-making power to extend the definition of sale in respect of food and to curb unruly ministers though i believe he need have no fear of that <e> <s> my noble friend and others expressed concern at committee stage about the breadth of this power <e> <s> we have reflected further on this matter as he is well aware and our amendment no <e> <s> is tabled to meet my noble friends concern <e>", "<cs> my lords when i rejected his half loaf- at committee stage the noble lord lord gallacher promised to return with a full loaf of bread <e> <s> i cannot say that i like his full loaf any better perhaps he should stay out of the baking business <e> <s> i am however grateful to the noble lords at least for putting into their proposal how they think this agency should be structured and what it should do <e> <s> many who have made similar suggestions have not taken their thinking that far <e> <s> at least the noble lords have done us the courtesy of filling out their proposal and it therefore makes it much easier for me to comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i feel that i must return to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i asked for the leave of the house <e> <s> in any case i meant <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carter said we have been over similar ground in committee <e> <s> as i said then the government have already held consultations with organisations representing local authorities to discuss the likely cost of carrying out the new tasks which this bill introduces <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson has clearly given further thought to this matter following the committee stage debate <e> <s> however i still cannot accept his suggestions <e> <s> before i explain why perhaps i may make a general point <e> <s> i was expecting to deal with all these amendments together as they are grouped <e> <s> my general point concerns all the amendments but i shall be speaking simply to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and suggest that injury to health should be defined by reference to most people <e> <s> this is undesirable <e> <s> i have vibes whenever i hear the words most people <e> <s> the definition we have provided merely assists in the interpretation of a phrase that occurs far more widely than in the present act <e> <s> it does not expand on the present interpretation which existing case law indicates to be that <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments of my noble friend lord mottistone reiterate the concerns he raised in committee <e> <s> i hope that he is now less concerned about the definition of injury as contained in clause <e> <s> as i have already said in response to my noble friends amendment to clause the definition is a reasonable one and i maintain consistent with the common usage of the term <e> <s> moreover it would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends concern that it is not specified in clauses to that the term injury to health applies only in respect of injury caused by food <e> <s> it would indeed be quite inappropriate for food <e>", "<cs> my lords much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to have got into a fog with this amendment <e> <s> i did not understand the noble viscount lord falkland in the first round and he did not understand what i said <e> <s> let us try to put this matter to bed <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear there will always be times in life when i cannot follow my noble friend lord swinton through every door he opens <e> <s> i cannot accept the amendment put forward by the noble lords for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall still civilly answer the point that he raised <e> <s> he asked why we do not insert the provision from clause <e> <s> clause is quite different <e> <s> it will be used when the risk is widespread <e> <s> clause in contrast applies to a single seizure of food <e> <s> the emergency control orders are not only for use against farmers <e> <s> on the contrary we would often expect to use the food and environment protection act for on-farm problems <e> <s> what they will do is to back up the department of healths hazard warning systems which are used to withdraw food when there is a risk to public health <e> <s> the provisions of clause will therefore also apply to manufacturers and retailers of food <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest to the noble lord lord monson that things have moved on since he last looked on a grocers shelves <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the noble lord lord gallacher that his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> clause e already gives ministers wide powers in respect of labelling including the labelling of irradiated food <e> <s> there is thus no need to make specific provision <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated food irradiation at length on second reading in committee and in our recent debate on the sub-committees report on the irradiation of foodstuffs <e> <s> i am therefore familiar with the concern expressed by the noble earl lord baldwin <e> <s> he in turn will know that the government cannot accept the amendment but i make no apology for repeating why the government have concluded that food irradiation is safe and why we believe that it offers real public health benefits and should be permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords no i think not <e> <s> time is going by <e> <s> i have made it clear previously that our research programme on food irradiation will continue but i believe that we have reached the point where we should stop looking for ghosts and proceed with introducing a process that offers real public health benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have always maintained that research will continue <e> <s> if the noble lord had happened to read properly what was said at committee stage he would have had that question already answered for him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord gallacher i may have missed it was he also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they are grouped together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> at committee stage we debated the question of ensuring that the irradiation process is not abused <e> <s> i said then and i shall repeat it that the government will not allow irradiation to be used as a substitute for good manufacturing practice or as a means of upgrading unfit food <e> <s> however i do not believe that the amendment is helpful in this respect <e> <s> the fundamental problem is that there are as yet no internationally agreed standards of good manufacturing and agricultural practice or microbiological standards for food for irradiation <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gallacher indicated at committee stage the world health organisation has begun some useful work in this area of microbiological standards <e> <s> but there are still many considerable practical difficulties to be resolved <e> <s> i do not see how the government could agree now to commit themselves to standards which have yet to be set <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> in discussion on the previous amendment tabled by the noble lord i dealt with the question of microbiological standards prior to irradiation <e> <s> therefore my remarks are directed to the question of standards after irradiation <e> <s> i remind the house that the government are committed to a comprehensive range of licensing controls which will be imposed on the processor in order to ensure that treated foods are safe and wholesome <e> <s> the key provisions of the framework that we envisaged are a product specific plant specific licence to irradiate the inspection of facilities by experts before and regularly after the issue of a licence and access for inspectors to the detailed records of dosimetry which will be required to be maintained at the plant in order to confirm that treatment has been correctly applied <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff has given me an entirely new perception of the expression dutch treat <e> <s> the whole matter has come to me as a very nasty shock <e> <s> i appreciate very much the noble lords apology <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with the proposed new subsection a and begin by making a general point <e> <s> of course ministers will take full account of all representations made to them in relation to any regulations authorising food irradiation <e> <s> that is the purpose of consultation <e> <s> but it would be quite wrong to provide in the bill that one particular issue should take precedence over all the others <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment repeats the proposal made by my noble friend at committee stage <e> <s> i have not changed one bit my view that it is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i have to say with the leave of the house but in reply to the question asked by the noble earl lord halsbury perhaps i might just say that authorised officers intent on prosecution will still have to use qualified public analysts to carry out an analysis and food examiners to carry out examinations <e> <s> courts will still expect to see a certificate as to the result of such analysis or examination whenever appropriate <e>", "<cs> i too was there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot agree to my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i cannot agree that we should limit these powers of entry in the way proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this issue in committee and i am afraid we still believe that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> this is a highly technical matter but i am assured that there are sound legal reasons for not making an explicit reference to relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is such a thing as an over-zealous officer he is already constrained by the provisions of this clause as i have described them <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the concern of the noble lord lord gallacher that enforcement officers should have access to the information they need to make investigations and perform their duties whether it is stored on paper or on electronic or automated systems <e>", "<cs> my lords as the mover of the amendment i believe i am entitled to speak again <e> <s> perhaps i may remind your lordships of the background <e> <s> as drafted clause makes an enforcement officer guilty of an offence if he discloses information which he has obtained on commercial premises about any manufacturing process or trade secret other than in the course of his duty <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to give a special protection to food manufacturers importers and sellers <e> <s> i find it difficult to find any justification for such special treatment <e> <s> the effect would be to require enforcement authorities to serve notices on the defendant within days of having evidence of the alleged offence and to bar them from prosecuting if that notice had not been served <e> <s> a provision of this sort would be most unusual <e>", "<cs> my lords i must resist the amendment <e> <s> noble lords will see that the bill already provides a maximum fine of in respect of all either way offences which are not those falling within clauses or <e> <s> i should stress that this is a maximum amount <e> <s> there is no reason why courts should not award lesser amounts where the offence is less serious <e> <s> i rarely believe in personalising things but speaking as a former magistrate i can say that very seldom is the maximum penalty imposed <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will see that the amendment is unnecessary and that he will be willing to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment appears to question whether the scope of clause is perhaps too broad <e> <s> the power to charge under food legislation is not new <e> <s> such powers already exist under parts i and ii of the food act and in scottish legislation <e> <s> however the existing powers are subsidiary to the main regulation-making power whereas clause would give a self-standing power <e> <s> the new power would be wider as well as more comprehensive and flexible <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying that i endorse the view that on matters of public interest such as food irradiation there must be full scrutiny of government proposals <e> <s> however i do not believe that use of the affirmative resolution procedure is the way to ensure that <e> <s> as the committee on delegated legislation explained in its report negative procedure should be the norm <e> <s> affirmative resolution should only be used for three types of powers those substantially affecting acts of parliament those having significant financial effects for example imposing a new tax and those involving considerations of special importance for example creating a new type of serious criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raised this point in committee and as she knows we gave the suggestion much careful consideration <e> <s> despite the late hour i am glad to have this opportunity to explain our reasons <e> <s> the definitions in clause apply to words or phrases which are being given an unusual or expanded meaning <e> <s> the concept of labelling in the bill is the same as that in common usage <e> <s> that has not led to any difficulties in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the last words of my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i cannot compete with my noble and learned friend lord hailsham or the noble lord lord hunter of newington but in when i became a junior minister in the then dhss i was given the in-house responsibility for ionising radiation of food <e> <s> i thus have quite a long pedigree of familiarisation with that process <e> <s> i have had the opportunity for instance of seeing the excellent research undertaken in northern ireland <e> <s> i have had plenty of opportunity to question and to be informed <e> <s> my conviction as to the safety and tightness of the process is thus i submit well-founded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth for the remarks he made <e> <s> as i said before i think that the time limits in the legislation are reasonable <e> <s> therefore i should be reluctant to see them effectively undermined by the qualification proposed in the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend said we have discussed many of the potential <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord gallacher will forgive me if i deal first with the point raised by the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale will be aware that it is for the usual channels to arrange when an order in my name is to be debated <e> <s> standing order governs the debating of motions for affirmative resolution <e> <s> the relevant provision of the standing order provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the usual channels which arrange these matters will take

the beer <e> <s> there is no evidence that prices have discouraged consumption <e> <s> this is still a small sector but it is the most rapidly expanding in the uk drinks market <e> <s> sales increased by per cent <e> <s> in and per cent <e> <s> in compared with previous years <e> <s> that sector now represents about per cent <e> <s> of total uk sales compared with virtually no sales three years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble lord is comparing like with like <e> <s> however market forces are the most effective way of determining and restraining prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not here to defend the brewers <e> <s> i am merely here to repeat facts <e>", "<cs> my lords the ec is currently engaged with other gatt members in the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations <e> <s> export refunds are an important issue in the negotiations <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the united states and others are calling for their abolition <e> <s> the european community has made clear that that is unacceptable and has put forward alternative proposals to impose greater disciplines on export subsidisation <e>", "<cs> my lords refunds for processed products enable food exporters to benefit from aids which would have been paid on their agricultural raw materials <e> <s> in fixing them food interests are taken into account as well as the needs of agricultural market management <e>", "<cs> my lords the community proposes that subsidies to food exporters will be clearly limited to the difference between the price of raw materials on the domestic market and that on world markets <e> <s> where that difference is minimal subsidies would not be available <e> <s> those proposals if adopted would not adversely affect food exporters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for lowering his decibels on this occasion <e> <s> i should point out to him that this country has led the way in the european community in bringing forward the question of fraud and taking appropriate action <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the only one that i have made up myself <e>", "<cs> my lords we have kept other countries fully informed about the development of bse in britain and of the probable role of meat and bonemeal as the source of infection <e> <s> in the light of that it is for importing countries to decide whether to accept this material and if so under what conditions <e> <s> for example this material may be for use in pig and poultry rations which is permitted in this country <e> <s> bse has not been reported in the netherlands <e> <s> research studies in this country show that the most likely cause of bse is the feeding of ruminant-based rations containing protein material derived from sheep some of which were infected with scrapie but we have no further information <e>", "<cs> my lords we are permitting breeding from some offspring <e> <s> there is no evidence which points to a need for breeding to be prohibited but farmers as a matter of prudence may wish to consider taking their own action <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is permitted and it is up to farmers to make their own decision <e>", "<cs> my lords we are carrying out an enormous amount of research into this disease which the noble lord will appreciate is a very new disease <e> <s> we have a project under way which is costing million to ascertain whether the disease is transmissible from dam to calf <e> <s> over offspring of affected cattle have been purchased together with a similar number of control animals <e> <s> all are being kept at ministry experimental husbandry farms <e> <s> the offspring of infected animals in this country are not being allowed to breed <e>", "<cs> my lords five antelopes have died of a transmissible encephalopathy probably as a result of consuming ruminant-based feed <e> <s> the ruminant feed ban imposed in july applies to zoo animals as well as to livestock <e> <s> advice about bse has been given to all zoos <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to give the noble lord the figure that he desires <e> <s> however i shall write to him on the matter <e> <s> up to th march cases

are carrying out an enormous amount of research into the whole matter <e> <s> farmers with herds of deer will have been aware as are farmers of cattle of the dangers we believe to be inherent in the type of food which is now banned for cattle <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the assumptions made by the noble lord are correct <e> <s> that is why we have a wide-ranging research programme which has been underway since the disease was first identified <e> <s> more than million has been allocated over the next three years to the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hard to tell which herds are free from bse because the disease does not show itself immediately <e> <s> it can occur in a cow in any period between about three years old up to a really old cow that is however old an old cow may be <e>", "<cs> my lords as part of the exercise i am willing to look at anything but i do not believe that share farming would solve the tenancy problem <e> <s> however those who are involved in that kind of farming would find it worthwhile to put their two bits in with everyone else in an attempt to obtain some form of agreement which would permit us to bring forward meaningful legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i submit that the uk <e> <s> without bangers would be like france without champagne <e>", "<cs> my

for the foreign office <e> <s> however i realise that i reply for the government <e> <s> the government will oppose any unnecessary restrictions and welcome the support of the industry and the meat and livestock commission <e> <s> separate provision could be made for minced meat which is to be consumed raw <e> <s> appropriate labelling could indicate whether products are meant to be cooked or are intended for consumption raw and would inform and protect consumers <e> <s> if all else fails i hope that labelling would provide a means for us to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is such a thing as the british sausage <e> <s> some people like a sausage with herbs and the sausage one eats depends on the recipe one favours <e>", "<cs> no my lords not much <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do so with pleasure <e> <s> the haggis is boiled before sale and is not subject therefore to these proposals <e> <s> we are equally determined to protect the haggis should the need arise <e>",

thing i can do is to put into the library a list of all the cases that we have had in numbers and the confirmed beef suckler cases by breed <e> <s> i also tell my noble friend that we have one confirmed case in a pure-bred aberdeen angus and in aberdeen angus crosses <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in touch with all the scientific expertise which we think can be helpful to us <e>", "<cs> my

my noble friends question in the order in which he raised them <e> <s> first i should like to express my sympathy and that of my colleagues to cattle farmers <e> <s> they are having a very difficult time particularly following on from the lead in milk situation <e> <s> we have asked the european commission to recognise the weak market position for beef here and in ireland and it has opened intervention for unlimited quantities of beef to provide a safety net <e> <s> with regard to retaliation i do not agree with my noble friend <e> <s> we are playing by the rules <e> <s> we are using the proper european procedures <e> <s> two wrongs do not make a right and importantly the commission is on our side <e>", "<cs> my lords details of all female offspring are kept on computer <e> <s> legislation will be introduced as soon as possible requiring details of the dam and offspring to be recorded and retained for years <e> <s> this is to provide the means if results of research indicate that further action is necessary to help eradication <e> <s> advice has been made known via adas the farming press and farmers meetings <e> <s> written advice is provided to the owners of all suspect cases at the time of the diagnostic visit and an advisory pamphlet is in the final stages of preparation following scientific advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to give my noble friend an assurance based on the best advice available <e> <s> the chief medical officer has said that beef can be eaten safely by everyone both adults and children including patients in hospital <e> <s> furthermore most animals currently slaughtered are of an age not to have been exposed to infection via feed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for his intervention because it gives me the opportunity to say that the action taken is without any scientific justification whatever <e> <s> earlier this year the top scientific experts in the european community endorsed the view of our own experts that british beef is perfectly safe to eat <e> <s> urgent discussions are taking place at all levels and with the full support of the european commission to get the restrictions lifted <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not believe that retaliation would actually help our farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord has recently been buying beef but i think he will find that the decrease already has worked its way through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what america has to do to get in this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer in this way <e> <s> in sheep with scrapie the placenta is a source of infection and it can be passed on through ingestion <e> <s> we are experimenting with cattle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

clause through your lordships house <e> <s> his efforts have certainly ensured that the difficult questions raised by clause have received very careful consideration <e> <s> however as he knows we cannot agree to this provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for his summing-up of the reasons why his side of the house will support the deletion of the clause

dispute the remarks about our farmers going out of business on <e>", "<cs> my lords re-balancing would mean an increase in protection against certain imports for instance as the noble lord lord gallacher said oilseeds and cereal substitutes offset by a reduction in protection elsewhere for example on cereals <e> <s> the united kingdoms doubts as to whether an acceptable package can be negotiated are well known and it is too soon to say what might emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is not obstinacy that is needed but a general agreement on the art of the possible in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the grant to individual arts bodies is determined by the arts council independently of and usually prior to any commercial sponsorship obtained <e> <s> the government have maintained their grant to the arts council and sponsorship is an additional resource not a replacement for this <e> <s> however we welcome very much the decision of royal insurance to renew and to increase its sponsorship of the rsc <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the board of management of the royal shakespeare company <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government came to power the arts councils grant has risen by nearly one-third in real terms <e> <s> this year it has risen by per cent <e> <s> over the next three years it will increase by per cent <e> <s> economic factors will always mean that there are lean periods for arts companies as for business in general <e> <s> the fact that major arts organisations know three years in advance the expected level of their arts council grant means that arts companies can plan better to deal with their problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the arts are booming as never before <e> <s> annual attendances at subsidised performances in england have increased from over million in to over million now <e> <s> they are expected to rise to over million next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the arts council grant is above the rate of inflation

for example is becoming the second city for the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords any meetings would be a matter for the board of management <e>", "<cs> i am not reading and the arts council itself <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply not only to my noble friend but also to the rather terse remarks of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> the phrase member state is not defined <e>", "<cs> i know

representations and their views will be considered when ministers decide whether to grant exemptions <e> <s> the noble lord will i hope recognise that there will be a degree of urgency but there will be no secrets in our decision-making <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend lord alport will forgive me if i say that he claims to know before i speak what i will say <e> <s> in part i am not surprised <e> <s> i have been writing letters to him since the st december on what i might say should this moment arise <e>", "<cs> i suddenly realised that my noble friend had not spoken to the amendment but it was included in my groupings <e>", "<cs> i must once again apologise for jumping the gun but i now finally come to the last of the three amendments on this subject <e> <s> we have accepted that industry needs some time to adjust to new cultivation techniques and to invest in the necessary equipment <e> <s> we believe it right to allow the farmers three seasons to do so <e> <s> we hope that advances in technology will be encouraged by notice of the ban <e> <s> for example i have challenged the agricultural machinery section of the industry to find machinery which will cope with stubble in heavy land <e>", "<cs> this amendment addresses an important aspect of the assessment which all medicinal products must undergo before they are licensed <e> <s> it is particularly important for veterinary medicinal products which because of their nature and the circumstances of their use are most likely to have an impact on the environment <e> <s> it has therefore been standard practice in the veterinary products committee for many years to consider the environmental aspects and impact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> i should like

first supplementary question we have first to decide the categories by which manufacturers may declare the materials used in their feed <e> <s> those categories must be in place by nd january <e> <s> we must also make sure that manufacturers are using common terminology and descriptions <e> <s> from experience we know that that will entail a good deal of discussion in brussels <e> <s> in different countries there are hundreds of raw materials used in the production of feed for animals <e> <s> we are pressing in brussels for a distinction between animal protein coming from ruminants and from other sources <e> <s> however negotiations are still under way <e>", "<cs> my lords since july any material from ruminants has been banned from inclusion in animal feed <e> <s> the pet food situation is different a voluntary ban has been operated <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to answer that question on another occasion <e> <s> i do not think that it has anything to do with labelling

material should not be used <e> <s> the voluntary ban has been extended to cover the full list of proscribed offals which includes brains <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to both noble lords for their excellent reception of the measures <e> <s> i must admit to the noble lord lord gallacher that i wrote my speech before the order paper was printed and i omitted to check the order <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing this matter to my attention <e> <s> estimates of this kind depend very much on the assumptions that are made <e> <s> i do not wish to comment on these figures <e> <s> however i do not dispute the general conclusion that liberalisation of agricultural policies brings substantial benefits <e> <s> i should however emphasise that the uruguay negotiations are now focused on reductions and not on complete elimination of support <e>", "<cs> my lords most studies suggest that multilateral liberalisation would significantly lower market prices for many agricultural products in the european community <e> <s> however many studies conclude that the reduction in the price of dairy products including butter could be relatively small <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i answered that question in my initial reply to a recent question from the noble lord <e> <s> however for the benefit of noble lords i shall repeat that all parties to the gatt round negotiations have agreed a long-term objective which is to provide substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection sustained over an agreed period of time which would result in correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets <e> <s> the uk is working hard with our ec partners to develop the communitys
