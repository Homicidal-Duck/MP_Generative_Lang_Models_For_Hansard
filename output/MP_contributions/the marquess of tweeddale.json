["<cs> my lords i think you will agree that that speech is a very hard speech to follow but it is my unfortunate position to have to do this <e> <s> this is my first speech in your lordships house and i hope that i shall not be thought unctious if i put on record that i consider it a great honour to be heard here <e> <s> i dare say that i may be surprised to hear certain expressions of welcome <e> <s> i hope that these will be none the less sincere for its being april fools day <e>", "<cs> my lords i thoroughly deplore the soviet occupation of afghanistan <e> <s> it is certainly a monstrous act of aggression and i wholeheartedly agree with your lordships condemnation of it <e> <s> neverthelessand i am sorry to have to disagree with the noble earl lord kimberley to whom we should be grateful for the opportunity of debating this matteri think that our athletes are quite right to go to the soviet union for the olympic games and i hope that the government will not obstruct them any more than they have already done <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he allow me just to point out if it needs to be pointed out that i am as much a protagonist of freedom as he is but that the difference between us resides in the means which we each consider to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord simon of glaisdale for the opportunity to discuss this very interesting subject and if i may to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord bridge of harwich on what i thought was an extremely elegant and a model maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether he would not consider that in the light of recent disturbances in brixton and elsewhere it is highly undesirable to hold the carnival at all in notting hill gate especially as notting hill gate is a predominantly white that is to say a non-caribbean area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for his answer may i ask would he not agree that following on toxteth moss-side and all the other disturbances we have had and given the fact that the record of the notting hill carnival is extremely mixed and given the fact also that the anti-nazi league and the national front both propose to participate in the carnival widespread public disorder is virtually inevitable and that therefore a ban should be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to consider that the royal wedding and the notting hill carnival are two completely different things <e> <s> may i also observe that people who put the two together are really living in cloud cuckoo-land <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he thinks that at a time when cuts are being made in such essential services as the bbc overseas broadcasts it is justifiable to lay out public money in this way particularly when as i understand it this laying out of public money will be necessary only if the extremely damaging allegations of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord st just for the opportunity to speak on this subject <e> <s> the government should address themselves not only to the problem of hard drugs but to the so-called problem of soft drugs <e> <s> we have heard from several speakers that there is <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether the instances which he has given us of children and pornography do not provide a case more for the protection of children than for the wholesale banning of pornography for such adults as may want it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his answer but i must confess that i did not hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord once again for his answer which came through loud and clear <e> <s> may i ask whether i am right in thinking that the government if not the attorney-general himself have the power to institute any inquiry that they wish if the will is there <e> <s> further may i ask whether the government would agree that there is ample evidence that miss smith met a death which amounts to homicide <e> <s> further may i ask whether the government would agree that the results of the foreign office inquiries and those of the west yorkshire police should be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the motion but most of the points that i intended to make have already been made very well by the noble earl lord selkirk on the one hand and the noble lord lord strauss on the other <e> <s> therefore i shall be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to intervene <e> <s> clause already exists i believe in substance in the act <e> <s> what is the purpose of repeating it here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am even more reluctant to intervene than was my noble friend lord monson particularly as my name is not on the list of speakers <e> <s> i should just like to say that i support practically everything that my noble friend has said and to raise one other point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have it with me but i shall look it up later on <e> <s> however i looked at the act and i do not remember seeing any reference to men there at all or am i missing the point <e>", "<cs> so we are talking about men in public lavatories essentially my lords <e> <s> i take it that that is how it has been interpreted <e>", "<cs> if clause is to stand part of the bill i agree with both the amendment of the noble lords lord mishcon and wigoder and that of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i should like if i may and if it is in order which i believe it is to ask the noble lord lord mishcon a question concerning his proposed amendment to clause <e>", "<cs> how do we define sexual purposes <e> <s> anybody who walks down the kings road addressing a number of young women is quite likely to have sexual purposes at the back of his mind <e> <s> i do not think that this is a particularly repulsive thing to do provided that the young man is polite about it <e> <s> i might add that under section of the act homosexuals are already in the position that i believe the noble lords amendment might put heterosexuals in <e>", "<cs> i could not agree more <e> <s> of course i am against the nuisance element but i do not believe that young men wandering about looking for potential sexual conquests constitute any such nuisance <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me he has just told us that the smooth operator would be at an advantage <e> <s> as i understand it we have been told many times that the purpose of this bill is to abate nuisance and not to promote morality <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what my noble friend lord kilbracken has said <e> <s> with the greatest respect to my noble and learned friend lord denning i feel that what is considered obnoxious in encounters on foot at least in the street has changed very much over the generations and that a great many women nowadays are not necessarily always offended by an approach which might be ultimately for sexual purposes provided that the approach is made in a polite manner <e> <s> if it is done otherwise i imagine it would be possible to bring other kinds of charge in any case <e> <s> i would therefore oppose the second of the noble and learned lords amendments <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to disagree with my noble friend lord st davids <e> <s> he seems however to have left out of account the fact that there may be occasions when people have good reason for disguising themselves <e> <s> i think particularly of people from countries such as iran who if they take part in an anti-khomeini demonstration and are identifiable might find themselves in considerable difficulty when they return or their relations at home might find themselves in great distress <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord with some reservations for that not very illuminating answer <e> <s> perhaps i may take the opportunity to say that when i put the question down on the order paper i was totally unaware that the turkish president was to be in london today <e> <s> is not the concept of turkey joining a european community a contradiction in terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply which was gratifying to hear <e> <s> have similar representations been made about the human rights issue especially in respect of the hungarian and german minorities <e>"]
