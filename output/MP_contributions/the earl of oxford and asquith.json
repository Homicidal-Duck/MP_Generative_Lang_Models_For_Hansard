["<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships for the first time early in the debate but so late in life i am very conscious of the convention that a maiden speech should not be controversial <e> <s> i am equally conscious that the subject of this debate makes it no easy task for although the situation in the middle east has many facets not all of them controversial the problem of palestine so pervades and bedevils that situation that it would be unrealistic not to focus attention on it <e> <s> and palestine is a problem on which opinions are deeply divided and feelings may run high <e> <s> we have seen that already this evening even in the few speeches we have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i join with other speakers in thanking the noble lord lord chelwood for giving us the opportunity for this debate and i do so the more readily because i agree with so much that he said and indeed with what many other speakers have said this evening including in particular the noble lord lord mayhew who has just sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords the rather short notice of the debate has certainly left me less well prepared for it than i should have liked <e> <s> but having served for many years in what was then palestine i should feel ashamed if i did not speak however briefly in support of the palestinians now in lebanon and in the west bank and gaza <e> <s> in part at least it was for their welfare and that of their parents and grandparents that we undertook responsibility for the palestine mandate <e> <s> we failed them in the end in this responsibility with the consequences for them that we see today <e>"]
