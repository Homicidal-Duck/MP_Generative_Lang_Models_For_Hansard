["<cs> my lords i rise to address your lordships house for the first time with considerable humility and reliant upon the knowledge that your lordships reputation is to deal kindly with newcomers <e> <s> for one who has not come from another place in fact from no place at all the task is formidable and your lordships may prefer to regard this afternoon as the first module of on-the-job training in what i can only describe as the young training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise this evening with some trepidation to sum up what is a first major debate on this subject and my trepidation is i fear all the greater for i feel rather unfit to compliment my noble friend lord stockton on his maiden speech <e> <s> i have probably had as many hours in this chamber as he has had years in parliament but i think that i can speak for the whole house in saying to him how much we appreciated his wise words <e> <s> the overriding impression they have left on me at least if i may say so without upsetting any of the noble lords here this evening is that his was the most forward-looking speech to grace this debate <e> <s> now that he has actually broken his duck perhaps i may say that i have in my short time in this chamber heard another noble lord fully years his senior make at least one speech and ask a number of questions and i hope that we may have the opportunity of hearing also from my noble friend many times in the months and years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful indeed to the noble lord lord gregson and to each and every member of the select committee for the report which they have delivered to this house <e> <s> let me also say how much i welcome on behalf of the government the opportunity that we have had today to debate the select committees report for we have indeed had a good debate <e> <s> it has highlighted the thoroughness and the penetration with which the select committee itself and this house this evening have considered this most important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the number who will be affected by the decision to give priority to those people who meet the programmes criteria for long-term unemployment and are also benefit recipients will vary according to changing personal and family circumstances <e> <s> married women may claim benefit in their own right and we have provided that where benefit is claimed by a head of household and includes a benefit for an unemployed spouse that spouse will also be regarded as a benefit recipient <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement on skillcentres being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> my noble friend the chief whip has asked me to offer his apologies to your lordships for inadvertently misleading the house in this respect <e> <s> the statement of course is the statement of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords there are currently wages councils <e> <s> the government have as yet made no decision on the future of wages councils <e> <s> they are carefully considering all available evidence and opinion on their operation and efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening todays debate on behalf of the government i should not like your lordships house to consider that the eight minutes allotted to me in any way reflects either the governments or my lack of concern about the subject of this debate which is after all the central issue of our time <e> <s> nothing could he further from the truth and although the time is more than enough i suspect to refute the case put forward by the noble lord lord cledwyn it will not be enough for me to expand on what the government have done are doing and will do <e> <s> in leaving some of that task to my noble friend lord gowrie i hope that no-one in your lordships house will feel that the government are in any way defensive of their record or that i am in any way slighting this house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat in the form of a statement the answer to a private notice question being given in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will continue to encourage employee involvement in the nationalised industries as elsewhere <e> <s> we believe that good employee involvement practices most suited to each organisation are best introduced on a voluntary basis by the management of the particular organisation in conjunction with the employees and their representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords the press notice referred to indicated that on th december there were unemployed claimants in the united kingdom <e> <s> the figure for th january published on st january was <e> <s> the most recent seasonally-adjusted figures show an increase of in the month to january and that the average monthly rise in unemployment in the three months to january was compared with an average monthly rise of in the previous three months <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement on skillcentres being made in another place by my right honouranble friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gregson for enabling us to have this most interesting and important debate this afternoon <e> <s> if i say that the debate today was up to the standard of the report i am sure that your lordships will take it that we found this a most interesting and thought-provoking report <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord both on his speech and on the speed with which he produced the report itself <e> <s> the government would wholeheartedly endorse much that the noble lord has said this afternoon and just as much as is contained in the report itself <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no definitive statistics on jobs created <e> <s> however according to department of trade and industry estimates of the number of new jobs associated with projects attracting regional aid some jobs have been created in corby since and a further are in prospect <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords while the monthly unemployment count necessarily reflects the administrative system for paying unemployment benefits we are satisfied that the figures are a reasonable reflection of the level of unemployment as shown by other less frequent estimates from household surveys of the number of unemployed people seeking work <e> <s> the labour force survey was in broad agreement with the monthly count <e> <s> results for will be published in the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider it important that employers and employees should take account of the effect of pay increases on costs competitiveness and jobs <e> <s> each company should consider carefully what it can afford and what it needs to pay to recruit retain and motivate its staff including its senior staff <e> <s> but it is for companies not third parties like the government to decide what level of pay is right in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are presently analysing the first reports to come within the scope of section from several hundred companies <e> <s> we hope to make available the results of this analysis within the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision has yet been made on the amount of money which the social fund will allocate to the youth training scheme in <e> <s> the european commission has recently announced some changes in the fund guidelines for but it is too soon to say how these will affect community support for the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is no <e> <s> the governments view is that taking the holiday on a monday minimises the disruption and expense to industry and commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord parry for his enthusiasm and his restraint in introducing the motion <e> <s> his enthusiasm was infectious <e> <s> indeed i do not think that i should burden your lordships house with any more figures <e> <s> the noble lord has given all that are required to show the enormous growth in tourism <e> <s> his restraint was even more commendable <e> <s> for fully minutes of his -minute speech he spoke of the united kingdom and fell into temptation only in the last three minutes to talk about wales <e> <s> he fell finally from grace utterly in my book in talking in the last few seconds about money <e> <s> i am grateful that we have had such a useful and timely debate in the view of my colleagues and myself on the committee that i chair to look at the progress and the course of possible future development of tourism within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the numbers recruited in represented a substantial improvement over the two previous years <e> <s> although slightly fewer of the successful candidates were awarded the higher board marks no one is recommended for appointment who is not fully up to standard in terms of ability and potential <e>", "<cs> it is with a mixture of pleasure and trepidation that i rise to assist my noble friend pleasure because this is my debut in this chamber in matters concerning social security and trepidation because i find myself answering such an acknowledged expert in these matters as the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> but i am glad to be able to do so because even though a minister without portfolio as your lordships well know i have a very particular interest in the encouragement of employment <e> <s> i believe that the changes in the national insurance contributions which my right honourable friend the chancellor proposed in his budget and which this bill seeks to put into effect are a bold and imaginative step to encourage employment at the lower end of the wage scale particularly among that vitally important group young people looking for their first job <e> <s> i am too old a hand to hazard predictions of my own but i notice that among the experts in this field the london business school has suggested that there will be some extra jobs as a result of these changes and some have made even higher predictions <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment has received responses to the consultative paper on wages councils <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords information technology centres exhausting their entitlement to their initial three years of department of trade and industry pump-priming funding are being required to make a partial contribution to their future salary and capital costs <e> <s> in order to help centres do this the government have relaxed the conditions under which they operate and are supporting a range of marketing initiatives to facilitate the sale of their products and services <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made known their proposal to deratify international labour convention on minimum wage-fixing machinery subject to the outcome of consultations in conformity with international labour organisation rules <e> <s> no decision could be taken before completion of these consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft industrial training levy engineering board order laid before this house on th june be approved <e> <s> the order is before your lordships today because levies in excess of per cent <e> <s> require an affirmative resolution of each house under section of the industrial training act <e> <s> your lordships will be aware of the importance of the engineering industry which remains the largest manufacturing sector in terms of employment <e> <s> engineering output rose in by per cent <e> <s> and the fastest growth was in the electronics sector emphasising the need for high level skills training in the industry <e> <s> it is important to ensure that all firms play their part in training and we must ensure above all else that economic growth is not hindered by skill shortages as has sometimes happened in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a statement on the white paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment deposited the results of the monitoring of employee involvement statements in company reports in the library on th june <e> <s> the results show that seven-eighths of the reports examined which appeared to be in the scope of the legislation included employee involvement statements and these included some excellent reports
