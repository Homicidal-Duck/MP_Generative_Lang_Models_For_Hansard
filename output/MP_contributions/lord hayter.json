["<cs> my lords i like other noble lords am very grateful to the noble viscount lord rochdale for introducing this debate <e> <s> so far it has reminded me of mark twains observation that everyone talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it <e> <s> in this context one asks the question who does the talking <e> <s> i noticed in a newspaper this morning that in one year the general council of british shipping held meetings in their building <e> <s> but what happened <e> <s> who listened <e> <s> i do not think anybody did <e> <s> and who acts in the context of what we are talking about today <e> <s> to be truthful it must be those nations who are not too mixed up with other nations and that means russia china and the usa and who do not get themselves too involved with allies who may not always agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trefgarne has had a tremendous ear-bashing today in a variety of different contexts and i hope that i shall be very gentle and not disturb him at all <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble earl lord kimberley for asking this question because i rise although it may not look like it like a phoenix from the ashes <e> <s> my little quango has been disbanded <e> <s> i was chairman of the little neddy which looked after international freight movement and it would therefore be on my conscience if i did not speak on this question in the context of air cargo <e>", "<cs> my lords it is about time that i brought a note of discord into <e>", "<cs> my lords i know <e>", "<cs> my lords in the days of ancient rome cato the elder used to end up every speech with the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody in this house is an expert on health <e> <s> apart from the expertise which i get as a patient past present and no doubt future my own expertise is as chairman of the kings fund <e> <s> i am delighted to have as my distinguished colleague on that management committee the noble lord lord hunter who introduced this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been this evening and earlier this afternoon a cloud of statistics around this house and i do not propose to add to that <e> <s> in point of fact i should like to get behind those statistics to the truth which underlines some of those figures particularly in relation to crime against property <e> <s> the difficulty there is first of all that not all these crimes are reported secondly that the victims very seldom see the attacker thirdly that in cases like burglary and housebreaking so many of the offences take place at night that it does not matter how many policemen you have on the beat they will not be there at the time the offence is being committed <e> <s> it is committed with speed committed in private places <e> <s> so the only honest hope of containing property crime is for us to do something about it recognising in a phrase that has been used before that security is an attitude of mind <e> <s> for the second time in a month the first time being when we debated the national health service i find myself saying that prevention is better than cure <e>", "<cs> on these benches we find ourselves in some difficulty on this bill because we do not understand the supernatural powers of the local authorities <e> <s> how could they bring the parent or guardian of the child if under subsection a of the new clause the parents are dead and there is no guardian <e> <s> we do not understand that <e>", "<cs> it is very kind of the committee to allow me to clear the matter up <e> <s> the new section which appears in the marshalled list says that the local authority has to be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the intention of the government to leave the phraseology exactly as it stands in this bill and to say that the commission will not be exempt from any duty or any tax when it is given all those concessions <e> <s> that does not seem to me to make sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i was reminded by the debate before this one on economics of the time when i went to take my tripos examination and was met outside by professor clapham one of my lecturers who asked me why i looked so worried <e> <s> i said well i do not know what the questions are going to be <e> <s> he said my dear chap in economics the questions are always the same it is the answers that are always different <e> <s> the same thing is true of health <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to finding myself very cynical about lots of matters in connection with the european economic community but i join the noble lord lord rhodes in saying how adroit expert and tactful our chairman was throughout this committee and he has cured some of my cynicism <e> <s> but i also follow the noble lord lord rhodes in talking about the dissemination of this report and i would be presumptuous enough to make a suggestion to a general reader who happens to come across it <e> <s> there are pages and i suggest that the first thing to do is to forget all about the statistical pages <e> <s> that will solve part of the problem <e> <s> having done that i suppose that logically one should also ignore the witnesses who claimed to be economists <e> <s> of course some of them were brilliant as the noble lord <e> <s> lord greenhill of harrow said but they were so boring <e> <s> if one does that one gets to the rest of the report and is faced with the question so what <e>", "<cs> speaking from this particular section of your lordships house there is a phrase that i cannot use we on these benchesbecause we on these benches never know what our colleagues are going either to say or to do <e> <s> indeed i have been bombarded with notes today because this was talked about as an all-party amendment which it is indeed but as far as the cross-benchers are concerned we have to speak for ourselves <e> <s> i would say however that at the second reading quite a number of cross-benchers voted for the government they did not like the reasoned amendment but the majority voted for that amendment <e> <s> i conducted a small private gallup poll of my own to find out what was the reasoning behind my colleagues attitude <e>", "<cs> indeed that will be so because after amendment no <e> <s> has been dealt with amendment no <e> <s> will be formally moved by the noble lord lord molson and his colleagues and of course there can be further debate at that stage <e> <s> to come back to amendment no <e> <s> this seeks to <e>", "<cs> i am beginning to feel that i am speaking in another place <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to set up a new directly elected metropolitan authority which would become the strategic authority for london <e> <s> may i make two points on what the amendment is not about <e> <s> we are not proposing a new greater london council under another name but an entirely different type of public authority <e> <s> we are not seeking to interfere in any way at all with proposals in the bill to devolve certain powers to individual london borough councils <e> <s> on the other hand we are concerned with the way in which essential city-wide functions of a strategic character would be administered in the future for the good of all london and its people <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to reply to the noble earl but i shall not <e> <s> instead i shall thank all those people who have spoken in this committee <e> <s> i would not insult your lordships by trying to repeat any of the arguments <e> <s> most of you have been here throughout <e> <s> it has been a most interesting debate and i end up with this simple question are the proposals of this amendment a better solution for the manifold problems of london than the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i go back to the beginning of this debate when the noble earl lord shannon referred to the three principal areas for action <e> <s> the first was increasing awareness which i think was sir geoffrey chandlers polite term for public relations <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just three quick points <e> <s> i was glad that the noble lord the minister straightened out the committee on the financial implications of this amendment <e> <s> of course he is right and the position is set out in the amendment and in the bill for those who want to read it <e> <s> secondly i think the ministers assurances in relation to the transitional financial provisions are well worthy of study but that is not what we are going to vote on now <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned once again i think we are all at one we want to do the best we can for the voluntary authorities <e> <s> we think one way and others think the other way <e> <s> let us put it to the vote <e>", "<cs> may i revert slightly from the lecture which we have just had given to us and refer to a matter on which i hope the noble lord lord elton does not feel that i have been a thorn in his flesh <e> <s> only yesterday i was reflecting that at the times when i had spoken in connection with the bill i felt why am i always the bridesmaid and never the blooming bride <e> <s> perhaps one fine day soon i shall wake up in the morning on my honeymoon <e> <s> in other words perhaps we shall win an amendment with myself as the sponsor of it <e> <s> however i just wanted to echo what everyone else has said <e> <s> i have the greatest admiration for the assiduity and the calmness with which the noble lord lord elton has dealt with us all and i am full of praise for his calmness <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can claim a certain amount of consistency in the passage of this bill <e> <s> to that end i have even put down my name to an amendment to be moved by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i have been trying with the help of others to improve the organisational aspects <e> <s> i have done so with little success so far <e> <s> but having put my name to an amendment to be moved by the noble lord the minister i think that we may have some success there i also have some hope that he will be sympathetic about this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all in favour of this amendment as i am of the other amendments in relation to this clause <e> <s> however and as the minister may know some slight worries are felt about the clause as a whole <e> <s> this amendment could perhaps be strengthened before third reading and i should like to explain to the house why i think that should be done and how it could be done <e> <s> under clause councils of each of the abolition counties will have to get a joint committee ready by st september in other words in just over two months time <e> <s> before then few committees of the councils will take place <e> <s> it is even less likely that meetings of the councils will take place in the month of august <e>", "<cs> my lords i come to praise australia not to bury her <e> <s> i welcome this bill personally and i also welcome it as a member of the cook society <e> <s> in case that society may not be well known to your lordships i would explain that it is not named after thomas cook the tourist but captain cook the explorer <e> <s> it has about members in this country whose duty it is to promote anglo-australian relations at a high level <e> <s> it has its counterparts in sydney and melbourne <e> <s> i have been specially charged by the noble lord lord shackleton to apologise because he is not here today to speak on this second reading as he is one of the many people who have australia in their hearts and therefore belong to the cook society <e>", "<cs> my lords when the abolition bill was before us last year one noble peer after another disclaimed any pretensions about wrecking the bill <e> <s> sometimes they were believed sometimes they were not <e> <s> i hope that i was because i have no party political angle coming as i do from these benches <e> <s> now once again as an independent <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will absolve me from any accusation of trying to vv reek this bill <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment so i venture to put forward some observations to your lordships <e> <s> you will remember that on second reading every speaker made clear that he supported the basic intention of the bill <e> <s> the majority of speakers on second reading made it clear that they thought the bill as drafted went far beyond its original intention <e> <s> as so many of your lordships are mixed up with voluntary organisations it is on that ground that i appeal to you to be very thoughtful about the proposi-tion which is being put to you <e> <s> this amendment tries to bring back to the bill the basic objective and thus avoids the concerns in the hearts and minds of so many of us <e>", "<cs> i believe that the comittee probably wants to get this matter settled and so i will cut short my own observations <e> <s> it is not a question as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said of whether a voluntary organisation of any kind will put out publicity designed to support a body such as the national front <e> <s> it is the other way around <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord did use the word support <e> <s> that is not our point at all it is the other way around <e> <s> let me give the committee an example <e> <s> in october wellingborough community relations council partly funded by the district council wrote to the head teacher of a local school urging him to withdraw an invitation to a national front member to talk to pupils of the school <e> <s> the letter stated <e>", "<cs> there are still problems despite what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i have here the example of an advice agency that sends out information in the city of winchester <e> <s> they could send out information about education grants in that city if it were funded by the hampshire county council but not if it were funded by the winchester district council <e> <s> why is that <e> <s> it is because hampshire is an education authority and winchester is not <e> <s> on the other hand the advice agency could send out leaflets upon house improvement grants if it were funded by winchester district council but not if it were funded by hampshire county council <e> <s> why <e> <s> this time the roles are reversed and winchester is the housing authority and hampshire is not <e> <s> that is the sort of nonsense that we on this side of the committee feel we should try to remove by the amendments before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going temporarily to upset the noble lord lord jenkins of putney by quoting the conservative party political broadcast on television last week which included the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that my notes have been shuffled as well on a number of occasions <e> <s> no it is clear to me that amendment no <e> <s> will be brought before the house only if by some ill chance amendment no <e> <s> is not carried <e> <s> we are not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have prefaced my remarks on amendment no <e> <s> by saying a courteous word to the minister because it is true that he has done several things that he promised he would do and for that we are grateful <e> <s> however i still feel partly on the ground of simplicity that our amendment is the better of the two <e> <s> i therefore wish to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> as he recommended in his few words the voluntary organisations should read and see what he said <e> <s> he thinks that they will be satisfied and i have a suspicion that i agree with him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as the first per cent <e> <s> layman on the committee whose report we are debating today <e> <s> i hope in minutes to guide you through its pages from the laymans point of view <e> <s> first as far as european committees in general are concerned it was a mystery to me until just recently to discover what happens when we prepare such reports in this house <e> <s> the terms of reference of the lords select committee on the european committees are <e>", "<cs> while the noble earl is thinking about that one perhaps i may ask whether i am right in thinking that the words in this clause are governed by the words in clause where hatred is described as being against a group of persons in great britain and it applies to the whole of this section <e> <s> surely that is the answer that so far as concerns the section we are talking about a crime against people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i appear before the noble baroness lady burton of coventry as one of the unconverted <e> <s> i am sorry but i must explain my reasons <e> <s> i take the house years ahead when at last i have screwed up the courage to take my car through the channel tunnel <e> <s> having driven to the ominously named terminal park i find there a mass of vehicles <e> <s> your lordships will remember if you have seen the literature in this context that initially vehicles every hour are expected to be using the tunnel each way <e> <s> as i sit there i am reminded of when i was in dunedin several years ago at the biggest slaughterhouse in the world where sheep are slaughtered each day <e> <s> however there had to be sheep in the surrounding countryside to make sure that a three-day supply of sheep was available <e>", "<cs> my text is taken from the select committees report at paragraph where it says <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the noble lord can take it that way if he wishes but i agree with the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> we want to see detailed proposals on the alternative ways of managing the safety of passengers in these trains <e> <s> for my part i hope that he will keep this very much in mind and press the amendment to a division if we have to <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something about the phrase artistic craftsmanship <e> <s> it was suggested to the minister that he should consult the crafts council and i think that is good advice <e> <s> it would also be good advice to consult the design council <e> <s> the word design does not appear anywhere in this particular part of the bill and yet one would have thought that one could copyright a design <e> <s> surely the design comes before the craftsmanship which is a point i should like the minister to consider <e>", "<cs> i had the wicked thought as we were debating this amendment that we would save an awful lot of time in this place if nobody could make a speech i paraphrase the words of clause a promoting or opposing a point of view on a question of political controversy which is identifiable with the view of either one party or the other <e> <s> that is my tactful way of pointing out how careful we must be to see that we do not injure free speech here in local authorities or even more importantly from my angle in voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister really imply from his reply to the question that the department does not know the number of wards that have been affected by financial savings <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm the extraordinary position at birmingham where the central birmingham district has been given a grant enabling the post of a nursing tutor to be established but it cannot get nurses to attend those classes because birmingham does not have the funds to staff the wards if they were to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it was a comprehensive answer to the cases i mentioned and of which i think he had prior knowledge <e> <s> in the circumstances i believe that it would be unworthy of me not to withdraw the amendment and i beg leave to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will know as well as i do that sometimes the chamber has to deal with an amendment which consists of changing only one word probably shall or may and that such an amendment has a desperate effect on the bill as a whole <e> <s> on other occasions there may be a fairly long amendment such as the one that we are now discussing which may appear to be very complicated <e> <s> however the amendment can be summed up in a few words to allow a voluntary code of practice to operate for a trial period <e> <s> that is the aim <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have had this problem in mind for several years will the noble earl hazard a guess as to how long it will take before oxford street or the kings road are as clean as all the streets in singapore copenhagen or moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords as the safety authority has issued this report and recommendations will there be any opportunity for members of your lordships house to study them <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a curious position <e> <s> apart from a reference by the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal i seem to be the only person to say a few words on this bill in relation to the voluntary organisations <e> <s> many noble lords will have much experience of the valuable work performed by the non-statutory and non-profit-making bodies <e> <s> there are over half a million such organisations in britain today <e> <s> over of them are registered charities <e> <s> over half the population performs some kind of voluntary work over the year <e> <s> from age concern to the world wildlife fund important work is done every day <e> <s> however in spite of the range and support for such work this bill does little to take account of these activities <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am delighted that he is prepared to have second thoughts about this amendment and i ask permission to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister speaks wisely when he suggests that we should digest what has been said <e> <s> we should all look carefully at the <e>", "<cs> there are four names down one of which is mine to oppose the motion that this clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> we wish to delete the whole of this residual rating but it is better to discuss it in connection with this clause <e>", "<cs> it strikes me how completely illlogical it is when one thinks of the hundreds of authorities in england wales and scotland that one has this enormous part of the bill dealing with local authorities now reduced to <e> <s> logic and common sense are on my side <e> <s> i shall vote against the proposal that this clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> if and when this amendment comes to be voted on and you are asked by members of the committee in whatever part of the chamber you happen to be what it is all about i beg you to say that it has nothing whatever to do with banding <e> <s> banding was dismissed by the committee in the first major amendment proposed to this bill <e> <s> we are not talking about banding between one section of the community and another <e> <s> we are talking about the very lowest band the poorest in the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most sincere in my thanks and congratulations to the minister for the improvements in the bill which have helped the voluntary organisations enormously or rather the people that the voluntary organisations serve <e> <s> however that still leaves a need to ensure that the charities themselves have the necessary finance to provide support services that have become increasingly important today <e> <s> to put it around the other way i feel that it is our job in this house to ensure that this novel form of taxation because that is what it is does not have the effect of destroying some of the real voluntary bodies and very seriously harming others <e>", "<cs> my lords to use a phrase that is sometimes used in this house from all on these benches i should like to thank the minister <e> <s> i am sure he will not mind if i couple that thought with thanks to the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble baroness lady stedman who have helped me from time to time <e> <s> i have been very impressed with the noble earls constant thoughts on the propositions put to him from all sides of the house and as somebody said we thank him not only for his speeches and sometimes his concessions but also for his willingness to write to us on a variety of subjects <e> <s> we are very grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that we are not talking about young people with mental disability to quote the draft regulations but about those with moderate learning difficulties <e> <s> would it not be much more appropriate for them to be interviewed not by a medical practitioner but by a careers officer <e>", "<cs> i find myself in some difficulty <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is not in point of fact an all-party amendment <e> <s> the name of the noble viscount lord ingleby is attached to both as is the name of the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> is the noble lord proposing both or are they alternatives <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in our heart of hearts nearly everybody in this house is ashamed of the litter in our streets and on our transport services <e> <s> will he tell us why he thinks that this move will be any more successful than the last one <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in catastrophes like this all the media should ask everybody to stay away from the area unless they have reason to be there <e> <s> and in particular people should be asked not to flood the telephone with the numbers given on the radio and television unless again they have real reason to ring up should they not <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the alluring title <e>", "<cs> my lords i now come to the management points <e> <s> the white paper makes two proposals to make something akin to a market <e> <s> major hospitals will be permitted to become self-sufficient self-governing <e> <s> last week the figure was <e> <s> this week it is <e> <s> i am not sure what it will be next week one must read the papers and listen to the government on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the man in the street of whom i am one know how to dispose of his old refrigerator <e> <s> is there a list of municipal councils which can do so without damaging the ozone layer <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the noble lord who has just spoken could have gone further and said i therefore propose to vote for the amendment <e> <s> what does the amendment say about the code of practice <e> <s> it says that authorities shall prepare and publish a voluntary code of practice for local authorities covering the scope of acceptable political activity by officers at the rank of principal officer and above <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> however i should point out that if the amendment is turned down we are back to the bill which is what we should be discussing and the words <e>", "<cs> by purest coincidence i read in the newspapers over the weekend of exactly the situation the noble baroness has just described <e> <s> the ombudsman said in his report that although he complained last year about the action of a local authority no remedial action had been taken therefore he could only again draw attention to the incident and hope for the best <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the minister for his thoughtful and very full explanation of the governments attitude towards this proposal <e> <s> however i think i made it clear that i was thinking more of the voluntary organisations than the local authorities <e> <s> i think therefore that i should consult with the voluntary organisations to ascertain what they feel as a result of the governments statement <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is true that yesterday i had an inkling of the governments attitude to this amendment in the circumstances that the minister has indicated <e> <s> however he has gone further this time <e> <s> i am much obliged to him for that <e> <s> it would be churlish to turn such an attitude into any form of rejection <e> <s> we should like to study the matter extremely carefully <e> <s> it is a complicated issue <e> <s> the minister has made it quite clear that his aims and our aims are very nearly identical <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that other european countries are far more advanced than we are in this matter <e> <s> has the minister been able to inform himself about that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords having already demonstrated how carefully i listened at a previous stage to the ministers speech i think that i must therefore do the same again <e> <s> in a way i am in a dilemma because as i understand it he feels that i should be comforted by an amendment which is yet to be debated <e> <s> that amendment may or may not be carried <e> <s> nevertheless in the circumstances i think that i must reserve my position and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some difficulty <e> <s> i have not seen the consultation document and whether i should have done i do not know <e> <s> there is no doubt that the minister has been good enough to make some concessions which go quite a long way towards solving the problems of the voluntary organisations <e> <s> my inclination if i have the concurrence of my two supporters they seem to be shaking their heads is to ask to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i ask that the house agree that the amendment be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to your lordships i hope that perhaps i am also speaking to parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> yesterday i suffered having to listen to parts of the employment bill a big bill in itself but it
