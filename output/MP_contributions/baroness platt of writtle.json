["<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord crowther-hunt for having raised the question of higher and further education and for enabling me to make my maiden speech on a subject which is very close to my heart <e> <s> a week ago as i stood at the table listening to my writ of summons being read out it referred to arduous and urgent affairs <e> <s> i was struck that afternoon by the historic nature of the ceremony and how every generation regards its affairs as the most arduous and urgent and we are no exception <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to address my remarks also the last item referred to in her majestys gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with pleasure that i rise to support the recommendations of the report of the select committee of the noble lord lord gregson <e> <s> as the noble lord remarked the inquiry originated as a result of an approach by basildon district council with regard to the pitsea landfill site in essex <e> <s> we in essex are very grateful for the objectivity of lord gregsons select committee and for its appreciation of the urgency of the problem of hazardous waste <e>", "<cs> my lords i first of all should like to thank the noble baroness lady david for establishing the subject this afternoon and to apologise to her for not being here to hear her speak or indeed to hear the beginning of my noble friend lord eltons speech but in essex we were conferring with the cbi with the idea of encouraging small business into our county and indeed talking about the cbi helping us to provide employment for young people and jobs which is one of the important parts of our policy <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend lord vaizey is not here to hear that certainly education and industry local government and industry do meet <e> <s> this is not a surprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome very much the initiative of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in moving for papers on the problems involved in the system of local rates <e> <s> also like other members of your lordships house i enjoyed the delightful way he introduced the motion <e> <s> we are a very adult democracy <e> <s> we are described as the mother of parliaments <e> <s> perhaps we are also the father of local government <e> <s> local government has been at work in this country as i have heard today certainly from early times but perhaps nearer to its present form in the late th century <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend if full advantage is being taken of such newer trends as intermediate treatment or a fostering unit such as that which has recently opened in essex which might allow some girls and i realise they are difficult girls to have the opportunity of a proper family life and to have more chance to succeed and which might be more economical <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the raising of this subject by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the armitage report and the action that the government propose to take on it is very important to this country and to the people who live here <e> <s> we are all concerned about the movement of lorries and the effect they have on our environment <e> <s> i speak with some feeling as i live in a house which is more than years old and which lies within feet of a main road in a beautiful and ancient village which has been in dire need of a by-pass for at least years to my personal knowledge <e> <s> i speak naturally of my own village of writtle in the county of essex <e> <s> we at last now have a by-pass planned for the year / <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his clear exposition of this bill <e> <s> it has been substantially altered since first-seeing the light of day and that is a relief to many of us especially the dropping of the clause to require a referendum before levying a supplementary rate <e> <s> there are those who would have liked to keep the power to levy a supplementary rate but until a few years ago a supplementary rate was a rarity <e> <s> and for many of us it is an anathema as it presents as my noble friend the minister said an unexpected bill to ratepayers in the middle of a financial year which could be a considerable burden both to firms and to individuals <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend the minister will be able to look at this matter again <e> <s> i agree with him entirely on the importance of independence and i can see that that is an important matter <e> <s> but it seems to me that the question of a list of auditors appointed by the audit commission ensures this independence because they will have decided who is on the list and if the local authority is then able to choose from that list that is not the same as just choosing anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the association of county councils is particularly anxious about this and i hope it will be possible to do something before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister agree that the special constables can form a very good bridge between the regular police force and the community <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend the minister for some information on his new clause because i confess to being uncertain <e> <s> first after the amendments which my noble friend said he intends to bring in at report stage will local government be answerable both to the commission and to parliament or will they not <e> <s> perhaps he was saying that they would not be responsible to parliament on this matter <e> <s> secondly as regards the reason for this new clause are the studies to be done before legislation or after and if they are to be done before legislation if it were proved that legislation resulted in less economy efficiency and effectiveness by local government would the idea be that it should not be enacted <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall raise the point under amendment no <e> <s> h <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend now provide the information for which i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> i do not think that i need to add any words to what he has said except to underline his remarks with considerable sincerity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the spirit of this amendment though whether it is the amendment or the amendment to the amendment i am not sure but the most important thing is to foster the spirit of partnership between the secretary of state and the local authorities <e> <s> therefore whichever way is more convienient i would be in favour of and i would very much support this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that we ought first to hear the results of the research to find out what proportion of the atmosphere is acid before jumping to conclusions <e>", "<cs> i must apologise that i was not here at the beginning of the discussion on this particular clause <e> <s> the word experiment is being used many times but i cannot find it anywhere in the bill <e> <s> reference has been made to the relationships between the police and the public and it would help them if it were quite clear that this is an experiment and stated as such in the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister could do that <e>", "<cs> i shall wait to hear my noble friend the minister regarding whether or not this should be mandatory <e> <s> i very much favour the fitting of laminated windscreens <e> <s> whenever we our own family buy a car which we find is not fitted with a laminated windscreen we have it altered before we drive it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that statement <e> <s> i will take his advice and study the leaflet which he says is in the library in order to see what this means for local government <e> <s> it sounds to me as though it will mean that responsible local government will have a difficult task in carrying out its statutory duty with yet a further reduction in grant <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the government will pay particular regard to the needs of those low spending local authorities who over many years have followed the present governments policy of reducing public expenditure and also whether they will pay particular regard to the economies which have been made in the past when they set rate support grants grant-related expenditure allocations and targets so that their decision will be fair to the ratepayers of those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for raising this subject today and for the sentiments which he so inspiringly put forward in his unstarred question <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate as have all other noble lords the noble lord lord russell of liverpool on a brilliant maiden speech <e> <s> perhaps he has answered the noble viscounts question <e> <s> at least one young man is prepared to spend a good deal of time preparing a speech on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i must apologise to the house that i was not able to be present at the start of the debate on this important subject by the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> i feel however that there have been interesting developments in education over the past few years which will help to promote the economic recovery of our country which we all want to see <e> <s> the hour is late and i shall be brief <e> <s> i think the most interesting development has been a change in attitude in schools colleges and universities which fortunately has achieved all-party support <e> <s> some years ago i think in the late s i remember reading the words <e>", "<cs> may i ask for clarification from my noble and learned friend <e> <s> he says that if a data user proves that there is no negligence then that is his defence <e> <s> but supposing an external person cracks the computer and gets in from outside <e> <s> can the data subject prove an offence against an illegal entry as it were to the data information <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but may i go one stage further <e> <s> would the data subject then be able to prove offence against the person who had broken into the computer <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking in favour of the dartford tunnel bill i must declare my interest as vice-chairman of the essex county council and an essex ratepayer <e> <s> you lordships will know that the bill is jointly promoted by kent and essex county councils to replace the dartford tunnel act <e> <s> however i am not a member of the tunnel joint committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of high cross for raising this matter as i agree with him that the truck acts need substantial updating <e> <s> they were originally enacted in the th century for very good reason in order to prevent exploitation of workers by prohibiting payment in kind or illegal deductions from wages <e> <s> at that time this meant ensuring payment of wages in cash on a weekly basis to manual workers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state be arranging an opportunity for a parental input into this matter <e> <s> it is important that teachers should be discussing the matter but most important of all is as my noble friend lord nugent of guildford suggested that children are watching television for nearly as long as they are in school <e> <s> that is in the hands of parents <e> <s> will the secretary of state discuss this matter with parents <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i say what a great privilege it has been to be invited to sit on the select committee for science and technology and to take part in the fascinating technical questioning and study leading up to the publication of the report on <e>", "<cs> my lords i must from the start declare my interest as chairman of the equal opportunities commission although it is not of course a personal or financial interest <e> <s> the equal opportunities commission has as one of its duties under the sex discrimination act to keep under review the working of the act and of the equal pay act <e> <s> hence it takes this matter very seriously <e> <s> it would have been preferable if the draft regulations before us this afternoon had been in the form of a straight forward amendment to the act so that it would have been capable of further amendment in your lordships house <e> <s> as it is we can only accept or reject these draft regulations <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this debate as an opportunity to allow opinions to be stated in our house before decisions are made by the governmment in this important and difficult matter <e> <s> i should also like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord chapple on his interesting and realistic maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i speak in support of this important report presented by the noble lord lord gregson our effective and excellent chairman <e> <s> it is i submit to your lordships a report crucial to the future prosperity of our nation <e> <s> in any difficult situation todays situation in our country in both financial and employment terms continues to be difficult the most important resources to help solve that problem will be human <e> <s> our technology is only as good as the people who control it <e> <s> companies and government in this country have provided training over a period of years <e> <s> greater emphasis was placed on training following the setting-up of the training boards after the act <e> <s> that was especially true of the larger companies some of which invested considerable resources in putting it into action <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of great pleasure to me and to the equal opportunities commission that the select committee has come out positively in favour of the directive for parental leave <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord seebohm for his lucid and highly supportive exposition of the report <e> <s> that for us is a matter of great importance and we hope that it will influence the government also to support such a directive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to take part in this debate <e> <s> i must first apologise to your lordships for my lateness and therefore for having to my regret missed the noble baronesss introductory speech and other early speeches <e> <s> i shall read them with great interest in <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful my lords <e> <s> it was endlessly repeated at the cbi meeting which i chaired that the short-term answer to the problem must lie in maximising the talents of the existing workforce <e> <s> helping women to bridge the career break to combine responsible family life and a career makes good commercial sense and to see to it that expensive investment in education training and in-house expertise is not lost either to the employer or the employee should be the order of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware of the great importance of the ratification of the united nations convention to a great many women who have worked extremely hard often on a voluntary basis for the united nations decade and who feel that it should happen before then as evidence of the governments commitment to the improvement of the position of women in society <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the government have considered the idea of instead of placing a harsh total ban on tbt-based paints as is being suggested at present of allowing only those paints which he has just mentioned with a lower rate of leaching of tri-organo tin compound which i suggested to the department of the environment in my letter of th may <e>", "<cs> my lords like every other speaker in your lordships house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also express gratitude to the noble baroness lady serota for initiating this debate on the select committee report on equal treatment for men and women in the matter of taxation which arose from their consideration of the european memorandum on the subject <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that the questions of equal opportunities and taxation are closely interrelated and of considerable importance <e> <s> during its lifetime the equal opportunities commission has consistently received complaints about the lack of equality in taxation and demands for support in putting the situation right <e> <s> at present there is hope in the air in the united kingdom and throughout europe due to the memorandum <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the secretary of state for employment aware that because of the interrupted nature of many womens careers due to responsibilities at home per cent <e> <s> of pensioners on supplementary pension are women <e> <s> is he aware also that the equal opportunities commission has constantly pressed for the equalisation of both retirement and pension ages between men and women generally <e> <s> does he not agree that it is a matter of great importance to women to be able to work longer in order to earn a better pension if they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the equal opportunities commission it is my pleasant duty to welcome this bill in general terms although later on i shall also have specific reservations <e> <s> the commission has for some time been pressing the government to comply with the decision of the european court of justice in november when it found that our legislation was deficient on three grounds with reference to private households small employers and collective agreements <e> <s> this bill is being introduced in the first instance to deal with these matters <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord trefgarne for his reply and for the way in which he has expanded upon the explanation that was given on second reading <e> <s> some of his remarks have given me considerably more faith in the clause <e> <s> on the other hand i still think that it would be a good thing if i were to read in <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i therefore beg leave of the committee to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> while agreeing in and again now that the factories act should be repealed in order to equalise the conditions under which both men and women work the equal opportunities commission then as now propose minimum standards of welfare a code of practice in the longer term and transitional measures to protect women currently employed subject to the present restrictions <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend and with the leave of the committee withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i shall take pleasure in visiting the department to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> do i understand that my amendment amendment no <e> <s> together with the consequential amendment amendment no <e> <s> must be taken at the same time <e>", "<cs> from all sides of the committee there have been pleas to the government to think again <e> <s> i will withdraw this amendment with the leave of the committee this evening but i am dissatisfied with the governments reply <e> <s> i reserve the right to bring it back and i shall be very likely to do so <e> <s> i hope very much that in the meantime the government will reconsider this in the light of what has been said this evening <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am interested to hear what my noble friend the minister said about the health and safety executive in suggesting that acas was the nominating body <e> <s> obviously the equal opportunities commission was very cognisant of the fact that the health and safety executive had jurisdiction in this area <e> <s> that might therefore be the answer <e>", "<cs> do i take it that my noble friend is giving an undertaking that the notes of guidance will be issued <e> <s> i know that notes of guidance are normally issued by the department of employment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for that undertaking and i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i express my gratitude to my noble friend the secretary of state and support this amendment to clause <e> <s> the equal opportunities commission was concerned that without the amendment the bill might fail to comply with the european equal treatment directive <e> <s> it is important that small professional partnerships should be treated in the same way as small firms

find it possible to accept what we believe is a very reasonable amendment <e> <s> at a time when there is a substantial change both in legislation and if this proposal is agreed in hours of work we feel that protection is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity on third reading of the sex discrimination bill to welcome the improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission welcomes the governments prompt reponse to the european court decision in <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission welcomes this clause which will widen considerably the opportunities for both educational institutions and others to make special provision for the minority sex where there have been few or none involved in a particular occupation over the past months <e> <s> over the past few

proceed will permanently reduce the capacity and financial viability of that airport <e> <s> will he look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government considering being more generous in
