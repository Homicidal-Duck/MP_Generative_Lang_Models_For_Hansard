grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for raising this question <e> <s> i am also very grateful to all other noble lords who have spoken in the debate for the way in which they seem to have agreed that the important task which lies before the government is to get on with both a nuclear programme in order to meet our electricity needs for the future and with educating the public at large as to the safety and the usefulness of this form of energy <e> <s> i would submit that there has been a remarkable unanimity from all sides of the house on the need for nuclear energy to fill the energy gap which we all know is going to exist and which is very nearly existing already <e> <s> i think that it is accepted by everybody that some nuclear energy will he needed <e> <s> therefore if we are to embark upon a programme of nuclear power stations it has to be a properly integrated programme for nuclear energy <e> <s> in saying that i would stress the importance of the fast reactor to any programme of nuclear energy embarked upon <e> <s> the fact is that it is the water-moderated reactors the magnox reactors and the advanced gas-cooled reactors which produce the radioactive waste which has to be dealt with <e> <s> it is the fast reactors which can deal with this waste <e> <s> in fact the amount of radioactive waste produced by a fast breeder reactor over a period of time is so small that if fully distilled down to its minimum size it would probably amount to only a couple of breakfast cups full of undisposable waste in a year from a full-sized power station <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord got it right <e> <s> they consume plutonium <e> <s> they may be made to produce some sort of plutonium but it is not bomb-quality plutonium <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble duke the duke of atholl for introducing this subject into the house <e> <s> i am always glad to talk about salmon and it is always a fascinating subject <e> <s> as the noble duke rightly pointed out it is time that we returned to this subject and returned with an intention to legislate <e> <s> it is also good to see that this short debate tonight has produced or will produce at least one maiden speech to which i shall listen with great interest <e> <s> i ought to start by declaring a number of interests <e> <s> i am the chairman and principal shareholder of a

thurso and district river fisheries board and the district salmon fisheries board and i am president of the association of scottish district salmon fishery boards so i have a lot of interest in this subject in all senses of the word <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to keep my remarks suitably short for a short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that one of the steeply rising costs of these airports is the sum of money that they have to pay in rates <e> <s> would it not be a sensible idea to derate these small local airstrips for the benefit of the communities which they serve <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give me an assurance that the matter will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has spoken of minimum standards and higher standards but would the government not consider it advisable to lay down standard standards <e>", "<cs> my lords not all liberals agree with the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i think that a very large body of opinion within the liberal party agrees <e>", "<cs> your lordships can all woo me if you like <e> <s> i dissociate myself from the idea that to pursue the development of fast breeder reactors is to create a bomb hazard <e> <s> this argument to me is rather like saying that if we sell cars we are selling the capability of making tanks and therefore we must pack up the motor industry and go back to the stage coach <e> <s> the argument that the fast breeder reactor is justified only if stocks of uranium are running low is in my view rubbish because the fast breeder reactor is justified for all the other reasons of safety efficiency plutonium stock management and so on which are adumbrated in this document <e> <s> however an unstarred question is not the time for family squabbles so i will if i may turn to the document and to the supplementary questions which i should like to ask her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure from these benches to welcome this little but valuable bill one which if i may say so is compassionate and indeed christian in its provisions <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to thank the noble lord lord ross of marnock and his honourable friend in another place for having brought forward this bill since it is indeed very much needed by certain classes of disabled persons in scotland <e> <s> it has also been a fine sight to see the noble lord lord ross of marnock discarding his sackcloth and shaking the ashes out of his shaggy locks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know if the noble lord is asking for an answer <e> <s> i believe that totally illegally but pragmatically and thriftily certain people in the north and west of sutherland used to cash their tokens in with the garage and get petrol in exchange the garage would then cash the tokens in with the bus company when it filled up the buses <e> <s> this would be one way in which you could do it <e> <s> i am sure it is totally illegal <e>

introduced his motion to your <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord ritchie-calder for drawing our attention to this important subject and in the process

antarctic just in time <e> <s> if it is too late the blame will lie at our door and not at his <e> <s> i say at our door because it will now be up to us to urge the importance of conservation in this area <e> <s> it will be up to us to urge a proper scientific control of development in the southern ocean and the continent of antarctica it will be up to us to urge mankind to behave as mankind has never behaved before and allow reason to control greed <e> <s> no longer shall we be able to claim ignorance of the danger which faces us because thanks to the noble lord lord ritchie-calder we ken noo <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally was not aware of that <e> <s> i had not at that time joined your lordships house <e> <s> but once again we have had brought to us the information which the noble lord lord shackleton first brought to our attention and it deserves the thanks of all of us <e> <s> those of us who like me have joined in this kind of debate at a later stage will ken noo <e>", "<cs> my lords on the continental shelf near to the argentine people are actually bringing up oil <e> <s> so we know that in that very large area there is oil <e> <s> it would be splitting hairs to argue that it is unlikely that there is any oil in the continental shelf which stretches from around the falkland islands to the southern tip of south america <e> <s> but there is a threat that there might be and there is a real possibility that ways and means of finding it and developing it will be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that in some of these respects we are splitting hairs <e> <s> there is no antarctic ocean <e> <s> in the northern hemisphere it is simple the arctic ocean is surrounded by land <e> <s> one talks about the arctic ocean <e> <s> in the southern hemisphere the antarctic is a land mass surrounded by ocean and around that land mass there exists what is broadly referred to as the southern ocean <e> <s> for the purposes of this debate i am talking about the south atlantic the south pacific the south indian ocean and the south of other oceans <e> <s> if one looks at the world from the bottom upwards as it were one sees the area of water surrounding the antarctic <e> <s> that is what i am referring to as the southern ocean <e> <s> i may be totally wrong and no doubt when the noble lord lord shackleton speaks later in the debate he will demolish my remarks completely <e> <s> that is what i am talking about at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too thank the minister for repeating the statement and we also thank the ministers who attended the various meetings for the effort that they put into reaching the agreements which they have reached <e> <s> i am glad that the meetings were on a friendly and constructive level because it is very important to us both now and in the future that when we discuss these matters with our friends and neighbours and fellow members of the eec we should do so on a friendly and constructive basis since we are all trying to get what is best for the community <e>", "<cs> my lords before i turn to the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland bill may i remind the noble lord lord ross of marnock that whatever they may read in strathclyde we in the far north still start the day with the <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense spheres of influence <e> <s> it seems to me that both bills tend to deal with the same subject <e> <s> which one therefore is to have priority <e> <s> i can perhaps explain that more clearly to the noble earl privately afterwards <e>", "<cs> it seems that we are discussing a matter of principle which in many ways should really have been discussed at second reading <e> <s> but if we are to restate our principles our principles from these benches are that tenants should be given a right to purchase their house but the great principle of scottish law which overrides everything that nobody shall so use their right as to harm their neighbour <e>", "<cs> i think that as regards this amendment we are probably more able to go hand-in-hand with the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord galpern <e> <s> however i feel that eight years is rather too long <e> <s> i would much prefer a figure of five years which seems to be a reasonable period by which one could prove ones intent and ones <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl clarify the point which he made <e> <s> he quoted the case of a prison officer <e> <s> as i read the bill it says <e>", "<cs> the discounts are indeed too high <e> <s> the noble earl has not explained this to us <e> <s> what will be the differential when all these houses come on the market <e> <s> at the moment maybe the difference is per cent <e> <s> between owner-occupied and non-owner occupied <e> <s> once all these houses become available for purchase is the figure not going to change <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that the difference between rented and vacant possession houses is going to narrow very considerably <e>", "<cs> this clearly has to be a probing amendment because to leave this whole section out of the bill would wreck it and it is obviously not intended to be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> now there are one or two questions that arise <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl lord mansfield can help us with these questions <e> <s> i take it that anybody who lives in one of these houses mentioned in this list of categories can buy that house <e> <s> he does not necessarily have to buy a council house does he <e> <s> he could buy the house that he lives in <e> <s> if that is so this surely presents fairly major problems because some of the houses for instance are remote doctors houses <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think i have made the point i am probing and was asking the question in relation to these small numbers of houses <e> <s> i do not quarrel with the fact that people who live in these special sort of houses should acquire points as it were when they go to council houses <e> <s> but i wonder whether they are going to be entitled to buy the specific houses they live in <e>", "<cs> i think we had it explained to us earlier in this debate that the principle is that workers in the public service living in houses provided by the public service should be allowed to acquire points towards the purchase of a local authority house <e> <s> if that is so it seems that if workers in the royal dockyard who are presumably working in the public service are living in houses provided publicly they should be entitled to this privilege <e> <s> but if this indeed applies and if the government say that they will consider it this brings to my mind the case of the united kingdom atomic energy authority where one-third of the employees in the town of thurso work in the public service they are public service employees and are living in tied houses which they cannot buy <e> <s> therefore they would surely be entitled to collect points <e> <s> however i do not see the name of the atomic energy authority anywhere in the list <e> <s> if this particular amendment is successful or even if it is not i shall certainly be examining this question more closely with a view possibly to introducing an amendment at the report stage <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment which i hope the government will consider with sensibility and compassion <e> <s> providing for the needs of the disabled is an expensive business <e> <s> it is not a cheap matter to put in all the facilities that might be required for somebody who uses a disablement vehicle and who goes in and out of the house in a wheelchair and requires handholds and so forth in the bathroom and other facilities so that he or she can live a fairly normal life in spite of his or her disability <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister for clarification in one respect <e> <s> he mentioned the right of pre-emption <e> <s> can he tell me where in the bill lies the right of pre-emption in regard to a house specially adapted for a disabled person <e>", "<cs> it is unfortunate that the three subsections of amendment no <e> <s> which are linked with the same part of the bill but not linked in sense have been put in as one amendment <e> <s> we would appreciate it if your lordships would allow us to consider them as three separate subjects for debate <e>", "<cs> i am not talking merely about the drafting <e> <s> i mentioned the drafting but the noble earl did tell me earlier on that this particular problem was solved by clause <e> <s> if he is going to tell me that now i am going to tell him that clause does not solve it <e>", "<cs> the noble earl started it <e>", "<cs> my lords i really feel i must say that the noble earl lord mansfield does not appear to have listened to what i said <e> <s> he is of course a little further away from being an old age pensioner than i am but surely a person who moves into the kind of housing which <e>", "<cs> i think i owe it to the noble lord lord ross of marnock to explain the difference in our attitude between this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> we felt that local authorities were being invited to become judges in their own cause <e> <s> in this amendment we are saying that there may well be a case which the local council may see but the judge should be the secretary of state and that is the slight measure of difference between us on this point <e> <s> nevertheless whether we may disagree or agree on the emphasis the purpose of both our amendments is the same and that is to safeguard particularly the smaller rural authorities where a housing plan could go very much out of balance with too many sales <e> <s> in fact at the last general election the tory party manifesto specifically suggested safeguards against too many sales in rural areas and i am surprised that they do not now see these suggestions with some pleasure in that we are helping them to honour their manifesto in this respect <e>", "<cs> i am not so much concerned with the speculator and the shark <e> <s> in this instance i should like some information on what happens in the event of a death <e> <s> let us assume that mr mctavish or mr smith buys his house and he makes a will and leaves the house to his son hoping that he will live for five years expecting that he will live for five years and then he is stricken down in the prime of life and his son inherits <e> <s> is this deemed to be a sale <e> <s> is this deemed to be a disposal <e> <s> and if so is the son then deprived of per cent <e> <s> of the discount <e> <s> it would seem to be an unnecessary hardship to impose at such a time and i wonder whether this would happen and whether it is intended that it should happen <e>", "<cs> this is an important and interesting new clause one which would bring the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland bill more into line with the housing bill which covers the same problems in england and wales <e> <s> it would also help to deal with this problem which has been referred to again and again in debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that clause is shutting the stable door after the horse has gone <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> we on these benches and i in particular would like to support the noble earl lord minto on this amendment <e> <s> i served for many years on the caithness county council and on thurso town council and i am currently lord lieutenant in caithness <e> <s> i therefore know how much social responsibility is now falling on the convenor of the county who in our particular instance has lost two town councils <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his assurance <e> <s> i would state at once that i know i will be supported in this by noble lords who have subscribed to my amendments <e> <s> in these circumstances i would be delighted to discuss this further with the noble earl <e> <s> i think it is essential that we deal with the matter at this juncture <e> <s> when i say at this juncture i mean while this bill is going through your lordships house because the opportunity may not arise conveniently again <e> <s> but on the assurance that i have been given i am very happy to accept the noble earls advice and to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord ross of marnock i have to welcome the arrival of this little bill in your lordships house but deplore its niggardly outlines <e> <s> the noble lord drew out attention to the pledge given in another place that scotland and england would be treated equally <e> <s> as he pointed out that pledge was given by the leader of the house of commons in answer to a question by my right honourable friend mr david steel <e> <s> he said and i quote from column of the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i am obviously in the hands of your lordships house <e> <s> i can only point out that although we do not have a speaker and although we do not have the same sort of clear-cut regulation that applies in another place we do have the supremacy of the house as a whole <e> <s> therefore if <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that the real problem which exercises the noble earl lord ferrers in his capacity as leader of the house at this moment is the question of dealing with disabled persons in this particular amendment <e> <s> if however i were to move a manuscript amendment to this amendment leaving out paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i do wish to be guided by the leader of the house and i asked him for guidance <e> <s> i asked him whether it would be competent for me to move a manuscript amendment leaving out paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had a little personal experience of this manoeuvre because i once had to do it before when i was introducing a bill in your lordships house <e> <s> i have therefore amended the amendment so that it can be laid upon the table in your lordships house simply by crossing out a and writing a instead of b and b instead of c <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to lay this amendment on your lordships table as a manuscript amendment if that is the pleasure of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords you have indeed been kind to me and i am very sensible of it but i plead that in this particular instance we have not had a great deal of time for working things out <e> <s> if i have been a bit slow in coming forward with things i plead that we have been under some pressure in this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care and attention to what the noble earl said in defence of this bill <e> <s> in particular i listened to what he said quoting from <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hughes has put the position very clearly and very well <e> <s> i really do not think that the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood has realised the enormity of what her friends are trying to do <e> <s> these houses which successive councils have tried to build as a stock of houses for old people who need them are now at risk because unless it is amended by the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock the law will state <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is going to submit a change from what is on the marshalled list should there not be a manuscript amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us an assurance that before assuming that we know the views of the falkland islanders they will be given some chance of being heard by a referendum or by a means that ascertains their views person by person <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord cromartie has indeed set us an admirable example this afternoon of brevity in a short debate <e> <s> he has also set us an admirable example by setting out clearly and concisely what his objective is and given us a clear idea of what we have to talk about <e> <s> i disagree with him about emphasis and i disagree with him over a number of suggestions he makes but i certainly agree with the intent and purport of his motion this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we too raise no objection to the order in general principle <e> <s> i am personally a little concerned and most apologetic that the debate began a little earlier than i expected and so i missed the beginning of the speech of the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> it was the beginning of the speech to which i would have listened with the greatest of attention since no doubt it dealt with specific grants payable to local authorities in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of land for use as public open spaces <e> <s> i am a little worried about the provision of public open space in scotland <e> <s> we need in our burghs and towns as much open space as we can get if we are to provide the play areas that our children need <e> <s> any diminution of the amount of grant for the acquisition of public open space must make it more difficult to provide the kind of play areas that may well be needed for our children <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw attention to one thing which i feel is escaping the thinking of the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> at the moment an agricultural occupier of land has the full right to use that land for any agricultural purpose he sees fit <e> <s> if any kind of order or restriction is placed upon that land it is inevitable that its value to him is diminished whether he be an owner a tenant a crofter or whatever it may be <e> <s> i think it is very important for us to recognise that any new restriction placed upon the operations which may be carried out upon a piece of land whether it is right or wrong to do so will make a financial difference to the man who earns his living on that piece of land <e> <s> i do not think that is being totally recognised <e> <s> it is being said if a difference is made he may have the opportunity to prove that a certain amount of loss has occurred <e> <s> but the moment any restriction is placed upon land it makes a difference and i think we have to be very clear about this because the amount of difference it can make may be quite large not only in what the man is able to do in his day-to-day operations but as regards what the land is worth to him if he sells it or gives up farming and seeks compensation <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would like an example let him imagine a field filled with young lambs being attacked by black backed gulls <e> <s> this was the example given to us earlier by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> if a black backed gull is killing lambs you cannot wait to get permsision to try some other means <e> <s> you have to seize a gun and go out and get it <e>", "<cs> i think the wording is better if unforeseen is substituted for incidental because incidental means careless in the true sense of the word caring less but i cannot see how somebody can take steps to prevent something happening which he cannot foresee <e>", "<cs> we have a real problem here <e> <s> i personally prefer the use of the word unforeseen because i do not think that people deliberately want to go and destroy birds or their nests <e> <s> i think it could be foreseen that if you cut a hedge in springtime you are liable to destroy nests <e> <s> it would be very surprising if you were to cut corn and destroy nests because that is not the season <e> <s> however there is an occasion when there would be a problem and that is if one has a field which one ploughed early in the season preparatory to growing a crop of corn and the ringed plovers come and nest in it which is what they will do <e> <s> it would be very difficult to avoid all the ringed plover nests in that particular ploughed area <e> <s> yet if one went ahead with ones cultivations would one or would one not have foreseen the destruction of birds nests <e> <s> it is quite a difficult problem <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord onslow asked for evidence of gangs of youths going about with airguns <e> <s> i can give it to him <e> <s> every year i am deed to use a good scottish word by gangs of youths who come out from thurso along the footpath and past my house which is attached to the ruins of thurso castle <e> <s> in the ruins many species of birds nest from fulmars to sparrows and i am constantly rushing out to drive away the youths who are coming out and firing at my house in order to try to shoot some of these nesting birds for no good reason and certainly for no conservation reason <e> <s> occasionally they wound a fulmar or two but they do absolutely no good and cause considerable disquiet and danger to me my family and my friends <e> <s> i am constantly having to call out the police especially in springtime and it would help enormously in curtailing this activity if it were fully understood that the airgun is not a suitable weapon wherewith to go shooting small birds <e>", "<cs> i referred to birds from fulmars to sparrows <e> <s> we have jackdaws and all kinds of birds nesting in these ruins <e> <s> one need have only one sparrow there and if the man says having hit a fulmar i was aiming at a sparrow what can you do about it <e> <s> i assure noble lords that if he hits me and says he was aiming at a sparrow he will get more than he bargained for <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to see the air weapon banned as a weapon wherewith to shoot wild birds of any sort and i see no practical reason for using it <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment i feel that there is one point that she brought up which should be mentioned <e> <s> i fear over-simplification <e> <s> i believe it would be an awful mistake to think that you could include all legislation to do with deer in a bill of this kind <e> <s> certainly in scotland it would be a great mistake not to have the deer act that we have there <e> <s> i think that the idea of putting everything into one bill is perhaps an unwise objective in certain instances <e>", "<cs> the great black-backed gull is a vicious powerful predator which will kill not merely a weakling lamb but a good thriving lamb by sheer attack while perhaps the mother is lying a bit weak after giving birth <e> <s> they will take the eyes out of a lambing ewe the tongue out of a lamb while it is being lambed and they will go right through the frontal bone of a lamb to kill it <e> <s> if they are allowed to multiply in an area they can cause great damage in the lambing field <e> <s> to say that they take the occasional weakly lamb is a minimisation of their danger which nobody in the north of scotland would accept <e>", "<cs> i think we are in danger of losing our sense of proportion here <e> <s> there must be something like million houses in this country and most of them are constructed as habitats for human beings and not as habitats for bats <e> <s> in the case of six houses where there are interesting colonies of rare bats i think we have made out a very good case for special arrangements to be made to try to protect those colonies <e> <s> this does not seem to me to justify our making it impossible for the owners of the other -odd houses in this country which arc constructed as habitats for human beings to be deprived of their ability to defend themselves from invading species of other sorts <e> <s> i think we are tending to lose a sense of proportion <e>", "<cs> is there not a misprint here because on page line the amendment would put seals in between saxifrage and sow-thistle <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments unwillingness to declare a policy regarding the future of a fast breeder reactor is already beginning to threaten the existence of the very teams who will be needed if the fast reactor is wanted <e>", "<cs> the nature conservancy council are remarkably good at feeding to the media such statistics as they feel may help their case <e> <s> they did it to me not so very long ago by feeding a story to the media about a site of special scientific interest which lies upon my land at a time when it was still being considered under appeal procedure by a forestry advisory committee it was still in the process of appeal procedure and about to come before the secretary of state <e> <s> i feel that one cannot let this spate of statistics go by without some comment because i have an interest in this <e>", "<cs> may i tell the noble earl that they have never yet asked me for permission before declaring a site of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson called for a sense of proportion on this matter <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow called for colourful language <e> <s> personally on this particular amendment i would prefer a sense of proportion to colourful language <e> <s> i think that a sense of proportion requires facts and facts are hard to come by <e> <s> i find it almost impossible to recognise the ncc that i know in the description of what goes on in wales given to us by the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> but in the highlands of scotland we have a very different situation <e> <s> there is already in the highlands million acres of sssis <e> <s> that is in the seven crofting counties <e> <s> it is widely said all over the highlands that the ncc intend to expand that until per cent <e> <s> of the whole area of the highlands is under an sssi <e>", "<cs> this is what i understand from my conversations with officers of the ncc <e>", "<cs> i will give some evidence which shows the extent to which they throw blankets around areas <e> <s> again i refer to an area which is on my ground <e> <s> at the centre of this area is about acres of flat blanket bog <e> <s> this is the area which the ncc consider should be preserved <e> <s> around it they have thrown an area of about acres <e> <s> they have done this they say just in case anything happened to the hydrology of the area that might damage this wet bog in the centre <e> <s> yet all over the area are sheep drains that were put in at the time of my great grandfather

area that has <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has got it wrong <e> <s> nobody can lower the water table by draining on the other side of a watershed <e> <s> if the noble earl can tell me how to drain a bog by making a ditch a mile away from the bog on flat peatland i shall be very glad indeed of the information because it would be vital information for the hill farmers in scotland <e>", "<cs> i would be glad if i was sure that was so but it seems to me you may well find that you are unable to get your drainage grant and so on because a place is declared an sssi <e> <s> now at the <e>", "<cs> i wish the noble lord would allow me to finish my sentence <e> <s> what i was going to say was that a place is declared an sssi without consultation because on none of the existing sites that i know of has there been any form of consultation or discussion before the label site of special scientific interest has been imposed <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to come in now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may have described it more accurately than i have but certainly it becomes a very difficult procedure to go ahead with a normal farming operation and i do feel there are anomalies <e> <s> many of the sssis which exist should be examined if they are to be given greater status because many of them are extremely awkwardly shaped from the point of view of the farmer and the owner of the ground <e> <s> i think that just to make it an obligation on everybody to notify their intention to carry out farming operations is placing a greater restriction on the farmer than already exists because at the moment all that happens if he applies for a grant is that the grant may be withheld but if he has to notify every farming operation which he is going to carry out in or near an sssi that is a greater imposition upon him than exists at the present moment <e>", "<cs> if i have over-stressed the case apologise to your lordships committee but certainly it does make it more difficult to get on with many common farming operations and the reason for declaring the area to be an sssi will have been to prevent those operations taking place in all probability <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord craig-ton replies i should like to say that i have been thinking very carefully about what has been said particularly by the noble lord lord donaldson on this side of the committee and my noble colleagues <e> <s> i think i may have been mistaken about the effect of this amendment and that i am not really so far from the noble lord lord craigton in what i would like to see done as i said earlier <e> <s> i hope that i may now be able to support him if he wishes to push this matter any further <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this proposal will be received with enthusiasm in the crofting counties <e> <s> there are hundreds and thousands of crofts of acres or less <e> <s> if people felt that the whole of their croft might suddenly be adversely affected by an sssi and that their extra livelihood as a crofter was going to be affected they would be very upset <e>", "<cs> there is a croft at newlands of geise just outside thurso and through the bottom half of the three arable fields on that croft there runs the main drainage from thurso golf course <e> <s> there is an area there of less than acres which has been declared an sssi in order to preserve such rare species as ragged robin and meadowsweet <e> <s> if one looks at the ordnance survey map one sees running through the middle two parallel lines with the word drain written alongside <e> <s> this area has been declared the newlands of geise mire <e> <s> that land really ought to be drained and that drain ought to be in course of being cleared in the national interest and in the interest of everybody else <e> <s> indeed the crofter in question has been trying to improve this land from an agricultural point of view and when i objected to this site i discovered that the boundary had in fact been drawn round an area which the crofter had previously reseeded <e> <s> so in the first instance they were proposing to designate as an sssi an area which had already been reseeded <e>", "<cs> i think it is a misconception to think that we can turn it into an asset because my experience of sssis is that once they have been <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that if there is a question of danger to the health of children the government should err on the side of the children rather than on the side of technicalities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is an element of damage to the farmer which is not recognised by among others the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge certainly in ploughing probably in re-seeding and very possibly even in the making of muirburn <e> <s> the very fact that there is an element of damage and interference with the farmers existing rights is recognised by the suggestion that there might be compensation <e> <s> i feel that the strongest objection to this particular clause must be the fact that a compulsory order can be introduced without any form of public hearing being provided for and that to me is the one reason why i cannot possibly support these amendments <e> <s> however i think that there are flaws in the amendments anyway as regards the way in which they are drafted and i personally shall resist them if they are moved in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords without supporting the noble lord lord burton i think it should be said that the hen harrier is rapidly multiplying all over the north of scotland <e> <s> of this there can be no doubt <e> <s> i have seen as many as five hen harriers in the air at one glance at the same time and it is impossible for me to drive to wick without seeing a couple of pairs on the way there and back <e> <s> it is getting to be very much more numerous in the far north in caithness sutherland and orkney than ever it was before and this is a trend which is continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord burton as regards this amendment because there is no doubt that these species do cause considerable damage at certain times and on certain parts of salmon rivers particularly in a spate when the cormorant is liable to come up from the sea <e> <s> i have seen them sitting at vantage points taking smolts and so on when the smolts were running <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to say that i think that he is wrong about this because a line of cormorants at the estuary of a river kill off the salmon before they ever get to the sea <e> <s> when the smolts are hanging about in the estuary waiting to become accustomed to salt water they are extremely vulnerable and these birds tend to gather at the estuary at that point and there may well be a strong case for control of their numbers <e> <s> i do not think that we can say that monofilament drift netting or what happens at sea is necessarily worse <e> <s> it may be as bad but certainly what the cormorants and the shags can do at the estuary is as bad as monofilament netting <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i should like to say a word about the noble viscounts amendment because i think that it is a very important amendment in principle <e> <s> it is the dilemma of conservation that very often one conserves one species one type of living creature and that in turn destroys another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear at all what the noble earl means by his reply <e> <s> i thought when we discussed the farne islands we opened up this problem that if one species predates upon another it may need to be controlled for the benefit of the other species <e> <s> i am not sure that that principle was allowed by the reply of the noble earl lord avon <e> <s> i wonder whether he could explain it further <e>", "<cs> but the situation i am envisaging is that just as in the farne islands a particular situation arises where one species harms the habitat or survival of another species so one might in certain areas take a protected species as being harmful to certain other species which live in that area and therefore allow control of the species which is protected over a wide area within a specific area where it is causing more harm than good <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a point here because indeed if we do adopt a code of practice it may well be that after trial and adjustment that code of practice could become law <e> <s> but that is not really what i wanted to say on this particular occasion <e> <s> what i wanted to do was to point out once again that the problem of sssis has arisen because there was no obligation to consult the people who were most vitally concerned <e> <s> the whole object of the sssi procedure was to deal with change of use not to deal with already agreed use under planning acts and so forth <e> <s> the point of declaring an area an sssi was to warn the planning authority that if that area ceased to be used for agriculture then something that was of special scientific interest might be damaged <e> <s> as a result of that the nature conservancy council declared a number of places sssis without ever even notifying the owners of the property or the farmers concerned because they were not obliged to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it has to be paid to begin with otherwise it will be no good <e> <s> one might enter into a management agreement saying that he will do this that or the other or he will not do this that or the other but he can then not turn round at a later stage and say oh i am very sorry but i now think that i ought to plough up this field <e> <s> if he has not taken compensation to begin with he will not have it so he is going to have to ask for compensation <e> <s> what i am saying is that the money will not be there either with management agreements or with compulsory purchase to meet all of these obligations in every case <e> <s> i think that is the dilemma which the government are facing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard and the noble lord lord melchctt have been grossly unfair to the forestry commission who in my experience take considerable trouble to preserve a certain amount of mixed habitat around the edges and through the middle of their plantations <e> <s> certainly where they have planted in caithness and on my ground which i have sold to them they have taken into consideration wildlife of every kind <e> <s> indeed my experience is that far from having nasty habits in regard to red deer they take immense trouble to try to get the deer out of the plantations i am talking about what the noble viscount lord massereene said at an early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the sweeping indictment of agriculture made by the noble lord lord melchett cannot pass without comment <e> <s> by and large the national parks are not covered with acres of sugar beet by and large the areas we are talking about are where the hill farmers live and hill farmers are not losing lots of people <e> <s> they are down to their last person <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord had a good say in denigrating the farming industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we will find this in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a piece of hard ground crossing a bog <e>", "<cs> my lords to accept what the government have said this afternoon is to hand a ready-made excuse to those who already misuse air weapons <e> <s> i cannot believe that the police in any police force in the country would not welcome the amendment as it stands <e> <s> one of their difficulties is in identifying the misuse and in explaining the misuse of air weapons to people who are misusing them <e> <s> it is clear here that everybody who is interested in wildlife and the question of conservation control and management is for this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my colleagues on these benches i should like to thank the minister for the statement he has repeated <e> <s> we support the government in the stand that they are taking for the british fishing industry <e> <s> we urge them to continue to seek a proper comprehensive policy for the eec on fisheries and to ensure that that policy provides for the proper conservation of our fish stocks within our own waters and ensures that the fishing industry continues as one of the great industries of this country <e> <s> we welcome the fact that the government are to give aid to our hard-pressed fishing industry <e> <s> we hope that the aid might also contain a measure of protection against the dumping of cheap fish within our markets <e> <s> on these benches we notice that that point has not been mentioned in this context and perhaps the minister would care to say a word or two on it <e> <s> however we certainly support the stand that has been taken and we sympathise with the government in the difficulties which obviously they have been experiencing <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a mistake to let this debate pass without making clear the one real point here and that is that you do not have to have a case of worrying to have a case of damage to sheep <e> <s> if you have a field full of heavily pregnant ewes and people are regularly going for walks through that field with their dogs the dogs need run only a short distance towards the sheep to make the sheep run <e> <s> if the dogs are then called back and return to their owners those dogs have in no way attempted to worry the sheep <e> <s> but if heavily pregnant ewes are constantly being made to run eventually some of them will abort and that is distressing to the sheep and damaging to the farmer <e> <s> therefore it seems only reasonable that people walking through fields should be enjoined to take the precaution of having their dogs closely under control <e> <s> to worry a sheep a dog must lay a fang on it or attempt to do so <e> <s> the amendment would cope with the situation where a dog was not attempting to lay a fang on sheep but was merely rushing around in play and was not under proper control <e>", "<cs> my lords my point was that a dog need only gambol around in a field full of sheep and the sheep will run because that is their natural reaction <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have probably been ahead of any other party in criticising the rating system as such though of course we are not alone in doing so <e> <s> no party in your lordships chamber or anywhere else in the country really likes the rating system yet one does nothing towards removing the rating system nor substituting something else by messing around with the way in which it is operated <e> <s> in fact delay in revaluation merely makes anomalies grow greater and confusion more widespread <e>", "<cs> can we take it from what the noble earl has just said that the government are just about to come up with an alternative to the rating system <e> <s> is that what he said <e>", "<cs> from these benches too we should like to have some clarification of this clause <e> <s> what we wonder is whether a partial revaluation creates loopholes or anomalies whether this can be avoided and why it is necessary partially to revalue partially not to revalue and so on <e> <s> so we shall listen with great care and interest to what is said by the noble earl in reply to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister showed early on in the debate in your lordships committee that on certain matters he is prepared to be flexible <e> <s> i hope this is a matter on which he will show a little flexibility <e> <s> i feel that here the difficulty arises not in the exact sum of but that on the whole it is the local authorities who understand better than anybody else what should be the prescribed sum in any particular area <e> <s> obviously very large businesses will not particularly want to pay instalments on a rateable value of but to the poorer older person perhaps the traditional widow is quite a mite and it may well be that in a certain area the local authority may find that a lesser sum than is appropriate <e>", "<cs> we too have great sympathy with this amendment and with the principles underlying it <e> <s> it seems to me that this is one of the anomalies and inequalities which was also compounded by delays in revaluation because it is important that a house has an efficient form of heating and an efficient form of insulation <e> <s> if a house is efficient and has an efficient form of heating or insulation it becomes more desirable so obviously its value goes up and it may find itself attracting greater rates <e> <s> but to choose to put the greater rates upon certain houses at the moment when this happens and to choose certain forms of heating as being liable to the imposition of a higher valuation as opposed to others seems to me to cut across the principle which is the attraction or the value of the house <e>", "<cs> i cannot think of one house in scotland that was built without some provision for heating of some kind <e> <s> people installed oil central heating because the form of heating already provided became unworkable ineffective too expensive or whatever <e> <s> the chimney linings might have become cracked or the chimneys smoked and they said we must do something about it <e> <s> it will be very expensive to gut out the chimney stacks and reline them so therefore let us put in a modern installation <e> <s> they then replaced the old system which either did not work or was inefficient and in rating terms they were treated as having two systems <e> <s> the fact now is that one system works and the other does not and one is simply trying to stop people from having to pay full fare for some <e>", "<cs> this is indeed the most controversial and the most hated clause of the whole bill <e> <s> this is the clause where the powers which are in the hands of the secretary of state to improve the standard of performance of a local authority are to be used arbitrarily to take away their ability to perform at all in other words to take away the grant on which they have calculated their expenditure <e> <s> if the secretary of state by doing so was willing to accept the responsibility for what he is doing this would probably be more acceptable but powers are being taken to take away the rate support grant from local authorities but without accepting the responsibility in return for having to provide the services which this grant is supposed to provide <e>", "<cs> the amendments to clause that we have just been discussing and voting on would not have removed the altogether objectionable parts of the clause but they would have modified some of its worst excesses <e> <s> it is for that reason that i supported them and it is for that reason that when the first of them came up i spoke in a manner which would perhaps more properly have been related to clause stand part <e> <s> i do not propose now to repeat myself upon this clause but would merely reiterate that we on these benches still feel totally opposed to this clause for the reasons which i have adduced <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl in relation to what he has said with all this welter of professional technical and academic advice would it not be better to have a committee to collate it for him <e>", "<cs> i am well aware and indeed i said that this amendment has come rather suddenly upon your lordships committee <e> <s> there are one or two observations i should like to make in respect of the answers i have received <e> <s> first of all if local authorities are going to face enormous expenditure with water mains bursting in flood all over scotland as the picture seems to be drawn then what about the poor fellow whose house is washed away <e> <s> surely this is a question of a moderate request in the face of moderate danger <e> <s> i do not expect lots of water mains to break in the circumstances where somebody could suffer a great deal of damage without getting compensation when they try to bring their case <e> <s> but i do expect it to be possible that such a thing could happen <e> <s> because it is possible that such a thing could happen then i have to ask myself whether it is reasonable to expose an individual to this personal danger when the community ought to be able to insure him properly against it <e> <s> it is only a matter of insurance so far as the water authority is concerned they would be foolish if they did not cover themselves with the appropriate insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to this argument and having heard the noble lord lord ross of marnock freely admit that the amendment is solely designed to wreck i feel it would be difficult for me to follow him in this particular amendment <e> <s> i dislike clause and i do not really like the bill at all so far as it goes but having got this far to this stage of discussion and examination i am not sure that it is our duty to wreck the bill completely <e> <s> these are after all provisions which would wreck not only this bill but would be critical of a bill which was indeed passed by a previous government for the control of local authority behaviour and expenditure and so forth <e> <s> i feel it would be difficult in this particular amendment to follow the noble lord lord ross of marnock much as i dislike the principle embodied in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord ross of marnock hinted in the committee stage that he was going to bring forward an amendment of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down could he confirm that the civic government scotland bill is the one which was shown in draft to the convention of scottish local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help the government to make up their minds if i were to tell them something of my own experiences in this matter <e> <s> even when everybody concerned is doing their best to provide access it is sometimes difficult to do so <e> <s> i was recently involved in adding a new public bar and games room to a small village pub in halkirk <e> <s> we decided from the start that there had to be access for people in wheelchairs <e> <s> the architect was duly informed to design the building so that people in wheelchairs could use it <e> <s> it was easy enough to get access from the street without steps and to get up to another level we had a ramp <e> <s> we also had a beautiful plan on paper for the toilets <e> <s> i was there while the framing was being erected <e> <s> i saw a nice large door frame for the toilet for the disabled <e> <s> however the door going into the lobby area where all the toilets met was of an ordinary size <e> <s> clearly a disabled person would have to dismantle their wheelchair in <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has not been thanked for his contribution i should like to take this opportunity to say that we regretted the entry of this bill into your lordships house and we regret even more its departure more or less unamended <e> <s> i moved an amendment on at least two stages in the bill but unfortunately it was not incorporated and therefore for some time to come the people of scotland will still be at risk from burst water mains without any hope of compensation <e> <s> however what we really regret about this bill is the way in which it illustrates a lack of feeling by the government for the real efforts which have been made by local authorities throughout scotland to economise in these difficult times <e> <s> the difficulty local authorities face is in trying to economise in these times in both saving money and discharging their obligations <e> <s> that is not easy to do but it has been tackled with considerable vigour by most local authorities in scotland <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down could i ask him to clarify something he said just now which frankly i do not understand <e> <s> i think he said that people would be establishing a connection created by employment with british citizenship <e> <s> surely what we are talking about is a disconnection and not a connection because clause <e>", "<cs> surprise surprise <e>", "<cs> my lords this evening we are being asked to approve the antigua termination of association order <e> <s> this when it has been approved will give independence to antigua and to that no one will object <e> <s> but as we have seen the government are also asking parliament and this house although <e>", "<cs> i consider it a privilege to support the noble lord lord campbell of croy who is moving this amendment <e> <s> i think that the government should consider that it gives them an opportunity to do a service for the gaelic-speaking people of the highlands of scotland at this particular juncture by recognising the position which the language indeed holds within the community which will be very greatly appreciated even if it is not frequently used <e>", "<cs> in rising to confirm that we on these benches support this amendment i feel entitled to do so for a number of reasons not least of them being the fact that i flew to gibraltar to start my honeymoon <e> <s> my support for this amendment also arises from the fact that i live in a part of the united kingdom over which the norwegian flag flew longer than flew the scottish flag or has yet flown the union jack <e> <s> i desire to share the privileges of united kingdom citizenship and of being british although i am proud to be scottish and to belong to a part of scotland which has a great viking heritage <e> <s> i share the sentiments which were expressed by the noble lord lord hughes earlier and like him i do not intend to keep your lordships long because i do not consider that the issue we have to decide here is a very complicated one <e> <s> the complication arises from the fact that the government are regarding the british nationality bill as though it were an immigration bill <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my colleagues on these benches i wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> like the noble lord lord underhill i regret that we have not had an opportunity to debate armitage but i do not propose to do so today <e> <s> i shall however ask a few questions and make a few brief comments <e>", "<cs> we have not been granted a view into the mind of the noble lord lord ross as to why he thinks that regions are the only fit local authorities to deal with the question of taxis <e> <s> no doubt he will wish to make that clear when he comes to later amendments in his name but at this stage i still believe that districts are perfectly adequate local authorities as are island councils to make provision for the licensing of taxis in their areas <e> <s> indeed in many instances they are better authorities to have charge of the licensing of taxis because they are much more closely acquainted with local needs and demands and the different considerations which come before an authority which has to deal with the licensing of taxis <e> <s> therefore i cannot follow lord ross along his line of reasoning and thus cannot support him in the amendment <e>", "<cs> while having some sympathy with the noble lord lord ross of marnock in desiring that these authorities should hold regular meetings i am not sure that i am in agreement with him that it is reasonable to specify the actual months in which these meetings shall take place <e> <s> it seems to me a little unreasonable to specify january march june and october if these particular months do not suit the business or the conditions of the district in which licensing is taking place <e> <s> i would support the noble lord if he redrafted the amendment to make it a minimum number of meetings to be held but it is difficult to support him when the months are so specified <e>", "<cs> may i underline the noble lord lord drumalbyn in saying that it is not always clear that it is better for regions to deal with something rather than districts <e> <s> for instance if it was intended to hold some protest procession in thurso it would be very difficult for inverness where the regional headquarters are to be as fully informed about matters in thurso as might be necessary <e> <s> they would obviously have to consult the local police headquarters in wick in order to find out what the position was <e> <s> it would probably be better to make the application to the district in wick where the police are in the office next door and can give a quick and sensible answer to the problems involved <e> <s> it is not always clear that the region is better than the district or that the district is better than the region in these matters <e>", "<cs> surely it is to accommodate very rare circumstances indeed that one keeps records in any case <e> <s> one can have sympathy with the police over the question of storing large quantities of items which take up considerable space <e> <s> but nowadays it is not difficult to store a record <e> <s> it is probably kept on a <e>", "<cs> there seems to me to be a slight flaw in all this in that in selling the articles for value there is no obligation on the police to obtain the best value <e> <s> there is no machinery laid down so far as i can see for getting the best price <e> <s> therefore if some chief constable was inclined to minimise the amount of difficulty he would have all he would have to do is sell everything for <e> <s> i feel there ought to be something which at least obliges him to get the best value or to obtain a valuation where it seems as though the value of the article is high <e>", "<cs> will the removal of a statue and its re-erection in another place be subject to planning consent <e> <s> i should have thought it had to be in some way the subject of planning consent especially if the statue belongs to somebody else <e> <s> we are told that if you own a statue privately and it is erected the council can tell you to take it down and re-erect it somewhere else <e> <s> surely that is a planning matter which must be aired in the normal way <e> <s> i should have thought the moving of statues and landmarks would be dealt with in the same way as planning matters and be subject to a public inquiry if necessary <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of respect to the noble lord lord hughes i think that the present position is that if one actually owns the land one can name the street as one wishes <e> <s> therefore if a private development is taking place until such time as the street in question is taken over by the local authority the private developer may place whatever name he wishes on the street <e> <s> of course once the street is taken over by the local authority the situation is as stated in the bill and <e>", "<cs> i feel i have to say that i approve of this amendment and i am grateful to the noble earl for bringing it before your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak on the bill i suppose that i ought to declare an interest in that i am a registered venison dealer who has on occasions supplied your lordships refreshment department but i do not think that that need inhibit me in regard to anything that i want to say <e> <s> in particular it does not inhibit me from thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for the extremely lucid way in which he has introduced the bill to the house and from wishing him success with its passage through this house and eventually another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i have bored your lordships on more than one occasion with a recitation of my interest in salmon and salmon fisheries and i will if noble lords permit me spare them further recitation of these <e> <s> i welcome this modest measure because modest measure it is <e> <s> it does not seek to put right the whole law of salmon fishing in the sea or otherwise <e> <s> it seeks solely to deal with one abuse which has crept in in recent years due to modern technology <e> <s> i welcome this approach because i feel that the reason we have not been able to have legislation and why it has been so difficult to have legislation to deal with the problems of salmon fishing in the sea and rivers is that we have always had to face the extraordinary shibboleth posed by hunter before we could do anything else <e> <s> the fact is that the all-embracing nature of the hunter committees report has been the greatest single factor in putting back legislation on things to do with salmon over the past years <e> <s> the work done by the hunter committee was tremendous <e> <s> it was voluminous and covered every aspect of salmon fishing but the report itself was too compendious <e> <s> the only way around this problem is to deal with matters not just piecemeal but certainly section by section because it would be awfully difficult to get together a bill big enough to bring the whole of salmon fishing up to date from the middle of the th century to today in one fell swoop <e> <s> therefore i welcome the fact that this bill is a modest measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the general gratitude expressed to the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood for securing this debate for us and for setting its range so widely <e> <s> as my noble colleague lord mackie of benshie has already said without farming the economy of the upland areas would collapse completely <e> <s> but without everything else the community life of the upland areas becomes hard even for the farmers to put up with and i should like to take full advantage of the width and range which is given to us in the debate to talk about one or two things which have not so far been touched upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we have actually heard any arguments which would lead us to believe that in the remoter areas such as sutherland a great deal of harm is being done by not licensing taxis <e> <s> in fact a great service is being done in some of these remoter areas by some of the smaller and perhaps irregular taxi firms people who are known non-drinkers who turn out on a saturday night to take people home and they are doing a service <e> <s> they are making quite sure that people are no lempted to climb into their own cars and go around to their own danger and to the danger of their neighbours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that this amendment is in the right place or to the right clause <e> <s> what it seeks to limit is the taxi driver and not the vehicle <e> <s> the argument has been that the taxi driver may have been working long hours before turning out at night to drive a taxi but this particular clause deals only with vehicles <e> <s> there is no control in this particular clause over the driver <e> <s> it is the later clause that deals with the question of the driver <e> <s> i feel that this amendment may mean the right thing there may be the wish to make sure that the driver is fit and capable of driving his taxi but it really should be in a different clause <e> <s> here we are dealing with whether the vehicle is fit to be driven <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect i should like to interrupt at this point <e> <s> you cannot have as many drivers as you like because they are limited by clause where it says that there have to be taxi and hire car driving licences <e> <s> therefore the number of drivers that you have is limited by that clause <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the clause in which one should limit the drivers <e>", "<cs> i was one of those who would have supported the noble lord lord burton a few years ago in wishing that the red deer commission should have to do with nothing but red deer <e> <s> i have however changed my mind on this subject not because i think that anything has changed about the problems that they will have to face as a result of having to deal with other species of deer but because there is no doubt that other species of deer are moving on to territory which previously was occupied only by red deer <e> <s> certainly this is true of sika and certainly it is true of roe <e> <s> i do not know about the other curious species of deer which i would have personally liked to have seen totally eliminated from the natural scene of the british isles such as muntjac and so forth but it is certainly true of roe and of sika that they are extending their range and that they are presenting problems in areas that were previously solely red deer areas <e> <s> reluctantly i feel that the commission and the noble lord lord glenarthur are correct in framing the bill in the way in which they have framed it <e>", "<cs> i think that this is an important and valuable amendment <e> <s> certainly the spirit of it is very important because any owner of land who sets out to produce a cull that keeps the deer population at a stable and satisfactory level has to take into account the numbers of deer that are normally on the ground and the numbers that are normally killed <e> <s> if he is not aware of numbers of deer that are being killed he is liable to make mistakes <e> <s> he may wonder why his policy which has been framed in all good faith and according to the best advice given by the deer commission is not having the results that it ought to be having <e>", "<cs> surely this amendment does not require them to make the return to the commission <e> <s> it is the owner who is required to make the return to the commission <e> <s> he is making at the present moment a false return for the simple reason that he has not the power to get the information from his tenants <e> <s> he has not the power to require his tenants to give him the information on the numbers of deer which they kill <e> <s> if an amendment like this were passed this would give the owners of the ground the right to find out from the occupiers of the ground how many deer they kill <e> <s> therefore he can then make a correct return to the deer commission as he is supposed to be doing <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not think this is at all a reasonable amendment and it is not very good for the occupier the owner or the deer for the simple reason that the sooner the deer that maraud upon turnips are shot the less will have to be shot it is as simple as that <e> <s> the typical marauding deer are stags at the end of the rut and if they come down to the turnips and get a taste of them it is well known that they will go back to the hill and the other deer will get the smell of the turnips off them <e> <s> more deer will return the following day and whereas you may start with perhaps two stags coming on to the turnips the next day you may have six and the next day you may have <e> <s> so if you shoot them the night you find them on the better it will be for the deer population because you will remove the temptation from the other stags to be brought to the turnips having smelt the turnips on their fellow stags the previous night <e>", "<cs> i should also point out that if clause a is introduced it will in fact remove from farmers a right which they have enjoyed since time immemorial <e> <s> it is a very important point <e>", "<cs> it might possibly be better if the red deer commission were to fall back upon such expedients as control schemes <e> <s> this has all to do with the red deer commission deciding what the relative stocking of deer and sheep on hill land shall be <e> <s> i believe that people should understand that what is being sought is the right to set down that one may have only so many deer per acre <e> <s> that is what underlies this particular part of the bill <e> <s> whereas i would fight to the death for the right of the farmer to obtain compensation by shooting marauding deer upon land that he has tilled and cultivated i do believe that the deer on the other hand are entitled to some ground on which they may roam <e>", "<cs> i should be happy to take the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord northfield and let my amendment fall <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down are we to take it that he is suggesting that if the ground is over-stocked with sheep you shoot the deer <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> what the bill does not say is that any member of the red deer commission who works two days a week or more will become pensionable <e> <s> it merely mentions the chairman <e> <s> in the case of the examples quoted by the noble earl lord mansfield any member of the highlands and islands development board or any member of the crofters commission other than the chairman who works two days a week or more becomes pensionable <e> <s> that may or may not be a good idea but here the chairman is being singled out <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment if he does withdraw it could the noble lord lord glenarthur give us an assurance that he will enter into some discussions about a possible new clause to deal with this matter <e> <s> because i think we have here uncovered a practice which we do not want to encourage and which can be misused <e> <s> i think it would be a pity to lose the opportunity of this passing vehicle the bill to produce some legislation on this subject <e> <s> so could the noble lord lord glenarthur at least give us the assurance that he will enter into some discussions on this <e>", "<cs> i greatly prefer the wording of the bill to that of this amendment <e> <s> i much prefer that this matter should be one for the professional advice of the red deer commission and for adjustment from time to time with professional advice which is what is provided for in the bill <e>", "<cs> i think we must recognise here that we could not suddenly ban the shotgun and hope that things would be under control <e> <s> it would have to be phased in first of all choosing proper ammunition and that kind of thing trying to work it so that there was better control of marauding by the red deer commission and so on <e> <s> many things can create the climate in which ultimately it would be possible to ban the shotgun but it could not be done by consent simply by laying it down in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord mackie of benshie and my colleagues we thank the noble lord lord lyell for these amendments <e> <s> we are grateful to him for having listened so sympathetically to what we said <e> <s> i agree that the way in which the provision is now drafted admirably meets the requirement which we were seeking to incorporate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my turn to say am grateful to the minister for including this amendment which admirably fulfils the purpose we had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a case where opposite views are honestly and genuinely held <e> <s> until just a very few moments ago i was minded to press this amendment to a division because the only way in which this matter can be satisfactorily decided is by dividing your lordships house and counting heads and seeing exactly what we intend <e> <s> but the noble earl lord mansfield has suggested a sop which is that he will be prepared to look at this genuine problem <e> <s> i am not minded to cause unnecessary trouble over this because if he will genuinely look at this problem so as in some way to incorporate into the bill the right of the traditional processions and of the bodies which traditonally process as part of doing what they do then for one will be satisfied and will wish to support him in whatever form of words he recommends to your lordships house <e> <s> therefore in order to give him an opportunity to do that and subject to the agreement of the other noble lords who have put their names to this amendment i shall be prepared to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl before he sits down what he meant when he said that he would look at this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for eliciting at least some form of promise from the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> i slightly resent the suggestion that i should have been dividing the house if i had been dividing the house as a virility symbol <e> <s> i do not know what the opposite procedure is <e> <s> certainly this would not have been the case <e> <s> i was at pains to tell your lordships that i take both this amendment and also this new clause very seriously as do all the sponsors of the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it may be of assistance to the house to remind your lordships that mount hood is a statue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i merely suggest that the noble earl the minister listens to the argument which has been put forward by the noble lord lord underhill because i think he is putting the proper case <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a mixed and unusual bill that we have been dealing with during these seven days but i agree with the noble lord lord ross that it is a useful bill and i like the noble earl the minister hope that when it goes to another place it will be dealt with in the spirit in which it has left your lordships house <e> <s> we have tried to improve it during our seven days consideration of it and on behalf of my noble colleague lord mackie of benshie who is unfortunately not with us today i should like to say that i am grateful for the way in which the noble earl has listened to the points we have put forward from these benches and has incorporated some of them in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the view is being taken that this is what is called a free-standing bill and that it will be able to stand on its own feet <e> <s> i welcome the removal of the somewhat ambiguous phrases with which the bill started <e> <s> therefore i feel that we should support the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal in his endeavour to tidy up the start of the bill <e>", "<cs> this is a useful and important amendment because by leaving the wording as it had been it would have taken away the powers from water bailiffs which they specifically needed to do the job which they were being asked to do <e> <s> so it is just as well that the amendment is there and we welcome it <e>", "<cs> this is an important addition to the bill because gill netting may be the only way in which to get proper samples of fish within trout lochs and so forth and one might enmesh salmon in this way <e> <s> therefore it is important not to interfere with genuine attempts to manage fisheries and conduct scientific experiments <e> <s> i recommend this amendment to your lordships <e>", "<cs> it is not a question i thought to ask them <e> <s> at the moment they have the responsibility of dealing with venison dealers themselves <e> <s> they are really the only people who have a close and intimate knowledge of venison dealers <e> <s> i am not at all sure that we should even ask them whether they want to take this on we should tell them it is their bounden duty to take on the giving of this advice <e> <s> during the interim stage when one is going from a registered venison dealer to a licensed venison dealer the commission are the only people who have any depth of information on the subject at all <e>", "<cs> it is not quite clear from the noble lords words whether he is accepting this amendment is not accepting the amendment or is proposing later on to come back with some other amendment which deals with this whole subject <e> <s> i wonder whether he would make the situation clear before i deal finally with the matter <e>", "<cs> in other words the noble lord is suggesting that the whole matter should he one not for the district councils but for the secretary of state or that we should not decide at this stage how the district councils will carry out their duty but shall leave it to the secretary of state to decide in his wisdom at a later stage <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for the explanation of the intention here <e> <s> i am sorry in a way that we are not going to clarify the matter in this debate <e> <s> in fact i am disappointed that we are not going to clarify the matter because obviously it requires clarification <e> <s> certainly two of your lordships have said that this is not a matter about which the red deer commission know anything <e> <s> in fact at present it is only the red deer commission who know anything about it in scotland <e>", "<cs> indeed the red deer commission are involved up to the hilt because at the moment they are the people who inspect the books of all registered venison dealers they are the only people with real breadth of knowledge of what goes on in the trade and how these various venison dealers conduct their business <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be rather useful at this stage to have the benefit of their advice <e> <s> however in a sense it does not really make any difference because if we hand the matter over to the secretary of state we find that his statutory adviser is the red deer commission so presumably he will obtain their advice <e>", "<cs> i do not honestly think that what the noble duke the duke of atholl has said is at all relevant because in fact the whole situation will change <e> <s> nobody now is going to go pussy-footing around not liking to ask somebody how many deer they have bought from so-and-so and how many deer they think have come in from here there or anywhere else <e> <s> there will be the right of the police to go in and look at the books <e> <s> there will be no question of anybody having to keep in somebodys good books in order to get a peep at them <e> <s> i think that the information <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find that an extraordinary argument because what the noble duke is more or less suggesting is that there will be two sets of books one for the police and one for the red deer commission <e> <s> that is what is implied at any rate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield spoke about shooting out of season as being more reprehensible than or as reprehensible as shooting at night <e> <s> i really cannot go along with him on that <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> the reprehensible out of season shooting has in the first instance been poaching <e> <s> therefore one should catch offenders for poaching and not merely for shooting out of season <e> <s> there is an element of accidental shooting of deer out of season which will always exist <e> <s> one could very well find that one is putting the same opprobrium on to somebody who has accidentally shot a hind which happened to be behind a stag that one aimed at <e> <s> this has happened every year to somebody in scotland <e>", "<cs> the only compensation which he is allowed under the law is to shoot the deer and sell the carcases <e> <s> it is important for him to be able to do this <e> <s> i have sympathy with the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> we are talking about the occasion when deer have marauded on to crop or garden ground and are causing damage which we want to stop <e> <s> we want to stop the deer coming back and repeating the damage bringing other deer with them and we want to make sure that the damage is limited as quickly as possible <e> <s> most agricultural tenants or crofters are not necessarily equipped to do this job <e> <s> perhaps they have to rely upon a shotgun when they would prefer to have a rifle <e> <s> possibly they are also not equipped with training and practice in shooting because they are too busy looking after their sheep their turnips their corn and so forth <e> <s> furthermore they do not want to sit up all night as well as to work all day <e> <s> therefore they are only too pleased that somebody efficient should come along and do the job of limiting the damage to their crop <e>", "<cs> the occupiers of these holdings already have these rights we are not suddenly giving them these rights they have had them since time immemorial <e> <s> if the noble lord lord northfield is quoting a statistic about the number of people who have the right it only goes to show how moderately these people have used the right if that is what this statistic is capable of showing <e> <s> we cannot accept that the bad cases the hard cases those of the odd person who here and there perhaps takes a cynical view of his right and perhaps takes a few deer at a time and allows others to come back in and so on during the night and off-season periods should colour our attitude towards the literally thousands of people who require to be protected and who have no other form of protection and no other form of compensation than what is provided in the deer legislation <e> <s> i think that it is not a question of the nfu lobby here but a question of the combined opinion of the people who live on the fringes of the areas where the deer are to be found <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord lord northfield is exaggerating a number of points <e> <s> there is a difference between deer and the kind of wildlife that was being protected in the wildlife bill <e> <s> in this respect deer are much nearer to ground game and agricultural pests such as rabbits and hares and therefore this legislation must be nearer to the legislation that deals with those animals <e> <s> i think it quite wrong for the noble lord to say that the seasons exist in any way to protect deer against a form of cruelty <e> <s> the seasons have nothing whatever to do with cruelty they are solely to do with the numbers of deer and their presentation to so-called sportsmen in the right kind of conditions at the right time <e> <s> we have a season in order to stop people who have areas of ground where deer naturally live from being too greedy and simply going on and on through long seasons taking deer which otherwise would continue to exist on the land <e>", "<cs> i do not really know a great deal about roe deer because we do not have many in caithness <e> <s> the infestation of forestry blocks by roe deer is a problem we have yet to come because forestry blocks are now establishing themselves in caithness and roe deer are establishing themselves in those blocks <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is almost identical <e> <s> i do not quite know which is the correct drafting here <e> <s> we wish to prevent the shooting of roe deer and fallow deer but allow the shooting of red deer and sika deer <e> <s> whether or not we have done that in the correct form i am not sure <e> <s> perhaps somebody can advise which of us has got the wording right to achieve the purpose that obviously we both have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem rather a charade to ask the deer commission stalkers to seek authoristation when they are already on the spot dealing with a case because in fact the people from whom they would be seeking the authorisation would be administrators not familiar with what is happening on the ground <e> <s> the normal procedure is that if the deer commission wants advice on whether to authorise something to happen they send their stalkers to look at the situation and the stalkers are the people who report back <e> <s> if they have then to report back and have their report okayed it seems to me to be rather a charade <e> <s> i think that in this case it would be helpful if the <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl lord mansfield for having given me this assurance because i think in fact that we are talking about the same thing <e> <s> we are talking about a definition and i greatly fear that farmers may not through any intention of the noble earl nor through any intention of the government but through simply adopting the wrong definition lose out in the small print as it were if they suffer a burst water main <e> <s> it would be most helpful if the government could look at the small print in this case and see whether it would not be appropriate to include those things which are defined as fixed equipment in the agricultural holdings scotland act and except from them those parts which are insurable which is really what i was trying to do by my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether it is mere procrastination or whether further information is required before a statement can be made <e> <s> secondly in view of the long lead time involved in getting these matters started can he give us any indication of which countries we are wooing in our efforts to co-operate in the international field <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> in thanking the noble earl the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that he has already indicated that there is no decision yet about a future for the fast breeder reactor and therefore it must be assumed that the programme lying ahead of the dounreay nuclear establishment is limited <e> <s> is he also aware of the work which is being done in fuel reprocessing and fabrication at dounreay and can he indicate whether there is a future for the dounreay nuclear establishment in this particular field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord hughes feels so pessimistic about the chances of these two amendments <e> <s> he will know that we on these benches have always supported him <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for at least expanding his letter somewhat <e> <s> his letter which i hold before me does not include any reference to shelter belts <e> <s> it certainly would be a natural mistake for any reasonable person to make to assume that land with trees on it was not land with structures on it <e> <s> i have never before heard a tree described as a structure <e> <s> however the noble earl has assured me that shelter belts are included that holes in the ground are also structures and therefore are included and that all of the things that would be included if he accepted my amendment are in fact included <e> <s> on that basis i am happy to agree that he has given me what i wished to have <e> <s> in those circumstances even though the scottish farmer is not given the same protection against the burst of a water main as the english farmer is given even though the strict liability is not so extensive on the scottish water authority as it is on the english water authority i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to be associated with the thanks expressed to the noble baroness for repeating the statement and in particular we wish to express our thanks to the noble lord lord shackleton for the magnificent work that he has done in producing a series of reports culminating in the report that we are now discussing about how the falkland islands could and should be developed <e> <s> it is only sad that this kind of development was not undertaken long ago in which case it might well have been that the conflict that has caused so much sorrow in this country and in the south atlantic would not have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords like every other noble lord who has spoken today i should like to start by thanking the noble earl lord halsbury for bringing this extremely important subject before us at such an important moment in the history of atomic energy in this country and allowing us this opportunity of discussing it in your lordships house <e> <s> it is giving all of us in your lordships house a chance of hearing what has amounted to a symposium on the fast reactor system by some of the finest and best-informed scientific brains in the country and i would venture to say in the whole world <e> <s> we must be grateful for that as well as for the opportunity which is given to mere laymen like myself to have our two-penorth in the same important discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i assumed that the noble lord lord trefgarne would actually speak <e> <s> but i beg the noble lords pardon and i thank him very much for putting me right <e> <s> i did not mean the noble lord lord trefgarne <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bethell raises an interesting if complicated question <e> <s> he states that air fares are too high <e> <s> from the point of view of the travelling public whatever you charge is always too high if you can get a journey for the same distance at a lower fare <e> <s> the noble lord also says that the state monopoly system is one of the causes of this problem and that the bilateral system of fixing air fares is outmoded <e> <s> what the noble lord does not indicate to us or hold out to the government or to <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating his right honourable friends statement and i join with the noble lord lord john-mackie in inquiring whether he can give some indication of how the negotiations on the commissions price proposals are progressing <e> <s> i hope he will be able to say they are progressing faster than is customary <e> <s> i hope also that the noble earl will be able to reassure us that we are honouring all our commitments in full to new zealand <e> <s> on the question of butter is he in a position to add any information about how the commission took the stress

hard cases make had law and it is perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon but i thought i understood him to say that there were at least two other measures which he helped to bring before another place <e> <s> i may have misunderstood him and i will look carefully at <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister replies i wonder whether he can explain something which at the moment is not quite clear to me <e> <s> in the bill the words used are <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friends on the liberal benches and in particular my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran i feel that at this point i should say that we were very sad to have lost the amendment which would have set up a council to advise and help the director general of telecommunications or whatever he is to be called <e> <s> we are especially sad that because of its wording amendment no <e> <s> was lost in the general collapse of that particular effort on our behalf to set up a council <e>", "<cs> my lords

years of neglect by a particularly unimaginative absentee landlord <e> <s> whatever else we do and whatever line we pursue in seeking a solution to the problem we cannot and must not avoid immediately

his helpful answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is satisfied that the regulations are sufficiently strong and wide enough to control the danger which arises from the careless discharge of air weapons <e> <s> does he have in mind any specific measures which might be added to those which are already on the statute book or in regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that there are two very simple ways in which the danger from air weapons i stress air weapons as opposed to firearms rifles and so forth could be reduced <e> <s> first it could be made compulsory that before discharging an air weapon a person should be required to have the written permission of the owner of the ground <e> <s> in the case of a public park the owner would he the local authority <e> <s> secondly if written permission were given the person who gave it would be jointly liable for any damage caused by the discharge of the weapon <e> <s> that would very simply bring under control a great deal of the careless discharge of airguns <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to come back on this question but the noble lord the minister has been in your lordships house for only a short time and

duke the duke of atholl <e> <s> i have to confess that the bill is not perfect <e> <s> i do not believe that it would have been perfect even if it had been drafted by the noble lord lord gray of

upon ownership <e> <s> on the other hand it would be equally wrong to have a structure that depended upon leaving out the owners of the rivers altogether <e>", "<cs> i can only reiterate that i think the noble lord lord ross of marnock is being deliberately obtuse or deliberately unfair <e> <s> clause seeks only to implement the statutory provisions which already exist <e> <s> the noble lord lord

necessarily want to deal with amendment no <e> <s> now in the same voice <e>", "<cs> obviously the other place will have more to say about matters of this nature than we shall <e> <s> however i think it was right to raise the matter <e> <s> it is very difficult to state at this stage what will be required and when <e> <s> i should not want to feel that any future government were lumbered with having to produce legislation in order to get on with the work that needs to be done at some future date <e> <s> i was trying to give flexibility but in view of what the noble lord has said and in view of the fact that we have discussed this matter and that it will be considered in another place i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> obviously this is very much more a matter for the other place rather than for your lordships <e> <s> having made the point and having received the noble lords assurances on the matter i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that so far the noble lord lord gray has not shown any other way by which consultation might be written into the bill i feel that we must go along with the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> but i hope that the noble lord lord gray may yet relent and give us some better idea of how consultation may be built into this bill <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord use his phrases advisedly <e> <s> he spoke about keeping people informed of decisions not about asking them to participate in the making of those decisions <e> <s> this is what the noble lord lord stoddart and i and my colleagues are trying to do <e> <s> how are people to participate in decisions <e> <s> are they merely to be informed or are they to have another opportuntity to participate in the making of them <e>", "<cs> i go along with what the noble lord lord stoddart says <e> <s> i think that the public in general tends to be afraid of atomic energy because it is a subject about which the ordinary citizen knows comparatively little <e> <s> this fear very rapidly subsides as i know has happened in my part of the world when more information is given and more openness is shown <e> <s> for example the success of the research establishment at dounreay has been due to the way in which the atomic energy authority has never sought to conceal anything from the people in that area and indeed has sought to inform them <e> <s> the more the authority seeks to inform and the less the government or anybody else seek to conceal the better in this particular field of endeavour <e> <s> by this i do not mean to say that they have to give away technical secrets there is no question of that <e> <s> it is merely a question of disclosing plans and intentions <e> <s> i think this is good both for the country and for the atomic energy authority <e>", "<cs> may i fasten on certain words used by the noble lord lord gray <e> <s> he talked about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the misgivings about this bill which i fear is leaving your lordships house imperfect in many respects <e> <s> i understand the underlying philosophy behind the bill <e> <s> in fact i and my colleagues on these benches agree that it is right that there should be more public accountability by the atomic energy authority and that where it is commercial it should be carrying out its business on a more commercial basis <e> <s> but we are most regretful that the initial capital could not have been in the form of some sort of public dividend capital <e> <s> i remain unsatisfied with the explanation which the noble lord lord gray gave me and particularly with his claim that the operations of the atomic energy authority are not and never will be cyclical in the same way as other public enterprises that have public dividend capital <e> <s> i feel that this is a matter for people in another place to look at at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i took the opportunity of an early bite at the cherry in this matter by raising the subject in the debate on the gracious speech from the throne <e> <s> i shall therefore try to be as short and as quick as possible tonight and try not to go over old ground <e> <s> in this connection i shall not go through my various interests in salmon <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships are well aware of them <e> <s> however i welcome this bill but as i forwarned the noble lord the minister when i took my early bite he will not get through without some criticism from me <e> <s> i welcome its three principles the principle of modernisation the principle of flexibility and the principle of conservation or protection <e>", "<cs> i think that i should be a little kinder to the noble lord lord gray of contin over his bill than he was to me over my bill <e> <s> i must say at this point that i think i understand what he is doing <e> <s> i think i can see why he is doing it <e> <s> i do not entirely applaud what he is doing because i would rather he was doing what i tried to do before <e> <s> the noble lord lord burton suggests that the modernisation of salmon districts should be compulsory <e> <s> i suggested a form of halfway measure in my bill that there should be a moment of compulsion but that the actual weddings between rivers should take place by mutual attraction <e> <s> in this bill the noble lord lord gray of contin is suggesting that there should be no compulsion but that a situation should be created where rivers can get together to their mutual advantage should seek to form themselves into viable boards and from there should create structures which are able to administer salmon fisheries in scotland <e>", "<cs> am i right in understanding that as a result of clause all district boards will change into the new kind of district board <e> <s> thereafter they may or may not go the next stage but the status of a district board that does not at the outset change its nature and amalgamate is not impaired by not changing <e> <s> it can at a later stage change if it so wishes <e> <s> that is how i understand it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for his generous response and for the way in which he has sensed the feelings of your lordships committee <e> <s> i would have preferred it had the minister come forward with this amendment and i think that he knows that <e> <s> it was only because he was a little unwilling to come forward with such an amendment that i was prompted to be so bold as to put one down <e> <s> now that he has agreed to take this <e>", "<cs> i should like to be able to support the noble lord lord ross of marnock but i feel that amendment no <e> <s> is deficient <e> <s> i go along with him in specifying anglers <e> <s> the noble lord knows very well that i wish anglers to get their fair share in the administration of fishing and of salmon rivers but it is a pity that he should specify anglers and leave out tenant netsmen <e> <s> the whole principle of the bill as i see it is to keep the balance even so that the two sides involved in exploiting the resource should consider the resource as paramount and not that one side or another side should have all the resource <e> <s> i feel that persons in this instance is an adequate description because it should include tenant netsmen just as much as anglers <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the noble lord lord gray will tell us that the district salmon fishery boards are obviously the appropriate persons whom the secretary of state will consult <e> <s> but as the bill is intended to emphasise the importance of boards and their role in the management of salmon fisheries i think it is important that this be emphasised at this point <e> <s> their status should be emphasised at this point and therefore i support the noble lord lord burton <e>", "<cs> i have to support the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> i am delighted to see the new <e>", "<cs> yes as a matter of fact i was quite surprised at the word adequate <e> <s> the word was suggested to me by the public bill office <e> <s> it may be that it is an inadequate word <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord lord gray of contin will tell me if he considers it inadequate <e> <s> if he considers it inadequate but accepts the principle i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> what is obviously intended is suitable for the occasion <e>", "<cs> i am happy to accede to the request of the noble lord lord gray <e> <s> i was aware that perhaps this was not the best drafted amendment that we were going to consider today <e> <s> i am glad to see that he accepts in principle that there might need to be some regulation of rod fishing methods <e> <s> however i urge on him when he is looking at this problem to consider that this is the kind of matter which will in its very nature require to be varied from river to river because there are some rivers which are appropriately dealt with in one way and some which are appropriately dealt with in another <e> <s> i beg him to look at that point <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i beg to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard <e> <s> first of all i am referring not only to salmon but also to trout <e> <s> people are putting trout into cages in hill lochs or in lochs in the upper waters of rivers where obviously there is a considerable build-up of detritus and so forth below the cages and where there could be interference with water quality <e> <s> this is one of the problems which i envisage <e> <s> on the question of estuaries estuaries are all defined in the salmon acts <e> <s> if the noble viscount wants to know where an estuary is the estuary limits are all defined and he can look them all up <e>", "<cs> i have to tell the noble viscount that this is not so <e> <s> we have caught fish in the thurso river which were farm bred which were identified by scale reading as having come from a fish farm and the nearest fish farm was somewhere round the west coast of scotland <e> <s> thus storm damage does take place fish do escape and get into other rivers <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too may ask the noble lord lord gray of contin if he will think about this whole matter <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to admit that this amendment may be in the wrong place and that it may be in the wrong form <e> <s> i admit that i had to put it before your lordships rather hurriedly because the full extent of the problem came to my notice only a comparatively short time ago <e> <s> after all we have not had very long in any case since second reading <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i think he has got it wrong <e> <s> first of all what i am talking about is net cages within the normal fishing areas of a river <e> <s> the use of those and the placing of net cages in such places as lochs in the upper waters deep parts of rivers and in estuaries is a comparatively new thing <e> <s> i am not talking about fish farms in the normally accepted sense or about anchorages off the coast i am talking about people setting up trout farms in lochs where it is doubtful whether anybody will really look at it from the point of view of planning <e> <s> it is not something which would move the planning authority enormously and nobody is enjoined to look at this practice which is growing <e> <s> it is not a fish farm being created in the normal sense it is not somebody making stewponds and setting up a fish farm as we understand the term it is a kind of semi-ranching in lochs <e>", "<cs> i should have thought the district board would be the people who would complain or it might be the river purification board but in either case they would have their interests interfered with if a cage were put there without their having been consulted and without having been able to make the proper representations <e>", "<cs> i find that immensely satisfactory and if other noble lords feel the same i would be happy to beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> as i say with all these <e>", "<cs> i fear that the thought lying behind these amendments is totally illusory <e> <s> i support <e>", "<cs> i will give way in a moment but please let me finish <e> <s> what happens is that the fish come in and explore the estuary and go out again <e> <s> if there is prolonged definable drought the fish will go off the estuary and the netsmen at the mouth of the river will be longing for a rise of water to bring the fish back <e> <s> in our case they also long for a south wind to take the taste of the fresh water out to bring the fish in <e> <s> however what they long for more than anything else is a small rise of water to define that a drought is not <e>", "<cs> i do not have to give way <e> <s> i am trying to give an explanation of how all fish run a river <e> <s> they will come in as long as there is a pool of water <e> <s> they will try to run up the river and if they do not like it they will fall back and stay around <e> <s> full drought conditions are self-limiting and the idea that letting a lot of fish into the river in semi-drought conditions will do the river good is a totally illusory one <e>", "<cs> it is important not to delete this <e> <s> i am thinking in terms of where one is trying to create a proper structure over a length of coast <e> <s> it may well be that between two district board areas as presently defined there lies an area where there has not been defined a district board simply because the burn or river which flows in at that point is too small to support a breeding stock of salmon <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord ross of marnock has his finger on a sore point <e> <s> i think it might be wise for the noble lord lord gray of contin to give another thought to this particular amendment <e> <s> heritable property could be a garage in which to keep ones waders <e> <s> will you tell me that you cannot buy a garage in which to keep your waders unless four-fifths of the heritable proprietors in the tay district agree <e> <s> it really is a bit silly <e>", "<cs> with respect may i make this point <e> <s> we are not discussing the word shall at all <e> <s> we are discussing the word co-opt <e> <s> i am not changing the word shall <e> <s> i am changing the word co-opt to appoint <e>", "<cs> i did not feel that i ought to sweep up the noble viscount lord ridley in my series but if he so wishes it would obviously be possible to discuss amendment no <e> <s> along with all the others <e> <s> i should be delighted were we to do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out one matter to the noble viscount <e> <s> i have already provided for this in amendment no <e> <s> which states <e>", "<cs> also amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my heart is softened by the kind reply of the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> if he really has taken aboard the idea that we should in some way try to achieve some sort of an election some sort of way in which it is not a rotten borough then i should be happy to go along with him <e> <s> we are now talking about an amendment which simply leads us into a whole series of amendments and i accept that it is a complicated area <e> <s> i accept that it has not been easy to draft it out and that it is not easy to accept it in a lump as it were and that we want to think about this <e> <s> however if we can discuss the principle of it at this stage what i feel is important is that we should not give built-in majorities to any section in the district boards <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gray will realise that i am not conceding anything either <e> <s> i am merely agreeing to talk to him <e> <s> i am agreeing at this stage to withdraw my amendments then to talk and we shall see what will come out of it <e> <s> if that is the basis on which we are agreed i am happy to ask your lordships leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel very inclined to accept the kind offer of the noble lord lord gray to discuss this matter <e> <s> i understand all the points which have been raised <e> <s> it was not easy to draft this amendment <e> <s> i do not share the fears of the noble lord lord gray about difficulties arising from genuine efforts to stock waters with fish in a traditional manner and i shall put that point to him when we discuss <e> <s> but i think at this stage it would be best if i were to withdraw this amendment on the promise of discussions and an amendment to deal with the matter later on <e>", "<cs> if the minister is writing to the noble lord lord ross of marnock will he kindly send a copy to those of us who have taken part at least on the debate on this schedule so that we are all informed <e>", "<cs> i too thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable and learned friend in another place but i am afraid i have to cease my kind words at this point because i think that this is a two-faced statement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain how a shopkeeper will suddenly be enfranchised <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will allow me to intervene is she suggesting that those people are remaining unemployed because they are in receipt of territorial army pay <e> <s> that is what it sounded like <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very puzzled by the noble lord lord grays reaction to this <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has pointed out that the secretary of state is to have powers to vary the whole thing <e> <s> but it is then going to be a matter of everybody changing courses when this variation takes place <e> <s> the minister has already admitted that the present set-up may have areas where the shoe pinches <e> <s> now let us suppose that these areas where the shoe pinches are on just one toe as it were on just one district <e> <s> why should that district go on in perpetuity having a set-up and a constitution on a statutory foundation which suits every other board in scotland but not this one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord gray could advise us on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble lord lord gray of contin is not going to accept this amendment and that the only way that i could put it across would be to divide the house <e> <s> i do not intend to waste your lordships time by doing so but i intend to go on pressing this principle by all the means in my power <e> <s> i hope that perhaps those in another place may be able to persuade the department of agriculture and fisheries to see sense over this matter <e> <s> with the leave of the house i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to know that the noble lord lord gray is still considering this matter <e> <s> i think it is important and i hope he will come up with a solution taking into account what the noble lord lord home of the hirsel also said <e> <s> i think this is a power that should be used locally with discretion it should be a reserve power as it were rather than one which would be constantly and capriciously used <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gray has said enough to show that there was and still is a problem in this area <e> <s> a whole lot of things are still unresolved <e> <s> there is the per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of non-crown seabed <e> <s> there is the question of whether the crown estate commissioners willing though they be to police and monitor these matters would have the expertise to police and monitor what was going on where a cage was sited <e> <s> there is the question in my mind of whether a cage sited within a fresh water loch for a part of the year would need planning consent <e> <s> if it were moored for a short time would it need planning consent <e> <s> if it did surely every keep net along the thames and along the canals of this country would require planning consent <e> <s> i do not know at what point <e>", "<cs> my lords before addressing myself to what the noble lord lord gray has said may i put at rest the fears of the two noble lords opposite the noble earl lord onslow and the noble lord lord kimball <e> <s> i suggest in this series of amendments methods by which elections could be held <e> <s> if they had looked at amendment no <e> <s> they would have seen that there was a method by which the clerk of the board would give notice of the type of election to be held how it would be done and the arrangements which would be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and the other amendment which follows on them amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i would briefly say on this amendment that i could not go along with it for the simple reason that it is important that people fishing should be able to dispose of their fish through legal channels and it is important to the anglers who <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house point out that i am not talking to the noble viscounts amendment <e> <s> i am speaking to the noble ladys amendment which amends the amendment of the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the statement that has been made by the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> in my view this is one of the most significant matters to have come out of this report stage debate on this bill <e> <s> we welcome it most sincerely because it really will make workable part of the bill which otherwise in my view would have been largely unworkable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gray for taking up this amendment <e> <s> i think it is an important one <e> <s> so far as salmon goes he has done very well <e> <s> we are protected against the cohoe the chum the chinook and all the rest of these fish of the salmon sort <e> <s> i am not convinced by his argument that this is a salmon bill and that one should not deal with the introduction of species likely to harm salmon <e> <s> there are waters in scotland which contain only salmon and brown trout and do not contain other species of fish but i think it would be a pity if it were felt that there was open season for introducing pike and perch and any other sort of fish that might harm the existing native population into these waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to see that the noble lord lord burton has taken up this point which i twice put before your lordships house at different stages of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord gray is still sympathetic but it would help us all very much if he could tell us exactly how sympathetic he is and how he intends to dispense and disperse his sympathy towards us <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble marquess lord lansdowne i have not seen any blinding light on the road to damascus <e> <s> i fear that i must take the noble viscount lord ridley to task for not reading what i said at committee stage more fully <e> <s> i did not base my conclusions simply on my observations in thurso <e> <s> i gave a full description with which i shall not trouble your lordships tonight of how all salmon behave in all estuaries all over <e> <s> the noble viscount may shake his head but i am certain that scientists are more likely to support my assessment of the behaviour of salmon than that made by many other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take this opportunity of adding my congratulations to those that have already been voiced in your lordships house to the noble lords who have steered this bill through its various stages and particularly through this latter stage when we have seen a very real attempt by the government to meet the general wishes expressed through our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for his reply i must confess that i am only partially grateful <e> <s> is he not aware that permission is given for oil platforms and in particular the oil terminal at flotta to discharge radionuclides into the sea and in the case of the oil terminal at flotta in unlimited amounts and that these radionuclides contain a fair proportion of a very nasty substance called polonium which when it was being experimented with at harwell actually escaped out of the laboratory and started walking down the passage <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the enormous importance of tourism to the highlands will the minister be able to assure us that special consideration will be given to the need for the highlands to maintain a connection with heathrow which is the terminus for trans-atlantic as well as air france flights <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take the opportunity to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur and indeed his predecessor the noble lord lord gray of contin for honouring the pledge to deal with this matter in another place <e> <s> in my view the matter as dealt with is very satisfactory and will be of satisfaction to those of us who promoted it <e> <s> i thank the noble lord very much <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord lord glenarthur assure the house that the department of agriculture and fisheries for scotland are geared to receive all the applications that may arrive <e> <s> otherwise what may well happen is that after the passing of this bill into an act all the bailiffs on this kind of river will suddenly cease to exist <e> <s> unless the machinery is ready to deal with the applications they will receive there may well be a hiatus if there are no bailiffs with any legal standing at all <e> <s> i should like to receive an assurance that they are geared to deal with this matter at the speed at which it may happen <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a helpful amendment which will be welcomed by district fishery boards <e> <s> in these days of high interest rates poor payers can be a great drain on any organisation <e> <s> the ability to recover the interest which is after all what the boards will lose if the due assessments are not paid in time is of enormous help to them and i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments deal with conservation matters <e> <s> they might well involve the seeking of advice by the appropriate department or ministry <e> <s> at this point it is only fair to say that we know what went on in another place because <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate those of us on these benches with the congratulations given to the ministry on the speed and thought with which it dealt with the problem that arose from the chernobyl disaster <e> <s> it would also be right to associate ourselves most sincerely with the co-operative attitude of the farming industry and the way in

noble lord replies to the noble baroness lady macleod could he include in the information not only the number of units but how many of them are below strength and how far some of them are below

the hands of a lot of different bodies <e> <s> i agree that this would be for the board of scottish homes itself just as the direction of the highlands and islands development board is in the hands of that board <e>", "<cs> i do not need to defend myself against the attacks of the noble lord lord gray of contin because he knows perfectly well that i am right and he is wrong <e> <s> he will understand why it is that i have to drive so fast <e> <s> but i feel that at this stage i should beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> however is he aware that illegal fishing is supposed to be taking place as far as miles out on the high seas <e> <s> does he agree that the tonnages of salmon being landed in donegal are probably twice those reported and could account for the whole of the missing scottish salmon catch <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lady robson and the right reverend prelate the bishop of gloucester in the amendmdent <e> <s> i fear the provision because it will in effect turn each of us into a vicarious scrooge <e> <s> we shall be extracting money from people who get nothing from us except what is given to them by charity <e> <s> they are people who are so disadvantaged that they do not know how to use the system in order to get anything out of taxes and local government <e> <s> we will either have to extract it from them or extract it from the charities that are set up to look after them when they are in desperate need <e>", "<cs> i must say that we are not here talking about the general principle of the bill <e> <s> we are talking about exceptional cases <e> <s> so to get up and say that we are in some way talking about the principle of paying ones whack is not so it is not the matter under discussion in these amendments <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl a question <e>", "<cs> i may be extremely stupid <e> <s> i see the danger of a gas-operated rifle which is one that reloads itself from the recoil of the cartridge but can the noble earl explain the essential difference between a pump-action rifle and a bolt-action rifle <e> <s> as i understand it a bolt-action rifle is one where the cartridge is ejected by pulling back the bolt and the rifle is loaded by pushing forward the bolt <e> <s> with a lever-action rifle such as the winchester the same thing is done namely the cartridge is rejected by pushing the lever forward and a rifle is loaded by pulling it back <e> <s> in the case of a pump-action rifle exactly the same movement is done <e> <s> the cartridge is ejected and one reloads <e> <s> i can see that this method is useful for people who are disabled but the action is no faster more efficient or deadly than that of a bolt-action rifle <e> <s> a gas-operated or a self-loading rifle is a totally different weapon as indeed is a recoil-operated rifle <e> <s> i do not see why a pump-action rifle is so much more deadly than a bolt-action rifle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the debate is taking place after nirex has given voice to its plans <e> <s> i am now able to take part in the debate untrammelled by the suspicion that i may be providing ground into which nirex will drill holes and deposit its waste <e> <s> i am able to say that at the moment i do not have an interest in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that we get the million which the consultants recommend <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that a very curious situation will arise when people come to inspect public houses and hotels because the local authority inspectors will test the whisky and someone else will test the water <e> <s> it seems curious that the same inspector cannot test both articles that go into the same glass <e>", "<cs> but he will not be able to prosecute is that right <e>", "<cs> but what guarantee is there that the secretary of state will prosecute <e> <s> none whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has referred to a long-term policy for forestry on the part of the government <e> <s> can he tell me where i may discover what that policy is <e>"]
