["<cs> my lords i am very happy to support the bill which the noble lord lord crawshaw has so ably explained to us this morning <e> <s> i myself sat as a jockey club representative on the levy board for about six years before becoming a steward of the jockey club and i should like to assure noble lords <e>", "<cs> before commenting on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord peart i should like to make a brief reference to the remarks made by the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> he singled out two race-courses <e> <s> i believe he mentioned haydock park and goodwood of which he was critical for having received interest-free loans <e> <s> may i remind the noble lord that the largest interest-free loan of all for sandown park was negotiated under his chairmanship <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wigg made the surprising remark even more surprising because he and i sat on that very board together for at least three years that i was a tote monopolist <e> <s> i do not know where he got that suggestion from <e> <s> i have never made any public statement saying i was a tote monopolist and i can only think the noble lord has fallen into the age-old trap that used to happen in southampton row and apparently could even happen in your lordships house of confusing me with the noble lord lord mancroft <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments initiative to change the laws on sunday trading for i believe that they are out of date with our way of life in <e> <s> it is undoubtedly a subject about which your lordships feel strongly and i have this evening listened to many arguments from both points of view setting out both cases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford for giving the house the opportunity of discussing a subject which happens to be very dear to my own heart <e> <s> as a keen racing man may i ask the minister whether he will congratulate his right honourable friend the prime minister on deciding to hold the general election on the only free thursday between the derby meeting and royal ascot <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble viscount lord head on a most admirable maiden speech <e> <s> one of the advantages of your lordships house is that it can produce an expert on very nearly any subject one likes to name <e> <s> the noble viscount is an expert as he was a racehorse trainer for many years until <e> <s> he has been extremely successful so who better knows the problems for racehorse trainers and staff employed by them than the noble viscount <e> <s> i congratulate him on a very good and interesting maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that intervention <e> <s> i cannot answer for the greyhound world but and perhaps the noble lord lord wyatt will correct me if there was no horseracing on a sunday i doubt whether it would be worth while for a betting shop to be open on a sunday <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment briefly on one point made by the noble lord lord graham in proposing his amendment <e> <s> i am speaking now only from a racing point of view but i suspect that what applies to racing applies to cricket as well <e> <s> the racing fixture list is compiled about months to two years before the racing takes place <e> <s> the fixture list is drawn up in about march of one year for the following year <e> <s> one may be talking in march about an event that is to happen in december of the following year <e> <s> local authorities can change <e> <s> what is acceptable to one local authority months in advance may well not be acceptable months later <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment very briefly in answer to the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> certainly the intention of the bill is for racing to take place on three courses perhaps geographically in the north south and midlands on the sundays when racing is allowed <e> <s> that will initially perhaps amount to seven sundays so we are talking about race meetings <e> <s> the noble lord seemed to think that there would be only one race meeting on a sunday <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> we shall come to that when we come to my amendment later on <e>", "<cs> the jockey club very closely monitors and controls the fixture list <e> <s> the committee will have to take it at face value perhaps <e> <s> the jockey club has stated that there will not be more than perhaps sundays on which racing can take place <e> <s> there is absolutely no intention of allowing racecourses to say we want to race on tuesday or we want to race next sunday <e> <s> as i explained earlier the fixture list is drawn up two years in advance and is very carefully approved controlled and fine-tuned <e> <s> that is the answer <e>", "<cs> i wish to reply to my noble friend lord brentford <e> <s> if he recalls on second reading the current senior steward of the jockey club the noble lord lord fairhaven told the house that the intention in year one was to have perhaps three or two but probably one meeting in the north one in the south and one in the midlands <e> <s> i hope that that point is taken <e> <s> it was to be a special family occasion allied perhaps to a fair or acrobatics that type of thing <e> <s> another point is the early opening or closing of a racecourse <e> <s> the noble lord told the house that if that was a success there could perhaps be an expansion to race meetings <e> <s> the committee can read that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with the greatest diffidence to reply to the noble viscount lord tonypandy <e> <s> he is a difficult man to answer <e> <s> i do not have his particular vernacular <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him on backing his first winner tonight in that he has won by a short head in respect of the number of jockey club members in the chamber as compared to the strength on the bishops benches <e> <s> i think that he has won by nine to eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that i have fallen from a horse onto my head more often than any other noble lord with the possible exception of the noble lord lord oaksey who does not appear to be here this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in support of my noble friend lord kimball <e> <s> way back in i put my name to an amendment moved by my noble friend lord middleton that the old east riding of yorkshire should not be merged into a new county of humberside <e> <s> at that time your lordships did not accept our amendment and the message from the government of the time was lets give humberside a try <e>", "<cs> i put my name to the amendment after much careful thought <e> <s> i have unfortunately had experience of small children and of ponies <e> <s> small children are quite easy to avoid ponies must definitely be avoided at all costs <e> <s> of course i am in favour of small children not landing on their heads too often and therefore in favour of them wearing hats <e> <s> however when i have been involved much against my will with my many small nieces and their even smaller and horrible ponies i have noticed that at the slightest opportunity the children undo the straps of their helmets <e> <s> if any members of the committee have watched racing recently they will have noticed that the first thing that a jockey does at the end of a race is to undo the chin strap <e>"]
