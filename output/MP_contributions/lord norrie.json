["<cs> my lords at the outset of my speech i too would like to congratulate the noble viscount lord mackintosh of halifax on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> we welcome him to this house and look forward to his contributions on other subject matter in future <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than speaking in general terms it would be more informative i believe to draw on my experience of sunday trading <e> <s> when not in your lordships house i work as a full-time director of a nursery and garden centre <e> <s> in this context i am among the per cent <e> <s> of the working population in england and wales who according to the recent mori poll work frequently on sundays <e> <s> i must therefore declare a personal interest in the new bill introduced by my noble friend lord glenarthur <e> <s> should it be approved garden centres would be able to sell their complete range of goods on sundays without fear of breaking the law <e> <s> the shops act could never be expected to keep up with the continually changing shopping habits of the general public <e> <s> as a specific example yacht marinas may sell a complete range of goods which may be interpreted as lawfully saleable on sundays while nurseries and garden centres which cater for a much larger cross-section of the general public may not do so <e>", "<cs> in the second reading debate the opponents of the bill did not establish to my mind any justification for opposing the basic principle <e> <s> whatever may have happened in the past the right to retail the right to serve customers and the right to shop on sundays should be rights that any civilised society adopts <e> <s> i still consider that this amendment is a wrecking amendment and is designed to be so <e> <s> it removes the freedom of everyone to trade and to shop on sundays <e>", "<cs> during the second reading i confessed to my criminal activities and to those of my fellow garden centre operators by selling on sundays a whole range of goods not listed in schedule to the shops act <e> <s> i also stated that the only item that garden centres could legally sell was cut flowers on sundays of the calendar year <e> <s> sunday trade for garden centres represents not less than per cent <e> <s> of the weekly turnover <e> <s> to be able to sell a garden centres full range of products on only five sundays in any one calendar year would be quite ludicrous <e> <s> were this to become law today my next appointment after leaving your lordships house would be with the receiver <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill on two counts <e> <s> first because i am a garden centre operator and have striven throughout these debates to represent the views of my own industry together with those of the allied trade of diy operators <e> <s> secondly because i believe that complete deregulation of shop hours is the only practical solution <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an indication of the number of successful and unsuccessful prosecutions during <e> <s> can he tell us whether those prosecutions applied predominantly to the diy trade and garden centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to bring to the attention of the house the role and response of the voluntary sector <e> <s> the voluntary sector has <e>", "<cs> my lords previous speakers have already outlined the complex and demanding role of the nature conservancy council which was so well illustrated in the th report <e> <s> the role of the ncc is seen by many as a negative force <e> <s> nothing could be further from the truth <e> <s> the ncc has to face up to a number of contentious environmental issues the future of forestry the changes of land use and the over-abundance of interest groups competing for influence and resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to register my total disapproval of the modifications proposed for inclusion in the revised berkshire structure plan <e> <s> how can it be that the people of berkshire with their elected members of parliament and elected local authorities of parish district and county all recommend one course of action and yet the examining panel appointed by the secretary of state recommends another <e>", "<cs> my lords proposals for the reform of the sunday trading laws have enjoyed massive support for the past years and i believe it is truly time that this matter was redressed in law and time that our legislators recognised the consistent demand of the general public <e> <s> in fact until the policeman the nurse the power station worker and even the football referee broke the law when they turned out to work on sunday <e> <s> those restrictions remained on the statute book until repealed as being obsolete and of chiefly historical interest <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i shall confine my speech to three important aspects of water privatisation access recreation and conservation in the countryside <e> <s> will the bill protect them <e> <s> the existing water authorities are the guardians of a substantial area of our country as alluded to by the noble lord lord broadbridge <e> <s> to put that into perspective it is an area slightly larger than warwickshire <e> <s> it includes some of britains most spectacular landscape a haven for flora and fauna and accessible to some of our most popular recreations pursued by millions of people every year <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord swinton i believe that the electricity supply industry is potentally britains biggest polluter <e> <s> the bill gives us an ideal opportunity to introduce safeguards which will reduce the adverse environmental impact of electricity supply and use <e> <s> we are told that over a period of months the electricity supply industry generates million tonnes of carbon dioxide which adds to the greenhouse effect million tonnes of sulphur dioxide which is the prime constituent of acid rain and tonnes of nitrogen oxides which create acid rain and contribute to the greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends explanation <e> <s> i look forward to reading the document <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister has already agreed to come forward with amendments at report stage to give special protection to countryside with particular conservation and amenity value <e> <s> in doing so he has been true to his secretary of states pledge given to the standing conference on countryside sports last month that the government would carefully listen to debate on these matters <e> <s> in the same spirit i do not wish to press my amendments today but i ask my noble friend to maintain the dialogue <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the wise comments of my noble friends lord renton and the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the debate on this amendment could if i dare risk a small pun prove to be one of the more illuminating that this chamber will have during the passage of the electricity bill <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take the opportunity provided to give <e>", "<cs> it would appear that my amendment amendment no <e> <s> ab would have a similar effect and i therefore support the amendment tabled in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i should like to make the point that we must not allow new objectives brought in by the secretary of state under this legislation to be less stringent than those that exist already <e> <s> the opening to the first sentence of clause reads <e>", "<cs> before the minister stands up i should like to say that i fully support these amendments tabled by my noble friends <e> <s> there can surely be no logical justification for excluding conservation duties from the remit of the nras powers since the present water authorities already have strict conservation duties <e> <s> regulation of the conservation duties should be passed to the nra in line with the other regulatory functions regarding water quality and resources <e>", "<cs> i have listened with considerable care and interest to the views of my noble friend the minister who will i think have noticed the concern expressed from all sides of the chamber on this issue <e> <s> whatever the government may feel about the rigours of a timetable for reviewing abstraction licences they must recognise the seriousness of the problem of over-abstraction and the effect on the environment <e> <s> the governments own statutory <e>", "<cs> my two amendments are grouped with the noble earls amendment <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and have been grouped together so i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble baroness lady nicol in very warmly welcoming the governments amendments on arrangements for the disposal of land in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty <e> <s> i also welcome the ministers indication that the clause has been drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to maintain continuity of drafting in subsection <e> <s> the amendment will ensure that the nra has the conservation duties that the government described in committee <e> <s> i refer particularly to the debate in committee on rd may on what were then clauses and and amendments moved by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to consider what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> he has said a great deal which needs to be digested <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers lengthy reply <e> <s> i have listened carefully to it <e> <s> there is no doubt that both in committee and at this stage great concern has been and is still being expressed on all sides of the chamber <e> <s> i have been able to speak with personal knowledge of the plight of the river pang which is representative of many other affected rivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and at this time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for his lengthy reply <e> <s> in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords during the earlier debate i supported the noble baroness lady nicol in seeking to bring sssis within the scope of the governments new clause <e> <s> the number of sssis damaged each year and the circumstances which allow them to be damaged demonstrate that the existing system of consultation and planning control is inadequate <e> <s> i welcome the governments new clause since it provides a safety net to catch sites which are to be disposed of and empowers the secretary of state to direct that vulnerable wildlife habitats and landscapes should be subject to covenants or management agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment which i consider as common sense and an important point of principle <e> <s> i recognise that the scottish river purification authorities rpas already have a duty to further nature conservation in so far as it is consistent with their functions <e> <s> earlier tonight we heard from the noble lord lord hesketh that the government have brought forward a new duty to be placed upon the nra to promote conservation outside its other functions <e> <s> this amendment provides the opportunity to impose a similar duty on the scottish rpas <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful and pleased to hear what the minister has said in response to my amendment <e> <s> i trust that in agreeing to consider all the points which i raised one can hope for some progress on all of them before the report stage of the bill <e> <s> certainly i shall be delighted to discuss any points of detail with the minister in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the minister said and i am disappointed that he does not see the importance of including the conservation of flora and fauna on land within the remit of the nra <e> <s> the nra is to have the duty to promote recreation the conservation of natural beauty and the amenity of land <e> <s> all those duties are intricately <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the minister has said <e> <s> i am afraid that the government have not given any ground since the committee and report stages on the amendments on water abstraction <e> <s> the amendments which i tabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a warm welcome to the governments proposed amendment which will bring all sites of special scientific interest within the safety net of clause <e> <s> the house will know that i supported an earlier amendment tabled by the noble baroness lady nicol which sought just to do that <e> <s> to that end i congratulate the government on accepting the need to safeguard sssis which may become surplus to the requirements of the water industry <e> <s> a number of conservation bodies were deeply worried that the wildlife value of many of the industrys lowland sites would deteriorate without there being a mechanism to help to guard against inappropriate land disposals or without the ability to apply conditions relating to access or land management <e> <s> the royal society for the protection of birds in particular considers that the proposed amendment will provide a basis for helping to safeguard many of the water authorities lowland sites which are important to wildlife <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his full explanation <e> <s> under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the intention of this amendment to clause moved by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> related to the amendments are amendments to schedule in the name of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i welcome these amendments and i shall welcome them fully tomorrow when we discuss schedule in detail <e> <s> today i want to concentrate on the issues of principle affecting electricity and the environment <e> <s> they are issues that i have raised repeatedly during the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak to government amendments nos <e> <s> and to <e> <s> i start by congratulating my noble friend the minister on her commitment last night to introducing an environmental amendment to clause of the bill on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an excellent time to be debating the role of the european community in protecting habitat and species because environmental issues remain high on the political agenda and all around us we are besieged with advice as to what should remain national concerns and what should become community concerns <e> <s> the commission proposal which we are debating on which our committee reported reflects rather neatly the conservative dilemma about europe <e> <s> we are all concerned with habitat destruction and threatened wildlife <e> <s> the question is whether protection policies should be implemented at the national or community level <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish only to make a brief comment in support of the aims of my noble friends bill <e> <s> the very fact that he has brought forward a bill which proposes an integrated system for environmental protection illustrates the fact that we do not have such a system at present <e> <s> that fact is to be regretted <e> <s> the bill is also of special significance coinciding as it does with the governments own environmental protection bill currently being debated in another place <e> <s> my view is that my noble friends bill is more far-reaching than the governments indeed it proposes a comprehensive system for regulating all activities which will affect the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i see this as a short and technical bill designed to introduce new financial and licensing arrangements for the coal industry <e> <s> i welcome it <e> <s> however i am sure that noble lords will be relieved to learn that i have no intention of embarking on a learned discussion about either its technical or financial merits <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate <e> <s> i am still disappointed by the noble viscounts response particularly as my amendment has been very widely supported on all sides of the committee <e> <s> i am particularly disappointed by the governments continual reliance on the planning system and the process of parliamentary assessment alone to address the very real environmental concern raised by coal extraction <e> <s> as i emphasised in my speech under the present arrangements these come into the process far too late to play the vital role which i envisage for the environmental duty <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before us is a rather strange creature <e> <s> much of its content is useful and important in strengthening control over pollution and nuisances though it could go considerably further in addressing the significant global threats now facing us and in integrating environmental regulation and assessment more fully <e> <s> on the other hand it raises an issue which i feel should have been given much more careful and deliberate consideration <e> <s> i refer of course to the proposed re-organisation of the statutory conservation bodies the nature conservancy council and the countryside commissions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kimball and the noble baroness lady nicol have both indicated to me that this bill is going to be widely supported <e> <s> it was indeed the ramblers association and the british horse society which were instrumental in negotiating the bills provisions <e> <s> both organisations belong to the outdoor pursuits division of the central council of physical recreation <e> <s> the ccpr the umbrella organisation to which most governing bodies of sporting and recreational activities belong supports the rights of way bill wholeheartedly <e> <s> it believes that its provisions will greatly benefit riders and walkers by improving access to the countryside <e> <s> no restrictions beyond those currently set out in the code of practice will be placed upon farmers and in certain ways landowners and the natural landscape will benefit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for such a detailed response to all four amendments <e> <s> i shall study carefully what he has said and how best to resolve the problems <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for a very full explanation <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he said and i may try to come back at the next stage with something on which we can both agree <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend once again for a full explanation <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he said in <e>", "<cs> i shall speak specifically to amendment no <e> <s> b and then go on to deal with amendments nos <e> <s> b c and d and lastly amendment no <e> <s> zc <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> b is to establish proper integration of countryside and landscape functions with nature conservation within the remit of the joint committee <e> <s> the select committee chaired by the noble and gallant lord lord carver recommended such integration <e> <s> i believe that that is one issue for which the government apart there is almost universal support <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> my amendment extends and clarifies the role of the joint committee <e> <s> the nature conservancy council currently has a duty under the wildlife and countryside act to review every five years the status of animals and plants in great britain and to advise the secretary of state whether endangered species are deserving of legal protection <e> <s> that is known as the quinquennial review <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps he can clarify one point <e> <s> can he confirm that the nccs present advisory committee on birds will continue to exist and co-ordinate bird conservation matters for the joint committee <e>", "<cs> i rise to express support for amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> in supporting the amendment i stress that our purpose is not to cut across the proposed new regional system but to make provision over and above it for activities which clearly have an inter-regional or national significance <e> <s> the new devolved bodies will naturally provide their hard-pressed funds first to conservation work central to their area <e> <s> we must ensure that this logic does not prohibit or disrupt projects that are too expensive for a single council to support or which seem insufficiently relevant to local needs to gain all the support they require <e> <s> perhaps i may illustrate my point with a few examples <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should add that i support this amendment which will give the new councils the power to reach agreements with those who have rights on sssis and with owners and occupiers of land adjacent to sssi land <e> <s> i consider this to be a necessary power which will prove helpful in the safeguarding of sssis <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment i should like to emphasise that at present the sssi provisions do not apply to common right holders <e> <s> peat cutters turf cutters and grazers are examples <e>", "<cs> it is obviously sensible that when land that has been notified as being of special scientific interest ceases to possess that special interest it should be denotified and the owners and occcupiers should no longer be bound by the provisions relating to sssis <e> <s> the omission of the power to denotify sssis from section of the wildlife and countryside act was surely an oversight <e> <s> it is right that the new council should have such and explicit power <e> <s> for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which closes a loophole that currently exists in relation to nature conservation orders under section of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> those orders are the last resort available to the ncc to prevent an sssi from being damaged or destroyed <e> <s> they are granted by the relevant secretary of state <e> <s> fortunately only a handful are used every year <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment which would allow the ncc to make management agreements to protect wildlife outside sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> we all know that the wildlife of this country is not confined to sssis and that many areas which fall outside statutory protection are very important in local terms <e> <s> therefore i would welcome the extension of the nccs powers in this way while pointing out that as ever the obligations for compensation might prove a deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in supporting amendments nos <e> <s> and and which also stand in my name i should like to voice my anxiety about the future of documentary and social action programmes particularly those relating to environmental issues <e> <s> i am anxious also that the full range of programming is to be shown at reasonable times <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for such an explicit explanation <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lord renton for making the situation clearer <e> <s> in view of the ministers full explanation at this stage i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was yet another of those privileged to serve under the chairmanship of the noble earl lord cranbrook during the inquiry which led to the report <e> <s> i do not use the word privileged lightly <e> <s> many noble lords have described his skill in steering sub-committee f through the complexities of community proposals for environmental legislation <e> <s> his knowledge as a scientist always gave a particular precision to his questions to witnesses as it did to deliberations on draft reports <e> <s> those of us on the select committee will confirm that he was eagle-eyed in spotting the environmental implications of draft reports from other sub-committees <e> <s> we were all sorry to hear that the inquiry would be his last <e> <s> however we were of course delighted to hear that his expertise was being recognised in his appointment to the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can she clarify exactly what she means <e> <s> i said that the advice did not have to be taken <e> <s> i do not understand her answer to that point <e> <s> advice can be given but it does not necessarily have to be taken <e> <s> the advice is there if it is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly disappointed by my noble friends response <e> <s> while rejecting these amendments and those of the noble and gallant lord lord carver there are no new objections as far as i can see <e> <s> i am at a loss to understand the governments continued opposition to this matter particularly as i stressed that when introducing these amendments we had met the governments criticisms of them at committee stage <e> <s> i had honestly hoped for a better response <e> <s> i am still amazed that the government are not willing to allow the best possible advice to be given to the country councils on countryside matters <e> <s> before deciding what action to take i ask my noble friend whether even at this late hour she can indicate if there is a possibility of her offering her own amendment at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the two of us <e> <s> in my amendment i am offering free advice <e> <s> if the free advice is accepted that is fair enough if it is not accepted that is also fair enough <e> <s> that is the fundamental difference <e> <s> i have to disagree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i wish to test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her reply <e> <s> before withdrawing my amendment i ask her to explain how each department in england scotland and wales can produce its environmental report to include nature conservation issues and to the same standard without the availability of common criteria from which to work <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the late hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendments <e> <s> i believe that members of this house still have a rare opportunity to secure the future of much of the best and most valuable in british broadcasting <e> <s> i last spoke on this aspect of the bill on th july and since then i have joined the noble baroness lady david and the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale and lord plowden for a meeting with my noble friend lord ferrers to press the government on these issues <e> <s> i followed closely the arguments put against our amendments by my right honourable friend mr mellor the minister in another place <e> <s> far from being persuaded by the governments arguments i am now even more convinced that the amendments are essential for the protection of documentaries social action and education programmes <e> <s> they are all seriously endangered species <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the select committees report <e> <s> there can be no doubt that the issues it addresses are important and need urgent action not least from the government <e> <s> both agriculture and planning policies for the countryside are coming under active review <e> <s> new initiatives are needed to protect the landscape and the social balance of our rural areas from the threat of excessive or unbalanced development <e> <s> the report covers many important aspects but like many other speakers i shall concentrate on the vital issue of affordable rural housing <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill allows us to look afresh at the planning system an opportunity that has not arisen for almost years <e> <s> it confirms the governments commitment to the planning system as a way of resolving conflicts over development <e> <s> it will help restore public confidence in a system which often fails to meet their expectations <e>"]
