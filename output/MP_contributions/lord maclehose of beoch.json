["<cs> my lords i ask for the normal indulgence of the house to somebody addressing it for the first time and who is all too conscious of the fact that a number of his former masters are sitting to pass judgment on him <e> <s> i wish to speak about hong kong because the fact that discussions about its future have started is a matter of very great importance <e> <s> it is a development which has been expected for some time but it is one thing to expect something and quite another to be faced by its reality <e> <s> the fact is that the announcement of the discussions and the accompanying flurry of official semi-official and unofficial statements and press commentary worried and confused the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble baroness lady vickers on introducing the bill <e> <s> i intervene briefly on one point <e> <s> the bill discriminates against other dependent territories and the question arises as to what extent that is an obstacle <e> <s> i accept that it was the governments intention that in its treatment of dependent territories the british nationality act should be neutral <e> <s> but there is an enormous difference between legalities and human feelings <e> <s> the fact is that the british nationality act was bitterly resented in the dependent territories including hong kong <e> <s> it is true that as the noble lord said the door to the united kingdom was closed to residents of dependent territories in but the british nationality act appeared gratuitously to double lock the door <e> <s> similarly the change in the name of citizenship was regarded as explicable i repeat regarded as explicable only as an act of political disengagement <e> <s> as the situation developed the then governor of hong kong exhausted himself in explanations and indeed in epithets but with only marginal success in moving her majestys government and i do not intend to repeat them this afternoon <e> <s> however i should acknowledge the recent administrative change authorised in hong kong passports which is helpful and <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in this debate because as governor of hong kong i saw at first hand the deplorable political impact of the original decision on fees for overseas students and the major diversion of hong kong students from the united kingdom to north america that resulted <e> <s> i was also involved in successive initiatives by the hong kong government to keep the academic link with the united kingdom going first by stop-gap measures funded entirely by hong kong and secondly by long-term proposals aimed at joint funding <e> <s> the most charitable description of the response up to till now was that the government appeared to be in some disarrary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord fanshawe with whom i had the honour of working when he was minister responsible for the foreign office and i was governor of hong kong <e> <s> i do not remember disagreeing with him often then <e> <s> i certainly do not disagree with anything he has said tonight with the exception of what he has said about myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like immediately to congratulate the noble earl lord birkenhead on his maiden speech <e> <s> i am relieved that he chose a subject which is virtually the only one on which i can compliment him with some authority <e> <s> i hope he stays with it in the years that lie ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the question asked by the noble lord lord bruce of donington would the minister confirm that there is no question of subsidisation of hong kong exports and that indeed since that market is entirely free for british and other exports it should be treated quite differently from protected markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for the clarity with which he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not say that that was my view <e> <s> i was quoting the view of the legislative councillors <e> <s> in a letter from the senior councillor it was stated that if they had to choose they would emigrate rather than apply for chinese nationality <e> <s> i think that we really have to take account of that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister comment on the role of the united kingdom trade commission in hong kong in furthering this trade particularly with the special economic zones of south china <e> <s> would the minister say whether he is satisfied that the china section of their commission is sufficiently staffed to meet its expanding requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i do congratulate the noble lord lord rhodes on his speech <e> <s> he certainly has a right to speak on china and i remember with affectionate respect the way he led that series of delegations through hong kong to china <e> <s> they were a very personal exercise in the improvement of sino-british understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not wish to detain your lordships long at this late hour i want to thank the noble lord lord chitnis for tabling the question and speaking to it so forcefully <e> <s> i am also very glad that he is personally taking an interest in the problem <e> <s> i have the most vivid recollection <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to say how fascinated i was to hear again the noble lord lord kadoorie <e> <s> his contribution was typical of his great and idiosyncratic contribution on so many matters in hong kong <e> <s> i think that the number of noble lords who have indicated a desire to speak on this motion this friday afternoon shows how seriously your lordships take their responsibilities toward the people in hong kong <e> <s> i think that the best contribution i can make rather than take up the points made by individual speakers is to say how i see this matter in its context and what i think is the most useful thing that your lordships can do this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the motion calls on the government to bring in a substitute motion which would confer the right of abode in the united kingdom to people who would otherwise become stateless <e> <s> my point is that this government and i suspect no government would admit under the terms of the international convention on statelessness that those people were stateless <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> would he agree that better knowledge of the country its law and its language would be of great assistance to our exporters <e> <s> would the government therefore support those places of higher education without which that knowledge would fade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat embarrassed to be placed so highly in this debate and to follow three speeches of such a wide-ranging and fascinating nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it covers an area of great importance to people in hong kong <e> <s> i for one shall want to study it carefully <e> <s> meanwhile there is one point upon which i would like clarification <e> <s> is it a firm decision as to what will happen up to <e> <s> will nothing change between now and then or is the arrangement subject to yet more debate and possible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that false rumour in vietnam is playing a part in encouraging this traffic <e> <s> will he say to what extent the overseas services of the bbc are being used to put the record straight <e>", "<cs> my lords the rumour to which i was referring was that restrictions in hong kong were being lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady young on her speech <e> <s> i was delighted by her positive reaction to her recent visit to hong kong <e> <s> perhaps i may also say how good it is to see so many of your lordships participating in this debate on a summer friday morning <e> <s> as the noble lord lord cledwyn said the drafting of the basic law which is what we are considering this morning is the responsibility of the chinese government but there is a british obligation which is to satisfy itself that in the end the basic law fulfils precisely the commitments of the joint declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government cannot match what the portuguese government have done will they consider reviewing the operation of section of the british nationality act which applies to a comparatively restricted number of hong kong people <e>", "<cs> my lords this question of british nationality is exceedingly bitter for people in hong kong <e> <s> it is the subject that arouses most passion and is at the heart of the disilllusionment with the united kingdom which is so constantly and i fear correctly alleged in the media <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak briefly and on only one point <e> <s> i believe it to be of general application based on my experience as chairman of the board of governors of the school of oriental and african studies <e> <s> the school expects to account in detail for the resources it receives from the public purse <e> <s> it welcomes external retrospective audit both financial and academic of the funds it receives <e> <s> but the operative word is retrospective <e> <s> it makes no sense especially in the case of a highly specialised institution such as soas for a central and remote authority to attempt to control in detail and in advance exactly how the resources should be applied as the ugc tended to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the excellent statement for the horror that he has expressed about events in china for his sympathy for the people of hong kong and for his detailed account of the action which the government have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister said about greater flexibility in administration of the british nationality act is extremely welcome <e> <s> i understand that this will take some time to work out while consideration is going through <e> <s> however does the minister know that many applications for british citizenship under section of the british nationality act by crown servants in hong kong have been rejected <e> <s> i am told that the figure is over <e> <s> as these people are vital for the future of hong kong does not the minister agree that it would be an extremely good thing if these applications were now reconsidered <e> <s> will the minister speak to his right honourable friend in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord willoughby de broke on his admirable maiden speech <e> <s> i am very much in accord with his sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement and i should like to be associated with the tributes to the foreign secretary <e> <s> i regret that while he was there he was subjected to one small piece of studied discourtesy <e> <s> i welcome much of <e>", "<cs> my lords as a scot it gives me great pleasure to follow the noble baroness lady carnegy in her plea for scottish whisky which certainly has been grossly badly done by in japan <e> <s> as a member of the select committee i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord kearton on his chairmanship of that committee and on his splendid introductory speech which did not leave very much more for the rest of us to say <e> <s> at this stage in the debate i find that fellow members of the committee have covered all the points and i shall confine myself to a slight emphasis or enlargement of just one or two matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister and other noble lords have referred to events in china and their impact on hong kong <e> <s> i am sure the government are right to continue to base their policy on implementation of the sino-british joint declaration as the minister said <e> <s> there is of course immense underlying strength in hong kong in its economic capacity in its resilience and in its capacity to get on with its great neighbour <e> <s> given time current difficulties might be expected to pass and intergovernmental business could be pursued in a calmer atmosphere <e> <s> but unfortunately time will not wait and as the minister indicated the government have several thorny issues that will have to be addressed this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement and for his subsequent replies to questions which covered all the points i had in mind <e> <s> however i wish to say to the minister what a relief it must be to the people in hong kong that the government have moved on this issue which was causing so much concern and which without action would inevitably have invited a further influx in march when the winds shift south and it is easy to move up the chinese coast to hong kong <e> <s> from what the minister has said today it is clear that there has been intense and highly expert negotiation with north vietnam <e> <s> i congratulate the minister and the government on what they have achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the government took a courageous and correct decision about non-refugee vietnamese <e> <s> will they now take an even more courageous decision about the grant of nationality to key people in hong kong on a scale that would save a situation that once looked so promising <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to start by saying what a notable decision this is <e> <s> though the numbers may not be as high as some in hong kong would have wished people in hong kong are realists and they must understand the realities of the political situation there <e> <s> the governments decision is a major element in assisting hong kong in its present predicament <e> <s> for my part i congratulate the government <e> <s> i realise that there may be criticism along the lines set out by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> people will say that there are a favoured few <e> <s> however it is impractical to give british citizenship to all dependent territory citizens in hong kong <e> <s> both major parties are agreed on this point <e> <s> of course if anything is to be done it must be to some extent divisive <e> <s> solomon-like decisions will have to be taken in the light of what is proposed <e> <s> i am heartily sorry for those who have to do this <e> <s> i ask whether special procedures will be considered so that the proposals can be put into operation quickly <e> <s> until the results are known there will inevitably be extreme personal worries in hong kong as to whether or not people are included <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord holme of cheltenham and to be able to congratulate him on his maiden speech <e> <s> i do so with all the greater pleasure since i now know that he was a gurkha officer in hong kong <e> <s> it was a most interesting and eloquent speech <e> <s> i hope that we shall frequently hear him in the house <e>", "<cs> it is with great diffidence that i intervene in a constitutional matter of principle <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon drew the parallel of the british nationality act <e> <s> there is no parallel here because the number of citizenships being issued is limited <e> <s> this means that until the total number is known the citizenships cannot be issued <e> <s> this in turn means that if each one is subject to review or many of them are none of the can be issued <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> as the noble lord lord marsh said it is an emergency measure to improve morale in hong kong <e> <s> but if it is to be held up by these constitutional niceties i fear that it will miss the mark <e>", "<cs> i find myself in some difficulty <e> <s> i agree with almost everyone who has spoken <e> <s> but it does not add up <e> <s> i sympathise with the spirit of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the undertaking given in which he quoted was a helpful move at that time <e> <s> it was well received but times have changed <e> <s> if they had not changed we would not be considering the bill <e>", "<cs> i very much support what the noble lord lord derwent said <e> <s> i support the concept of giving points as set out in paragraph of the draft scheme a copy of which has been placed in the library for connections with the uk through as stated in the draft investment relatives residents education and so on <e> <s> however the inclusion of the phrase service with british firms causes a great many unintended problems and i believe that further thought should be given to that matter <e> <s> it would discriminate in the most bizarre way between firms which are all british but which happen to be domiciled in different parts of british territory <e>", "<cs> my lords it was very valuable to hear my old friend the noble lord lord kadoorie speak on this subject <e> <s> no one has contributed more than he has to hong kong <e> <s> it was very valuable to hear his broad appreciation of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl said is this not essentially a hong kong matter <e>"]
