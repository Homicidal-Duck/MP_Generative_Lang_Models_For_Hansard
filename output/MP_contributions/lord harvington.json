["<cs> before the noble earl replies may i say that i am perhaps the only one of your lordships who has actually jumped into one of these fences and it is an extremely disagreeable experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make what may seem to your lordships quite a small point and it may well have been made in the past when the de <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer for her majestys government but i am sure that you cannot because they are not part of the currency of the country today and have been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend realise that the whole country will be pleased to know that that is so and that many people in fact almost everybody hope that this glorious feat of british arms may be signalised by an award such as that of the victoria cross for the george cross although secundus inter pares with the victoria cross is not quite the same thing <e> <s> i hope that something will be done to help that cause along the way because i am sure it will be well received not only by the country but also by the armed forces and especially by the people concerned <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene to say that i believe that the noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris have put their fingers on the right way of looking at this matter <e> <s> i do not think that we are going <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would advise the greater use of standing committees in this house to save the time of this house in the manner in which they do in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be the wish of your lordships if i were to express your feelings on the debate that we have had it has been most interesting as well as our gratitude to the noble lord lord trefgarne for dealing so fully with the points we have made <e> <s> but perhaps above all i should thank him for hard cash because it is not very often that a debate such as this ever results in any government announcing hard cash <e> <s> although i have been in one or other of these places for years i have never before seen it happen quite like that <e> <s> so on behalf of us all i thank the noble lord and following upon that i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> i had the good fortune to be lucky in the draw for a short debate about a year ago in which the noble lord lord winstanley spoke <e> <s> during my research for that debate it became clear to me that per cent <e> <s> of the population have some deafness disability <e> <s> if one looks around the chamber now and considers that per cent <e> <s> of us have a hearing disability of some kind that would be my answer to the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> although there are no doubt other disabilities the overwhelming necessity to aid the partially deaf cannot be disregarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be pleased to hear what my noble friend has said <e> <s> perhaps the difference expressed this afternoon could be resolved between the noble lord the minister and the royal national institute for the deaf so that there may not be any misunderstanding between the ministry and the institute <e> <s> would he also accept from me that i know that his ministry is doing great work in this matter and doing everything possible to speed up research in order to make these hearing aids much more efficient than they are now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord shackleton to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to my noble friend lady young for allowing me to interject just for one minute on what i think is a very important point which has been missed <e> <s> i went to this area about five years ago and i observed the fact that there is no harbour at all <e> <s> it is not a question of bad harbour facilities there just aint any <e> <s> therefore the swell round the island is pretty constant all the time and all the transporting of materials from any ships that come there has to be done in very small tenders in fact what we would call very small tenders indeed <e> <s> unless something can be done about making some sort of a wall or something against which you can put a or tonne ship so as to use its derricks to unload the materials you need to unload then i think it will be very difficult to develop the islands in any way at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend the minister were to give way to this question which the questioner seems to desire where would it end <e> <s> would not the league against cruel sports and the support <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the law as it stands is that if a dog is caught <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also bear in mind that much of the money involved over the past years has been spent on trying to isolate the virus in the disease of scrapie in sheep <e> <s> is he aware that as a result to the great loss of our sheep breeders it has not been possible to export pedigree sheep from this country to new zealand or australia <e> <s> will he try to ensure that some money is left for the continuation of what has been going on rather unsuccessfully for the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to what extent the government have improved the inland waterways for use by commercial undertakings during the last two or three years <e> <s> my information seems to be that they have not done very much <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that if this idea were adopted it would be extremely difficult for the milk industry and very wasteful of effort and would be altogether a bad thing for british agriculture <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord why this should be so <e> <s> a number of my noble friends in this house have had their land used for opencast coal mining and it has looked pretty terrible when it has been carried out <e> <s> to my certain knowledge all that land has been restored and today looks as though it has never been touched <e> <s> how does it come about that a situation exists which does not seem to be denied by the government front bench and which has been put forward by noble lords opposite that there are such areas in central london <e> <s> can anyone explain to me why it is that in other areas of the country these matters have been put right and yet have never been touched in an area so full of people and where amenity is of such great value that it seems impossible to believe that such a state of affairs could exist <e> <s> i should like to know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the order he proposes to make will be subject to a statutory order which can be prayed against by this house <e> <s> will he be kind enough to <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no intention of speaking today and in fact i am only here by accident as it were <e> <s> i noticed that no other noble lord of my own religious persuasion is here to say anything and i thought i would just say that i entirely agree with the noble lord lord mishcon and the right reverend prelate the bishop of chichester in what they said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether concerning the sum of money that she has announced will be spent on st helena she will go a little further and say if some of that money will be spent on what seems to me as one who knows the island to be of the utmost importance namely that there should be a suitable quay for unloading vessels <e> <s> she did not touch upon that <e> <s> can she enlarge upon that aspect <e>", "<cs> i shall intervene for just a few moments <e> <s> i have listened carefully to all the speeches that have been made this afternoon <e> <s> i have had a great deal of experience in another place with procedural matters and i was very impressed by the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon when he said that whatever we did this afternoon could only be the last word in one way that is if we vote against it <e> <s> if we vote for it the whole position is as open as it can possibly be <e> <s> i believe i am right in that but if not some authority on the procedure in this noble chamber will no doubt put me right <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether so far he knows under the new arrangements the rights of navigation are affected at all <e> <s> there is tremendous use as he well knows for amenity purposes of the waterways of england over which the old waterways authorites especially in east anglia i believe had a great deal of control <e> <s> i wonder whether he can throw any light upon this because it affects a very large number of her majestys subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend repeat the undertaking which his noble friend lord elton gave when answering questions on the previous statement namely that the interests of inland waterway navigators will be safeguarded <e> <s> of course in wales the problem is minuscule compared with what it is in england <e> <s> but in one way the degree of minuteness is in inverse ratio to the glorious beauty that lies therein and they should be preserved safely so that not only the welsh themselves but all the british people can enjoy them in their recreation time <e>", "<cs> my lords thank god <e>", "<cs> romania my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may put a point to him <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be of great assistance to the noble baroness in cases such as this and also cut short much of the discussion if her department were to give her the co-ordinates of these small places so that anyone can go and look at them <e> <s> she could then say you will find it in the library <e> <s> it is this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend a short question <e> <s> it will be in your lordships recollection that the english channel is divided so that there are two lanes <e> <s> one lane goes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that perhaps i too can join the noble lord lord balfour in this business of being one of the few <e> <s> i am probably the only member of your lordships house who commanded a flight in a fighter squadron in <e> <s> i can only say that this news we have had today that her majestys government will provided certain requirements are forthcoming which i am quite sure can be made to be forthcoming have a favourable attitude towards the idea that there should be a statue is something that those of us who are left who were involved with the late air marshal would very much like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this question is close enough to the subject matter <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend can say something about the agricultural advisory council which has been studying for years how to isolate the virus of scrapie in sheep <e> <s> does she feel that perhaps we may have an interim report <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not like doing so because i agree with her on so many issues <e> <s> in proposing the amendment however she has the whole thing wrong <e> <s> if she reads the second reading debate she will see that the noble baroness lady blatch i shall not worry the committee with the exact quotation but it is at col if anyone is interested made it clear that she supported the bill as it was and that it could not be improved in the way i believe the noble baroness had in mind <e> <s> the words used by the noble baroness lady blatch form a very good reason for not accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely sure whether the conservancy council took part itself but its interests were definitely very much represented <e> <s> the whole idea was to have everybody on a level so that no one could veto a common decision and say that is not the decision we want we want this <e> <s> i think we can safely say that those with for example navigational interests whose livelihood depends on keeping everything beautiful and as we would like to see it will take great care to see that for their part the things which the noble baroness wishes to see done will indeed be done <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting him <e> <s> i did not mean that parliament could not try to intervene <e> <s> i meant that it would be impossible to obtain agreement between the many <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt here <e> <s> i should apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> i believe i made the mistake <e> <s> on reflection and i should know from my long memory i do not think hybridisation is involved <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a word to cheer up the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby particularly in regard to his comment at the beginning of his speech about dogs and going to church <e> <s> our dog goes to church every sunday and has done ever since he was a puppy <e> <s> he causes no trouble and behaves himself extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords by courtesy of the remaining three noble lords who are down to speak in the debate i should like to take the opportunity offered to address a few words of thanks to the noble lord lord molloy for the way in which he opened this debate and for the speech he made <e>", "<cs> i wish to express concern about the position of the trustees in voluntary schools under the provisions of the bill <e> <s> the amendment provides for the governors of the voluntary school to consult the trustees <e> <s> the noble baroness has done something to meet the position of catholic schools by allowing consultation to take place at all <e> <s> but i do not think that it goes far enough <e> <s> it is the trustees who are the owners of the property <e> <s> surely their consent should be required before an application is made for a change of status <e> <s> i cannot help thinking that the bill does not sufficiently distinguish between the position in county schools where the owner is the local authority and the position in voluntary schools where a private charitable trust is the owner <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has heard all the views which have been brought forward <e> <s> there has been no one at all to support the government in the question of one or two students <e> <s> my noble and learned friend should tell us what is the supreme advantage of going against what seems to be the general opinion of the committee in having two students rather than one <e> <s> what is so sacrosanct about it <e> <s> is not this just an instance when the government in their generosity could see the wish generally of the committee and give way <e> <s> this is just the type of occasion where a government should give way unless they are prepared to say why one student is better than two when everyone around the chamber has been saying the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord remember that birmingham is perhaps the best governed city in england <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord speak up it is very difficult to hear him <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the points made by the noble lord lord hylton in moving these amendments <e> <s> they are necessary in order to do justice to the position of the trustees of voluntary schools to whom the schools belong <e> <s> the bill provides no more than this <e> <s> first that trustees may object to a proposal to change the status of their school a right which is also given to members of the public <e> <s> secondly the trustees should be consulted by governors where the initiative for change comes from the governors rather than from the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am looking at the clock <e> <s> i suppose it might be two years since i last had the privilege to address the house <e> <s> perhaps i may be left in peace for three minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interject just one single word <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl whether he would agree with me that this is looked upon by countless numbers of our countrymen as a very serious blasphemy indeed and whether it is not up to us as leaders of christianity which is what i believe a great many members of this house to be to do something about it <e> <s> if we cannot do anything about it under the present legislation ought we not to do something about it through new legislation <e> <s> will he further agree that this is a suitable matter to be brought up for debate within a very short time in order to make sure that parliament takes seriously the fact that this country is still a christian nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lady gardner <e> <s> in my nd year i went to have my eyesight tested the other day by a consultant who had been testing it every five years and to my astonishment he told me that my sight is better now than it was five years ago which was very pleasing to hear <e> <s> therefore it shows that <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is a welcome if belated attempt to face up to the need for public law to control the procedures used to assist human fertilisation <e> <s> it contains provisions to prohibit or alternatively to restrict research on human embryos <e> <s> in both cases this is a recognition that there are limits which must not be transgressed no matter how great are the successes claimed in relieving infertility and no matter how promising are the advances hoped for in diagnosing and eliminating genetic defects and diseases <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for just a moment in the debate <e> <s> i shall be very short in what i have to say <e> <s> i shall certainly not join in the most learned discussions which we have heard from both sides of the committee <e> <s> i think that the chamber is well appraised of what we are really dealing with in this clause <e> <s> it is quite simple <e> <s> however i should like to put noble lords on their guard <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the comments of my noble friend the minister and to those of the members of the committee opposite <e> <s> that has drawn my attention to the fact that i may be <e>", "<cs> i entirely support everything that has been said <e> <s> i cannot resist the thrill of finding myself on the same side as lord mcgregor for once <e>", "<cs> i must support my noble friend the duke of norfolk in opposing the amendment <e> <s> we have a strange situation in british law where many acts remain on the statute book which no one would wish to see enforced <e> <s> for instance a taxi driver who does not carry a bale of hay in his boot is breaking the law but no one would expect to see <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i too support the noble baroness and my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in the amendment which he has brought forward <e> <s> the amendment has gone a long way towards meeting some of the considerable difficulties we have had in accepting the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i am sure that the house will be pleased to know that there is to be a prosecution in this case <e> <s> many scores of people saw this terrible accident which might easily have involved the loss of life <e> <s> can my noble friend assure the house that the trial is likely to take place before the next round the island race which will be on approximately the same date this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what my noble friend has said but there are occasions particularly on this day and on other days during cowes week when one cannot see the water for yachts <e> <s> does it not therefore behove those who are running commercial craft to take extra special care at such times <e>", "<cs> my lords is there a philatelic aspect to the question <e> <s> it might be a good idea to get hold of these stamps and give them to ones grandchildren for birthday presents <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps he will allow me to raise a question with regard to scrapie <e> <s> i was chairman of the national sheep breeders of great britain in the s and if he looks into his files he will find that i have raised the question many times <e> <s> i hope the noble lord who is to follow will allow me a few moments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the amendment be now put <e>"]
