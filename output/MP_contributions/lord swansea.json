["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his answer which since i tabled the question has been foreshadowed in the gracious speech <e> <s> and though it may appear a little tardy following my noble friends notable speech last week on the humble address may i take this opportunity of congratulating him upon his first appearance at the dispatch box at question time <e> <s> may i ask him what are the governments plans now for the disposal of the old coal exchange building in cardiff on which a certain amount of money from public funds has already been spent and whether they expect that that expenditure will be recouped <e>", "<cs> if i may put in a very brief word here as another welshman i should like to support what my noble friend lord gibson-watt has said and congratulate the government on this eleventh hour change of heart which will be very warmly welcomed throughout wales <e> <s> like my noble friend i have lived in wales all my life in an area where welsh is not very widely spoken <e> <s> i have never had the need to learn it myself but that does not mean that i have any the less regard for it as an ancient language the language so they say spoken by adam and eve in the garden of eden and one which has a wealth of ancient literature and is well worth preserving from the cultural point of view however much one may doubt its practical value in the world today <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to welcome the governments move in this matter <e>", "<cs> if properly used the air rifle is a very effective weapon for controlling small pests and with respect to my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard the fact that some may be fitted with telescopic sights merely adds to their effectiveness in the sense that it is an aid to killing humanely the bird you are aiming at rather than simply wounding it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i am quite happy to agree to that suggestion <e> <s> in looking at this subsection i think it advisable that we should know just what we are talking about when we consider the terms automatic and semi-automatic weapons <e> <s> there are accepted technical definitions for those terms and for the avoidance of any misunderstanding in debating this amendment or some of the following amendments we ought to be quite clear about just what they mean <e> <s> so i suggest to the committee that we go back to square one and ask ourselves what the terms really do mean <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend on the front bench for his remarks <e> <s> i am not quite sure what our position is under the eec regulations but i rather get the impression in some cases that it is a case of being under a selective obligation in other words if we like the sound of certain eec legislation we accede to it and if we do not like it we do not feel obliged to accede to it <e> <s> this smells to me very much like such a case <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i agree entirely with him so far as the definitions of automatic and semi-automatic weapons are concerned <e> <s> i went into that very point in some detail on clause <e> <s> i am also aware that the scope of this subsection of clause is not so broad as that of clause but even so i thought it a suitable opportunity to make a fresh approach to the question of semi-automatic weapons in the hope of saving a little <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton threw into the ring the question whether or not his amendment was any good <e> <s> i would submit to your lordships that it is not and i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will not be too precipitate in committing the government to accepting an amendment of this kind which to our surprise he indicated a couple of weeks ago that he would <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to restrict the use of air weapons to those of higher-power muzzle energy of more than foot-pounds the ownership of which is subject to the holding of a firearms certificate <e> <s> i think this is both unnecessary and mistaken because i seem to detect in it a move to restrict the ownership of weapons under the guise of conservation <e> <s> secondly i think it is a mistake to suppose that air weapons of a lower power are not effective in dealing with small pests <e> <s> i believe they are and i could produce evidence to support that but i shall not detain your lordships on this occasion <e> <s> i just hope that my noble friend on the front bench will not be in too much of a hurry to commit the government <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> of course the most important aspect of this is the question of the semi-automatic rifle <e> <s> i shall not pursue this at this late hour but i shall return to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend on the front bench for what he has said <e> <s> i do not quite understand why he should be so worried about what the effect on other countries might be if we choose to derogate from the provisions of the directive because as regards the destruction of vermin and of species which cannot be said to be endangered we should not be afraid to go our own way <e> <s> after all as i have said the same considerations do not apply in all member countries <e> <s> we must take account of that <e> <s> of course we are a party to eec legislation but that is all the more reason why we should ensure that such eec legislation is properly framed and is founded on sound principles <e> <s> if we had the courage of our convictions and showed our own attitude towards this matter it might give a gentle nudge to the eec to take a look at this legislation of theirs again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put me in a slightly difficult position <e> <s> article of the directive empowers a member state to derogate from any of the provisions of the directive for certain good and sufficient reasons <e> <s> i would submit to your lordships that the control of pests and the protection of crops is a legitimate reason for accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add what is perhaps a lone voice in support of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the shooting organisations the british shooting sports council through its member organisations are actively prepared to co-operate with the government in the preparation and distribution of any material designed to educate the public in the better and safer use of firearms of all descriptions in particular air weapons which are the weapons most likely to fall into the hands of young people <e> <s> surely the approach that my noble friend has mentioned is far preferable to one of ruling air weapons out of order in a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that at the shooting galleries the rifles are normally chained to the counter so that they cannot easily be removed and that given proper supervision by the proprietor there is little likelihood of their being stolen <e> <s> although the proprietor does not need to have a certificate to <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord renton on the able way in which he has outlined this bill to the house and to give the bill a welcome as it is a praiseworthy attempt to strengthen the law relating to the criminal use of firearms <e> <s> i shall not weary your lordships with too many details of a technical nature <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that under existing legislation the courts already have ample powers to deal with firearms offences and that a more stringent use of those powers would be far more effective in reducing armed crime than would be the imposition of further restrictions on legitimate ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many of those who have been prosecuted were resident in this country and how many were overseas visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many prosecutions have been brought for use of bus lanes by vehicles other than those for which the bus lanes are designated <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i welcome this order because it is a great step forward for scotland <e> <s> i have no connection with scotland myself because i come from another part of the celtic fringe <e> <s> nevertheless this order is to be welcomed <e> <s> i welcome it with certain minor reservations <e> <s> an order as we know cannot be amended and our convention is that we do not reject one either <e> <s> the order lays down certain minimum requirements in the weight of the bullet the muzzle velocity and the muzzle energy <e> <s> i gather that these were worked out on the basis of advice given by the red deer commission <e> <s> it is desirable that the order should specify certain minimum standards allowing a wide range of weapons covering all calibres in common use <e> <s> but there are certain calibres still widely used although they are of some age now <e> <s> they might be regarded by some people as almost obsolete or old-fashioned but they are still widely used popular effective and are capable of killing a deer humanely although they might fall marginally short of one or other of the requirements laid down in this order <e> <s> i hope that it is not the governments intention to outlaw these weapons which although elderly are still widely used and still effective <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much that i should like to say but i feel that i must not trespass too much on your lordships goodwill <e> <s> time is getting on and i think that the house is anxious to return to a subject of slightly greater national importance <e> <s> my noble friends reply was not unexpected <e> <s> i just wonder how much his own heart was in it <e> <s> i must not be unkind to him because he has been a member of a team representing your lordships in our annual match against the other place that takes place at bisley every year and i think that he has some sympathy with the shooting interests <e> <s> i am grateful to other noble lords who have taken part in this debate and arising from what some of my noble friends have said i have personal experience of shall we say <e> <s> inefficiency on the part of the police but i shall not embarrass my noble friend by telling him that story now <e> <s> i may tell him privately another time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> in respect of highways the intention is not to protect the private owner of the land but to protect the travelling public where a nuisance exists <e> <s> there is evidence that such a nuisance exists already <e> <s> i am however glad to hear from my noble friend that the police have powers under another clause of the bill to deal with nuisances of this sort <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if her majestys government decide to introduce an amnesty will they at the same time advise the public that as an alternative to surrendering such unregistered firearms to the police they may also legally dispose of such items for their current value to a registered dealer <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many motorists find it a nuisance to have their cars cluttered with vouchers of one sort or another and that they may prefer to have the option of paying a little less for their petrol <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord mishcon is a golfer <e> <s> some noble lords may be <e> <s> i wonder whether those who are golfers have ever tried to play a round of golf with one club <e> <s> firearms are used for many different purposes and in many different competitive disciplines <e> <s> it is useless to talk of restricting ownership of firearms to one per person <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very particular pleasure for me and one that has fallen to my lot only once previously to congratulate a maiden speaker <e> <s> i have great pleasure in doing so in this case <e> <s> my noble friend is a well-known sportsman <e> <s> he speaks with some experience on the subject and i am sure that as well as that experience he has a measure of ability <e> <s> i hope that he will be able and willing to give your lordships the benefit of that ability on some future occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will forgive me the point on consultation that i was attempting to make was that the government arrived at their conclusions and their intentions without any consultation <e> <s> there has been a great deal of consultation since but that has not had any effect on the governments opinion <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by declaring an interest as chairman of the british shooting sports council <e> <s> i hope that it will not be necessary for me to do so each time i rise to my feet during the committee <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord brain and in particular amendment no <e> <s> which refers to pump-action rifles <e>", "<cs> it is a complete fallacy for my noble friend to say that a pump-action rifle is faster to operate and therefore more dangerous and lethal if there is such a thing as degrees of lethality than a self-loading rifle <e> <s> it is sheer nonsense to equate a pump-action rifle with a self-loading one <e>", "<cs> the inclusion of pump-action rifles in this clause of the bill is based on a complete misconception on the part of the government <e> <s> i can think of no other reason for it <e> <s> like so many other provisions of the bill it is based on ignorance combined with prejudice <e> <s> i should like to know why my noble friend thinks that a pump-action rifle can be considered to be as dangerous or as lethal if he likes to put it that way as a self-loading rifle and more dangerous than other types of rifle all of which are only as dangerous as the person behind them <e>", "<cs> there are very few areas of sport and recreation in which disabled people can take part although that depends on the nature of their disability <e> <s> however shooting is a sport in which they can take part <e> <s> if the nature of a persons disability permits him to hold a rifle and fire it at a target i can see no earthly reason why he should not be allowed to do so <e> <s> the governments of nearly every other western country are much more liberal in their attitude and they trust people <e> <s> why do this government not trust the public <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich forgets that the law varies considerably from one state to another in the united states <e> <s> some are fairly liberal but others are very much more restrictive than this country <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in the amendment that he has moved <e> <s> it is entirely logical and provides a satisfactory machinery for allowing the continued possession of self-loading rifles <e> <s> the national associations together with their affiliated clubs are entirely willing to help and co <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> the number of self-loading rifles tried and made before the date mentioned in the amendment is fairly small <e> <s> they were nearly all experimental rifles or prototypes <e> <s> there are not many of them about but such rifles as there are should be preserved <e> <s> they are of value to collectors they are of interest to students of military history and they are also of value to museums <e> <s> i do not recommend that many of them should actually be taken out to the range and fired now with modern ammunition but such as there are in this country should certainly be preserved <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friends attitude to this amendment is the same as that to his own amendment no <e> <s> as regards development which might arise in the future <e> <s> the type of gun with which this amendment is concerned may not be commonly used certainly not for sporting purposes <e> <s> it may be used for riot control <e> <s> personally i am not concerned with that type of shotgun but possibly people who shoot may be <e> <s> in any case i can see that there are technical difficulties here and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend may perhaps have overlooked one point in his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what controls the velocity of a bullet is not the gun itself but the cartridge which is used in it <e> <s> some cartridges produce a muzzle velocity in excess of the speed of sound and some produce a muzzle velocity below the speed of sound <e> <s> there are a good many rim-fire cartridges which produce the latter velocity and it has been found by manufacturers that the best accuracy for competition purposes is produced by this ammunition which is below the speed of sound <e> <s> my noble friend may perhaps not have been previously aware of this point but it has an important bearing on his amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> shooting interests have been caused a great deal of concern <e> <s> who can say what might be prohibited in the future <e> <s> it could be something that has not yet appeared on the market something that we do not know about <e> <s> we seem to be seeking to ban something which does not yet exist <e> <s> to give the secretary of state such wide-ranging powers as this without any hope of reversal is i believe entirely mistaken <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will think carefully about whether this clause is desirable <e>", "<cs> i know why the amendment has been introduced by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> it has all been sparked off by the invention of certain automatic pistols originating in austria some parts of which are composed of plastic non-metallic <e> <s> most of that weapon will not show up on an x-ray machine <e> <s> it is absurd to describe such a weapon as one which would pass an x-ray machine <e> <s> so long as there are steel barrels metallic springs and metallic ammunition that concept is pie in the sky <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> the noble lord lord brain is quite right <e> <s> must start again <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> as regards the last amendment which was agreed to before we rose for dinner the committee agreed to give the secretary of state powers to place on the prohibited list something which is at present unknown and we cannot foretell what that may be <e>", "<cs> i hope as my noble friend says that that situation is as unlikely to come about as the invention of a wholly plastic firearmwhich was dealt with under the previous amendment <e> <s> i can only express the hope that when the placing of any item on the prohibited list which is not on it now is contemplated by the government they will go through the proper process of consultation with shooting interests and with the trade before deciding what they will put on the list and presenting it to parliament <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely certain that my noble friend has grasped the full purport of the amendment <e> <s> it is a perfectly innocent one and simply refers to shotguns which have been converted from former military rifles <e> <s> they will have the detachable magazine on them which was intended for the original cartridge but they are not capable of taking shot cartridges <e> <s> i should have thought that that could have been quite happily classed as a single shotgun and would then come under section of the principal act <e> <s> however i shall not press the point at this stage but i may reconsider it for the next stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the amendment is a non-starter <e> <s> if it is agreed to it could open the door for wide interpretation by individual police constables <e> <s> it is already well known that many interpret the law in widely differing ways <e> <s> the way in which the bill is presently worded is open to misinterpretation <e> <s> if this amendment is agreed to misinterpretation will be a certainty <e>", "<cs> i was about to mention the same point <e> <s> it is perfectly feasible to immobilise a shotgun so to speak by removing the fore-end provided that one first snaps the locks in other words one releases the tumblers inside by pressing the triggers and then one removes the fore-end <e> <s> without the fore-end the action cannot be recocked and as the locks have already been established the gun cannot be fired again without being recocked <e> <s> also there are some guns the noble earl lord swinton mentioned the browning over-and-under and of course there are others such as slide-action self-loading shotguns in which another part of the mechanism such as the belt or breechblock and not just the fore-end must be removed to immobilise the gun <e>", "<cs> yes all guns are not ejectors <e> <s> if a gun is a non-ejector one presses the triggers to snap off the locks before removing the fore-end <e> <s> the fore-end is necessary before recocking the gun so the gun cannot be recocked <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend give an assurance that it is not the governments intention to put a limit on the number of shotguns which can be held by an individual <e> <s> if that is the case will he agree that the wording of this subsection is somewhat vague and should be amended at the next stage <e>", "<cs> does the minister not agree that in its present form the bill is open to misinterpretation particularly by the police who might seek to impose arbitrary limits <e>", "<cs> i spoke on this point on the previous amendment <e> <s> i firmly believe that all doubt should be removed from the bill <e> <s> the clause as it stands is open to misinterpretation especially by some police forces which may wish to impose an arbitrary limit <e> <s> in spite of what my noble friend said they could read this clause as entitlement to impose such an arbitrary limit <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord in his amendment <e> <s> the certificate holder may be resident in a far part of the country perhaps in scotland or wales <e> <s> he is accustomed to buying his shotgun cartridges from a certain dealer in london <e> <s> he likes that brand and will not use any other <e> <s> it is convenient for him to purchase from that dealer <e> <s> it should not be necessary for him to produce the shotgun certificate to that dealer for every purchase that he makes when he may be some miles away <e> <s> he could easily make the order over the telephone having previously satisfied the dealer on another occasion that he is in possession of a valid certificate <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the gun is converted so as to have a barrel of legal length what harm is there in that <e> <s> the owner has complied with the law <e> <s> he has provided himself with a gun with a barrel of legal length <e>", "<cs> this exchange only goes to show what a nonsense clause is <e> <s> once a gun has been fitted with a longer barrel which is permanently fixed and not detachable i cannot see what objection there could be to the owners retaining possession of it in a functional form <e> <s> this underlines the fact that clause really is a nonsense <e> <s> i will not detain your lordships at this late hour <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> how can my noble friend reconcile what he has just said with what the said to the amendment which i moved previously <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord brain who has moved the amendment <e> <s> i should also like to take the opportunity to say one nice thing about the bill that is to welcome what we have in clause <e> <s> making shotgun and firearm certificates renewable on the same date is something for which shooting interests have been pressing for a long time <e> <s> that provision has at last been put into the bill and i welcome it <e> <s> at the same time i feel as does the noble lord lord brain that as little administrative work will be involved in renewing a shotgun certificate at the same time as a firearm certificate the shotgun certificate fee could be remitted altogether <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment arises partly from a popular misconception which has appeared in the press that almost anything can be obtained by mail order <e> <s> that is just not so <e> <s> any transaction by mail order is subject to exactly the same conditions under the firearms act as a transaction over the counter <e> <s> in other words a firearms certificate or as the case may be a shotgun certificate must be produced certainly in the case of a firearms certificate <e> <s> if the amendment were to state that goods should be sent to the address shown on the firearms certificate that would be a safeguard against stolen firearms certificates <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend and i have been speaking to two different points <e> <s> i shall study what he has said <e> <s> perhaps i shall return to the matter at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i was referring to the types of rifle or pistol which might be used on a range <e> <s> my noble friend was concerned with the use by members of a club of that clubs rifles or pistols without a firearms certificate <e> <s> i shall consider whether to return to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of pressing this amendment but i find the concept put forward by the noble lord lord harris that any government are infallible an interesting one <e> <s> governments can and do sometimes make mistakes <e> <s> it is comforting to know that we are dealing with decisions on a national basis made by the secretary of state rather than by a chief constable and one hopes that those criteria would apply throughout the country <e> <s> i am sure that they would do so <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend has not taken on board the substance of this amendment <e> <s> many clubs are quite small affairs which are run very cheaply indeed on an absolute shoestring <e> <s> even if the fee only averages out at a year it is still a consideration that has to be taken into account in the budgeting of the club <e> <s> when put on top of the other expenses that a club may have to pay for its ammunition hire of the range and so forth the sum mounts up very considerably <e> <s> however i do not intend to press this amendment at this stage and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> however well intentioned my noble friends amendment is some ec countries and some other countries do not require any certification for shotguns and sporting firearms <e> <s> people may own them freely <e> <s> therefore it would be difficult for any such visitor to produce written evidence of his authority to possess such a firearm or shotgun <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord ferrers will be able to reassure us on the point <e> <s> a firearm or shotgun certificate for a resident of this country may be varied throughout the country <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to tell us that the same will be true of a visitors permit <e> <s> i am sure that many members of the committee are concerned about the point <e>", "<cs> is it really necessary for the places to be specified <e> <s> can the visitor not just have a blanket permit to shoot on any land over which he has the owners permission to shoot instead of naming every hit of ground over which he wishes to shoot <e>", "<cs> for the avoidance of all doubt would it not be possible for my noble friend to reconsider this matter and if necessary put down an amendment himself at the next stage of the bill along the lines of this amendment in order to make everything absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> it is quite true as he said that visitors from overseas may come to this country for fairly long intervals and for longer than six months in a calendar year <e> <s> it is entirely reasonable that the period of validity for a visitors permit should be months and not six <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend said just now teams from overseas come to participate at bisley and at other events <e> <s> indeed the bisley meeting of the national rifle association is going on right now <e> <s> i have been prevented from taking part today in the first stage of the queens prize because i had to be here <e> <s> that is by the way <e> <s> teams of varying sizes come from overseas and some of them may well have more than members <e> <s> i should prefer not to see a specific number stated <e> <s> the choice of the number is quite arbitrary <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can tell my noble friend the current practice for overseas teams competing at bisley <e> <s> the names are sent in advance to the national rifle associations offices by the governing body in the country concerned <e> <s> all the names of those in the team and details of their rifles together with the serial numbers are sent <e> <s> the administrative work is done at our offices at bisley at no cost to the police <e> <s> when the administrative work and the compiling of details has been completed at bisley the application is passed to the surrey police <e> <s> the permit is then issued straightaway at no charge because there has been no cost to the police <e>", "<cs> i mentioned this point earlier in connection with another amendment <e> <s> it applies also to competitive teams for example at bisley <e> <s> i suggested that my noble friend should say how such circumstances would be dealt with under the bill <e> <s> i mentioned also the question of splitting a team to take part in competitions in different parts of the country <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend replied to that point either <e>", "<cs> i feel that it is all a question of how one reads the amendment <e> <s> it is possibly capable of misinterpretation and that is what i feel has happened in this case <e> <s> i believe it should be interpreted as <e>", "<cs> with great respect to my noble friend lord brain i feel that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i have a clear recollection of the home secretarys announcement on nd september to police officers <e> <s> at that time parliament was not sitting and so that was the only way in which his announcement could have been made public <e> <s> it is quite clear in my recollection that self-loading rifles were specifically mentioned in that statement <e> <s> i have a copy of it at home <e> <s> the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i must support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the basis of compensation already announced is parsimonious beyond belief <e> <s> i doubt whether the home secretary really appreciates how much the owners of these firearms paid for them in the first instance <e> <s> many could have cost anything up <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting my noble friend <e> <s> i did not say that the owner should be <e>", "<cs> the shooting interests regard the consultative committee as of the greatest importance because it could obviate many of the arguments and discussions that have taken place in the past <e> <s> the committee will remember that in the standing committee in another place the amendment to set up this committee was carried against the governments wish <e> <s> at the next stage of the bill in another place the government amended the provisions relating to this committee removed most of its powers and left it relatively toothless <e>", "<cs> it is highly important that this committee shoud be able to exercise some initiative of its own and not deal just with such matters as are referred to it by the secretary of state <e> <s> it is conceivable that at some time in the future a secretary of state may feel that there is a point which might give rise to some embarrassment to him or his department and therefore refrains from referring it to the committee <e> <s> it could be swept under the carpet for ever <e> <s> therefore it is most important that there should be two-way traffic and that the committee should be able to make proposals to the secretary of state on its own initiative <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is highly important and it could lead to much greater uniformity of practice thoughout the country <e> <s> this is one of the biggest problems to bedevil shooting interests in different parts of the country <e> <s> we have discussed this many times with home office officials <e> <s> a chief constable has very wide discretion in his area <e> <s> it is quite understandable that different chief constables apply and interpret the law in widely differing ways <e> <s> that fact is recognised by the home office which says that the chief constable has such discretion <e>", "<cs> if that is the case one might ask why the government did not do precisely that in relation to the proposals in the present bill before the home secretary announced his conclusions in september <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> it may be that it is not perfect in its drafting <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench may wish to accept the principle of the amendment and perhaps let us hope produce a further amendment at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> this is a problem of very long standing <e> <s> most of us have been aware for years that the law is often technically broken in this respect <e> <s> a blind eye is turned to it but it is high time that the law took cognisance of this point and the matter was put right for good <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> again it covers a point that shooting interests have discussed with the home office for a good many years past <e> <s> i can see no reason why this provision should not be put into effect and work perfectly well <e> <s> with improvements in computer record-keeping and communications between different police forces it should be perfectly easy for the police to keep tabs on certificate holders over a period of six instead of three years <e>", "<cs> my noble friend evidently does not like the amendment <e> <s> i shall not take up the time of the committee at this very late hour but it is a point which we are somewhat concerned about because more and more problems arise from time to time where firearms and shotguns are concerned <e> <s> we are approaching a state where we have government by decree <e> <s> i should have thought that parliament ought to have a say in the rules when they are made also although not covered by the amendment a say on the level of fees charged for a certificate <e> <s> however that is another question <e> <s> i shall not take up the committees time and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is one question that i wish to put to my noble friend <e> <s> he may not be able to give an immediate answer <e> <s> i refer to what i believe to be the finest collection of modern weapons in the country the pattern room at the royal ordnance factory enfield dock which is not specifically mentioned in the schedule to the bill <e> <s> it is a highly important collection especially to students of design of military firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> this is one matter upon which i must beg to differ from him <e> <s> he mentioned the question of lethality <e> <s> it is very hard to see whether rifle a is more lethal than rifle b both are equally lethal and i do not believe there is any such thing as degrees of lethality <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend can give me an example of something which is only slightly lethal <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall follow what the noble lord lord monson has said <e> <s> the whole of the bill is founded on last years tragedy at hungerford when people were killed <e> <s> however only about half of them were killed by a self-loading rifle in the hands of a madman <e> <s> i believe that that is the only case on record of the misuse of a self-loading rifle <e> <s> the bill is panic legislation <e> <s> it is based on that one incident of a self-loading rifle in the hands of one who was mentally deranged <e> <s> i am unaware of any other example <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends reply brings back the whole principle of clause of the bill <e> <s> he tried to make out indeed successive government spokesmen have tried to make out that certain weapons are more dangerous or lethal than others <e> <s> i have tried to point out that there is no such thing as different grades of lethality <e> <s> i still believe that a circumstance could arise in which something put on the prohibited list later turns out to have been put there inadvertently unnecessarily or on false premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend <e> <s> there is a limited number of vintage arms of the class that would be included under clause of the bill for which ammunition is no longer made or commercially available <e> <s> it is only a small number <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment because the wording of the bill at present is ambiguous and is open to misinterpretation by a chief constable who might not be so kindly disposed as are some others <e> <s> i believe it is very desirable that when the bill emerges in its final form it should be quite clear on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords several points have been raised in connection with this amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will feel inclined to take note of them and not press the amendment at this stage but bring it back at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords at present there are a number of people who have firearms dealers licences for example because they collect firearms or carry out repairs to firearms for other people perhaps for their friends without being a professional dealer or professional gunsmith <e> <s> those are the kinds of people whom i have in mind <e> <s> i hope that answers my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am entirely satisfied with my noble friends reply <e> <s> he must be aware as my noble friend lord burton mentioned that for example in the north of scotland a number of small shops in country areas such as the village ironmonger do a very useful trade with the local residents in firearms and ammunition as a sideline to their normal business <e>", "<cs> my lords there is so much in legislation which is left to the discretion of the courts that it is quite appalling that parliament is so deliberately vague from time to time <e> <s> we always pass the buck to the courts to decide in the long run <e> <s> however after what my noble friend has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> under the act sale or purchase by mail order or over the counter is subject to the same rules <e> <s> the rules apply to all cases including mail order <e> <s> many people are wrongly under the impression that one can write to a firm advertising in a magazine order what one likes and get it <e> <s> one cannot <e> <s> it is subject to the same procedure whether for firearms or for shotguns <e> <s> my noble friend lord mountgarret mentioned crossbows <e> <s> they are not firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of this clause <e> <s> however it seems a little illogical to me <e> <s> if the visitor is properly vouched for by a responsible resident of this country and if he can bring with him a firearm and ammunition if he is accepted as a responsible person i really see no reason why he should not also be permitted to buy firearms as well as ammunition <e> <s> however i shall not pursue the point at this late hour and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather disappointed with my noble friends reply <e> <s> it has always been an axiom of the law in this country that it should apply equally to all sections of the community <e> <s> in this case i believe strongly that it should apply to the dealer as well as to the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support this amendment because the level of compensation proposed is quite inadequate <e> <s> i have spoken to a n umber of owners of the class of rifles which stand to be prohibited under the bill and many have told me that their firearms cost considerable sums of money <e> <s> they have had them improved in various ways by having new barrels fitted and so on <e> <s> their present value bears no relation to the retail value of that make of firearm <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is talking about per cent <e> <s> of the off-the-shelf price <e>", "<cs> my lords with the houses permission i should like to ask a question for clarification <e> <s> the noble earl was basing his calculations on the off-the-shelf price <e> <s> in cases such as the ones i mentioned a few minutes ago where people have spent a considerable amount of money on improving their firearm so that the value of it bears no relation to the off-the-shelf price what criteria would he apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment strongly <e> <s> i wish to remind your lordships of the history of the clause which did not appear in the bill as originally laid before parliament but was inserted in committee in another place against government opposition <e> <s> on report the provisions of the clause were rather watered down by the government <e> <s> some of us i believe would like to see it restored to something like its original form <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has dealt far more ably than i could with the safeguards that are built into it both from the point of view of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> the present form of subsection is very unsatisfactory <e> <s> it suggests that the committee in five years time might be allowed to waste away and wither on the vine because the secretary of state perhaps has not given it any work to do with that very object in mind <e> <s> the committee could perform a very useful function and it is most important that it should be allowed to continue in being on some other terms than are mentioned in this subsection <e> <s> i should be quite happy to go along with the noble lord lord monson in suggesting it should he left out altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> this subject has been a point of discussion between shooting interests and the home office for a long time <e> <s> the fees for firearm and shotgun certificates have now reached the pitch where they become quite a burden on the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised at my noble friends reply <e> <s> i am disappointed that he has not seen his way to accepting the amendment <e> <s> as he says this could apply just as well to someone who is sent abroad on business <e> <s> the amendment was framed to keep things simple and to underline the fact that such a person would be going abroad in the service of his country as a member of her majestys forces or in the foreign service <e> <s> as my noble friend rightly says the same principle could be applied to a person who goes abroad in the course of business <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press the point but my noble friends reply has not changed my views about the procedure used <e> <s> i shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> he pointed out that i may be legislating for something that does not exist <e> <s> however clause of the bill does that very thing it legislates for things that do not already exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the reply which i more or less expected from my noble friend <e> <s> one point he raised which he has mentioned to me before in conversation is the question of taking away the rifle and ammunition <e> <s> i have never mentioned that <e> <s> i have only referred to a person having it in his possession on a range <e> <s> i would never advise a person that he was entitled to take a rifle or ammunition home with him but only to have it in his possession on the range for the purposes of using it then and there <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support to this amendment <e> <s> the present law under the act and now this bill can only be described as a nasty sticky mess <e> <s> the law is full of anomalies and the more that can be done to tidy it up the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i think perhaps he has not fully taken into account the meaning of amendments nos <e> <s> and read together <e> <s> if both those amendments are accepted the subsection will have the effect which i mentioned earlier <e> <s> nevertheless i do not intend to pursue the amendment further and beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful once more to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> if the relevant part of this bill comes into effect at an early stage after the passing of the bill i shall be perfectly satisfied and so i hope will my noble friends and colleagues <e> <s> on that understanding i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not keep your lordships long i certainly have no intention of making a second reading speech <e> <s> we now come to the final stage of what i describe as a sorry and unnecessary bill <e> <s> at the same time discussion has cut across party boundaries and led to a free exchange of comments and opinions across the floor of the house something at which your lordships house excels when it has the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by my noble friends reply because the information that i have obtained indicates that police forces throughout the country are taking on additional staff greatly in excess of the estimate of additional staff which was foreshadowed at the time the act was introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords further to my noble friends reply there is an uncomfortable feeling that this increase in bureaucracy for want of a better word will lead to a further swingeing increase in the fees for shotgun certificates <e> <s> can he confirm or deny that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> having spoken to the author of the article i am sure that a great deal more might have been said than appeared in the article <e> <s> will the government consider a licensing scheme for these intensive units and a scheme for better training of the stockmen involved <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government been made aware of the so-called family pig system which has been developed at the school of agriculture in edinburgh which appears to be a very much more humane way of keeping pigs <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that i have no intention of pressing my motion <e> <s> but before i withdraw it perhaps i may make one or two points <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord kimball who is chairman of the firearms consultative committee for what he said about the work of the committee <e> <s> he told us that the committee is in the middle of deliberations on fees as well as on other matters <e> <s> that makes one wonder all the more why the government did not wait until those deliberations were concluded before they acted by laying the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all grateful to the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton for introducing this debate and also to my noble friend lord middleton for his contribution in a slightly different field <e>"]
