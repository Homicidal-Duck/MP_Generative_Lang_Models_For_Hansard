["<cs> my lords i should like to begin if i may with a brief reference to the electoral system <e> <s> the house will not be surprised to learn that we on these benches regret that there is no reference in the gracious speech to electoral reform <e> <s> we have made it clear in the course of this debate that we wish the government well in the very difficult tasks which face them <e> <s> nevertheless we feel that it is important to emphasise that they have secured a majority of the seats in another place on a minority of the votes per cent <e> <s> of the votes cast one-third of the total electorate <e> <s> more people in fact voted against conservative <e>", "<cs> my lords at the conclusion of this debate i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in it <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl lord ferrers that this has been a useful and interesting debate and i have listened with great interest to all that has been said <e> <s> if i have been a little disappointed at what has appeared to be the majority view i am not in the least surprised <e> <s> at this stage i must not attempt to answer the various individual points that have been made much as i should like to do so <e> <s> but perhaps i might be permitted a few very brief general comments <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful debate today not the least notable feature of which has been the opportunity to listen to the four maiden speakers <e> <s> four maiden speeches each so different yet each so full of interest and instruction <e> <s> attention has rightly been focused this afternoon on the soviet military build-up and the noble lord lord hill-norton told us to analyse the threat <e> <s> we must certainly do that and we cannot ignore all the different factors which have been brought out during the debate about the soviet build-up the superiority in conventional weapons particularly tanks the amount of money being spent by the soviet union per cent <e> <s> of gross national product per annum the increase each year in the amount spent the improvement in the quality of the armaments which the soviet union possesses so that the superiority of nato is gradually being eroded the improvement in land and air mobility so that there is a soviet capacity to launch an attack without having to reinforce it beforehand the change in the character of the soviet air arm from a role that was essentially defensive to one that is now offensive and there is the build-up in the navy and the merchant navy <e> <s> these things we have to see in the context of the soviet global <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart for adding to his previous remarks although what he has added does not seem to me to make any difference to their substance <e> <s> the point that i am making about what he said is that it is not just a question of trusting the russians because we know that they do not always observe the treaties into which they enter <e> <s> therefore it is essential to have verification and that is one of the features of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for asking this important question this evening <e> <s> for a long time those who have a moral concern for the impoverished peoples of the third world to whom the noble lord referred so movingly have followed these unctad meetings with attention and anxiety <e> <s> but now that it is clear we are faced with a world energy crisis and a world recession more and more people are coming to realise that north-south relations are relevant to that as well and that they are bound up with the whole question of markets <e> <s> indeed the noble lord referred to this in his speech <e> <s> so added to the proper moral concern there is a growing enlightened self-interest <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran i should like to comment briefly on the order <e> <s> we on these benches regret that we should be faced with this order today <e> <s> we supported the wales bill although we were critical of its provisions because we have long been committed to the concept of a parliament for wales and we felt that the bill was a very modest step on the road to devolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for making the statement this afternoon <e> <s> certainly we on these benches regret the situation which has made this statement necessary <e> <s> we are glad that the government have offered arbitration and have agreed to abide by the ruling of the arbitration tribunal <e> <s> we wonder whether there has been any response at all from the union to this offer whether it has actually rejected it or whether it has just ignored it <e> <s> at any rate we hope that the offer will be accepted in due course and that the dispute will be satisfactorily settled very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government press for early agreement in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord for his very clear explanation of the purpose of the order and of how it fits into the working of the new pensions scheme <e> <s> i suppose that the only argument that could arise would be over the actual figure given for the increase in earnings but the noble lord has explained and the explanatory memorandum has set out how the government arrived at this figure and i do not think there can be any quarrel with that <e> <s> however i wonder whether there is any way in which the government might take steps to make the whole procedure better known and better understood by potential beneficiaries <e> <s> of course per cent <e> <s> is a high figure and in passing i would draw attention to the burden which such a rate of increase must be imposing on the funding of final salary occupational schemes <e> <s> the figure reflects inflation whether it runs behind or ahead of prices and one is bound to speculate gloomily about the figure which will appear in a similar order next year <e> <s> however so far as the present order is concerned we on these benches are content that it should receive the approval of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a brief word to what has been said by other noble lords <e> <s> i had not intended to intervene in the debate but i have listened carefully to what has been said by the noble earl lord kinnoull and the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in thanking the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for his very clear explanation of the purpose of the orders <e> <s> as he explained they are the usual annual up-rating orders covering national insurance supplementary benefit and family income supplement <e> <s> they have been described elsewhere as the biggest cash increases ever <e> <s> but i think one can say without any hostility that that is no particular credit to the government because the government are merely performing their statutory duty to increase the long-term benefits in line with increases in prices or earnings whichever are the higher and the short-term benefits in line with increases in prices <e> <s> the size of the increases is really a measure of inflation and of the failure of successive governments to control it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord for his very careful explanation of the regulations <e> <s> he has made it very clear that since the introduction of the act students going straight from school to higher education because under that act they are given more generous starting credits than previously and due to the working of the -week rule can claim unemployment benefit during all vacations of a -year course this being based on only a few weeks actual employment <e> <s> as the noble lord has said that was never the intention and he has indicated that it caused concern to the previous government as well as the present government and it led to the previous government putting forward the suggestion that all students should be debarred from receiving unemployment benefit in the short vacation <e> <s> the national insurance advisory committee recommended against that suggestion <e> <s> then came the proposal from the last government in similar terms to that before us this afternoon requiring a longer term of employment in effect and not affecting mature students a regulation which would apply only to the short vacations <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord cullen for his explanation of this order <e> <s> we on these benches warmly welcome the increase in the addition paid for the first child in a one-parent family from to <e> <s> this is a substantial increase and we recognise that <e> <s> nevertheless we share with the noble lord lord wells-pestell regret that the government have not at the same time increased the child benefit for all children <e> <s> this would have helped one-parent families further and would have helped larger families proportionately <e> <s> it would also have helped all the poorest families and while a high percentage of one-parent families are among the poorest the number of the poorest families who are one-parent families is about per cent <e> <s> so that there is nothing done for the per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful to the noble lord for his clear explanation both of the need for these regulations and of their nature <e> <s> on tuesday we dealt with an additional qualifying condition for students in respect of unemployment benefit and here we are dealing with additional qualifying conditions for seasonal workers <e> <s> however as i understand it these regulations introduce no new condition they merely continue the original regulations <e> <s> therefore the purpose of the regulations is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell has given us an early opportunity to debate the effect of the governments policies on the family <e> <s> i am certainly grateful to him for that and grateful to him for giving us the opportunity of listening to the three maiden speakers to whose contributions we look forward later this afternoon <e> <s> it must have been a pleasant change for the noble lord lord wells-pestell to make the kind of speech which he made this afternoon instead of standing at the box on the other side of the house and telling us with equal passion why there was no money to carry out the various reforms which were being pressed upon him by members of your lordships house <e> <s> nevertheless i agreed with a great deal that he said and certainly i share his concern about the course now being pursued by the government and the effect it will have on families <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the two noble lords who have already spoken in expressing the hope that the noble lord lord brockway will soon be restored to full health and to his place in this house <e> <s> i should like also to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his very clear explanation of the purpose of this order even although like the noble lord lord hatch i am unable to approve that purpose <e> <s> it seems to me that this order is an example of one of the least satisfactory characteristics of british politics at the present time <e> <s> it is an example of the way in which an incoming government undoes the work of its predecessor <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord cullen for his very clear explanation of these regulations and the order <e> <s> i think that if the noble lord lord wells-pestell and i had had a meeting before this short debate we might not have found it so easy to agree because i wanted to say a word about the one that he picked on the family income supplements computation no regulations <e> <s> perhaps i can say a brief word about the others before i do so <e> <s> the social security benefits up-rating amendment order is necessary to bring about the situation which we thought had been brought about by the previous order and we debated the issue at that time <e> <s> that order i am sure is acceptable to the house <e> <s> it is clear too that the second order is required because a widows late husband over and not retired at the time of death would have no earnings factor because no contributions were payable after and it would not be possible to calculate an earnings-related addition in relation to contributions <e> <s> as a result actual earnings are to be used <e> <s> again i am sure that that is a very non-controversial proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly it was not that i was objecting to the word person but the text just said he in the two places to which i referred <e> <s> i felt it should say he or she because it was as i understand it referring to a man or a woman <e> <s> further down in the order that distinction is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by apologising to the house for the fact that owing to a long-standing engagement i shall have to leave before the debate comes to an end <e> <s> i hope the house will forgive me <e> <s> when i undertook to speak in this debate i thought it was going to take place yesterday as indeed was the original intention <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that if multi-member constituencies were in use it would be possible to adjust the number of members in order to take account of the electorate in each constituency and thus avoid the unfairness to which the question refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for his clear exposition of both the purpose behind the bill and the background to it <e> <s> the sentiments which he expressed and those expressed by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts about greek accession will i am sure find an echo throughout the whole house <e> <s> as we welcome the bill we naturally recall the links over the years between the british and greek people for example the part played by byron in the struggle for greek independence <e> <s> and perhaps it is appropriate that someone from these benches should say a word of welcome for the bill because in this month of november we celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of gladstones great midlothian campaign and glad <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for his careful explanation of this order and of the effect of the social security contributions earnings limits amendment regulations <e> <s> the raising of the lower and upper limits to which he referred is of course the inevitable consequence of inflation and we are becoming used to it as an annual exercise <e> <s> i regret that it has been found necessary to increase the class primary and secondary contributions by per cent <e> <s> each but i think it is clear from the report of the government actuary that this is due to the high level of unemployment which he has been instructed to assume and that is another indication of the unhappy economic circumstances with which we are faced <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord belstead for his explanation of the regulations and i wish briefly to say that we on these benches fully support the three sets of regulations <e> <s> the represention of the people armed forces bill hl <e> <s> which was introduced into this house by my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran would have allowed service spouses to choose whether or not to be registered as service voters and so would have gone part of the way to doing what these regulations will do <e> <s> as the noble lord lord belstead has indicated my noble friend will next week be sponsoring another bill in place of that one but i am glad that these regulations cover that part of the bill which he originally introduced <e> <s> he introduced that bill because of the great <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in thanking the noble lord for this careful explanation of these regulations <e> <s> i welcome the extension of the child benefit increase to persons bringing up children who are not their own <e> <s> i also welcome the removal of the anomaly whereby people in receipt of benefit lower than the child benefit increase were excluded <e> <s> we on these benches find these regulations to be non-controversial and unexceptionable and i am happy to support their passage through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord strabolgi for drawing our attention this afternoon to this very important matter <e> <s> the increase in domestic gas and electricity prices are as noble lords have already said massive <e> <s> increases of per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively are alarming <e> <s> they are even more alarming when one thinks of them in the context of what is happening elsewhere when one realises that they come on top of an inflation rate already at per cent <e> <s> when they come on top of a steep increase in mortgage interest when they come on top of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his very thorough explanation of the purpose of the order as he made clear it implements so far as the united kingdom is concerned nine of the agreements concluded in the tokyo round of negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade <e> <s> some nations took part in those negotiations and we on these benches welcome the fact that at last we have reached this final stage <e> <s> as the noble lord said the negotiations began six years ago <e> <s> they have passed through various vicissitudes and have been subject to much delay but it is encouraging to have an agreement liberalising trade concluded at a time when there is so much talk of a relapse into protectionism in the face of a worldwide recession <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that it is the intention of the government to phase out the earnings rule during the lifetime of this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is undoubtedly indebted to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for initiating this debate this afternoon and also for giving us the opportunity to listen with such appreciation to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord holderness <e> <s> as i am speaking so late in the debate and after so many distinguished speakers it is very difficult for me to say anything fresh <e> <s> however listening to the debate today i was very vividly reminded of when immediately after the war i was involved in the military government in trieste <e> <s> at that time there were many communist demonstrations in trieste <e> <s> people used to come in from the yugoslav military government area alongside communist demonstrators complete with their red flags <e> <s> they came in by sea a great fleet of them <e> <s> at that time we had no idea that yugoslavia would become the kind of non-aligned power which the noble lord lord hankey described a few minutes ago <e> <s> at that time yugoslavia was lined up with the cominform and seemed to us to be part of the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord spens for drawing our attention once again to this unresolved and unhappy situation in cyprus not least because it will enable us to have the opportunity to listen to the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady jeger <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord simon explained our general attitude to this bill and in the course of doing so spoke about the assisted places scheme and our attitude to that so i hope that the noble lord lord james who has just been talking so interestingly about that subject will forgive me if i do not follow him but confine my remarks to the provisions in the bill relating to school meals school transport and free milk <e> <s> as we have heard this afternoon the government are reducing or removing the statutory obligations on local authorities with regard to all three <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord for repeating this statement made in another place <e> <s> there would appear to be two inter-related but separate issues here first the dispute between the secretary of state and the area health authority over the cuts in expenditure and secondly the legality of the action taken by the secretary of state when faced with this confrontation <e> <s> today as i understand it we are concerned with the second of those issues and i should like to put these questions to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady young for the very careful and thorough explanation of the bill which was given to us <e> <s> it is as she said the first of two bills giving effect to the governments proposals in the field of social security <e> <s> the bills are remarkable in that they both contain provisions designed to reduce the value of benefits below that which they would otherwise have attained <e> <s> the no <e> <s> bill ends the automatic uprating of short-term benefits which must mean that those benefits will in future decline and we have what has happened to the death grant as an awful warning <e> <s> the no <e> <s> bill also provides for the reduction and the eventual abolition of the earnings-related supplement to short-term benefits <e> <s> this bill as the noble baroness explained ends the provision whereby long-term benefits including pensions are increased in line with increases in earnings or prices whichever are the higher <e> <s> in future these benefits will be increased only in line with prices <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord byers has certainly provoked a fascinating debate today and no part of it was more fascinating than the notable and courageous speech of the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> i should like to say something about the basic economic <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which has just been moved by the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> i do not think that the case has really been made out for abandoning the present formula <e> <s> if there is no link with earnings as is now proposed and if there is an increase in the standard of living through earnings rising faster than prices pensioners and others on long-term benefits will be left behind they will <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister said i wish to add a comment to what i said earlier <e> <s> she said the last government broke the link with earnings as if that were some argument against having a link in the future <e> <s> it is just as easy to break a link with prices as it is to break a link with earnings and we have no guarantee so far as that is concerned that the present government might not find some way to break the link with prices <e> <s> governments may not stick to what they are supposed to do but we are trying to decide this afternoon what they are supposed to do <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that if the link with pensions is not maintained in practice fully pensioners must be worse off than under the present formula <e>", "<cs> may i make one quick point before we finish our debate on this particular matter <e> <s> what i have to say is in reply to something that the noble baroness said <e> <s> when answering the point that i raised about the cost of the ratchet effect she quoted part of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the bill <e>", "<cs> i support the principle in this amendment <e> <s> unless there is some technical objection to it which has not occurred to me as yet i shall be inclined to support it completely <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell has explained that the date gets earlier each year at the present time and that the government are proposing to overcome that by allowing the date to go back as far as the end of the th month which could mean a very considerable loss to people who had to wait for their increase for something like a fortnight <e> <s> this amendment as i understand it would prevent that and would also overcome the objection to the way things are working at the present time <e>", "<cs> am i not right in thinking that what the government are saying in the bill is that the date must be not later than the last day of the month and we normally think in terms of november and that this amendment would make it not later than the st <e> <s> would that not still leave the necessary flexibility to deal with mondays <e>", "<cs> this problem arises through having a period of reference which is half in the past and half in the future <e> <s> this came about during the time of the last government <e> <s> many of us objected to it at the time and felt that it was an unsatisfactory arrangement to have six months of record to go by and another six months to guess at when you are working out what the increase should be <e> <s> it can obviously mean that the guess can be wrong and if the guess is wrong then it is only right that it should be made good <e> <s> had the old system been maintained that situation could not have arisen <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness had been prepared to say that the pledge stood that the earnings rule would be abolished within the lifetime of this parliament then i should have felt inclined to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> even if she had responded positively to the suggestion of the noble lord lord wells-pestell i think i <e>", "<cs> the question one must ask is whether it is the intention of the government that these benefits should continue to decrease in value <e> <s> are they saying that we do not need a maternity grant and a death grant <e> <s> they should come clean with the committee if i may use that expression otherwise it is quite absurd in my view for them to say it will cost extra money in a time of inflation to keep benefits at the same real value <e> <s> that we know <e> <s> that must happen <e> <s> but are they saying that these benefits are ones which they no longer regard as being of any importance and that they can be allowed to dwindle right away <e> <s> surely <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for what he said about the amendment <e> <s> he said that it was a modest amendment and it is a <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has referred to the proposal in the no <e> <s> bill to increase the short-term benefits by per cent <e> <s> less than would be necessary to restore their value and she described it as an interim step to bringing them into taxation <e> <s> but it is purely arbitrary is it not <e> <s> and some people will be penalised who would not be liable to tax at all <e> <s> i wonder if the noble baroness can say whether it will be the intention to make up that per cent <e> <s> once the benefits are brought into taxation for otherwise some people at the very bottom of the scale will be penalised unfairly <e>", "<cs> it certainly seems that the formula which the noble lord lord wells-pestell has suggested is a neater one than that at present in use and it might well be considered as a substitute for it for the reasons which he very clearly put forward <e> <s> i too regret the proposed abolition of the earnings-related supplement <e> <s> the philosophy of the earnings-related supplement is that national insurance is not only a means of averting extreme poverty though it certainly is that but is a means of cushioning the fall in earnings which people suffer when they suddenly become unemployed or sick and when their commitments have been entered into on the assumption that their earnings would continue and be able to take care of them <e> <s> they then find that that is not so and for a period the earnings-related supplement acts as a cushion <e>", "<cs> this opening up of a gap between the invalidity pension and the retirement pension certainly seems to be a matter to which we should give serious thought <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has explained that the government are contemplating the application of the per cent <e> <s> reduction to invalidity pension because it is not taxed but what they are proposing to do will have the effect that the retirement pensioner not paying tax will get more than the invalidity pensioner not paying tax whereas until now these rates have been the same <e> <s> this seems to be a move in the wrong direction and one would want to know precisely what are the reasons which have caused the government to propose this course of action <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the proposed up-rating on the part of the government as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has made clear is not really enough to take account of inflation and the figure of is a more accurate attempt to reflect that than the and amendment no <e> <s> would put it at that figure <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would then maintain its value in terms related to earnings thereafter <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that the committee has turned down the more modest proposal which i put forward earlier that the present value of the maternity grant should not be allowed to fall further i am not too hopeful about the prospects for this amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i should like again to express my support for it and for the increase in the maternity grant which it would provide an increase in a benefit which as the noble baroness has explained has been allowed to decline in value over the years <e>", "<cs> i take rather a different view on this matter from that taken by the noble lord lord wells-pestell though i agree with him on some things <e> <s> i agree very strongly with him about the value of the work that has been done over the years by the supplementary benefits commission and indeed i said so on second reading <e> <s> i share some of his apprehensions about how the new arrangement will work <e>", "<cs> i too am sympathetic to this amendment <e> <s> i see the dilemma we are in <e> <s> the object of the bill is to reduce discretion <e> <s> one can see why that must be done <e> <s> if we are to continue to have on supplementary benefit the large numbers that we have on it at present in the absence of any measures which will take a large number of those people off supplementary benefit some restriction of discretion would appear unfortunately to he inevitable <e> <s> but even so it seems that there should be some final opportunity to deal with a case which it may not be possible to categorise in any of the prescribed categories <e>", "<cs> the annual reports of the supplementary benefits commission have been of extreme value and they have reviewed the whole operation of the supplementary benefits system <e> <s> even although a great deal everything if you like almost everything is going to be laid down in the bill that still does not get rid of the need for monitoring how that <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to say a word in support of this amendment <e> <s> the governments schemes for helping with fuel have ensured that those who are helped get rather more than was the case before <e> <s> but they are available to a much more restricted number of people and there are many people as the noble lord has just explained who your lordships might well consider ought to be assisted and who are left just outside <e> <s> this amendment would certainly help some of them and for that reason i support it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for the detailed reply that he gave <e> <s> i did not find it altogether satisfactory and i think what has been said by my noble friend lord evans of claughton has made it very clear that there is another side to this case <e> <s> the point which has to be taken into account is the changed situation in which local authorities find themselves and the extra burdens which are now being put upon them as a direct result of government policy <e> <s> in the light of that change i think it is reasonable to take the line that my noble friend has taken and to support this amendment <e> <s> for that reason i should like to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i very much regret the decision which the minister has just announced <e> <s> we are talking here about equity and fairness <e> <s> if the long-term rate is a certain figure for everyone else it seems to be completely wrong that it should be less for the longterm unemployed <e> <s> the amount of million is of course a large sum of money <e> <s> it is not so large a sum of money when we consider that the total social security bill is million <e> <s> i should have thought that within that total it should be possible to ensure that the long-term unemployed are treated fairly and on an equal basis with other long-term beneficiaries <e>", "<cs> one suggestion as to where some of the money might come from would be if we did not have a ceiling on national insurance contributions <e> <s> that is a point which the noble lord might consider <e> <s> at the moment after we reach the top limit on contributions contributions become a decreasing percentage of the income of the contributor <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> in the course of her remarks she has said that the abatement of the short-term benefits by per cent <e> <s> is to be an interim measure <e> <s> does that mean that the short-term benefit and supplementary benefit will be realigned once the benefits are brought into taxation <e>", "<cs> in that case it might be a short-term measure which might have a long-term effect because if the difference is to carry on even though the benefits are taxable the effect of what is done next year will continue right into the future unless some specific steps are then taken to realign benefits <e> <s> it was on that point that i was really seeking some elucidation but the noble baroness does not feel able to give it <e>", "<cs> i should like just to add a brief word to what the noble lord lord wells-pestell has said <e> <s> we on these benches attach a great deal of importance to the role which this new committee will play <e> <s> i said at an earlier stage of the committee proceedings that we supported the setting up of this committee covering the whole field of social security and not just supplementary benefit but i also said it had to be a powerful and independent body <e> <s> i think that is worth stressing and i agree wholeheartedly with what the noble lord lord wells-pestell has said about the importance of this body being able to make suggestions about future legislation without necessarily any prompting by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i should like to express sympathy for this amendment <e> <s> there is certainly a need for someone to guide claimants through the maze of benefits which our highly complicated system provides family income supplement child benefit national insurance supplementary benefits <e> <s> the noble baroness has reminded us that this is just what lord beveridge envisaged as long ago as <e> <s> it would i am sure relieve the pressure on social workers which was one of the things that he wanted to achieve <e> <s> i understand the point raised by the noble lord lord wells-pestell about the question of independence <e> <s> but i think this has to be an official organisation that the noble baroness has in mind that it cannot be confused with independent organisations outside the system <e> <s> they will continue to have a completely outside and independent role to play <e> <s> therefore it is going to he necessary for this particular service to be provided within the social security office to enable the individual who comes in the potential claimant to feel that this is a section of that office to which he or she <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i did not find it in some of its aspects very illuminating <e> <s> i am not clear yet whether or not there is a green paper likely to be produced on this subject which was the question that i asked <e> <s> as i made clear and as the noble lord made clear this particular amendment does not call for a green paper though i want the information to be available <e> <s> the noble lord has told us that some research is going on in this field but it only relates to part of the area covered by this amendment <e> <s> it relates to families of handicapped children <e>

investigation into that and a report it need only be an interim one presented in a years time <e> <s> i do not see why that should not be done and why that should not be included in the bill <e> <s>

discussion which we have just had on this important proposition <e> <s> perhaps i could begin by referring to the point that was raised by the noble baroness lady trumpineon who wanted words to be altered in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords we return now to the subject of the tokyo round <e> <s> this is a subject which we debated in this house on st january when we discussed the order ratifying nine of the agreements associated with the tokyo round and when we discussed also the white paper on the negotiations <e> <s> but the house is indebted to the european committee for the report which

forward in the report <e> <s> we now have much additional background information and some very valuable comment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support very briefly the amendment which has just been moved

seems to suggest that he is perfectly right to call for any variation of this kind to be referred as the amendment would have it to the advisory committee and i hope the government will give very careful consideration to what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank those noble lords who have supported this amendment the noble baroness lady vickers the noble lord lord gisborough and the noble and learned lord lord gardiner <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy while not altogether unsympathetic to the purpose of the amendment wanted something which would go rather further and he mentioned the problems which had been encountered in setting up the framework for this particular provision <e> <s> i have no doubt there were problems but we now have the framework and so far as i am aware the framework is not proving difficult to operate and i see no reason why that established framework should not be extended to this particular group <e>", "<cs> my lords by the leave of the house may i say in reply to that point that we know the number of those who have taken up the option which is now available to those who are taxpayers <e> <s> i believe that is something like <e> <s> it is unlikely that those who are non-taxpayers would be so out of balance with that particular number as the noble baroness suggests <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are

proposals have been discussed in the security council and that there they were vetoed <e> <s> will it really help to go again and secure another veto <e> <s> it has been suggested that there might possibly be a use of the unity for peace procedure through the general assembly of the united nations <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out drawbacks in connection with <e>", "<cs> my

with the request by father lini for a state of emergency to be declared <e> <s> i take it that there has been a united response to that by the french and united kingdom resident commissioners <e> <s> it has indeed been rather worrying in recent days that the impression has been created of some degree of disunity between the french and the british with the french perhaps leaning more towards continued negotiation than the british <e> <s> i say that that impression has been created i do not say that it is the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord the foreign secretary for making this statement this afternoon <e> <s> when a statement on this matter was repeated in the house on friday of last week i asked for an assurance that the british and the french were in agreement on how to deal with the situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne was reassuring <e> <s> he said that the british and the french were in the closest touch and in answer to the noble lord lord leatherland he said that that meant in the closest agreement <e> <s> yet events over the weekend as the statement has made clear have shown that the concern expressed in this house on friday was justified <e> <s> it became clear that the french did not agree with the dispatch of the royal marine commandos and that the withdrawal of the gendarmes was not purely coincidental

have done so <e> <s> if that had been done then they would have become immediately subject to tax <e> <s> and in two or three years time the benefits would have been uprated in the interim in line

commitment in this amendment yet they now say that because they are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that explanation and i am sorry if i missed that point when she replied to the noble lord <e> <s> at any rate it is a considerable number of people whichever way we calculate it who are affected and who get what the noble baroness called rough justice <e> <s> i certainly think it is rough i am not quite so sure about the justice <e> <s> well i am sure that there is not really any justice in it <e> <s> we know that there is a possibility that the value of the invalidity pension may be restored when it becomes liable to tax but this is subject to the availability of resources and we cannot be certain that in fact that loss through the abatement during the interim period will ever be made good <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount lord ingleby and the noble lord lord wallace of coslany for their support of the amendment <e> <s> i regret that the noble baroness lady young has not found it possible to support this series of amendments though i did not think she would because we are not really arguing in this committee stage as we so often are in

pursuing them but for the fact that they think the economic situation demands it <e> <s> the difference between the two sides of the committee on this matter is not a question of which is the best way of dealing with the problem of the disabled it is a division as to whether it really is necessary given the economic difficulties to save million from the benefits which are given to the disabled

is the same in <e>", "<cs> before we finally leave this subject of the earnings-related supplement i should like to return to the argument which the noble lord lord sandys has pursued in the course of

lord lord wells-pestell said about the number of strikers who claim supplementary benefit <e> <s> i believe that the figure for all strikes is somewhere around per cent <e> <s> it is as low as that

that we should not penalise people for exercising a right <e> <s> i did not say that we were preventing them from exercising the right <e> <s> i said that we should not penalise them for exercising a right and that that is what this clause does <e> <s> does the noble baroness not agree that that is so <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble viscount lord ingleby and the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood for the support they gave to the amendment and i thank the noble viscount in particular for correcting me in describing the investigation which is at present going on i think i described it as being into the position of handicapped people with families whereas of course it is as he said an inquiry into the position of families with handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for his very comprehensive summary of the provisions of the second lom convention <e> <s> when we debated the first lom convention in this house on th november i said at that time that it was a valuable experiment of great significance and i think we can say today that it has been a successful experiment <e> <s> the fact that acp countries have sought to renew it is

what is the argument in favour of not making good shortfalls <e> <s> if one has made an estimate and it is ones intention to get the estimate correct and then to link the benefit to it and that estimate proves to be wrong what is the argument in favour of not making good the shortfall <e> <s> surely the only argument can be that the government are saving money <e> <s> but then one is bound to ask this <e> <s> is there anything which the government would not do in order to make savings <e> <s> that in itself surely is not a good enough argument <e> <s> there must be another one <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i should have asked the permission of the house and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very strongly with the view of the noble lord lord underhill that this is not a party political point <e> <s> i think this is a matter which concerns people in all parts of the house because as the noble baroness lady masham said they appreciate that inflation has hit the disabled particularly hard with the extra expenses that disablement brings <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young has made a great point about the resources being available but although she put forward her argument extremely lucidly i do not think really she succeeded in dealing with the point which was raised by my noble friend lord simon <e> <s> after all the whole bill saves only million and the noble baroness herself has told us that million is what is spent altogether on social security <e> <s> to suggest that it is necessary to leave out of legislation this particular commitment in order to meet an emergency situation or a potential emergency situation seems to me to be exaggerating beyond reason the point which she is making <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been pointed out that this bill results in an increased severity so far as the earnings rule is concerned and in that sense it moves in the opposite direction from the governments originally stated purpose of phasing out the earnings rule during the lifetime of this parliament <e> <s> i was very interested indeed to hear the noble lord say that the government hoped to increase the earnings limit next year <e> <s> does the noble lord mean that they hope next year to begin the phasing out or does he merely mean that over the next year they will as they are not doing this year maintain the real value of the limit as it now stands after the effect of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter speaking about earnings-related supplement suggested and one can see a good deal in this argument that it was helping people rather better off than those who were suffering the most from unemployment <e> <s> but i think he would agree that there is a top limit it is not an earnings-related benefit which goes right up the scale <e> <s> you do not have to be earning a princely income in order to get the full amount of the earnings-related supplement <e> <s> it is designed to help with the sudden reduction in income and the continuing commitments which can place some people not necessarily those at the bottom of the income scale in an extremely difficult position <e> <s> one wonders if we are going to remove earnings-related benefit or indeed any benefits or reduce them whether there ought not also to be reductions in contributions <e> <s> that i think would frustrate the governments intention because as i understand it the intention is to accumulate funds in the national insurance fund <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be the case following on from what the noble lord lord drumalbyn has just been saying that the clause would still refer to urgent cases <e> <s> so it would not be taking it out of the sphere of urgent cases if i have understood it correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> is she <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his detailed reply to the amendment which he delivered at some considerable speed no doubt because of the lateness of the hour and it will take some reading to follow all the points that he made <e> <s> i

should like to thank the noble baroness for the very comprehensive and clear explanation of the nature and purpose of these seven orders which she has given to us <e> <s> we arc as she said trying to cover a great deal of ground in one debate and while it is true that we have discussed much of the background to these orders in the debates which have taken place on the two social security bills which have been through this house nevertheless i cannot help feeling that the supplementary benefit regulations will require a more detailed scrutiny than we shall be able to give them today <e> <s> so far as the pensioners lump sum payments order is concerned i do not propose to say anything about that because my noble friend lord grey intends to say a word about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his explanation of the new government amendment and also for his kind reference to myself <e> <s> i should like also to thank the government for accepting the intention of the amendment which i moved at the report stage in this house and which this house approved <e> <s> the decision by the government and the approval obtained in another place yesterday

for his reply <e> <s> i welcome the fact that he re-affirmed once again the governments concern in this matter and their desire that public bodies should play their proper part in employing disabled people <e> <s> i am not altogether happy that the arrangements which he suggested could be put into force under the bill will actually achieve this end <e> <s> he said that the minister could take action but he did not say that he would take action <e> <s> we shall have to wait to see what he does under the powers already in the bill if we do not press this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that under the proposed scheme the single man will be very much better off whereas the married man with children will be worse off <e> <s> does he feel that such arrangements could be justified <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are glad too that the government have recognised the extent of the pressure on this house which has been very considerable and that they have taken this important step to relieve it <e> <s> we remain of the opinion that too much legislation is going through parliament under this government as under the last <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness for her explanation of the purpose of these amendment regulations <e> <s> i am grateful to her for providing the background papers for the debate to which she referred <e> <s> we are discussing the commencement of this new supplementary benefit system later this month and it is disturbing that as we do so we should hear rumours of a cut in the real value of supplementary benefits <e> <s> i hope that those rumours will prove to be false <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble marquess speaks of the problems of the horn of africa with a knowledge to which i would lay no claim and i am sure he will understand if i do not follow him in discussing the problems of that troubled part of the world <e> <s> i often think that our debates in this house are a little like the grand national those who complete the course are many fewer in number than those who are in at the start and who are the winners is an open question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we on these benches welcome the governments intention to seek the widest possible consultation on their proposals <e> <s> we are glad that no compulsion is proposed in regard to moving to direct payment to bank accounts and we welcome the fact that retirement pensioners will be able to continue to draw their pension weekly and to do so at the post office <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord wells-pestell i am very doubtful about the proposal to make child benefit payable monthly in arrear for most mothers even though they will still be able to collect it at the post office <e> <s> to make a monthly payment possible is one thing but to make it compulsory for most mothers is another <e> <s> do not the government consider that where there is weekly payment of wages it is best to have weekly payment of benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by declaring an interest <e> <s> i am a director of a life and pensions subsidiary company of a firm of lloyds brokers and although life assurance and pensions are excluded from the directive which we are considering this evening the parent company has of course an interest in the subject matter of this particular directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble baroness lady young for the very thorough explanation which she has given us of the purpose and content of this bill <e> <s> as she made clear the bill increases national insurance contributions from employees from the self-employed from the non-employed and from married women and widow optants who pay the reduced rate <e> <s> for employees the increase will be one per cent <e> <s> the noble baroness explained that it will be divided in this way one-quarter of it will go towards paying for the increased cost of unemployment one-quarter towards the national health service to increase the funding from contributions to the national health service from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and one-half to enable the treasury supplement to be reduced from per cent <e> <s> the level at which it has remained for the past five years to per cent <e> <s> so it follows that three-quarters of the increase is not necessary to fund the national insurance benefits <e> <s> it is as the noble baroness said part of the governments overall economic strategy to restrain the growth in the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is greatly indebted to the noble baroness lady masham of ilton not only for the way in which she introduced this debate this afternoon but for giving us so early in this international year the opportunity to discuss it in general terms and also to discuss the white paper <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a brief word in support of this amendment <e> <s> it has always seemed to me as it seems to the noble lord lord wells-pestell that it is unfair that those earning over the top limit of a week under this bill should have their national insurance contributions as a percentage of their earnings actually decline the higher their income is <e> <s> the continued extension of intervals of upper limits results in those caught between the old upper limit and the new upper limit having to pay in the year that they are caught a particularly heavy amount <e> <s> i did point out on second reading that for the person on the a week maximum it will be an increase of per cent <e> <s> in his national insurance contributions <e> <s> if there were no top limit for contributions that would remove that anomaly <e>", "<cs> i have followed with great interest the discussion as to whether the amendment should be discussed or not and i appreciate the weight of the suggestion that perhaps we should not be discussing it <e> <s> nevertheless social security is a matter of cash benefits and almost everything to do with social security involves money <e> <s> indeed almost every if not every amendment involves government expenditure and i am not clear where we should have to draw the line if we said the amendment should not be discussed because i am sure that the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord spens have a similar effect <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said we might as well abandon our committee stage if we cannot discuss the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it removes that part of the increase in the employees contribution which is not designed to pay for national insurance benefits but is designed to promote the governments medium-term economic strategy <e> <s> we on these benches do not support the transfer of the burden from the treasury supplement to personal contributors <e> <s> i said on second reading that i disagreed with personal contributors being asked in effect to pay for non-contributory benefits <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may give the noble lord lord spens a little encouragement by saying that certainly i was in support of his previous amendment but it was so obviously a follow-on from the amendment which had preceded it that i thought it would be wrong to take up the time of the committee by repeating the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> for the reasons which i gave when discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but in addition the argument has been put forward by the government that government expenditure on non-contributory social security benefits and on the treasury supplement has increased between and by per cent <e> <s> in real terms whereas all contributions including those of employers have increased by only per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords during our debate on the bill we have had considerable discussion about the governments case that the treasury supplement to the national insurance fund has increased at a greater rate than national insurance contributions since and despite all that has been said about that from the government front bench i still feel that that argument is not valid and that the figures which were given in another place by the secretary of state would not have suggested that had they not covered the period during which the new earnings-related pension scheme was introduced in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord cockfield succeeded in his aim to speak non-controversially <e> <s> in his opening remarks he said that he hoped that the debate would enable us to produce a better document next time <e> <s> of course it is always our aim to improve as we go on but we have provided the noble lord and the government with the opportunity to produce a better policy now <e> <s> the noble lord dealt with public expenditure <e> <s> i

lord lord bruce of donington in order to endorse his final plea to the government to look at this matter again <e> <s> when it was discussed at the report stage in another place it was clear that there was a closer approach to agreement than there had been at the committee stage and the minister indicated that he was prepared to consider any proposals that might be brought forward to try to

will not be surprised to know that i consider it rather disappointing <e> <s> on the options which he mentioned i do not think that they are extremely attractive but nevertheless i should like to

activity <e> <s> why should this particular type of non-commercial activity be open to commercial and industrial companies and not to insurance companies <e> <s> to say that is to emphasise the point

a brief word <e> <s> i am still a little puzzled as to why the government do not want this idea even if they do not want the precise words of this amendment to be adopted <e> <s> it is not argued that this information should not be in the hands of the actuary <e> <s> at least i understand it is the case that it is generally agreed that the actuary should receive this information <e> <s> as i

important matter <e> <s> i also wish to thank him for the speech with which he introduced the subject to us and for his eloquent peroration with which i was in complete agreement <e> <s> it is quite clear that the house has appreciated greatly the maiden speeches of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and the noble lord lord john-mackie and as many noble lords have already mentioned we look forward to hearing both speakers on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady young for her very clear and lucid explanation of the purpose and the contents of this bill <e> <s> i should like to join too in expressing thanks to mrs warnock and her committee on whose work the bill is largely based <e> <s> like the two previous speakers i look forward with keen interest to the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank most warmly all those noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> i also thank the noble baroness lady young for her reply <e> <s> however it did not convince me that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the amendment would fundamentally alter the bill <e> <s> i cannot see why this is so <e> <s> in fact in respect of a particular year the bill says that since the level was placed too high for that year there was a miscalculation there must be a clawback in respect of that year <e> <s> all my amendment says is that that principle should apply in reverse if there is a shortfall <e> <s> this does not seem to me to be a fundamental departure from the nature of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the noble baroness lady jeger in making it clear that we on these benches also dislike clause which is the only controversial clause in the bill <e> <s> we regret that it was not amended during the committee stage <e> <s> however we welcome the repetition of the pledge with regard to long-term benefits and the making good of shortfalls relating to them which the noble baroness has given this afternoon <e> <s> we regret however that that pledge does not apply to short-term benefits <e>",

educational problem <e> <s> it seems to me that it is certainly a problem that affects the welfare of the child but it is not really to do with that childs ability to learn that childs ability to take

a matter affecting the education of the child apart from his general welfare and that of the whole family <e>", "<cs> i should like to join in supporting this amendment for the reasons which have been so well expressed by previous speakers <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth described this as a minimum commitment and it seems to be a minimum commitment <e> <s> the concern which many of us have on this bill is that the good intentions of which it is full will lead to very little or not enough in practice <e> <s> this is one of the amendments which seeks to prevent that

beginning of provoking some discussion as to whether the limitations contained in this particular subsection are in fact desirable or not has been achieved <e> <s> we have had some useful discussion

<e> <s> i am not fully convinced now that they are all necessary <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble baroness lady young if she feels that were it possible to test reasonablenessand to satisfy her on that one point it would be desirable to have some provision of this kind which would indicate that local authorities are supposed to take some action to put schools into a position whereby they can meet some needs which they may not be able to meet at the time of the first consideration <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady young for her further elucidation <e> <s> i should like

listened with great interest to the comments from those who did not feel able to do so <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david pointed out at the very beginning an important fact that this would involve a minimum of expense and that it would provide something to aim at which was underlined by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth when she said that we need a systematic plan <e> <s> it is our attitude to those two statements that we need something to aim at and a systematic plan on which our approach to this amendment turns <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point made by the noble baroness <e>

point behind this amendment <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that i agree with her that we should not try to prescribe every detail from the centre and that certainly was not the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> i should like to consider carefully the arguments which she has advanced against certain aspects of the amendment in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot resist saying that it seemed to me that the noble baroness lady jeger had scored a bullseye when she linked the reaction of the noble baroness lady young to the phrase use their best endeavours and her reaction to could reasonably be made a phrase which we had earlier <e> <s> i am wondering whether if i had worded amendment no <e> <s> to read or with the use of their best endeavours it would have been acceptable to the noble baroness or whether that is another hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for his explanation of these amendment regulations <e> <s> the first thing that strikes me about the regulations as a whole as indeed it struck the noble baroness lady jeger and i think also the noble lord is their complexity and complication <e> <s> in order to advise on the supplementary benefits scheme or to understand ones own position in relation to it it is necessary to use first the supplementary benefits act as amended which is found as schedule of the social security act secondly sets of basic regulations thirdly three sets of previous amending regulations fourthly these amending regulations which we are now discussing and fifthly the supplementary benefit miscellaneous amendments regulations issued at the same time and which as the noble lord explained to us are subject to the negative procedure <e>", "<cs> when we discussed this matter on second reading i expressed support for the principle which lies behind this amendment and also behind amendment no <e> <s> a and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i reaffirm that support today <e> <s> but an amendment in similar terms to amendment no <e> <s> was moved by my honourable friend mr clement freud in another place <e> <s> i still prefer the wording of that amendment because of its comprehensive nature to which attention was drawn by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i attach a certain amount of importance to the fact that amendment no <e> <s> provides for the notification to be done twice at an interval of six weeks the reason being that the parents may well not be in an emotional state that they take in on the first occasion when they have just had the handicap confirmed the significance of the information about the support organisation but six weeks later it comes again when they are more adjusted to the situation and ready to take advantage of such help and assistance as is available <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could say very briefly that i too welcome as indeed i said a few minutes ago the fact that the government have brought this amendment forward even although i prefer for the reasons i gave amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had not myself and it may well be my fault seen the amendment that we are now discussing until this morning and this seems to have been somewhat similar to the experience of other noble lords <e> <s> that is the reason why we feel that perhaps some further consideration should be given to it but as the noble lord lord renton said that can still be possible at report even though this amendment is accepted in its present form at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady young for the care with which she has approached this amendment <e> <s> i listened with great interest to what she had to say <e> <s> the major point of difference between those of us who support the amendment and the noble baroness lady young as she indicated at the conclusion of her remarks is the use of the phrase the efficient use of resources <e> <s> it is of course in the current context that we are particularly anxious about that phrase <e> <s> but we have left in the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness lady young recognises that the two principal objections which she put forward to the original amendment at the committee stage have been met in this amendment so we are not now producing something which has been voted on in this form on a prior occasion <e> <s> we took notice of the criticisms which were made and amended the amendment so that the reforms required by the criticisms would be incorporated into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support very briefly for this amendment <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and the noble lord lord renton i am glad that we have in clause but like them i prefer the amendment which as they have pointed out is more comprehensive <e> <s> i think it is important to have government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord cullen for his explanation of the contents of these orders <e> <s> this is the seventh consecutive year that i have had the pleasure of commenting to the house on the social security benefits up-rating order and <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to express sympathy with the amendment for i feel it would be unsatisfactory to leave the commencement date unspecified <e> <s> there is the danger as the noble baroness lady jeger made clear that if we did that we should be opening the door to delay <e> <s> the government envisage as she said the possibility of different parts of the bill being implemented at different times <e> <s> but as she pointed out that would still be possible if the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate my noble friends and myself with the tribute paid by the noble baroness lady young to lord boyle of handsworth <e> <s> we fully endorse all that was said by the two noble baronesses <e> <s> we on these benches are glad that as a result of this bill steps will be taken to implement many of the recommendations of the warnock report <e> <s> we are glad that the integration of education of handicapped children with all other children is now accepted as a consequence of the acceptance of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the house may now return to considering the social security contributions bill <e> <s> i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord elton for his very thorough explanation of the contents of this bill <e> <s> as he stated the bill increases the employees contribution from next april by per cent <e> <s> and reduces the treasury supplement from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of total contributions <e> <s> there is no increase in the employers contribution rate <e> <s> last year a similar increase of per cent <e> <s> was imposed on employees and the year before a quarter of per cent <e> <s> so since the government took office the employees contribution has increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> that is an increase in the percentage rate itself of per cent <e> <s> we have to remember as the noble baroness lady jeger pointed out that national insurance contributions are much more regressive than income tax having a lower threshold and because once you pass the top limit in earnings the contributions which you make to national insurance become an increasingly smaller proportion of your earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord could give the comparative figures <e> <s> it would be most helpful if he could <e> <s> he said that while child benefit was a factor it was not the main factor <e> <s> would he not agree that it was a factor of something around million and that perhaps the supplementary benefit was somewhere around million <e> <s> would that not suggest that the child benefit was a major factor <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say whether it is still the intention of the government to abolish the earnings rule and if so can he give any indication of when that might occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble baroness lady gardner for asking this important question tonight and wish briefly to support her in pressing it on the government <e> <s> we listened with interest to her description of the westminster scheme and we know that she has considerable experience and knowledge in this sphere <e> <s> the orange badge scheme is valuable but as the noble baroness said there is no doubt that owing to abuse of it public confidence in it has declined <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord ohagan for raising this important subject this afternoon and also to thank him for the way in which he did so <e> <s> i fully support the plea which he made that the united kingdom should become a full member of the european monetary system <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord lever of manchester who speaks to us with such knowledge and authority on these matters should have supported that plea as strongly as he did <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has made it clear that employees have not previously been required to contribute to the redundancy fund and i believe there is a clear distinction and difference between a national insurance scheme and compensation <e> <s> redundancy payments are not an extension of unemployment benefit and the victim or potential victim is not usually expected to contribute to his own compensation or potential compensation <e> <s> if the government were to say they wanted to make redundancy payment a part of the national insurance scheme we could then discuss that proposition <e> <s> i would wish to oppose it but i would regard it as more logical than the present proposal <e> <s> i think it is wrong to exact a contribution in this way <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is not the difference that people regard redundancy payment as compensation for loss of their jobs which varies according to the length of their service whereas a national insurance payment is designed to provide the minimum to live on if you should be in that unfortunate circumstance <e> <s> the earnings-related supplement has now gone but even the earnings-related supplement was merely designed to cushion the immediate effect of unemployment <e> <s> the idea of a redundancy payment is that there should be some compensation for the fact that you have lost your job <e> <s> to have to contribute to it seems to undermine that principle of compensation <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has pointed out that the employees contribution has gone up per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> if we include the bills proposals during the time of this government <e> <s> i would oppose the per cent <e> <s> increase to which this clause gives effect for three reasons first because i do not think there should be an increase in the employees contribution in a scheme of this kind without a balancing contribution from the employer <e> <s> i think the way to help employers if it is felt they need special attention is through a reduction in national insurance surcharge <e> <s> secondly i do not agree with a contribution being made by employees to the redundancy fund and we have just discussed that <e> <s> thirdly i do not agree with a contribution being extracted from employees to offset a reduction in the treasury supplement and i imagine we shall discuss that when we come to the question of whether clause should remain in the bill <e> <s> so for <e>", "<cs> the government argument for the reduction of the treasury supplement is that expenditure on social security met from general taxation including the treasury supplement has increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> it is true of course that expenditure on non-contributory benefits is only per cent <e> <s> of the total because the per cent <e> <s> as i mentioned includes the treasury supplement which goes towards financing contributory benefits <e> <s> but there has of course been an increase from some per cent <e> <s> of the total in to about per cent <e> <s> of the total in in the proportion of the whole which is represented by non-contributory benefits <e>", "<cs> i should like to add just a brief word to what has already been said and i shall be interested in the reply lord spens receives to this amendment of his <e> <s> it seems that the principle is sound <e> <s> it seems reasonable the self-employed man pays a single contribution in lieu of the employers and employees contributions <e> <s> he is the employer but also by inference he employs himself and it seems reasonable that his contribution should be divided in the proportion suggested in the amendment and what we might call the employers element should be allowed as an expense <e> <s> as i say it seems a very reasonable proposition but i shall be interested to hear whether there are any grave administrative difficulties which would prevent its being put into practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret the fact that we are going to pass this bill through the house without any amendment although i admit that it is difficult to amend this bill without destroying its substance <e> <s> i made it clear in the second reading and committee stage that we on these benches are opposed to its substance <e> <s> we also are opposed to an increase in the contribution for employees without any increase for employers believing that a reduction in the national insurance surcharge is the way to help employers <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the increase in the benefit for children under five to which he referred was paid for by loss of benefit to other claimants <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord for his explanation of the order <e> <s> he has made clear that these regulations governing the collection of national insurance contributions from mariners are made necessary by the change in the method of collecting income tax the abandonment of the marine tax deduction scheme and its replacement by normal paye <e> <s> as the noble lord said the order is technical and non-controversial <e> <s> i join the noble baroness in asking how many are likely to be covered by the regulations <e> <s> i gather that the numbers covered by the marine tax deduction scheme have sharply declined recently <e> <s> the government appear to have dealt satisfactorily with the points raised by the social security advisory committee including the question of the treatment of leave pay and we on these benches support the approval of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> we on these benches agree with the government on the need for prudent increases in prices where agriculture products are in surplus <e> <s> we think that the government were right to resist the higher demands <e> <s> first may i ask the government whether they accept the commissions per cent <e> <s> proposal <e> <s> secondly may i ask the government whether we are likely to get an agreement on farm prices without agreement on the british share of the budget and on the wider question of reform of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> arising out of that may i further ask whether or not such a comprehensive settlement will require some increase in the total resources available to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord oram for raising this important subject this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure that he was right to place the subject in the context of the interdependence of the nations of the world rich and poor alike <e> <s> the world poverty lobby i do not use that phrase in any critical sense has succeeded in bringing home some of the facts about world poverty to a large number of people in this country the fact that million people are in a permanent and chronic state of poverty according to the world bank the fact that the north including eastern europe has one-quarter of the worlds population and four-fifths of its income the fact that in the poorest countries one out of four children die before the age of five <e> <s> so one could go on reciting these appalling statistics <e> <s> the mass lobby of parliament last year the support for the brandt report in this country and the number of copies of the report which have been sold in this country higher than elsewhere have shown that the people in this country are aware of the importance the magnitude and the urgency of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord glenamara for moving this motion this afternoon <e> <s> it gives us the opportunity to discuss the strategy underlying last weeks budget and also to consider once again the serious economic problems facing our country <e> <s> i say at the beginning that i agree with much that the noble lord said although i will comment a little later perhaps adversely on one or two aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble baroness in thanking the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for his explanation of these measures <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by declaring an interest since i am an insurance broker and it is part of my task to advise my clients as to whether they should contract out of their pension schemes or contract them in <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for repeating the statement made by the prime minister in another place <e> <s> it is clear as has already been said that the european council had a very comprehensive agenda and i must restrict myself to one or two points only <e> <s> the question of unemployment quite rightly was an important matter under discussion and we welcome the decision of the community and member states to take whatever steps are open to them to improve the level of investment of the community but i wonder just what that will amount to in practice <e> <s> can the noble lord give us any idea what plans the community might have in that respect and what plans the united kingdom government might have in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the noble lord is in a position to answer the question which put to him on the genscher colombo plan <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord elton for his very clear and thorough explanation of what he himself called a complex subject <e> <s> the bill like gaul is divided into three parts the statutory sick pay scheme the unified housing benefit and the miscellaneous provisions <e> <s> i think it will be generally agreed that the first two of those are the most important <e>", "<cs> i can see the difficulties which the noble lord lord cullen has put forward to accepting the <e>", "<cs> i have listened with very great interest to what the noble lord the minister has had to say about the reasons for having this provision in the bill <e> <s> it seems that a lot of what he said is very reasonable and that it would be desirable if possible to have the kind of arrangement which the bill sets out <e> <s> but the trouble for me is that sickness benefit and statutory sick pay are not identical <e> <s> if they were identical one could say that it was perfectly all right to say to the man who was on strike you have got to go to the state for the same benefit <e> <s> it will not be through your employer because it is more satisfactory in these circumstances that it should not be <e> <s> that is understandable <e> <s> but they are not identical as has come out in our debate this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for his reply to the amendment and for the other contributions that have been made to this discussion <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that i did not of course query in this amendment the level of <e> <s> the noble lord began by defending that but i did not attack it in this amendment <e> <s> i am not saying that i think that is enough but we come to discuss that matter in the next amendment <e> <s> but in this amendment i was not raising that point at all <e> <s> the point which i did raise the noble lord answered a point which i did not raise and upon which i do not think i received an answer was the question about those who have a full contribution record but who <e>", "<cs> i was coming to that point <e> <s> while that is a valid point it is not an answer i think to the question which i have just raised about the position of people with full contribution records now and under the proposed system <e> <s> but coming on to that further point about not compelling the employers to pay employees more than they would normally earn i agree that that is a valid point and that it might have been better if i had worded my amendment so that it said <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a brief word in support of this amendment and those associated with it <e> <s> when we were discussing the last amendment the noble lord lord mottistone said he thought there was an advantage in having three different levels of benefit and that this was more flexible <e> <s> my difficulty with that was that the levels were such that it was possible for somebody who had a full contribution record to be worse off under the new system compared with what we have at the present time <e> <s> that is not so under these amendments <e> <s> that problem is dealt with and also in the third category there is the phrase which i said would have been better had i included it in my amendment normal earnings or whichever is the lower <e> <s> for these reasons i support the amendment that has been moved by the noble baroness lady jeger <e>", "<cs> i should like to return if i may to the point which the noble lord lord trefgarne made earlier when he was answering on the previous matter <e> <s> there he was talking about i have now forgotten the point i was going to make to your lordships <e> <s> i will think it out <e>", "<cs> having collected my scattered wits perhaps i could make the point that i was on the verge of making a minute ago and it is this <e> <s> i think it is wrong to deploy in defence as the noble lord did the fact that there are some occupational schemes many of them very good run by employers because those occupational schemes are running now <e> <s> what we are trying to compare is the sickness benefit through the state scheme as it is at the moment and as it would be under the scheme proposed by the government and in both cases it will be in the context of existing occupational schemes which will presumably not necessarily be changed <e> <s> what we are saying is that in the case of a married man in the top bracket of the new three levels once you have taken into account the national insurance contributions he will in fact be worse off <e> <s> single people as the noble lord has pointed out will be better off but we are pointing to the fact that the married man will be worse off <e> <s> we were asking for the government to confirm that and i think the calculations which have been made across the committee have confirmed it <e>", "<cs> i must confess that that is rather a disappointing answer <e> <s> the noble lord says that we must have a consistent relationship between statutory sick pay and sickness benefit and offers that as one of the reasons why it would not be possible to put a duty upon the secretary of state to raise the benefits in line with prices <e> <s> but he is given the discretionary powers to do that under the bill <e> <s> one would imagine that the same consideration will apply to a discretionary power <e> <s> if in one year he decided he wanted to do it although he had not done it the previous year he would still have to be concerned about a consistent relationship <e> <s> so that makes no difference whether you have it obligatory for the secretary of state to make the increase or if it is left to his discretion <e>", "<cs> this question of the abatement is one which has created quite a lot of heat and it did so when it was debated in another place <e> <s> the strong feeling there was that when once the short-term benefits were taken into taxation the abatement which was an interim measure should be made good was to be found in all parts of the other place and i have no doubt that it would be so here if all parts of this place were fully occupied at the present time <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord trefgarne in his opening remarks put the case for this amendment very well when he said that since sickness benefit had been abated and since the statutory sick pay had been based on sickness benefit it could be argued and indeed i would say should be argued that if it were not for that abatement the statutory sick pay would be fixed at a higher level and i would point out that we have an amendment coming later which would take care of sickness benefit <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne is a little too optimistic about the way in which the scheme is going to be operated without additional burdens with very little extra <e> <s> i did read out a long list of things which employers will have to do <e> <s> the present administrative cost is only part of what they will have to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has referred to the conduct of successive governments but he has not referred to the conduct of successive oppositions <e> <s> i well remember the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne explaining to the house in some detail how we could afford to abolish the earnings rule which the government of which he and the noble lord are members have not yet been able to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking noble viscount lord trenchard for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we on these benches are glad that our forces have been successful in these engagements and that there has been only the one casualty to which reference has been made we are glad to hear that he is in a satisfactory condition <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock to the noble baroness lady jeger and to the noble lord lord molloy for the support which they have given to this amendment <e> <s> and i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his reply which he will not be surprised to know i find very unsatisfactory <e> <s> he said that the abatement was designed to get reductions in expenditure <e> <s> well they got them and they have had the reduction over the years since it was reduced <e> <s> now that they are going to have a reduction through taxation which is going to give them a bigger reduction than the one they have obtained through the abatement it seems right at this point to restore the cumulative effect of the abatement <e> <s> i am quite sure that all logic and all fairness is on the side of that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i think the case has been put very clearly by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> it does seem wrong to single out one particular section of the community and to say we shall not take the actual income what you have actually received but we shall take something you are assumed to have received whether or not you have done so <e> <s> that does seem wrong and therefore i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return briefly to the point which i made during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank those who have supported this amendment and i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply even if i do not find it a very satisfactory one <e> <s> the noble lord said that there is to be an increase in november in child benefit and of course we know that but we know as he said that that is merely to account for inflation and for a shortfall in the previous year <e> <s> it in no way compensates for the removal of the child dependency additions <e> <s> the noble lord said that the child dependency additions were being phased out <e> <s> well that was not news we had already referred to that and we knew that they were being phased out <e> <s> the complaint was that they were being phased out without any compensation no compensating increase in child benefit <e> <s> it is to that that we were objecting <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye for asking this question this evening for he gives us a second opportunity to discuss the significance of the use of the majority voting procedure by the council of ministers with regard to the agricultural settlement <e> <s> the noble lords question lays the emphasis upon the political and constitutional aspects of that event rather than on the agricultural ones <e> <s> having thanked the noble lord for putting the question i then must part company with him because i think that the view i would take would be diametrically opposed to the view which he has put so clearly before us this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and the noble lord lord kilmarnock for the support which they have given to this amendment <e> <s> i see that i ought to declare an interest <e> <s> in my case it is two granddaughters <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne said that the real value of child benefit had been maintained and it has been in this year though not over the period that the government have been in power <e> <s> but that is really beside the point <e> <s> the fact is that if you do away with a particular benefit you ought to increase child benefit in order to compensate and that is the argument that was being put forward by the social security advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords having considered what the noble lord has said and with very great regret because i think there is an important issue of principle here an important division between us and i think that some of the arguments which have been put from this side of the house have not been answered i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trefgarne referred to himself as a new boy in this sphere of social security but i think that the whole house has been greatly impressed by his versatility <e> <s> he seems to pass from airports to foreign affairs and then to sick pay with the greatest of ease and he certainly has not appeared during the discussions on this bill to be a new boy <e> <s> i am sorry to learn that the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne will no longer be assisting him in this sphere because it has always been a great pleasure to work with the noble lord who has always been so helpful and so courteous <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for raising this subject this afternoon <e> <s> a few minutes ago the noble lord lord underhill said that we were all for peace <e> <s> i think he can certainly say that we would all like to see disarmament however much we may disagree about the way to attain it <e> <s> i

elsewhere but they do not have a great deal of power to control it although they may hope to influence matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord plowden and his committee for this most valuable report that we are discussing this evening <e> <s> it contains an informative and helpful summary of the proposals of the commission and some very clear conclusions about them <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate my noble friend lord tordoff for the way in which he introduced this report to us earlier this evening <e> <s> we have had three reports now from the select committee on the regional fund <e> <s> we debated them in last year in and now we have this third report this evening <e> <s> as i say there are in this particular report

consecutive year that i have had the privilege of addressing your lordships on these up-rating orders i am well aware of the problem we face on these occasions <e> <s> the increases we discuss this evening were announced the day after the budget on th march so there has been a great deal of time for them to be discussed both in this house and elsewhere not least when we were debating the social security and housing benefits bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like once again to join in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for his lucid explanation of a complicated matter <e> <s> i made clear when we discussed the social security and housing benefits bill that we on these benches wanted a unified housing benefit but that we had misgivings about the actual proposals which the government had put forward <e> <s> in particular we regretted the fact that the government had decided to proceed on a no-cost basis in spite of the fact that the supplementary benefit commission had suggested that a scheme of this kind was not likely to be satisfactory unless there were some additional resources made available to it <e> <s> we doubted the wisdom of giving the bulk of the administration to local authorities first because of the burden on the local authorities themselves and secondly because of the number of offices to which people would have to go <e> <s> those entitled to housing benefit supplement for example may have to deal both with the local authority and with the dhss instead of just with the dhss as is the case now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his explanation and to say that we on these benches support the order <e> <s> i rise principally to welcome the adoption of the system of the single transferable vote and i am glad that the noble lord has told us that this was felt to be the way in which fair representation could be obtained <e> <s> i look forward to the governments adoption of this system in other spheres <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow both for raising this unstarred question this evening and for the way in which he has done so <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the noble lord lord cockfield has already set out some of the governments aims in a speech last month and we look forward to hearing him elaborating on that and perhaps filling in some of the details which may not have appeared in the british press <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say by what percentage the real value must increase in order to provide the same services for the increasing number of people <e> <s> can he say how much the increase per annum must be in order for us to stay where we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we too regret that the noble earl is not able to give us better news than the morning press suggested might be imminent <e> <s> we must hope that an offer of the kind reported in the press may in fact be forthcoming <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge in asking the noble earl whether he can give any indication of how much time is left for such an offer to be made <e> <s> clearly such an offer would be welcome because of the economic situation in northern ireland and the considerable amount of government money invested in the project <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply may i ask him in view of the fact that the cuts mean much to the recipients and yet according to the figure he has given the sum although substantial is still small compared with the total overall social security budget whether the government will seriously consider restoring the penalties and thus relieving hardship increasing demand and reducing unemployment and indeed going some way to pay for the cost of the increase of benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure which the noble lord gave include the cost of restoring the child benefit to its real value in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the policy of the government to allow the real value of the christmas bonus to continue to decline in subsequent years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for raising this important matter this afternoon and for the way in which he has done so <e> <s> i listened with great interest and much sympathy to what he had to say <e> <s> he was right in indicating that there is a great danger that the interest aroused in by the international year of disabled persons may be allowed to dissipate <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and useful debate this afternoon and i should like to thank all those who have taken part whether they agreed with what i said at the beginning or not <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his reply <e> <s> of course i am tempted to start replying to all the points that have been made during the course of the debate but i must not do that <e> <s> in any case it has already been done very effectively from our point of view by my noble friend lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in thanking the noble lord the secretary of state for making this statement this afternoon <e> <s> it is clear from what he said that a few positive decisions were reached but we on these benches have been discouraged during the past week to hear the rumours of deadlock and of the search for a facesaving compromise <e> <s> one cannot help wondering whether the secretary of state is perhaps a little too complacent about the result of this conference <e> <s> i wonder whether he can say with confidence that the protectionist advance will be held up as a result of it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the best way to deal with the question of the poverty trap and to eliminate it is to find a way of reducing the high degree of dependence on means-tested benefits <e> <s> will not a tax credit scheme offer such a way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his very clear explanation of the purpose and content of the order and regulations <e> <s> last year we had the reduction in the treasury grant which was reduced to per cent <e> <s> of contributions in the second of two stages which lowered it from per cent <e> <s> and we on these benches opposed that reduction <e> <s> there was also an increase for personal contributors but there was no increase for employers and we did not think that that was right either <e> <s> we said we thought there should be a cut in the national insurance surcharge and that it was through such cuts that employers should be helped <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness the leader of the house for repeating the statement made in another place by the prime minister <e> <s> the european council has clearly discussed many important aspects of world affairs <e> <s> like the noble lord lord cledwyn and the government themselves we on these benches hope that the danish government will before long accept the commissions proposals for a revised common fisheries policy <e>", "<cs> i should like to express thanks to all noble lords who have supported this amendment and as your lordships have seen it has been supported from every part of the committee <e> <s> there is clearly some strong feeling that there is here a need for reform <e> <s> i think the noble lord who raised the question of drafting had a point <e> <s> there is some room for improvement in the drafting <e> <s> the intention is clear that in certain circumstances the local authority <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> i think the absence of mandatory grants for the training of social workers in this country is a great handicap to that important branch of training <e> <s> the training is vital as the noble baroness made clear and i think the statistics she gave about the numbers of people trained in particular spheres were very telling indeed and they indicate how great the need is <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may ask the noble lord this question because from what he said i was not quite clear what he and his colleagues are considering <e> <s> i understood him to say that administrative difficulties made it impracticable to have a list of all registrations <e> <s> but i thought he went on to say that while it was not desirable to have a list of everybody who had had their registration refused or cancelled nevertheless it was desirable to have some kind of list of people who might be described as undesirable <e> <s> yet in the second part of his reply he seemed to say that this was not the case and that he did not approve of what he called black lists <e> <s> i am not quite clear what it is that he and his colleagues are contemplating as a possibility <e>", "<cs> since i understand from the minister that the matter is under consideration that the government are seized of the nature of the problem and that there is a possibility of some kind of list i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that these powers are far reaching as my noble friend emphasised however lacking in novelty they may be however conventional they may be <e> <s> the very fact that the noble lord the minister gave an assurance that they would not be used to introduce major changes indicates that they could be which is further proof of the extent of the powers <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to consider what the minister has said in his reply to these amendments and we may well return to this subject at a later stage <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that the need for these large institutions to be represented on a large number of joint consultative committees will not be the occasion for an increasing number of orders <e>", "<cs> i am surprised to hear that but i will look again at the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger indicated the support which the amendment has attracted from people who will be very much concerned with the development of family practitioner committees <e> <s> i did not find the reply of the noble lord to be altogether convincing <e> <s> however i do not wish to divide the committee <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his acceptance in principle of this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to support briefly what the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said <e> <s> this amendment would make sure that all who need home help would get it or at any rate they would not be deterred from getting it on financial grounds <e> <s> the noble lord emphasised that there is no addition to supplementary benefit now available in order to pay for a local authority home help and in the absence of that it seems that this amendment is necessary <e>", "<cs> again i should like briefly to support the amendment which has just been moved and to express support for all three of the amendments to which the noble lord spoke <e> <s> as he explained they are designed to see that the elderly and the disabled do not have to pay for services except meals if they are on supplementary benefit if their net disposable income is less than the retirement pension after the effect of the charge has been taken into account and if their capital resources are less than <e> <s> in those circumstances they are not required to pay and that seems reasonable <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord said in his closing remarks it seems right and wholly reasonable that the limit to be put on the contribution which is made to help to maintain a child in care should be similar to the limit which is placed on the amount of benefit given to somebody who wants to maintain his child at home <e> <s> i do not believe that this proposal is subject to the criticisms of the other amendments which the noble lord the minister put forward in his reply to the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> reacts to what the noble lord the minister has just said may i just underline one point in relation to this amendment which calls for a disregard of child benefit <e> <s> this highlights the difference between the treatment of a child in hospital and the treatment of a child in care <e> <s> with the child in hospital child benefit continues for weeks and may continue longer than that if the parents are maintaining contact with the child in hospital whereas with the child in care benefit lasts for only eight weeks and then stops <e> <s> very often the benefit paid during those eight weeks is required by the local authority by means of a payment <e> <s> there seems to be a considerable difference in this respect between the position of children who are not in very different situations <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could say something about this point at this stage or at some other stage <e>", "<cs> when speaking earlier the minister referred to somebody who effected a transfer of this kind at the last minute but of course the last minute covers the previous six months to the date of actually going into accommodation <e> <s> i believe it has become clear from our recent discussion that there is nothing in the clause and i do not think there is anything referred to by the clause which contains a reference to this being carried out deliberately <e> <s> it seems that anybody who makes a transfer within the previous six <e>", "<cs> i think that possibly the noble lord the minister is a little complacent about staffing levels at the present time <e> <s> we cannot ignore the fact that the industrial dispute in birmingham centres round the question of whether or not they are facing an intolerable burden now that the numbers on supplementary benefit have so greatly increased <e> <s> however i would <e>", "<cs> again i wonder whether there is not perhaps a certain element of complacency with regard to the quality of adjudication on the part of the noble lord but again i would not want to press the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is an important point <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble lord has said about extending the membership of a tribunal more widely so that it includes people who are not at the present moment specifically included but i do not think that that should be done at the expense of someone who represents the employees <e> <s> otherwise there may well be a danger that employees will think that the tribunal is loaded against them <e> <s> for that reason i should like to test the opinion of the committee on this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the secretary of state for making that statement this afternoon <e> <s> we shall certainly want to consider the statement and the agreements carefully before reaching a final opinion about them <e> <s> we recognise of course that textiles is a crisis industry requiring special measures by the european community and we hope that where special measures of this kind are required they will be transitional and we understand that that is the underlying intention <e> <s> we are glad that agreement has been reached with countries but we are concerned that the agreements seem more rather than less protectionist <e> <s> is it right that the agreement and its negotiation have been the cause of considerable friction with the countries concerned <e> <s> what will follow at the end of the term of the agreement <e> <s> do the government feel it will be possible at that time for the community to move to a less protectionist less tough agreement <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply and encouraged by the fact that the government are going to review the possibility of greater reliance on lay tribunals <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord the secretary of state for his clear exposition of the purpose and nature of this bill <e> <s> on th december six years ago to the day we debated the second reading of the national insurance bill of that year which first introduced this tax <e> <s> it is interesting now to look back at the debate which we had on that occasion <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey speaking for the labour government explained that the new tax was necessary to help reduce the public sector borrowing requirement <e> <s> the noble lord said that this was part of a long-term strategy to reduce the borrowing requirements steadily over the next three years <e> <s> if this did not happen he said then it was the view of the chancellor of the exchequer mr healey and i quote the noble lords words at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for his clear explanation of the purpose of this order <e> <s> we on these benches did not approve the transfer of the first eight weeks of sick pay to employers for reasons which we set out when the social security and housing benefits bill was before the house <e> <s> we did not approve either of the three levels of benefit since there is no such differentiation in national insurance sickness benefit <e> <s> however the bill became law and we all understood that the levels of benefit would be up-rated before the bill became effective in april of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment moved by the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> the noble baroness reminded the house that at the committee stage i moved an amendment which would have prevented a denial of parental rights to parents of a child in voluntary care without recourse to the courts <e> <s> it would no longer have been possible for that to be done by administrative means through a parental rights resolution <e> <s> as the noble baroness said there was wide support for that amendment in all parts of the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne said that the present procedures were not ideal and also said that the government had not ruled out the possibility of change although he opposed the amendment itself <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i should like to say once again as i said at the committee stage that we on these benches support the amendment that has been put forward by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> in the couse of her remarks she presented what i considered was an unanswerable case for mandatory grants for the training of social workers <e> <s> when we discussed the question in committee it was clear and the point has been quoted again today that the noble lord lord trefgarne was not opposed and said that the government were not opposed to the concept of mandatory grants <e> <s> the question is one of pure expense <e> <s> so far as i can see that is the only problem the only reason why the government have up to now been disinclined to accept the proposal <e> <s> but if the figure that we have heard mentioned today million or even less is correct i would agree with the noble lord lord mottistone that it is a very manageable figure <e> <s> after all we do not spend a very great deal on the personal social services about billion as compared with million on social security billion altogether <e> <s> even in this field the whole scale of expenditure is not large <e> <s> this would be a small addition to a total which is not great at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that when i withdrew the amendment in committee i did not do so because i had found the noble lords answer convincing <e> <s> in fact i said that i did not find it altogether convincing but i did not want to divide the house at that time <e> <s> i confess that i still do not find the answer altogether convincing <e>", "<cs> my lords i would give general support to this amendment although there is a good deal of weight in what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> with regard to sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of myself and my noble friend lord kilmarnock who regrets his inability to be present this evening i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord campbell of croy for giving the house the opportunity to discuss these regulations <e> <s> the noble lord and the noble lord lord underhill have covered the ground comprehensively so i shall intervene briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this bill and to support the arguments which were so ably put forward by my noble friend lord harris of greenwich when he moved the second reading of it <e> <s> as the house is aware we on these benches have for long felt that the arguments against the first-past-the-post system are very strong <e> <s> that system distorts the votes it gives power to the winning party out all proportion to the votes cast for it it magnifies small swings it under-represents substantial minorities it does not allow a choice within parties between candidates of the same party and it leaves large numbers of people in the position where they cannot point to anyone and say i helped to elect that man or that woman <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other speakers in thanking the noble lord lord wells-pestell for introducing the motion this afternoon <e> <s> clearly it is concerned with a subject on which he feels very strongly and during the course of our debate a good deal of strong feeling has been expressed in all parts of the house on this question <e> <s> we have had an interesting debate <e> <s> at the outset the noble lord lord cockfield in his peroration attacked demand management and incomes policy rather as though they represented totalitarian tyranny <e> <s> i think that that was a rather extravagant view and i reject it <e> <s> my noble friend lord diamond summed up the main theme that we have been discussing today in the economic side of the debate when he said that it was a question of whether or not to turn up the gas when the house is cold and i think that much of our discussion has been about which way to turn the tap and how far to turn it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would like to indicate to the house the nature of the reply which he had from the academic council <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble baroness in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for his explanation of these orders <e> <s> i think perhaps the most important one although as the noble lord said it is the more straightforward is the order which deals with the supplementary benefit resources amendment regulations <e> <s> as the noble lord said it raises a matter of principle which created a minor crisis of conscience for the social security advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords all that i want to do is to thank the noble lord for his very clear explanation of the contents of this order and to welcome the removal of an irritation as he said which has been caused to married women and widows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy has certainly raised an important subject in his unstarred question this evening <e> <s> i think we are in danger of creating two nations those with a job and those without a job <e> <s> it is difficult for those of us who have a job to understand fully the situation of the three million unemployed <e>", "<cs> the three million who have no job <e> <s> we tend to forget that low-income families suffer from a higher inflation rate than the community as a whole <e> <s> in february the low pay units index indicated that low-income families among whom of course the unemployed are predominant had a rate of inflation of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> high than the rate for the rest of the community <e> <s> another worrying thing about the present situation as far as the unemployed are concerned is the degree to which the unemployed today rely upon means-tested supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord oram for raising this important matter this afternoon and for doing so in such a comprehensive manner <e> <s> we on these benches warmly welcome the second report of the brandt commission and give general support to its principal recommendations <e> <s> we see that report as a warning cry which cannot be ignored and as an emergency programme which ought to be considered with urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for his very clear exposition of the purpose and content of this bill <e> <s> we on these benches agree with the linking of benefits to prices <e> <s> we wish that all benefits were linked to prices particularly the death grant <e> <s> we regret that long-term benefits are no longer linked to earnings as well as prices <e> <s> the noble lord the minister referred to that and again to the ratchet effect <e> <s> i have said previously in this house that we on these benches are not worried about the ratchet effect because we do not consider that the retirement benefit level is adequate <e> <s> we accept that there has to be a measure of redistribution if it is to be made adequate and we believe that we have provided a means of doing that in the tax credit scheme which we have recently published <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can give some indication of when the common fund for commodities is likely to be put into operation <e> <s> it has been in preparation for a long time <e> <s> can he say what is now the position about global negotiations within the united nations <e>", "<cs> i should like to express support for these amendments general sympathy with their purpose and i support the concept of bi-annual upratings <e> <s> as i made clear when we had the debate on second reading i think the government are right to go back to the historical method instead of the forecast method but i think that the timing of doing it is wrong and that it should not be done at a time when inflation is expected to rise because that involves a loss <e> <s> the chief drawback in the historical method is the degree of delay which is involved <e> <s> bi-annual upratings will cut that down <e> <s> it used to be argued by government that it took six to seven months to carry out the necessary calculations and that therefore you could not have more than one uprating per year <e> <s> but i think it became clear during the debate of this bill in another place that it could be done within five months and therefore it is technically possible to do it twice in a year and other countries in fact manage to do so <e> <s> france and denmark have pensions reviewed twice yearly in relation to the index <e> <s> in finland and the netherlands there is an automatic increase after a per cent <e> <s> rise in the index <e> <s> in luxembourg there is a similar automatic increase after a per cent <e> <s> rise <e> <s> in belgium it follows automatically upon changes in a prices-and-wages index <e> <s> it can be argued they have different systems and that ours would need to be accommodated to this idea <e> <s> perhaps that is no bad thing and we should think out ways of doing what other people have managed to do <e> <s> at any rate it is clear that it is not impossible to have the historic method and to have bi-annual upratings <e>", "<cs> the reason why this amendment was put down was because there is no guarantee that the up-rating in the second year will make good the loss which i think we are all agreed is bound to take place in the first year <e> <s> the noble lord did not address himself to that point <e> <s> he said he did not think that the amendment would achieve its purpose but he did not say why he did not think it would achieve its purpose <e> <s> he said he wanted to get away from overshoot or shortfall <e> <s> the whole purpose of my argument was to show that under the present system you could not get away from overshoot and shortfall <e> <s> if therefore you did not want to lose value it was necessary to have an arrangement of this kind <e> <s> i can well understand that these are quite complicated arguments to take in when expressed verbally <e> <s> therefore i believe it is only right that the minister should have an opportunity to read what i have said and then to answer the points i have raised <e> <s> for that reason i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but i hope to return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find the reply of the noble lord lord trefgarne disappointing <e> <s> i had hoped that the government would be prepared to accept the concept of bi-annual up-ratings even if they were not prepared to incorporate this as something that would be brought into practice as soon as the bill becomes law <e> <s> as my noble friend lord kilmarnock pointed out it seems that public expenditure is the only substantial ground on which this proposal is registered <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place and i also join in congratulating him on his first appearance in his new role <e> <s> we on these benches approve in

have to leave before the end of this debate in my case to catch a train <e> <s> if that should happen i hope that i shall be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is no guarantee that any loss which is caused by going back to the historic method in will be made good in the ensuing year <e> <s> is he also aware that i have a letter from his noble friend lord trefgarne confirming this <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the welcome answer given to my noble friend on the question of the attendance allowance will the government declare an amnesty for those parents who because the regulations are so complicated inadvertently claimed this allowance while their children were in hostels and who are now being asked to repay it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes for asking this important question this evening and also for putting the case behind it so clearly <e> <s> in pressing for the extension of the invalid care allowance to married women and for the abolition of the household duties test for the housewifes non-contributory invalidity pension the noble baroness has the full support of my party

join in supporting the good wishes which have been extended by them to all those who serve this house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can begin by saying to the noble lord lord energlyn that he ought to consider the conduct of the greek cypriot government in cyprus by looking at it from their point of view namely that they see within their territory what they regard as a rebel government maintained by the armed forces of a foreign power <e> <s> i think any government in that situation is bound to act in the way he mentioned against what they consider to be a rebel government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think there have been grievances on both sides and i would not for one moment seek to deny that <e> <s> there was always the hope that agreement between the two communities would end that breach and in february president makarios as he then was and mr denktash agreed certain guidelines cyprus should be independent non-aligned bi-communal and a federal republic <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what will he the maximum loss under the alterations which are now being made <e> <s> is it true that in particular cases it could be as much as per month <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the extent of the cuts which the government are now making is considerably greater than they indicated at first <e> <s> have not the government made a serious mistake in this matter <e> <s> would it not be wise to withdraw these drastic proposals now for review and consultation to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for the fact that my name is not on the list of speakers but i withdrew it when it seemed likely that the previous debate would end so late that i would be unable to he present <e> <s> however i under-estimated the restraint which noble lords are capable of exercising on occasion <e> <s> i should like to join in thanking my noble friend lady burton for raising this important question this evening and i should like also to support her plea that gas and electricity prices should not rise a plea i think supported by most of the other speakers who have joined in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether it is correct that the current heating additions at the two rates he mentioned are only enough to keep a two-bar electric fire on for two-and-a-half hours and six-and-a-half hours respectively

buckinghamshire county council have been requested to pay million to the thames valley police towards greenham common peace camp policing although of course greenham common is not in buckinghamshire <e> <s> is he further aware that if they comply with that it is understood that buckinghamshire county council will be penalised for overspending their budget and will have to forfeit another million

his explanation of the purpose and content of these instruments that are before us this morning <e> <s> i think the noble lord must be glad that housing benefit is not paid out of the national insurance fund since as a consequence of that we are not discussing the confusion over the most recent cuts which the government are proposing in that connection <e> <s> having watched the programme whats it worth <e> <s> on channel this week it seems to me that ministers are not fully aware of the implications of what they are proposing in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will allow me to begin my few remarks by paying a tribute to my late noble friend and colleague lord amulree <e> <s> we were saddened to learn of his death yesterday <e> <s> it is particularly appropriate that we should remember him today when we are discussing disablement because as a doctor he specialised in dealing with the problems of the old which often include disablement and he always took a keen interest in the kind of debate that we are now having <e> <s> he was liberal chief whip in this house for years during which time he contributed much to the smooth working of the house <e> <s> we on these benches knew him as a jovial modest and kindly man <e> <s> we remember him with affection and we know that he was widely respected in the house as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say how the arrangements made for those falling sick while on strike the arrangements to receive sickness benefit instead of statutory sick pay have worked out in practice <e> <s> were any of the people who would have been eligible for statutory sick pay had they not been on strike ineligible for sickness benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the high percentage of one-parent families who are on supplementary benefit and who as a consequence gain no financial advantage from claiming one-parent benefit will the government consider disregarding one-parent benefit for the purposes of supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord hatch of lusby will forgive me if i do not follow him into the interesting territory he has just been exploring <e> <s> my noble friend lord ezra performed a valuable service today by raising this important matter and i should like to underline the case he has made in support of the motion <e> <s> that case is based on the assumption that we want to see the european community play a significant role in the world and that we want to see britain play a significant role in the european community <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has never wanted that and has always made that very clear in this house <e> <s> he did so again today <e> <s> but we are not discussing whether britain should be in the community <e> <s> we are looking to a future in which we assume that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would be prepared to consider that but within the limitations that i set out earlier

purpose and nature of this order which we are now discussing <e> <s> the changes made by these regulations as the noble lord indicated are part of the changes in housing benefit announced in the autumn <e> <s> when they were announced they created a storm of disapproval <e> <s> the social security advisory committee received representations in regard to them <e> <s> that is the highest number of representations in relation to any particular set of proposals that they have yet received <e>", "<cs> i wish to say only a few brief words and to support what the noble lord lord campbell of croy said when he described what took place during our second reading debate <e> <s> i was certainly one of those who suggested that it might be better for the power to be exercised by the home secretary on the very grounds that have been given by the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> on that day since we were also considering the bill brought forward by the noble earl lord longford we were concentrating on discrimination and outlawing discrimination and it seemed that there was a case for having all of the government apparatus if i may so call it dealing with that under one roof and that it should be within the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to my noble friend lady burton of coventry for raising such an important matter this afternoon and i should like briefly to support the general trend of her remarks <e> <s> choices at home are limited by inadequate community provision to free women from the sole responsibility of caring for small children the frail and the elderly while choices at work are adversely affected by education as we have already heard careers advice heavy domestic responsibilities employers concentration upon senior <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for his explanation of the contents of this bill and to say that we on these benches fully support it <e> <s> as he has made clear it eliminates a body which is no longer necessary the pensions commutation board which has been in operation from <e> <s> advances in medical science have made the work of the board largely routine and it does seem sensible to pass is functions over to the appropriate secretary of state who will be exercising precisely the same function as the board and will be using precisely the same tables <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> in general and with one reservation we welcome the intention to review sectors of the social security systems so long as that is not a cover for further cutting back benefits <e> <s> with regard to the review of provision for retirement i should like to ask the noble lord whether it is possible to come to final conclusions on portable pensions independently of the conclusions reached in the review of the wider issues of pension policy <e> <s> are the two not so interrelated as to make that impossible <e> <s> can the noble lord say when the findings with regard to pensions are likely to be available <e> <s> it is certainly appropriate to review the housing benefit scheme which had such a confused start and the scope of which has already been reduced <e> <s> as to two further reviews the one on supplementary benefit and the other on benefits for children and young persons these are both exceedingly important sectors and we welcome the fact that they are to be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has raised an important question this evening <e> <s> at first when i saw his question on the order paper i thought that he was contemplating the possibility of a complete separation between peerages and membership of this house and that would of course have raised the whole question of reform of the composition of this house <e> <s> then last friday i read a column headed in house briefing in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether there is any particular difficulty that is preventing agreement being reached with canada <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain the house but i should like to join in congratulating the noble lord lord campbell of croy for having piloted this bill as far as to this stage <e> <s> i hope that the bill will now pass <e> <s> we on these benches were supporters of the bill promoted by the noble earl lord longford and we regretted that it did not secure the approval of this house <e> <s> but we made clear on second reading that if that bill failed we felt that the bill introduced by the noble lord lord campbell of croy would provide a very useful function <e> <s> that we still feel and we hope that at some point in time the government may be persuaded to find time for it elsewhere so that it can be passed into law <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are committed to having a means test of some sort in this particular case as the consultative document seems to suggest will the government consider doing three things first substantially increasing the grant secondly making it available in all cases without initial means test and thirdly recovering it subsequently from estates over a certain size <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness like to put that suggestion to her right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his party when in opposition in just before they took office felt so strongly that the earnings rule should be abolished then and there that they divided this house on the issue temporarily defeating the more thatcherite point of view adopted by the labour government and explaining very carefully exactly how this abolition could be afforded <e>", "<cs> my lords if pensions have increased by less than the increase in earnings as the figures given by the noble baroness have made clear does it not mean that pensioners are now receiving a lower percentage of the total paid out in earnings and pensions than they were in <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that these amendments while related are not dependent on each other and therefore the proper procedure is to take each amendment as it comes although inevitably since the same principles are running through them there is bound to be a little overlapping between the debates on the separate amendments <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble earl for the sympathy which he has expressed on behalf of the government with the general principle behind these amendments that is to say they are anxious to see that the position of the disabled within the london transport system is safeguarded <e> <s> but the noble earl will not be surprised if i say that i am disappointed with his attitude to this particular amendment <e> <s> nevertheless we have had a very useful debate <e>", "<cs> we have had an impressive short debate on this important issue and the committee as a whole was clearly impressed by the speech of the noble baroness lady lane-fox who spoke of the wide support that exists for inserting this specific duty into the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness spoke from experience as indeed did the noble baronesses lady masham and lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the bill would be short-sighted and obsolete without this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton described it as the key amendment and i think that he is right <e> <s> the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth pointed out that we were not seeking anything impractical or anything unreasonable as i had already explained in proposing the amendment <e> <s> but of course what we say here will be governed by the terms of the bill itself which she went on to explain <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his co-operation in this matter and in view of what he said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for his very clear exposition of the contents of this bill <e> <s> there is no one general theme as he explained linking the different parts of the bill together which we can say at once that we are in favour of or opposed to <e> <s> the bill was described in another place as a miscellaneous ragbag of a bill that artificially combines wholly unconnected issues <e> <s> unfortunately that is true of a good many of the social security bills that come before this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord brimelow and to the select committee for the very thorough and comprehensive examination which they made of the negotiation to secure a successor to lom ii and it has been very useful at the beginning of our discussion to have this statement of the view of the government which has just been given to us by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> it is clear that this is an important subject yet it is equally clear i think the report brings this out that the lom convention is of a limited nature <e> <s> i think a few facts will support that contention <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will no doubt recall that in committee i moved an amendment which was in the precise terms of amendment no <e> <s> in the marshalled list today in the name of the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> the difficulty of the noble earl lord avon when faced with this amendment was that the duty placed on london regional transport in the bill is to provide transport services and <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i should like to support the idea behind this amendment namely that there should be some obligation on london regional transport to give specific consideration to and to produce proposals in relation to transport services for those who are unable to use buses and the underground railway <e> <s> something which would make certain that there will be some step forward is important <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that british standards for dispensing are not really an adequate substitute for qualification <e> <s> i share the misgivings expressed just now by the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone on that point <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals reminded the committee that during the second reading debate i quoted the words of the noble lord <e> <s> lord trefgarne just over a year ago in this house when speaking for the government <e> <s> i want to return to those words because they put the case for this amendment so well <e>", "<cs> i too am glad to hear that consideration is being given to the position of the partially sighted <e> <s> i cannot pretend that i was altogether satisfied with the reply which the noble lord gave <e> <s> i would like to consider what he said and perhaps to return to this particular subject at a later stage <e> <s> but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that there are clear principles in the bill and because of that it is not necessary to have the affirmative procedure <e> <s> is the <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals has made clear this will allow all retirement pensioners to continue to receive national health service spectacles on the present terms <e> <s> it is true that million of the million retirement pensioners are on supplementary benefit and that they will get national health spectacles as now <e> <s> but there are very many more just over that limit and only per cent <e> <s> of existing national health service spectacle-users will qualify under the new rules <e> <s> i think in particular of people on small incomes perhaps with a small occupational pension <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that the government do not believe in indiscriminate grants <e> <s> one can understand the point they are making there <e> <s> but the point that is worrying those of us on this side of the committee who have been associated with these various amendments is whether the provisions in the bill for those who happen to be on low income benefits are sufficient to ensure that there will be no economic hardship beyond that <e> <s> the government say that there will not be but we on this side of the committee feel that there may well he particularly with regard to old age pensioners and the disabled those people whose incomes are higher than the level which would bring them into benefit yet who still are on very low incomes <e> <s> i have a feeling that at a later stage we shall have to come back again to this whole question in order to be quite certain that as a result of the bill we are not imposing unnecessary economic hardship on people <e>", "<cs> i should like to support briefly what the noble lord lord ennals said in introducing this amendment and in speaking to the whole series of amendments about this part of the bill <e> <s> i should like to emphasise what he said about the question of discrimination against married women <e> <s> the eec directive of july on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security states that the directive applies to schemes which provide protection against sickness invalidity <e> <s> the non-contributory invalidity pension was designed to help those who become disabled and who have not had an opportunity to acquire a sufficient contribution record <e> <s> the review of the household duties test said this <e>", "<cs> i merely wish to say very briefly that we on these benches should like to be associated with the proposal which has now been put forward and if possible to participate in it along with the others <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> as she pointed out blind people on supplementary benefit receive per week supplement <e> <s> that is quite clearly a derisory sum <e> <s> when i raised this matter on an unstarred question in february the minister said that he understood that it had been at that level for years and that if it was uprated it would now be a week <e> <s> that is not very much but what we have to realise is that while we were prepared to pay a week years ago we are prepared to pay only a week now in terms of real value <e> <s> what we have really said is that the blind should have less and less as time has gone on <e>", "<cs> clause implements schedule which phases out the short-term child dependency allowances <e> <s> as i have explained before we on these benches support the replacement of the child dependency allowance by child benefit <e> <s> our complaint has been and remains that child benefit has not been increased sufficiently to compensate for the gradual withdrawal of the cdas a process which the schedule would complete <e> <s> thus the result has been to reduce the level of benefit <e> <s> the total child support that is cda plus child benefit which is received by a short-term claimant is today per week less than it would have been but for the policy pursued since by the present government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> he spoke rather quickly and i shall read it very carefully to make sure exactly what he said <e> <s> he said if i understood him correctly that child benefit is going up <e> <s> yes that is true but what i was objecting to was child benefit not going up by the same amount to compensate for the withdrawal of the child dependency allowance <e> <s> i gave figures in that respect <e> <s> the increase in november to which the noble lord referred is to compensate for inflation and not for the withdrawal of child dependency allowances <e> <s> he spoke about increased supplementary benefit offsetting to some extent the withdrawal but it is no satisfactory exchange to have supplementary benefit instead of a national insurance benefit to which one is entitled by right <e> <s> i do not think very much of that argument <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a short word of support for this amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord morris that franking should be abolished <e> <s> i think it is wrong that when the guaranteed minimum pension in a paid-up pension under a contracted-out <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord answer the point about the closed fund raised by the noble lord lord morris <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for presenting an answer to my various questions but he did not in fact deal with any of the questions that i put to him <e> <s> he did not deal with the question about how it was possible to share without having an increase in the pension which exceeded prices on the assumption that earnings will always be higher than prices <e> <s> he did not say what the relationship should be and what he felt about the possibility that the assumption in the paper published by the department of health and social security was right <e> <s> he did not say whether that assumption was accepted by the government or whether the government are happy about the implications of having a basic pension which is related only to prices when earnings are increasing every year faster than prices with the result that the basic pension will ultimately become so small in relation to the earnings related pension that the whole scheme as now cast will be thrown entirely lopsided <e> <s> it would be interesting to have an answer to these various points but in order to allow the noble earl to think about them a little further i will at this stage beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for raising this important subject this afternoon <e> <s> we know as the noble lord lord cockfield has said that it is one on which the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the correction of the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> she is quite right because the amendment should refer to a retirement pension but the term old age pension is so embedded in the mind of the community that it is often still used even if incorrectly <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> at the meeting with the minister to which reference has already been made there was general agreement that the inclusion of an assessment code was essential <e> <s> it became apparent that there would be a document of that kind in existence and it seemed right that there should be a reference to it in the bill <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will find it possible to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others who have spoken in support of this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me as the noble lord lord mottistone has said that this discrimination which is what it is will go in time <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be possible for the government to consider removing it in part <e> <s> a government say that they do not have million but when governments say that they do not have money what they mean is that they have different priorities <e> <s> they are spending their money on something else and one is not quite sure whether they are justified <e> <s> one is certainly not justified in saying that out of the large amount of money they spend every year this discrimination is so unimportant that million cannot be found to put it right <e> <s> but if that is so then surely a start could be made and it could begin to be removed perhaps by taking certain age bands so that within a short time it could be completely eliminated but the cost would be spread over <e> <s> it would not be so heavy a cost immediately on the government <e> <s> perhaps they would consider tackling it in that way <e> <s> however i should like to repeat again what the noble lord lord mottistone said that i am quite sure the time will come when this discrimination is eliminated <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear that we on these benches are opposed to the practice known as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his reply but it still seems to me that the government have not got to grips at least not in this house with the problems which i outlined both at the committee stage and this evening <e> <s> for example the noble earl said that if we were to link to prices or earnings whichever increase was the higher this would mean a higher burden <e> <s> he then went on to say that there would be no ratchet effect in certain circumstances and if prices happened to rise higher than earnings every year from now until some date in the future there would be no extra burden either <e> <s> so if the noble earl is saying that there is an extra burden he must be making some assumptions <e> <s> however when i asked him whether he was making certain assumptions he said that he was not making those assumptions but he did not tell me what assumptions he was making in arriving at his conclusion that there will be a higher burden <e>", "<cs> my lords at the two previous stages of the bill i supported the noble lord lord morris on this point and he has not yet had a fully satisfactory reply to the very cogent points he has raised <e> <s> neither he nor i are against the abolition of franking <e> <s> i have made clear that we on these benches welcome it but we recognise the fact that if franking is abolished it will mean that some early leavers are going to have higher pensions than they otherwise would have done <e> <s> we recognise that that will cost more <e> <s> in so far as that refers to future years it can be funded over the future but in so far as it refers to past years it puts an immediate burden on the fund <e> <s> provision has to be made immediately by those who are running the fund in order to make sure that the fund is solvent <e> <s> therefore there is the danger that with some funds this retrospective part of the proposal could put them into insolvency or could mean that some members who have stayed and not retired early will have lower pensions than they otherwise would have done <e> <s> i shall be most interested to hear whether the noble lord is now in a position to give the assurance either that that would not happen or if it does happen that the government will put it right as the noble lord suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur and the noble earl lord caithness for the manner in which they have presented their case throughout the different stages of this bill even when we have strongly disagreed with that case <e> <s> we are grateful to them too for supplying the information which we needed for our discussions <e> <s> i should like particularly to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for arranging the discussion on the severe disablement allowance which was very valuable indeed <e> <s> on the opposition side of the house from the opposition front bench the noble lord lord ennals forcefully assisted from time to time by the noble baroness who has just spoken has made a considerable contribution and so have other noble lords not least my noble friends lady robson and lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for the way in which he introduced these orders this afternoon <e> <s> as he made clear the orders provide the necessary up-rating to keep benefits in line with prices <e> <s> i think that it is fair to say that there is no significant improvement over and above that except the extensions which he mentioned to the scope of the age-related heating additions and also what he said about war widows <e>", "<cs> my lords i will detain the minister for only a moment <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> he says that they have never been a factor <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would just say again that last sentence when he was referring to the factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think my question was about benefit rates <e> <s> it was whether new benefits would be considered in some of the various proposals that are put forward from time to time if there is a surplus increasing in the fund because earnings are continually running ahead of prices <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the position at the moment that with regard to up-ratings this applies immediately during the year but under the orders will cease to do so <e> <s> that was the point to which i was referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement and to say that we on these benches share the general concern about the very serious situation in ethiopia which has been described as the most serious situation for years by the united nations world food programme <e> <s> if the european community which has a surplus could help and if the government can promote such help then we would certainly welcome that <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether he is satisfied that the all-out international effort to which the noble lord lord oram referred is likely to emerge and also whether he agrees that while there is a problem with regard to distribution there is also a very serious problem with regard to supply which at the moment has more or less run out <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury and to his committee for the production of this most valuable report <e> <s> we are also grateful to the noble lord for the way in which he introduced the report to the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has listened with considerable interest to the speeches of the noble lord lord elton and the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i hope they will forgive me if i do not follow them through all the various issues that they have raised <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on social security in general and pensions in particular <e> <s> i am assured that today is the day to do that though it is never entirely clear whether social security comes under the heading of social affairs or of the economy <e> <s> social security is designed to remove or alleviate social ills of a financial nature <e> <s> but when we consider the fact that the cost of it in is anticipated to be somewhere in the region of billion taking some per cent <e> <s> of government spending then we realise the importance of its relation to the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord the minister for his very clear exposition of the content of these two orders <e> <s> we learn from the government actuarys report which accompanies them that the surplus in the national insurance fund estimated for the current year is reduced by million to million <e> <s> that is quite a reduction although the surplus remains considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not ask the reason for proposing the extension from eight weeks to weeks <e> <s> i asked why the proposal was put forward now when the actuarys report says that full information as to the effect on the fund of the eight weeks provision is not yet known and will not be known until early next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by declaring an interest since i am an insurance broker specialising in life assurance and pensions <e> <s> i too should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his clear exposition of the contents of this bill <e> <s> if i understood him aright there are two main provisions <e> <s> some tax exempt friendly societies had in promotional literature described benefits in such a way as would take the policies that they were offering outside the permitted limits for tax exempt policies and doubts about the validity of the contracts had consequently arisen <e> <s> in the bill this is solved by excluding promotional literature from consideration <e> <s> then there was the problem of what to do about unit linked policies where an increase in the value of the units would <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for his clear exposition of the purpose and content of these regulations <e> <s> as he explained they are only an interim measure <e> <s> we are to receive further proposals and we have had an indication in the consultative document of what they will be <e> <s> if i have understood the timetable aright we shall be discussing those proposals in february <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble earl for his very clear explanation of this order <e> <s> as he explained the order increases the three rates of statutory sick pay to take account of inflation <e> <s> it increases them by per cent <e> <s> we on these benches have no objection to that in fact we would object if it were not done <e> <s> so we support the approval of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion moved by the noble lord lord beswick calls for economic and social policies which will give new life to national pride in the welfare state <e> <s> i should like to echo that plea <e>", "<cs> although that country runs a large deficit which does not appear to create inflation but less than west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger for initiating this debate this afternoon <e> <s> we have had a wide-ranging debate but of course the terms of the motion are themselves very wide <e> <s> as far as the national health service is concerned i think that there have been two sentiments predominating in our debate namely the sentiments of pride and anxiety pride in the achievement of the national health service and anxiety that we may allow it to decline <e> <s> my noble friends lord winstanley and lady robson spoke about that matter and i just want to add the comment that the confident statements that are made by government spokesmen in this house about the current position of the health service always seem to me to contrast very strangely with what one reads in almost any local paper that one picks up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord hanworth for asking this important question this evening <e> <s> i should like to support the general tenor of his remarks <e> <s> the noble earl and others have referred to the earnings-related pension <e> <s> although i feel that discussion about that is probably outside the scope of the question i cannot resist saying at the outset that i would abolish the earnings-related pension if i could and replace it with a greatly increased basic retirement pension <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord gowrie for his clear and lucid explanation of the bill <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot speak as enthusiastically about the bill itself <e> <s> i am struck by the contrast between the picture of the future so far as the tsbs are concerned which was presented to us when the trustee savings banks bill of was before this house and the picture of the future with which we are now confronted <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for her clear explanation of the regulations and to join in welcoming her advent to this complex field of social security and congratulate her upon it <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the statutory sick pay regulations were straightforward <e> <s> i think that that is right <e> <s> i do not want to say anything about them except to draw attention to the fact which is not strictly within the regulations but is related to statutory sick pay that the public accounts committee in another place said during the course of the past week that one in three sickness payments made to staff under the governments devolved statutory sick pay scheme were found to be wrong <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a little way to go yet before we have that scheme exactly as it ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i am very disappointed with that reply <e> <s> it seems to me that i answered in advance some of the points which the noble earl raised as objections <e> <s> i explained how the system would work <e> <s> i think i made it very clear indeed that the shares would be held for the employees that that would not just mean those who happened to be employees on the particular day and that the same applied in regard to depositors <e>", "<cs> if i may add to what my noble friend has said on this matter it seems to me that the two matters which concern the kensington society who are worried about the future of holland park are first whether the borough will have the resources necessary in order to deal with that park which is more than just an ordinary park and therefore might make a drain on their resources which an ordinary park would not <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can assure us that the resources are available and that there will not be any lessening of the amenities which at present exist on account of financial stringency on the part of the borough <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness explain the role of the social security advisory committee in the consultation <e> <s> presumably the green paper will be submitted to that committee but will the final proposals of the government after consultation be submitted to it <e> <s> that procedure regrettably was not followed in the case of the supplementary benefit regulations dealing with board and lodging <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that some of us never wanted a state earnings-related pension scheme but wanted a higher basic pension and would be prepared to agree to the abolition of the earnings-related pension if and only if it were accompanied by a substantial increase of something like per cent <e> <s> in the basic retirement pension <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating that lengthy but important statement <e> <s> there will be general relief that the period of waiting and speculation is over and now the period of consolation <e>", "<cs> consultation my lords <e> <s> whether there will be any consolation for the noble baroness and the government remains to be seen but there is some consolation for me in putting to the house this proposition that we shall require to consider what has been put before us by the government and we shall need to analyse it in order to see whether it is in fact the great review the wide-ranging review of social security that we have been promised or whether or not it is a piecemeal cost-saving exercise as has been alleged <e>", "<cs> my lords after two and a quarter hours of statements we return now to the social security bill <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for the speech that she made some time ago when she gave a very comprehensive exposition of the contents of this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stallard suggested this bill will perhaps seem somewhat old hat after the publication today of the green paper and it may be a little difficult to concentrate on the contents of the bill when more interesting and controversial matters are being widely discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that i have not completely understood it and will therefore have to read what he has said in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for his explanation of the contents of this bill <e> <s> it is a modest bill and i want to speak very briefly about it <e> <s> we have been told that a flat rate is to be levied on insurance companies for the purpose of recouping the cost of the supervision of the insurance industry and that the amount to be raised in this way is likely to be in the region of million <e> <s> it is rather like the pupils being asked to pay the headmasters salary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter referred to some article i think by mr steel in a newspaper <e> <s> i do not want to refer to that i have not read the article in question <e> <s> i think it is entirely irrelevant to the merits of the particular amendment before the house at the moment <e> <s> i think it is important to consider the merits and i regretted very much that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did not do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger for raising this important subject this afternoon <e> <s> it has provided us with the opportunity at an early date to discuss the governments proposals <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington has given us a fairly comprehensive resum of those proposals <e> <s> i think the government are to be commended for undertaking the reviews but it seems to me that they have left a pretty short period of time for consultation to take place <e> <s> three-and-a-half months covering the holiday period does not really seem long enough <e> <s> there are in the proposals some measures which we would support and many about which we will want to be strongly critical <e>", "<cs> i should like to enter a plea that the registry should be a tracing registry and not a registry of documents or that if there is to be a registry of documents it should be at the joint office of the inland revenue superannuation fund and the occupational pensions board <e> <s> i suggest that they should become the registrar if a registry of documents is felt to be essential <e>", "<cs> it stays as it is in the bill with no further change <e>", "<cs> i do not think it does <e> <s> however i shall consider what the noble lord has said and perhaps return to it <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord very much for his comprehensive reply to these amendments <e> <s> the amendments were designed to make the working more simple by removing the administrative problems created by having these three different tiers by the very simple procedure of excluding the first and extending the payment by employees throughout the range of earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether former foster children remaining in their former foster parents home are now to be exempt <e>", "<cs> it appears from what the noble earl has said that invalidity benefit is going to be made subject to taxation even though the government have not yet made it so <e> <s> that is an important admission on the part of the government this evening that that is what they intend to do <e> <s> if the government are able to restore the abatement and yet intend to proceed to taxation it destroys the argument that the abatement was introduced in the first place as an interim measure pending the introduction of taxation <e> <s> it leaves the saving of money as the only argument in favour of it <e>", "<cs> the impression had certainly got about that as the government had done nothing as yet to apply taxation they were not now intending to do so <e> <s> that impression has been dispelled by the noble earl this evening <e> <s> there is nothing else that i can add to what i have already said except to repeat that we shall undoubtedly return to this matter on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply to this amendment <e> <s> one of the things that she said was that the three rates were introduced in order to give an incentive to people to go back to work but that does not apply in the case of sickness benefit <e> <s> it seems to me that it is wrong to have different principles applying to benefits which are used for the same purpose <e> <s> certain categories of people get sickness benefit others get statutory sick pay <e> <s> it does not seem to me right that we should have a different set of principles for the one than for the other <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the case that has been put by the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> he has put the case extremely well <e> <s> as he pointed out the majority of carers are married women and it has always seemed very unfair that they should not get an allowance which as the noble lord has said is not a very large one <e> <s> i strongly support the aim of this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> taking up the point made by the noble lord lord mottistone i do not know whether he is really comparing like with like <e> <s> he is saying that because as he understands it per cent <e> <s> is the average of the increases that are made in pensions in payment we ought therefore to increase preserved pensions by the same amount <e> <s> but if we are dealing with final salary schemes then up to retirement those people who now may be receiving only per cent <e> <s> in retirement have certainly received an increase in their pension which has taken account of inflation have they not <e> <s> if inflation has been running at higher than per cent <e> <s> then they have had a higher increase than per cent <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the comparison with the preserved pension what is happening with the preserved pension compared with what is happening with the man who is still in his final salary scheme <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble baroness has said i beg leave to withdraw this amendment and i shall look forward to seeing the government amendment dealing with this matter in due course <e>", "<cs> in view of those reasons i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> just before we approve the amendments perhaps i may thank the noble baroness very much indeed for accepting them and for her cooperative attitude <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to say that i think the noble lord lord bruce of donington has performed a service by tabling this amendment although he does not intend to press it <e> <s> it is important to know precisely what is the burden that it is felt necessary to put on the insurance industry in order to pay for the supervision of that industry <e> <s> i shall be most interested to hear what the noble lord the minister has to say in answer to that important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady young for her explanation of the purposes of this designation order <e> <s> as she said the object is to enable the third lom convention to take effect in united kingdom law <e> <s> it is perhaps not the occasion to debate in great detail the contents of the convention but we have the opportunity to welcome most warmly the successful conclusion of this third set of negotiations <e> <s> in saying that i am at one with the noble lord lord oram <e> <s> these negotiations are inevitably complicated and take a long time <e> <s> the eec council has to negotiate with the eec member states <e> <s> the eec council has then to negotiate with the eec commission <e> <s> there has to be negotiation between the acp states and then finally between the acp and the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i am rather disappointed by that response from the noble baroness <e> <s> but i should like to thank the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lord lord monson for their support of this series of proposals <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington said that this was not targeted as effectively on the lower paid as were the governments proposals <e> <s> this was the argument put forward last time which i felt was valid then but i do not feel that it is valid in respect of these particular proposals <e> <s> according to my calculations the government proposals mean that at a week for those who are contracted in at the present time and paying the contracted-in rate there is a payment of under my proposal it is <e> <s> so there is a difference of p there <e> <s> at per week the government proposal is mine is <e> <s> at per week the government proposal is and mine is <e> <s> so they are at lower end of the scale and the rates are not substantially different from those that are achieved by the government procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her explanation of this series of amendments <e> <s> i should like to thank her in particular for dealing with the problems associated with section c to which the noble earl lord buckinghamshire and i drew attention at the committee stage <e> <s> the two big problems have been removed <e> <s> the first was in lines to on page which would have removed a discharge under existing scheme rules <e> <s> the second was in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for her explanation of the amendment regulations <e> <s> seldom has any set of regulations received such a bad reception as was accorded earlier this year to the new regulations dealing with board and lodging <e> <s> there was as the noble baroness will recall severe criticism of them from all parts of this house <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> b moved by the noble lord lord gridley and with the leave of the committee to speak to amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name and the names of a number of other noble lords <e>", "<cs> i have just one point to make <e> <s> it seems to me that the central issue at stake is whether the successor bodies will be as good a guarantee for providing any extra funds which may be necessary to secure the accrued benefits as is the national bus company <e> <s> can the noble lord lord belstead say whether he thinks that the successor bodies will be as good a security from the point of view of making up any deficit in the funds in the future relating only to the accrued benefits at the time of transfer <e> <s> if he does not think so obviously the employees must be in a worse position <e>", "<cs> i should like just to ask the noble lord one question arising out of that reply <e> <s> what is to happen should any of these companies be privatised <e> <s> may they then still remain within the local government superannuation scheme <e>", "<cs> i think the statement which the noble lord has given to the committee this evening is very reassuring <e> <s> i should like to consider carefully exactly what he said <e> <s> however it seems that some of the fears which have been expressed are groundless and that steps are being taken to see that people will get their accrued entitlement within the local government superannuation scheme preserved within that scheme and that employers in the new companies will be able to continue membership in the local government superannuation scheme which will probably be the most desirable outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank those noble lords who have expressed their support for this motion my noble friends and also the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i much appreciate their support <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton said that it was rather a late stage at which to have a disagreement with another place and that we must not keep the bill hanging about but i would have thought that the new information about the possible legal position which we have had this evening and about which we had much discussion in our earlier debates is in itself sufficient ground for keeping things hanging about for a little longer so that we may make sure that this legislation is not confiscatory because that is really the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for her explanation of these orders <e> <s> as this is the last july when we shall be discussing up-rating orders perhaps i may be permitted to say that this is the eleventh successive year in which i have had the privilege of taking part in these discussions <e> <s> i do not know whether that is a record <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether it is intended to phase that out as must surely happen if it is never increased to meet inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her a question arising out of her last point which is about this per cent <e> <s> increase in pensions <e> <s> i did ask her how much of that was due to the link with earnings which is no longer there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by agreeing with the noble lord lord bottomley about the need to integrate to harmonise which is the word he used income tax and benefits <e> <s> however unfortunately that had to wait for a further investigation and a further review <e> <s> i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for giving us the opportunity to discuss these two important subjects today but like the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble baroness lady faithfull i feel that we might have done better to take them one at a time <e> <s> i want to concentrate on the second part of the motion and on pensions in particular <e> <s> i begin by declaring an interest in that i am an insurance broker specialising in pensions and life assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with considerable trepidation to speak on this important legal question in the presence of so many distinguished lawyers <e> <s> however when we are discussing a matter of such basic fundamental importance as individual rights it is perhaps appropriate that the voice of the ignorant layman should be heard particularly if it is heard briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness for repeating this lengthy but important statement <e> <s> as we have heard the statement is accompanied by a white paper but as the noble baroness lady jeger has said we have not yet had time for consideration of that white paper <e> <s> we shall certainly want to consider it very carefully and i hope that when we come to do so we shall find that the figures we need are contained in it <e> <s> we did not find them in the green paper and if they are not in the white paper either certainly we shall be moved to protest <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady jeger we look forward to an early debate on the white paper well in advance of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble baroness lady hooper for her clear explanation of the contents of the order <e> <s> as she says there is not much change introduced this year <e> <s> as she pointed out there is no increase in the rates <e> <s> she felt that that was creditable because there had been a per cent <e> <s> increase in prices <e> <s> we have to bear in mind that contributions are linked to earnings and that earnings have been increasing faster than prices so that we would anticipate a buoyant revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for her explanation of this order <e> <s> as she made very clear it provides a routine rise in benefit to take account of inflation and as the noble baroness lady jeger indicated to that extent it is not controversial though we on these benches have also criticised the concept of the three rates <e> <s> however the order provides the opportunity to ask one or two questions <e> <s> it is an opportunity of which the noble baroness lady jeger has taken advantage and i should like very briefly to reinforce one or two of the questions which she put and perhaps to put another <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble baroness lady serota in thanking the noble and learned lord lord templeman for the way in which he has introduced the report to us this evening <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord and to sub-committee e for the informative report that they have presented on a complex subject <e> <s> the report throws light on some difficult legal matters <e> <s> this is most helpful to a layman like myself <e> <s> i can well understand that those who oppose united kingdom membership of the european economic community and who do not think that the united kingdom should be bound by the treaty of rome might find the report irksome reading <e> <s> but for those of us who believe that our future prosperity and the preservation even of our democratic system depend on increasing european collaboration and unity there is nothing in it that is disturbing <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hanworth has performed a valuable service this evening by drawing the attention of the house to these important matters <e> <s> he has as the noble lord lord auckland has pointed out covered a wide field <e> <s> if there is one point that we should like to drive home from these benches this evening it is that there is a need for a comprehensive constitutional review and reform a look that is at the whole of the constitution and an attempt to reform it overall and not merely by piecemeal methods from time to time <e> <s> we have to examine how the different pieces of the constitution fit into one another <e> <s> such a reform among other things we would hope would aim at achieving reform of the electoral system reform of the composition of your lordships house decentralisation and devolution of government and the establishment of a bill of rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady serota and her committee for the most valuable report which they have provided <e> <s> it is particularly useful to have the summary of the commissions view as expressed in the memorandum and the views of the european parliament and of the economic and social committee <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that all these bodies including the select committee want to see independent taxation with the individual adult as the unit <e> <s> certainly we on these benches agree most warmly with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> first may i welcome the fact that the government recognise that very many people wish to retain the option of being paid in cash at post offices <e> <s> i think that is a most important point <e> <s> secondly while we agree with the moving of the uprating date to april previous experience both with this government and with their predecessors has shown that when the reference period which is used to determine the rate of inflation is moved beneficiaries can suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now return to consideration of the position of voluntary organisations after the abolition of the glc and metropolitan county councils <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord bottomley for raising this very important matter this afternoon and for drawing the attention of the house to the disturbing situation which prevails <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that we on these benches regard the early introduction of a uniform system as essential <e> <s> do the government accept that in order to secure agreement the uniform system must be proportional <e> <s> by what date has legislation to pass through this parliament in order that a uniform system may be operative for the election <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now return to the debate <e> <s> i should like to begin by saying that i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for providing us with the opportunity to examine the social effects of the governments policies <e> <s> like him i find them in many ways adverse <e> <s> i was astonished to hear the noble lord lord young of graffham say if i understood him aright that the governments policies are not designed to have social effects <e> <s> if the government are involved in social security health education housing and the economy what they do is bound to have a social effect and we are entitled to review it <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill most warmly on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness lady masham for the very clear and comprehensive explanation of the bill that she gave the house <e> <s> i also pay tribute to mr tom clarke who piloted the bill through another place and who was successful there in reconciling different views <e> <s> before i say more i apologise for the fact that i may have to leave the house before the end of this debate because i have to catch a train <e> <s> i am particularly sorry about that because it will be the first time that i have left early a debate in which i have been speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for her comprehensive explanation of the contents of the bill <e> <s> however i must support the protest made by the noble baroness lady jeger about the fact that this second reading debate on a very important bill comes on so late in the day <e>", "<cs> i thought that i referred to amendment no a i think i mentioned it at first <e> <s> it is not my intention to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the reply which she has given but in my view it is not a very satisfactory one <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the outset that when the noble lord lord mottistone mentioned insurance brokers he reminded me that i should have declared an interest in rising to speak earlier in that i am an insurance broker specialising in the pensions field <e>", "<cs> i am glad to know from the noble baroness that the government have sympathy with the thinking behind this amendment <e> <s> i was very interested in what she had to say about the consultations which are going on and the consultations particularly with the occupational pensions board <e> <s> in view of her statement that it is the intention of the government to ensure that people who enter personal pension schemes provided by bodies other than those at present covered by the policy holders protection act shall not be in any worse position and that they shall enjoy the same protection i do not wish to press this amendment at the moment <e>", "<cs> at the present moment in order to contract out a scheme has to undertake to provide a certain level of benefit <e> <s> you cannot get away from that and it is laid down <e> <s> the change that this bill makes is that for certain categories of contracting out it will be possible to do so by making a minimum contribution to a pension and not guaranteeing the benefits at all <e> <s> in those circumstances it seems to me and this amendment refers only to minimum contributions there is a very strong case for imposing a limit <e>", "<cs> i regret one thing that the noble baroness said and i welcome what she said about another <e> <s> i regret that she is committed to the maintenance of the per cent <e> <s> but i welcome what she said about the position of those who are already in occupational schemes and whether if they transfer the per cent <e> <s> should be paid <e> <s> when we come to amendment no <e> <s> we can perhaps go into that matter a little further <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble baroness does not think that my amendment would achieve the purpose which she has in mind <e> <s> i am sorry that she does not think it satisfactory <e> <s> we shall look forward to her amendment and shall judge whether we consider that it will achieve the purpose that she says she has in mind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> this amendment appeared in the first marshalled list under my name and i did in fact submit it <e> <s> however i do not intend to move it <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady trumpington described the choice that was given by the set of proposals contained in amendment no <e> <s> and in the others to which i have spoken as feeble <e> <s> yet they give a choice to every eligible person in the country <e> <s> those who are at present in occupational schemes would have the opportunity during the six-month period to switch to a personal pension scheme if they wished <e> <s> those who come to the point where they are eligible to join in the future will have the opportunity to make the choice at that time <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord swann for the reasons that have already been expressed <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble baroness lady trumpington one question <e> <s> is there anything in the bill which prevents an employer making compulsory a group death-in-service scheme that is making it a condition of service <e> <s> it might be possible to have the option to change available for members of the pension scheme and to run quite separately alongside it a group death-in-service benefit scheme which could be made a condition of service <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble baroness lady turner and the noble lord lord ennals for their support of this amendment <e> <s> i regret that the noble baroness lady trumpington has felt that she must turn this down along with most other things <e> <s> i think that she has to answer the argument and i do not think that she has put forward by the three bodies that i mentioned <e> <s> it may be said that age concern excellent organisation that it is has obviously a vested interest in looking after the interests of old people <e> <s> when it comes to the social services committee in another place and the social security advisory committee they are grappling with problems across the whole range of social security <e>", "<cs> if what the noble lord says has any validity it would seem to me to apply now yesterday and tomorrow just the same <e> <s> it does not seem to be an argument that is related to our particular situation at the moment <e> <s> it would seem to be an argument against pensions of any size at any time and one that you could bring out just as strongly against pensions in the year as pensions this year <e> <s> the noble lord nods that is so yet the government are placing an obligation without knowing what the circumstances will be at that time on people years ahead to pay at certain rates <e> <s> they are not at all concerned about it and they are very anxious that they should not be involved in paying this bit extra at the present time <e> <s> i feel this is a matter on which i should like to test the feeling of the committee and that i must therefore press the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i made it clear in our debate on second reading of this bill that in the liberal party we had a long record of arguing for a much higher basic pension and that we felt that if we could obtain a much higher basic pension it should be possible to leave earnings-related pensions to the private sector whether they are occupational or personal pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i must confess that i am very surprised that the government should have concluded that generally speaking no uprating is necessary <e> <s> we shall certainly want to examine most carefully the evidence on which the government have based this decision <e> <s> it would appear to conflict with evidence which we have received from other sources <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow me to say that i welcomed the statement where there are advances in particular categories <e> <s> i made that point but i had criticisms as well <e>", "<cs> i take it that the sponsors of the bill agree with the minister as they have not spoken in a contrary sense <e> <s> it seems to me that there could be as much argument about what was the interest of the disabled person as about what are medical grounds <e> <s> it is left extremely vague and wide <e> <s> nevertheless in view of what has been said and in view of the time i shall not pursue this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the second amendment is not mine <e> <s> i therefore did not say that it will be spoken to <e> <s> i have no doubt that it will <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank all the members of the committee who have participated in the debate and who support this amendment <e> <s> each of them referred to sections of the community who are under who would be affected by the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could explain why it is that the government are always so pleased when they are able to say that they have raised the tax threshold so that fewer and fewer of the people at the bottom of the scale are caught in the income tax net <e> <s> is it not correct that the prime minister has said that it is quite wrong that so much should be taken from those at the bottom <e> <s> the thing is to raise the thresholds <e> <s> but if the noble lords argument is to be followed surely this means that we are not inculcating that spirit of responsibility as far as national matters are concerned with those people that we are letting out of the income tax net <e> <s> yet the noble lord comes along and says we must get people into paying for local government even if they are right at the very bottom of the pile even if they are the poorest of the poor <e> <s> but not apparently when it comes to national matters <e> <s> can the noble lord explain the difference between those two in the governments thinking <e>", "<cs> is it not correct that expenses will be treated as income as far as these people are concerned so that if they receive as has already been said expenses in excess of the earnings disregard which is now instead of that that will go against their benefit <e> <s> that is the point to which objection has been taken since expenses are often considerably in excess of that amount <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply and i recognise that at this time of night he perhaps could not go into it in more detail <e> <s> i think it was important that this aspect of the implications of this bill should be considered <e> <s> we are relying more and more on means-tested benefits and we ought to consider whether this is the way in which we want to see the social security system go <e>", "<cs> i should like to re-emphasise that the question of having an independent forum of appeal is extremely important <e> <s> i am glad to know that the government are still considering it <e> <s> i wait with interest to see what is their final decision on the matter <e> <s> i may well return to the matter at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> of the four amendments to which the noble baroness has referred the only one which is mine is no <e> <s> za <e>", "<cs> it has been widely understood that the governments intention operating through this new bill will be to substitute loans in a great many cases where there would now be grants <e> <s> it is understood to be the governments intention to move towards a system in which loans will be the norm rather than grants although as the noble baroness has made clear grants are not ruled out <e> <s> it is a fact that this understanding of the governments intention has caused a great deal of apprehension and concern among people who have to deal all the time with those who are unfortunate enough to require supplementary benefit <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks the feeling is that if you switch over to a system which is mainly of loans and deduct the repayments from the income support you will be putting people on to an income <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment which the noble lord has just moved and also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which has a very similar purpose <e> <s> as i understand it under the amendment that is now before the committee grants will be available for furniture and household necessities whereas under amendment no <e> <s> payments for removal expenses and essential furniture and essential household repairs will not be repayable <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter correct in saying that amendment no <e> <s> excludes loans <e> <s> it seems to me that amendment no <e> <s> does but amendment no <e> <s> says <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the idea that special needs needs that are admitted by the government to be special should depend on a fund that is cash limited must give rise to considerable concern <e> <s> it would certainly appear to mean that whether an award however justified is made or not this must depend on how much cash is in the fund at any time <e> <s> it would seem to be true as the noble baroness said that those who claim early in the financial year would appear to be better placed to make sure of getting their award than those who come later in the year <e> <s> if some are not to be in danger of not getting their special needs met it is difficult to see what the cash limitation means <e>", "<cs> i am not quite clear about this <e> <s> the bill seems to say that in making an award an officer must take into account any relevant allocation under clause <e> <s> that is stated in line on page <e> <s> then when one looks at clause one sees that it says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those who have supported this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the second answer of the noble baroness was rather different from her first <e> <s> her first answer seemed to suggest that the effect of the amendment would be to give an entirely new role to the social security advisory committee whereas her second reply seemed to suggest that this was something that it was doing already but that we do not need to put it in the bill which is a fairly familiar answer <e>", "<cs> i accept the explanation of the noble baroness and assume that her second answer is the one on which we must place the most reliance <e> <s> as that was for me the more satisfactory of the two i am rather pleased about that although i am disappointed that the noble baroness is not more enthusiastic about the precise proposal in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that reply because she seemed to be moving some way towards meeting the objections which have given rise to this amendment and i am grateful for that <e> <s> however i should like to read very carefully what the noble baroness has said and perhaps she too may like to read what i said and we can possibly consider the matter again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness argue that the amendment would not leave the officer with that flexibility <e> <s> the noble baroness is not answering that question <e>", "<cs> i regret that the noble baroness has not agreed to think about it again <e> <s> after all i should have <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the answer for which i am grateful was entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i do not think the noble baroness answered my question when i asked if the applicant having shown that he had no resources was to be refused a loan on the ground that he had no resources to repay it <e> <s> but i shall not pursue it further tonight <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this position is very unsatisfactory <e> <s> it is clear that the officer must have regard to what is in the kitty <e> <s> that is written into the bill <e> <s> the amendment would have taken it out <e> <s> the noble baroness opposes the amendment <e> <s> she must feel it is necessary for some reason that the officer should continue to look in the kitty although she says that there is no possibility of it running out of money <e> <s> the two things seem to be at odds <e> <s> we shall certainly want to come back to this issue but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully support this amendment and i should like to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment has precisely the same effect as amendment no <e> <s> in the names of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to congratulate the sponsors of the bill in another place mr tom clarke and in this house the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady hooper for explaining some of the content of the orders <e> <s> we on these benches agree with the moving of the up-rating date <e> <s> we think that it is sensible to align the benefit year and the tax year but i do not think that what the government are doing is fully understood in the country <e> <s> that is one reason why they have received a great deal of hostile criticism about the smallness of the increase <e> <s> nevertheless previous experience has shown that when the period of reference is altered beneficiaries can suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> what exactly is the commitment if it does not entail indexing <e> <s> could it mean that the value is allowed to decrease to the point of extinction <e> <s> the commitment requires some definition <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness can explain what would the position be if the person goes back into serps and the extra money comes back after he has transferred back <e> <s> where does it go then <e> <s> is it reclaimed by the department of health and social security <e> <s> what happens to it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has reminded the house she agreed during the committee stage that the per cent <e> <s> incentive should not be paid to those who switched from contracted-out occupational schemes to contracted-out personal pension schemes <e> <s> i should like to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the object of that amendment was to put into the bill what the noble baroness had agreed to and to have it there on the marshalled list in case there was no amendment forthcoming from the noble baroness in relation to this matter <e> <s> the government are proposing to deal with it as she has explained by giving themselves the power to exempt certain prescribed employment which it is intended although not specified will include the per cent <e> <s> incentive as applied to switches from contracted-out occupational to contracted-out personal pension schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it seems to me that this would be a very considerable simplification and that appears to have been the feeling of other noble lords <e> <s> nevertheless i shall not press the amendment at this point but shall consider again what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal first with the technical objection that the minister made if the amendment were passed then i am sure that he could table a satisfactory amendment of his own given all his experience and skill to meet the point that he so clearly outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support the amendment which has been moved so ably by the noble baroness <e> <s> we agree that the abolition of the -year rule hits some groups of people particularly hard and we believe that the unemployed should be regarded as one such group requiring special treatment <e> <s> for those reasons we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady turner and also to the noble lord lord ennals for the support which they have given to the amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for his sympathetic response to it <e> <s> the noble lord has made it very clear that the government are committed to the concept of equal ages for the retirement of men and women <e> <s> he also stressed as every other speaker has stressed the importance of flexibility <e> <s> indeed i would underline again that what we are seeking is not a fixed retirement age at which everybody must retire but a normal retirement age which can be moved up or down with corresponding adjustments in the pension to suit individual choice <e> <s> the noble baroness lady turner made a very valid point when she illustrated how retirement five years earlier for women could be disadvantageous to those in occupational pension schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> i should like to support too the concept that the amendment is designed to support namely that child benefit should be increased in line with prices each year as in fact is the case with national insurance benefits <e> <s> child benefit replaced family allowances and income tax allowances for children <e> <s> when that was done we on these benches welcomed it as the first step towards a tax credit system <e>", "<cs> my lords i much appreciate the support that has been expressed by so many speakers in the debate <e> <s> many have underlined the point that i made at the outset that at least in the board and lodging regulations there are exemptions for people under who would otherwise be affected <e> <s> we are not saying that we like the regulations <e> <s> we have made it clear that we do not but at least they have exemptions whereas for the category that we are now considering there are no exemptions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment and testify to the fact that the anxiety referred to is still very prevalent for the reasons so cogently expressed by previous speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred as i did to the offset of mortgage interest in the case of home income plans <e> <s> i certainly welcome that <e> <s> under a home income plan somebody may raise a mortgage on his house in order to purchase an annuity <e> <s> out of that he pays the interest on the mortgage and the balance is the additional income which helps him to meet his expenses <e> <s> he never actually receives the mortgage interest <e> <s> it never comes into his hands because it is retained by the life office which is providing the plan <e> <s> it seemed reasonable for the government to offset the mortgage interest and i am glad that they have done that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on one point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if i understood the noble lord aright he was concerned that there was no reference in the amendment to the notional amount of included in family credit in order to provide for meals for schoolchildren <e> <s> the noble lord will no doubt recall that yesterday we were informed that the figures were purely illustrative <e> <s> in fact the figure of is not in the bill <e> <s> the actual figures are not yet determined and when they are they will appear in the regulations <e> <s> no doubt when they are fixed this amendment will be taken into account if it is then part of the bill as i hope indeed it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposition is an extremely simple one <e> <s> what the amendment is proposing is that instead of having these appeals heard by a body which includes people some of whom sit on the housing committee and some of whom feel a responsibility for the decisions of that committee they should be heard by an entirely independent genuinely independent appeal process <e> <s> since such a process exists for the rest of social security it seems reasonable that it should be the one used <e>", "<cs> my lords i too saw that grouping <e> <s> it was no doing of mine <e> <s> i think that they are two separate points <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness attempted at all to deal with the complaint put forward by the law society of scotland <e> <s> if she wishes to do so i shall be happy to give way <e> <s> it seems that the noble baroness does not wish to deal with that point <e> <s> i shall remind the house what it was <e> <s> the law society of scotland indicated that the word possibility diminished to an unacceptable extent the rights that the clause gives to claimants <e> <s> it suggested that there should be a reasonableness test incorporated by way of amendment <e> <s> that is what we have done <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble baroness has shown why the alternative suggested in the amendment is unsatisfactory to the government nor do i think that she has dealt with the legal point that i raised with regard to the view of the law society of scotland <e> <s> in those circumstances i should like to take the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that there might be other debts and that this was one of the factors that the officer would be seeking to evaluate in trying to judge the likelihood of repayment <e> <s> she said that if there were other debts that might affect the size of the loan <e> <s> but if we are talking here of needs not of whether the person should have a loan to purchase a new car or a matter of that kind but whether an established need is to be met then it is difficult to see how the other debts can be relevant to whether or not payment is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness for her statement <e> <s> it has made much clearer how it is intended that the fund shall work and it is encouraging to know that there will be no cash limit <e> <s> particularly in view of that i still do not see why it is necessary in those circumstances for the officer to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall want carefully to study what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say briefly that i have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said by the noble lord lord pitt and the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> it seems to me that the operation of this clause needs considerable explanation to find out who will be affected as the noble lord lord ennals said the extent to which they will be affected and when this would take effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it was sir edward gray who said that the lights were going out all over europe and as the noble baroness spoke i could not help thinking that the dimming of the lights in the chamber was perhaps a significant comment on what is happening to democracy in this country because so much of what governs the everyday life of individuals is put into regulations and is not fully or properly debated by either house <e> <s> that is a very serious situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that i was not in any way challenging the fact that we were to have a flat-rate system <e> <s> as the noble baroness said we discussed that at an earlier stage of the bill and i am not seeking to re-open the question <e> <s> i am sure that it would not be proper for me to do so <e> <s> but i am saying that some people who have great experience of pension schemes and are operating them all the time for instance the cbi the national association of pension funds and the nationalised industries pension group believe that there could be a move of younger people out of occupational pension schemes which could have a destabilising effect <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches an grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i should like to make it clear at the beginning of my comments that we on these benches would certainly be against abuse <e> <s> i abuse is proved we should certainly want to see i tackled <e> <s> however it is very difficult to tell how much the increase is due to the increase in poverty as the noble baroness lady jeger suggested due for example to unemployment and how much is due as i noticed in a quick glance in the past few minutes that the social security advisory committee suggests to a reservoir of unmet needs which is only now being fully appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for the even-tempered and helpful way in which she has piloted this bill through this house in which she has been ably assisted by the noble baroness lady hooper and the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> there have been many notable contributions to our debates from the opposition benches from the cross-benches from the government benches and not least from my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e> <s> there have been some deep and strongly felt differences but they have all been expressed in good tempered debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord henderson of brompton on the new addition for the severely disabled which his amendment has extracted from the government <e> <s> of course it is not what he wanted but it is a concession and as far as it goes it is welcome <e> <s> what worries me is this <e> <s> when we discussed this matter in committee many examples were given of severely disabled people who because of the number of additions for which they could qualify would in fact be worse off if they were to be translated to the new arrangements <e> <s> the noble baroness made it clear that they would not be translated because of the transitional arrangements which the government had provided <e> <s> however in the committee we were concerned about the newly severely disabled people who would become severely disabled once the bill and its provisions were in force and people who would be as severely disabled as those who were quoted during our discussion in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady young for her very <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose the amendment and support the general trend of the remarks of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> as the committee is aware articles and deal with more majority voting in the council in order to speed up decision-making and the completion of the internal market and they concern a marginally increased role in consultation for the european parliament <e>", "<cs> the title of this particular section as the noble lord lord bruce of donington has explained is economic and social cohesion <e> <s> as the noble lord has said that is something with which we can all agree <e> <s> he particularly instanced the subject of unemployment and personally i hope that the members of the community will act together on the question of unemployment along the lines that have been suggested this week in a report by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> it would appear that this is a fairly routine uprating statement compensating for the per cent <e> <s> increase in inflation <e> <s> on previous occasions we have made it clear from these benches that we support the move of the uprating date to april <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the third reading of the bill this afternoon <e> <s> i made clear on second reading the attachment which we on these benches have to the concept of european union and our support for the single european act as a modest step towards that goal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord gladwyn and lord harris of greenwich have amplified my opening remarks with a wealth of argument and therefore i can be brief <e> <s> i regret that the government do not see their way to supporting this amendment <e> <s> however it does not bind the government to anything <e> <s> they could heed the amendment if it were passed or they could resist it as they please <e> <s> i believe that if it were passed it would be an important expression of opinion by this house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord winstanley outlined the general situation with regard to housing very clearly and comprehensively <e> <s> other noble lords have looked at particular aspects and i should like to concentrate for a minute or two on the relationship between housing and social security <e> <s> this is particularly important because of the increase in poverty in recent years poverty amid comparative affluence <e> <s> those with incomes under per cent <e> <s> of the supplementary benefit level have increased by per cent <e> <s> since an increase from million persons to million persons <e> <s> according to a parliamentary answer only up to one-thirds of that has been caused by raising the supplementary benefit level and the other two-thirds is due to other reasons among which of course is unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i am bound to say that we on these benches are also unhappy about this proposal <e> <s> we are glad as was the noble baroness lady jeger that the period of reduction is to be reduced from six to four months <e> <s> we also note that the reduction is to apply only to newcomers <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether it is correct as the noble baroness lady jeger said that the new cases will lose an average of per week as compared with now and that it will be greater in particular cases <e> <s> also is it correct that as a result most claimants will fall into arrears <e> <s> we know that evictions have been increasing in recent years <e> <s> will they not be further increased by this measure <e> <s> the statement says that the saving will be million <e> <s> in view of the drawbacks is it worth making

burden is being placed upon them which many will find difficult to sustain <e> <s> is it correct for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for explaining the content and purpose of these regulations but i am bound to say that we on these benches remain unhappy about the principal proposal contained in them <e> <s> it is after all a straightforward cut in benefit <e> <s> the original proposal it is true has been modified <e> <s> it is now to be for four months instead of six this representing the elimination of the possibility of a mortgage trap but

fact refer to that point in the course of making the allusion to which she has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness <e> <s> lady trumpington for her explanation of

in fact refer to a regular payment today although i went into it last thursday <e> <s> no doubt the noble baroness will want to look that up to see precisely what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are determined to retain the unsatisfactory retrospective triggering system are they prepared to consider having a seven-day rolling triggering average period instead of a monday to sunday

asked an unstarred question on this subject <e> <s> in putting the question he covered that area comprehensively and he received a comprehensive reply from the noble baroness lady hooper <e> <s> other

am sure that the whole house wishes to congratulate the noble lord on having been elected to such an important position of leadership within the community <e> <s> his speech was made with all the authority of his years in the european parliament since and his leadership for five years of the european democratic group together of course with his distinguished service to the national farmers union in many capacities and latterly as its president <e> <s> we look forward to many equally authoritative contributions from him in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely saying that as i understood it the noble lord lord plumb said in his evidence and in his speech this afternoon that he believes there will be a need for further resources <e> <s> i have no doubt he believes that many other things must be achieved as well <e> <s> one may possibly depend upon the other <e> <s> he has expressed a view in favour of an increase in community resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept that that was the treasury estimate <e> <s> it seems to me that the government hesitate to agree although mrs chalker said in evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his exposition of <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that there are some pensioners who have no income <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord satisfied that after losses in housing benefit are offset against gains in family credit all the parents concerned will in fact be fully reimbursed for the loss of free milk <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if the amount of housing benefit does affect the total amount of resources available for the family and a compensation is given under one benefit but a deduction is made from another a family may not have any extra money in order to make good the loss of free milk <e> <s> is that not logical <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the steeper tapers which are to be used in connection with housing benefit will accentuate the poverty trap by increasing the rate of withdrawal and that the child benefit freeze will broaden the poverty trap by including more families in means-tested benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker who was not a member of the sub-committee i can express the gratitude of the house to sub-committee c of the select committee for the production of this most interesting and thought-provoking report and to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for the way in which he introduced the report to us this afternoon <e> <s> it is a paradox that while the possession of a highly developed social security system is one of the distinguishing marks of the member states of the european community certainly of the original members nevertheless this is an area in which there is little concerted community action <e> <s> it is also an area as all speakers so far have pointed out where there is a lack of comparative information readily available yet the sub-committee has managed to accumulate within the pages of the report a good deal of such information <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale put the basic question <e> <s> he asked whether social security policies have an impact on the operation of the common market <e> <s> in theory the answer appears to be yes <e> <s> people may move to a country where social security is at its greatest in order to have that protection <e> <s> employers who have an extra burden of national insurance and insurance contributions may be at a disadvantage competitively compared with employers in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl say how many people now receive the supplementary additional requirement on account of disability and how many will receive the disability premium and the severe disability premium under income support <e>", "<cs> my lords how many pensioners will receive transitional protection <e> <s> will they not all suffer a gradual decline in the real value of the benefit they receive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief general comment on the motion so ably and comprehensively moved by the noble countess <e> <s> i join in the thanks to her which were expressed by the noble lord lord carter for providing us with the opportunity to discuss these regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i might ask another question before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> would he agree that the pensioners referred to in his letter to me of th december will in fact all suffer a decline in the real value of their benefit contrary to what he states in the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now return to the social security bill <e> <s> i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his clear explanation of the contents of the bill <e> <s> it seems that after every major social security act we require further legislation in order to make the necesary corrections <e> <s> this bill in addition to correcting the mistakes made in the social security act introduces a number of measures most of which seem designed to claw back money from claimants <e> <s> in these circumstances we find it difficult to welcome the appearance of the bill in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider the possibility of adding a supplement to attendance allowance for the very severely disabled unable to live alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is generally agreed that my noble friend lord ezra has provided a most valuable service by raising this important matter tonight <e> <s> in common with my noble friends on these benches i look forward to the completion of the internal market by in the belief that it will bring benefits to the community as a whole and to our own country particularly in respect of financial services <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank the noble lord lord ennals and the noble baroness lady turner of camden for their support of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals was correct in saying that the object of the amendment is to confirm the <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> time limits would be welcome and thay may well be dealt with in the manner suggested by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i particularly support the amendment because it includes a right of appeal with regard to the attendance allowance <e> <s> in june my noble friend lord wigoder secured the support of the house for a similar appeal to be introduced from the decisions made in connection with the social fund <e> <s> i hope that today the committee will support the extension of the normal right of appeal to the attendance allowance <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what was said by the noble baroness lady turner of camden <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> we must come back time and again to the basic fact that child benefit replaced income tax child allowances <e> <s> it is dangerous to lose sight of that fact <e> <s> the governments green paper <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not be surprised if i say that i find that a rather disappointing answer <e> <s> it seems that it is all too difficult and that we are so near to the scheme coming into practice that we must not change anything in it <e> <s> we need not necessarily change it from the date of inception <e> <s> it could be changed from a year in advance but i should like to consider the points that the noble lord has made and reserve the right to come back at report stage perhaps seeking an amendment as he suggested that would cover other benefits as well as the one covered here <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to express support for the amendment <e> <s> it would not be right to leave all the exemptions to be prescribed <e> <s> i do not see why we should not write into the bill what we regard as the important exemptions <e> <s> it seems to me that these three categories are reasonable <e>", "<cs> it was very clear that the noble lord lord henderson and i were talking about the same category of young persons <e> <s> he mentioned in his second intervention that there were some of them <e> <s> indeed i mentioned that figure in my opening remarks <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i did not entirely understand the reply that the noble lord gave but that is probably my own stupidity <e> <s> the bill reads that <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that everybody who is covered by prescribed circumstances will receive benefit for a prescribed period or that some people in prescribed circumstances will receive it without a prescribed period being imposed <e>", "<cs> i shall read carefully the noble lords answer to see whether i understand it a little better and perhaps return to the subject <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not find the ministers answer terribly satisfactory but i shall not pursue it further this evening <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i oppose the question that this clause stand part of the bill and i do so for several reasons <e> <s> i do so first because it turns the yts into a compulsory scheme and the voluntary nature of the scheme was one of its basic principles <e> <s> that principle was restated at a meeting of the youth training board as recently as th july <e> <s> moreover sir bryan nicholson the former chairman of the manpower services commission wrote to mr norman fowler on behalf of the msc on rd july in these terms <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter observed that i had said that we should not legislate <e> <s> but i say that we have legislated and imposed a severe penalty on people who deliberately choose to remain unemployed <e> <s> that penalty has been described by a government minister as not lightly to be dismissed <e> <s> i am convinced that the number of to year-olds who remain deliberately unemployed is small <e> <s> all the statistics bear that out although there has been some anecdotal evidence to the contrary this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which has the same effect as my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i support this in preference to my own <e> <s> when the abatement was first imposed at the age of it was argued that those over years with an occupational scheme had retired and were not genuinely seeking work <e> <s> as i said at second reading bank managers were much cited in that connection <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord say in view of his remarks about the wise use of resources why he distinguishes between an occupational pension exceeding per week and an investment income exceeding per week <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that under the noble lords proposals somebody could be entitled to unemployment benefit even if he had an investment income exceeding per week even though he is over <e> <s> is that not so <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and a all seek on an ascending scale to index link the amount of occupational pension which may be enjoyed by someone over the age of without suffering abatement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord might be slightly more friendly towards this amendment as it is only enabling and does not compel the secretary of state to make any payment if he feels along with the minister that to do so would add complications and that there is no need to do so because of the existence of other provisions <e> <s> however single payments for items other than insulating or draught-proofing would presumably be cash-limited <e> <s> this amendment would have been a way of ensuring that anything extra required as a result of severe weather would not be cash-limited <e> <s> it is clear however that the noble lord is not attracted to the amendment and i do not intend to press it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i greatly welcome the ministers statement that it is the intention of the government to make a wide range of information widely available <e> <s> i also welcome support from all parts of the committee for the idea that that information should be available <e> <s> i believe that there is considerable support for the idea of putting a provision in the bill which will ensure that that is done not only this year and perhaps next year but regularly every year <e> <s> perhaps the minister will undertake to submit for our consideration at the next stage of the bill an amendment along those lines which is more balanced than he believes this one to be <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i hope that he will see fit to submit an amendment which will cover what he has said the government intend to do and what so many members of the committee hope will be done <e> <s> i shall also perhaps attempt to put down a more balanced amendment <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord wigoder secured the approval of this chamber on th june when the social security bill of that year was being discussed for an amendment which set up an appeal procedure of the nature that the noble baroness wants to see <e> <s> that was passed by this chamber by votes to <e> <s> i very much hope that this place has not changed its view though there are not that number of noble lords in the committee to indicate that <e> <s> however i hope the committee will remain in favour of instituting an appeal from the social fund <e> <s> i think that on the last occasion the appeal procedure was actually rejected in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this scheme take away from the class of severely disabled people a statutory right to benefit and replace it with cash-limited charity <e> <s> why are the government so reluctant to include this additional benefit for very severely disabled people within the statutory social security system <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble baroness lady jeger for supporting the amendment <e> <s> as the minister says it is quite true that this is not a new situation it is an anomaly which already exists <e> <s> i referred to a case in which the social security commissioners fully sympathised with a lady who found that she was worse off as a result of accepting work and moving from supplementary benefit to family income supplement <e> <s> the object of this amendment is to prevent that anomaly from continuing as it will under the new arrangements as they stand at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment introduced by the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> i recently said that it appeared that the governments proposals were replacing a statutory right to benefit with cash-limited charity <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carter has said the scheme is now a fact and this amendment would bring it within the statutory social security system <e> <s> i believe that that is required by all the organisations speaking for the disabled including the disablement income group <e> <s> it has made clear the fact that it also wishes to see these arrangements and any which succeed them within the statutory social security system <e>", "<cs> my lords those who will be able to receive income support for the whole period covered by the clause and year-olds will not be subject to a prescribed period <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord accepts that <e> <s> if he accepted it and when he said in his original speech without any time limit it appeared that he did my amendment would be consistent with what he was saying <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not able to accept the amendment but i do not want to pursue it any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i first apologise to the noble lord lord seebohm for having omitted his name from the sponsors of the bill at the beginning of my remarks <e> <s> that was very remiss of me as i know of his continued and deep interest in this subject <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his support this evening <e> <s> indeed i should like to thank all noble lords who have supported this amendment <e> <s> as i think the noble baroness lady jeger said this is indeed a non-party issue and that has been made clear by the support which has come to the amendment from different quarters of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and i have no hesitation in agreeing to what he suggests <e> <s> i shall retable the amendment <e> <s> i look forward with interest to the amendment that the government will propose on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ennals and confirm what he has said about the amendment that i moved on th july <e> <s> in reply the noble baroness lady trumpington made the concession to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> after the noble lord lord ennals had said what he has just reported to the house the noble baroness repeated the assurance at col <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for explaining the content and purpose of this order <e> <s> nevertheless i want to reinforce the arguments which have been made by the noble baroness lady jeger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i accept that in purely mathematical terms that is correct <e> <s> however let us suppose that the figure is per cent <e> <s> and is increased to per cent <e> <s> that would be an increase of per cent <e> <s> i imagine that the noble lord would not set the alarm bells ringing because of that <e> <s> conversely had the figure risen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> which is a comparable rise i imagine that he would not have gone to panic stations in those circumstances <e> <s> the question is whether the figure of per cent <e> <s> has any significance at all <e> <s> i rather think that it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to this amendment and with the leave of the house to amendment no <e> <s> which is in my name <e> <s> the house will recall that at committee stage i tabled an amendment which would have obliged the government to prepare a report on the social fund every year and to list the refusals from grant or loan and summarise the reasons <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale said on that occasion that he thought that was unbalanced as it did not deal with the acceptances <e> <s> therefore at report stage i tabled an <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two matters which we particularly want to get clear <e> <s> it is difficult to get them clear from the discussion we have had so far <e> <s> first will a cash limit be applied from the outset <e> <s> on a previous occasion the minister told us that that was not so but at some point at a later stage than when the fund actually commences when it had been seen how things were working out a cash limit would be imposed <e> <s> i am not clear when that point will come <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord skelmersdale on the way in which he has presented the governments case throughout our discussions <e> <s> he has done so with good humour patience and if i may say so a considerable mastery of his brief even if it has been a brief with which i have often disagreed <e> <s> i also appreciate the co-operation which has been possible between this bench and the opposition front bench as well as with noble lords in all parts of the house <e> <s> i recall the part played with regard to the review of child benefit by the noble lord lord seebohm and the noble baroness lady faithful <e>", "<cs> i am assuming that we shall come on to the state scheme premiums actuarial tables amendment regulations subsequently so i will not say anything at all about them at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we must again thank the noble lord for his explanation of the regulations <e> <s> i should perhaps declare an interest in the matter as i <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted once again to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his explanation on this occasion of no fewer than five sets of regulations <e> <s> the regulations complete the framework for the new regime which comes into force next week <e> <s> the house may think that they do so just in the nick of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself and noble friends with the tributes which have been paid to the late lord ramsey <e> <s> i speak as a non-conformist and i can say that during his years as archbishop lord ramsey was held in the highest regard by all branches of the christian church and indeed by the general public outside <e> <s> it was of significance to us on these benches that in his younger days he was in fact on the list of approved liberal candidates <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate has explained the content of this measure very clearly <e> <s> it would perhaps hardly be appropriate that i as a member of the united reformed church should speak in any detail about its contents <e> <s> the measure is concerned with the church of england and its welcome intention to strengthen its presence in priority areas <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly anticipate the next measure which we are to discuss which enables the church of england to make provision for co-operation with other churches <e> <s> i greatly welcome such co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords in my previous intervention i said that i greatly welcomed co-operation between the different christian churches <e> <s> the united reformed church of which i am a member does of course include two traditions the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the independent living fund is a temporary measure <e> <s> if that is so how long do the government envisage that the temporary period will last <e> <s> what do they have in mind to replace it on a permanent basis <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and the two amendments associated with it to all of which my name is added <e> <s> as the noble lord has clearly explained the amendments would eliminate the exemption from community charge for those people with severe mental handicap <e> <s> it would replace the exemption with a maximum per cent <e> <s> rebate for certain categories of very old and disabled people receiving certain benefits and for those registered blind or partially sighted <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved so effectively by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and to which my name is attached <e> <s> it seems to me that the issue is very simple <e> <s> people who give their services to help the disadvantaged in return for pocket money should not have to pay the community charge <e> <s> as we have heard residential community service volunteers work away from home <e> <s> they work full-time they receive board and lodging and a small subsistence allowance which may amount to or per week <e> <s> they are not eligible for benefit <e> <s> it is true that they will be eligible for the per cent <e> <s> rebate of the poll tax but in certain areas for example inner london even after receiving the rebate they will still be paying some to per week of their community charge <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all those who have taken part in the lengthy debate on this section of the bill <e> <s> when i look back to the example which i gave at the outset it not only seems a long time ago but it also seems to me that we have had no satisfaction that the mrs f in the example which i gave would not suffer in the way which i described <e> <s> this amendment would prevent such suffering <e> <s> why need there be such an elaborate defence against the introduction of this simple amendment which would serve to put the matter right to put peoples minds at rest and to make it less necessary for the committee to spend a great deal of its time examining the detailed procedure which will be used if the bill eventually becomes law <e> <s> it seems to me that this lady mrs f will suffer in the way i have described i am not satisfied that that is not so <e> <s> i believe that my amendment would put her into a satisfactory position <e> <s> therefore i wish to test the opinion of the committee on this proposal <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am very disappointed with the answer the minister has given on this point <e> <s> i can see that there is no understanding at all on the governments side of the committee at least on the front bench on the governments side of the case which we are endeavouring to put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for raising this important matter this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to underline much of what she said and take a stance rather different from that adopted by the noble lord lord bauer <e> <s> before i do that i recall the fact that we are shortly to hear the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of salisbury and i look forward to that with anticipation <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that the commons has rejected this amendment and in such <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker in the debate who was not a member of the sub-committee i should like to thank sub-committee a for the production of this most useful report <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord kearton for the way in which he has presented it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what kind of response the government have had to the consultative document on hostel charges and when they expect to produce proposals based upon their reflections on the response <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for repeating the statement made in another place by the secretary of state <e> <s> in the course of the statement the secretary of state referred to pensioners earnings and naturally we shall all be gratified to learn that overall they are tending to increase on a satisfactory basis <e> <s> however the government have to remember that some pensioners rely entirely on the basic pension <e> <s> they tend to be the oldest among them <e> <s> those people have indeed lost as the noble baroness said through the breaking of the link with earnings in the early days of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place by the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> it seems that government policy is based upon a combination of high interest rates and the restraint of public expenditure <e> <s> as the statement explains public expenditure is continuing to decline as a percentage of national income <e> <s> it is expected to be less than per cent <e> <s> in the current year <e> <s> one of the prongs of this two-pronged policy is in the main high interest rates designed to rein in private expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly in support of the case so ably put forward by the noble countess lady mar <e> <s> as i understand the position having listened to the noble countess disabled persons who receive board and lodging and care in private houses at present can receive an additional income support payment to help cover the cost of care <e> <s> however the new regulations provide for the same income support to be paid to all claimants with help for board and lodging coming from housing benefit <e> <s> housing benefit relates only to rent and makes no payment for care <e> <s> those who would have qualified for an extra income support payment for care under the new regulations will not receive any payment for care at all <e> <s> transitional protection will be provided for existing claimants <e> <s> this indicates the governments awareness that a problem is being created <e> <s> existing claimants on transitional protection will therefore gradually lose their payment for care <e> <s> new claimants will be at a disadvantage from the start <e> <s> there will be nothing for new claimants in care or for those in supported lodgings from next april <e>", "<cs> my lords as i did not serve on the committee i should like to begin by thanking its members for producing this most interesting and informative report <e> <s> i should like also to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for the thoughtful way in which he introduced it to your lordships house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my remarks by agreeing with the noble baroness lady macleod of borve when she says that this is an important bill <e> <s> i believe that the house will agree that we have had a useful debate this afternoon in which we have heard a variety of points of considerable interest which will no doubt influence the future development of the bill as it goes through the house <e> <s> the bill has been generally welcomed <e> <s> my noble friend lord meston made it very clear that we on these benches fully support it even if we have a reservation or two about some of the many propositions contained in it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that those who are entitled to family credit and do not get it suffer doubly through the fact that child benefit is not being uprated <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that the best means of ensuring that all receive their dues is an index-linked universal benefit offset by the operation of the tax system on the remaining taxable income <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what proportion of claims are now being adjudicated within the legal time <e>", "<cs> i fully take the point made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and no doubt the word requirement would be more satisfactory <e> <s> i believe the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was thinking along somewhat similar lines <e> <s> i should like to read very carefully what he has suggested and perhaps return to this matter at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my appreciation to the noble and learned lord for his ready acceptance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his reply to this amendment <e> <s> i should like to consider carefully what he has said <e> <s> i had thought that it might be along the lines he has put forward <e> <s> i should like to read it carefully and to consider whether we should pursue this matter any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his explanation of the purpose and content of the orders <e> <s> we are approaching the first anniversary of the introduction of the new social security regime <e> <s> when are we to have a report from the government explaining exactly how the new scheme has worked out and who have been the gainers and the losers <e> <s> we read alarming reports from some of the voluntary organisations and we like to be able to set against them what is revealed by the governments monitoring <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i agree very much with the noble baroness lady david that corporal punishment is particularly inappropriate for children in care many of whom are there because of physical abuse <e> <s> i also agree that there is a great difference between receiving corporal punishment at the hands of the parent whatever view one may take of that and receiving it at the hands of a relative stranger <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david told us that each year approximately young people leave care <e> <s> research indicates that per cent <e> <s> of young people leaving care go to live on their own <e> <s> this compares with per cent <e> <s> of the general population of that age <e> <s> when the noble baroness moved amendment no <e> <s> she reminded us that for those in the to age range benefit available has been reduced <e>

lord russell for their support on the amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor thought that it would be too complicated and heavy <e> <s> however the noble lord lord mishcon pointed out the number of other cases where similar procedures are followed <e> <s> indeed i mentioned in my remarks that it already works with some social services departments and it is merely a question of extending what already exists over the whole field <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that reply <e> <s> he said that he expected that local authorities would monitor the work of the complaints system but expectations are not always fulfilled <e> <s> i was glad to note that the subject will be referred to in guidance <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his willingness to see whether there is anything further in that respect that he feels he can do <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord prefers the text as it stands in the bill and in his opening remarks indicated his regret at the loss of the words significant harm <e> <s> i believe that i now understand him to say that he is coming round to the point of view that the word significant should be eliminated <e>", "<cs> at any rate that was the view expressed by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a word on the amendment as its purpose is virtually the same as that of the following amendment no <e> <s> to which i referred earlier <e> <s> we were concerned that neglect did not appear to be covered by any of these definitions <e> <s> the only difference between our amendment and that of the noble baroness is that she has added the word neglect to the definition of harm whereas we should have added it to the definition of ill-treatment <e> <s> i should be happy with either and i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation of the present position <e> <s> i was glad to hear him say that this bill maintains the balance of power between the courts and the local <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if we discussed amendment no <e> <s> with this amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> wants to insert at the end of line <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation which seems to me to be satisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation of the reasons

to the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble baroness lady faithfull for her backing about professional support <e> <s> i am encouraged by the fact that the noble and learned lord saw at least some aspects of that which he felt were necessary <e>", "<cs> i meant to say in the course of my introduction that it was a recommendation of the cleveland report page that something of this kind should be introduced into legislation <e> <s> clause may perhaps answer what was suggested there <e> <s> i shall examine that and also what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is once again indebted to the noble lord lord kearton and to sub-committee a for producing another thorough report on the financial future of the european community <e> <s> it has also had the benefit of hearing from the noble lord lord cockfield fresh from his four years as a commissioner in brussels <e> <s> we are delighted to see him in the house once again taking part in our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> i understand his point about the fact that there must be a limit to the amount that is put on the form <e> <s> one could add bits <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support very briefly this amendment and also amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> that amendment deals with those over five years of age and the provision for them <e> <s> the point i want to make is that activity out of school hours and in school holidays is important for the children but its availability and continuation is essential if in many cases the parents particularly for example lone parents are to be able to continue to work <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment and those associated with it to which i have put my name <e> <s> as has already been <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as we have heard it applies to foster children only <e> <s> in that connection it is relevant to take note of the fact that the national foster care association supports the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment and the amendments associated with it so ably moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i understand the distinction made more than once by the noble and learned lord in the course of our discussions on this aspect of the bill regular income should come from social security and exceptional and essential needs should be met by the social services department where they cannot be met by social security <e> <s> that is an excellent principle in the abstract <e> <s> however i believe that we have tried to convey to the government the peculiar situation in which young people under find themselves today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for the answer he has given <e> <s> it seems to be a question in part at least of whether we are thinking of a minimum standard of care which would apply to everyone or whether we are thinking of a degree of care which would depend on the circumstances of the parent <e> <s> i am not quite clear which the noble and learned lord has in mind but i am glad to know that the matter is to be considered further <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> naturally i feel disappointed that he could not accept the amendment but i see the logic of his arguments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord feels that the power of the court in wardship to give short-term and long-term directions to which i referred in my remarks has been unsuccessful or unhelpful in any way or has worked against the welfare of the children <e> <s> i know that he can say that the court has parental responsibility and so it is not the same as other cases but putting that point on one side does he feel that the operation of the power has been such as to suggest that it should now be abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that when the rate of inflation is falling the present historic period of reference helps those on benefit and that when the rate of inflation is rising people on benefit suffer because they lag behind <e> <s> in view of that fact have the government considered returning to a reference period half in the past and half in the future so that an estimate has to be made each year for say six months from november as to what the rate of inflation for the year will be <e> <s> i do not necessarily advocate that system but would it not allow likely future trends to be taken into account as well as past experience <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i moved a series of amendments designed to establish the independence of the panels of guardians ad litem from the local authority <e> <s> at the end of the discussion i withdrew those amendments after the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor explained that it was the governments intention to develop the panels on a regional basis <e> <s> it seemed that that would provide an opportunity to distance the panels from any particular local

suffered a severe stroke <e> <s> i had the help of speech therapists and so i was able to learn something of what they do the importance of what they do and of their fears for the future <e>"]
