["<cs> my lords i hope that it is in order for me to make the briefest imaginable intervention in this debate in my capacity as chairman of the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> it is simply to express <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord geoffrey-lloyd on his maiden speech in your lordships house <e> <s> now that his floodgates have been so joyously opened i hope that we may hear from him on many other occasions <e> <s> i have the privilege to sit under his chairmanship on the leeds castle foundation and i know what an outstanding job he has done not only for the preservation of that particular piece of britains heritage but also in making it profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say something as chairman of the national heritage memorial fund we do not want to be dogs in the manger about the word heritage <e> <s> however <e> <s> although as the noble baroness said i did on a previous informal occasion say that we did not really mind whether it was called the heritage commission or not i think that on consideration i should like to take those words back <e> <s> the disadvantage of using the word heritage is first that i think whatever happens it is liable to get the new commission muddled up with us <e> <s> secondly heritage as we understand it has so much wider a connotation than the various things which will be looked after by the new commission <e> <s> that has been demonstrated by what we have been able to do during the two and a half years of our existence when we have grant-aided not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my real objection is to the use of the word heritage <e> <s> heritage conservation i find rather less objectionable than the other title <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to be the first speaker to be able to congratulate the noble lord lord mcalpine on his vigorous humorous imaginative and sensitive maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords hope that we shall hear him on many other occasions <e> <s> i should also like to join in congratulations to the noble earl lord munster on his maiden speech <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord fanshawe for having initiated this discussion <e> <s> i venture to speak in it as chairman of the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> i and other trustees of the fund have the privilege i may say the pleasure of spending in defence of the heritage such sums of your lordships money and that of other taxpayers that are allocated to the fund from time to time by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> in the four years of our existence we have been amazed to discover how rich and varied has been what we have understood to be the heritage <e> <s> i am often asked if we have enough money to fulfil our responsibilities <e> <s> of course the superficial answer has to be no <e> <s> one cannot have enough of a good thing <e> <s> that being said however i am glad to go on record as saying that it is my opinion that hitherto within the ambit of what is reasonable and practicable her majestys government have given us an extremely square deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to speak in this debate in my capacity as chairman of the national heritage memorial fund and i should like to begin by thanking the noble earl lord gowrie for the very kind remarks he has made about the fund and indeed about myself at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> i have no doubt that those thanks will be echoed by the noble baroness lady airey when her turn comes to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from the eton town council which prays that your lordships will give consideration to the introduction of legislation to prohibit the sale and use of lead weights on fishermens lines on freshwater rivers lakes and reservoirs in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may get an oar in edgeways this bill had a jolly rough passage in another place <e> <s> indeed so long drawn out were the debates that they were described as a filibuster <e> <s> i think that is unfair and unfortunate <e> <s> it is unfair because if your lordships read the reports you will find that generally speaking they are not the stuff that filibusters are made on and it is unfortunate because it may make the uninformed believe that those who oppose fluoridation of the water supply are a crazy bunch of cranks and fanatics <e> <s> this is by no means the case <e> <s> of <e>", "<cs> my lords sir humphrey would have said government is about stability about keeping things going about preventing anarchy about stopping society from falling to bits and still being here tomorrow <e> <s> and perhaps sir humphrey would have added minister i advise that the second reading should be late at night because that will help to bamboozle their lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to add my congratulations to those which have already been expressed to the noble lord lord teynham for his excellent and enjoyable maiden speech <e> <s> i hope we shall have many more speeches from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak for a few moments on those three properties <e> <s> nostell priory already belongs to the national trust and the only thing that is of interest there is its contents that is the chippendale furniture about which the noble lord has spoken <e> <s> as regards weston park both the contents and the house are involved and the same applies to kedleston <e> <s> certainly so far as concerns the national heritage memorial fund we look upon the contents as being as important possibly more important than the houses themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been already said doctors never agree <e> <s> unfortunately i do not share with the noble earl this great learning which he has displayed to us this evening about medicine <e> <s> i shall study very carefully what he has said <e> <s> the question now is whether or not we should divide on this issue <e> <s> here i am in a slight state of bewilderment since i am not familiar with these affairs <e> <s> however i believe that if this amendment was passed it would lead to financial implications which possibly may be outwith the powers of this house <e> <s> thus if i may i should like to reserve the right to come back to this question on third reading <e> <s> otherwise i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely clear whether this amendment is being moved or not but i should nonetheless like to express myself in complete agreement with what the noble lord lord ennals has said about it <e> <s> i start by congratulating the noble baroness and thanking her for having as one might say come up with her amendment <e> <s> i do not think it is good enough though <e> <s> a point that has not really been mentioned in the debate this evening is that putting fluoride in the water supply is a very serious matter quite apart from the medical side because it is being put in not to make the water wholesome and drinkable but to medicate us <e> <s> that is a matter which i think has been described not without justice as an infringement of the liberty of the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise because i shall not be able to stay until the end of this debate as i have a long-standing engagement to take the chair at a dinner at eton this evening <e> <s> yes we eat there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not hear the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a very vigorous political society which is for people normally over the age of <e> <s> politicians from every possible side of the political spectrum come to talk to us <e> <s> i put a plug in here <e> <s> one of our miseries is that those of the left are reluctant to come <e> <s> i cannot think why <e> <s> they would get a warm and loving welcome <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the public concern over the indoctrination of partisan political views in our schools is very soundly based <e> <s> indeed it has been recognised by the secretary of state for education and science and i have a nasty feeling that it is on the increase <e> <s> at the moment the indoctrination which is causing concern is the promotion of left-wing revolutionary views <e> <s> it would be just as objectionable if the views promoted were extreme right-wing views <e> <s> it is against both right and left-wing indoctrination that amendments nos <e> <s> and and amendments yet to come are designed to protect us <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that when the noble earl lord swinton was summing up after the debate on amendments nos <e> <s> and he said that he would take the matter away and think about it <e> <s> i hope that when he does so he will not close his mind altogether to trying to find some form of legislation which will satisfy both sides of the committee <e> <s> i think that we are dealing with an emergency <e> <s> that is why we ought to have legislation and we ought to have it quickly <e> <s> i am all for an inquiry but inquiries take a long time and i am not sure that we can afford to wait a long time <e>", "<cs> i would not contest what the noble lord says <e> <s> we are very fortunate at eton and etonians are very lucky people <e> <s> however it is just the same wherever one is one must try to achieve a balance <e>", "<cs> i entirely disagree <e>", "<cs> i think that the key word is promotion <e> <s> it is perfectly all right for people to express partisan views so long as they are balanced <e> <s> what is wrong and what this amendment seeks to prevent is the promotion of views to the exclusion of others <e> <s> i am not saying the amendment is well-worded but that is the object of the exercise <e>", "<cs> but we had others to counter-balance it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we can all be grateful for some of the amendments to this bill that the government have put down but i fear that they have not suggested anything worthwhile to meet the argument which was put forward by noble lords on all sides of the house that we ought to legislate specifically to prevent our children from being indoctrinated with partisan political views <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first add my congratulations to those of the noble lord lord strabolgi to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as a trustee of the british museum and as chairman of the national heritage memorial fund i am well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness lady cox is to be congratulated on having initiated this debate <e> <s> she did it democratically <e> <s> i believe that she is speaking of the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment not simply because captain hook was an old etonian and he was <e> <s> but for a slightly more personal reason <e> <s> i suspect that i and my brother the noble earl lord wemyss who is not present this afternoon may be the only two members of your lordships house who in company with their grandfather and six other children had two plays especially written for them to act in by james barrie <e> <s> not only did he write the plays for us he also rehearsed us personally <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that it was a most terrifying and awe-inspiring experience <e> <s> however in spite of being a frightening man he was a great lover of children and i know from what i remember of him that if he had realised what was going to happen he would have been absolutely fascinated and delighted by it <e> <s> it is for that reason that i hope your lordships will support the amendment which is extremely imaginative <e> <s> it is right that the work of james barrie which has given so much pleasure to children for so many years should continue to bring comfort to those who are in trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be considered entirely inappropriate if as provost of eton i say a few words in this debate <e> <s> i promise to be extremely brief <e> <s> as provost i am as completely embedded in the private sector of education as to use p g wodehouses immortal phrase a prawn in aspic <e> <s> the private sector is not concerned in the bill at all <e> <s> however certain lessons from the experience of the private sector may be of value <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that there is no such thing as a parent association at the college and that is the greatest good fortune and a boon <e> <s> they exercise a certain amount of power but in a subtle my dear boy way rather than anything in the nature of public meetings thank god <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady cox explained the reasons for the amendment with her customary clarity and conviction <e> <s> i listened to what the right reverend prelate the bishop of london said with deep respect and considerable encouragement <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> first however i must apologise to the committee because i shall not be able to stay very long <e> <s> i am supposed to be in cambridge in about minutes so i shall have to hurry <e>", "<cs> my lords i heartily support the amendment of the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> there are many parents of handicapped children who are extremely apprehensive about the possibility of these special maintained schools being phased out which as we know is the policy of some authorities <e> <s> the parents feel that this is a dangerous sociological fashion <e> <s> what they want above all is that the maintained schools which are absolutely super should remain <e> <s> i hope that the government will feel able to give this little thing which will bring much comfort to many parents <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clarify that point <e> <s> the point is that the dean and chapter are the custodians of the map in a moral sense <e> <s> that does not mean that they do not own the map but it is rather different from merely owning it <e>", "<cs> my lords i first congratulate the noble viscount lord daventry on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was excellent <e> <s> secondly i thank the noble lord lord blake for having instituted this interesting debate <e> <s> i have to take issue with him on one thing that is his figures about the funding of the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> he has maligned the government <e> <s> they do not give us million a year they give us million <e> <s> this does not make it any less remarkable that we have managed to spend million the noble lord was right there in eight and a half years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always delighted to go to the exchequer <e> <s> i have been very successful there <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am extremely grateful to the noble earl lord perth for initiating this debate <e> <s> i hope that he will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord birkett not only on having won the lottery for short debates but on having chosen this subject when he won it <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will look seriously at making it possible for a nationwide lottery to be held <e>"]
