["<cs> my lords when i decided some months ago to take part in this debate there were storm clouds gathering and a deep depression was developing on the other side of the atlantic and i have to admit

we followed the wishes of mr trudeau and his friends we would alienate eight of the provincial premiers and a large proportion of the population of those provinces on the other hand if we heeded them and rejected the federal governments request we would be accused of interfering in canadian domestic affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by extending my congratulations to the right reverend

also express my appreciation to the noble lord lord brimelow for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the bma is rather splitting hairs because if you put a literal interpretation on this and if i ask for an intimate search of somebody do i have to name what sort of drug i am looking for and if by any chance the wrong drug turns up when an intimate search is being carried out what happens <e> <s> this business of naming a certain number of drugs in regard to which you may ask for an intimate search but excluding others seems to me to be absolutely beside the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg

said in my speech it is my first experience of introducing a bill on second reading which can be quite awe-inspiring even with such a simple bill as this <e> <s> i expressed the hope that the bill would be supported from all sides of the house and my hope has been completely fulfilled because very full support has been shown from all sides <e> <s> i should like to say a few words of appreciation for the full support given to the bill by my noble friend the minister and her majestys government <e> <s> i think all noble lords welcome the assurance from my noble friend that there

clear whether the noble lord lord monson was speaking to both the amendments but i should like if i may to speak to them both because i believe that they are virtually synonymous <e> <s> as i explained at the second reading of the bill it is clear and concise and its objective is to increase the maximum penalty for major trafficking in class a drugs from years to life imprisonment <e> <s> it is not aimed at the small-time pushers but at cynical profiteers who are in for the big money <e>", "<cs> with so many noble and learned lords around me i feel somewhat diffident about replying but i am sure that i will be corrected if i am wrong in what i say <e> <s> i believe that it is the case that a judge can recommend a minimum sentence <e> <s> another point which may reassure the noble

the nice things that he said about my presentation of the bill <e> <s> i am also a little worried that i shall be drawn into legal matters with all the expert and learned lords around me <e> <s> but

commend the speed with which it has been brought before parliament following the report of the home affairs select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords possibly the only element of the bill that has caused some disquiet is that of reversing the onus of proof to the accused to show which of his assets do not derive from drug trafficking <e> <s> i have heard that some people think that that provision is rather un-british because in this country we are innocent until proved guilty <e> <s> i feel sure however that i do not need to remind your lordships of the type of persons with whom we are dealing wholly without conscience or concern for the suffering they are spreading among the young people of this country they are vultures growing fat on the misery of others <e> <s> i suggest that we must do all we can to make the punishment fit the crime <e> <s> we must ensure that there is no easy hiding place for traffickers their moneys or their assets <e> <s> i give this bill my unreserved support
