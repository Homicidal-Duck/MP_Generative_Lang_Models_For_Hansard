["<cs> my lords being both a farmer and a forester i have found the bill very interesting <e> <s> after the and wars large areas of scotland and england and i believe of wales too unfortunately i have not been able to visit wales for many long years but i hope to do so again fairly soon were planted up <e> <s> in many areas the planting has grown into substantial forests <e> <s> they have covered big areas of land with rather bleak-looking timber <e> <s> looking at it from the hilltops i would call it mono-coloured gloom <e> <s> it does not look very interesting it is not a very good habitat for animals <e>", "<cs> one way of curing this problem rapidly is to bring back horses <e> <s> if the land is repopulated with horses we shall save a great deal of trouble <e> <s> we cannot produce nearly so much without them <e> <s> i put forward the idea i do not know whether it is a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister rises perhaps i may mention that the other day i was listening to a conversation between a couple of farmers who were arguing about the measures that were being taken <e> <s> one farmer was quite keen the other rather doubted them <e> <s> i doubt them myself <e> <s> one claimed that the energy being measured in the hill country in the highlands had been there for a long time <e> <s> i doubt that from what i have heard <e> <s> i believe that the later tests carried out for acid rain show quite definitely that that was the time when the measures rose to a dangerous level <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for what he has told us <e> <s> if it is decreasing and the danger will soon pass i am very glad to hear that <e> <s> i was not acquainted with the position not being in the area <e> <s> what i have heard was very comforting <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question about the amendment <e> <s> i am a little mixed up but i think that this is where the point comes in <e> <s> some years ago i had a lot of trouble <e> <s> i was snowed up badly <e> <s> at that time the local authority arranged for various farmers with tractors and lifters to help out <e> <s> they were not contractors <e> <s> they were chosen because they were in a strategic position and able to open up the roads <e> <s> they did so and they also opened up a lot of fences and dykes as well <e> <s> one part of the country has been suffering from that ever since <e> <s> i believe there is some method of insuring people if that happens to them but it has not appeared so far <e>", "<cs> in this case it will hardly come under the contractors being paid money <e> <s> the contractors are selected because of the key position which they hold so that they can keep the roads open <e> <s> the authority says youve got that now get on with the job <e> <s> it is a bit difficult but it gets things moving <e> <s> i can quite see the point about that it helps tremendously <e> <s> it comes under the legal definition <e>", "<cs> i apologise to members of the committee if my voice is not too clear <e> <s> surely nurses are part of a state service as are those serving in the army and the navy <e> <s> do members of those forces have to pay for their lodging <e> <s> if not then why should nurses <e> <s> has anything been done in that connection <e> <s> what i am trying to say is members of military institutions pay rates but they will not have to pay the new tax whereas nurses will <e> <s> they are all working in state services so why should nurses have to pay <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment as well <e> <s> there is another matter that i have not heard mentioned since i came here this evening and that is forestry <e> <s> in scotland much of the hill country presents a very difficult situation when planted up <e> <s> how the timber will be extracted when the trees are only half grown and when thinning has to take place i am not quite sure <e> <s> it will be rather difficult <e> <s> therefore i suggect that in the future when these trees require thinning and felling horses will be required for extraction <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask another question <e> <s> scotland has been revalued more often than england and at a much higher rate <e> <s> for many years the english rates have been much lower than in scotland <e> <s> i think it is still going on <e> <s> i have not checked on it lately but my recollection is that we pay much higher rates in scotland than in england because of the revaluations <e> <s> the english have not had a revaluation for a long time <e> <s> that makes a big difference to industry the nurses and everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i decided to speak this morning and i have not prepared anything <e> <s> therefore i shall not keep the house long <e>", "<cs> my lords while there are difficulties about aircraft and landings we are trying to do as little as we can with turnhouse <e> <s> that used to be a very good aerodrome and is one of the best in the whole of britain for landing <e> <s> it is more or less fog-free and during the war it was a very valuable place <e> <s> that has now been closed down <e> <s> why is that <e>", "<cs> my lords not edinburgh airport <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the bridge is being taken down because it is considered to be unsafe <e> <s> on the other hand i believe it is being removed and is likely to be put up somewhere else as it is in quite good condition <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that answer can we not in future have all motorways with three lanes <e> <s> that would be safer <e>", "<cs> my lords do we have sufficient control of imports <e> <s> i am sure that many cases of salmonella arise from imported foodstuffs and animal foodstuffs <e> <s> i believe that salmonella and diseases of that type live in certain areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that salmonella and other diseases inhabit certain areas and that in those areas we gradually obtain immunity to the disease <e> <s> however in other areas we do not have freedom from the disease <e> <s> what controls exist in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what interest the national farmers union has shown in these schemes <e> <s> is it doing anything <e> <s> has it been consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for answering my question i am very glad to hear what he said <e> <s> however will it mean that we shall have to wait still longer at the passport office <e> <s> i ask that because the original offices have been computerised but it now takes considerably longer to hand out passports <e>", "<cs> my lords some time ago i heard about the fertilisation of rivers in iceland <e> <s> the rivers there are being stocked with salmon <e> <s> small fry were put into the river <e> <s> they went out to sea and to great joy came back again at the correct time <e> <s> i do not know whether they were scottish salmon or canadian salmon but i am sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may mention herbs of the deep rooted variety <e> <s> in certain parts of the alps both in germany and in switzerland these deep rooted herbs are improving the quality of cattle and other stock <e> <s> in addition deer and many other <e>", "<cs> my lords if we wish to have a clean atmosphere why do we not use more natural <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister of state for a very fine effort <e> <s> i believe that the bill will be a huge success <e> <s> it looks very good <e> <s> however there is one point that i make <e> <s> the bill starts off very well and there is then a gap <e> <s> the gap comes after the birth of the animal its death and its subsequent consumption <e> <s> that is where we <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that system of traffic control is used in scotland today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the debate <e> <s> i disagree with much of what has been stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not having put down my name to speak in this debate <e> <s> i did not think that i had anything to contribute to it <e> <s> however when i came into the chamber the noble lord was speaking about a matter that interested me <e> <s> it was about training people <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that the minister of agriculture has been telling us all about the continent and our surrounding neighbours but has said noihing about the united states of america <e> <s> we know that a good many experiments have been carried out there into this new disease <e> <s> i say new but per laps i should not <e> <s> it has probably been around for a long time but it now has a name <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to ask why america is not in this as well <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lady carnegy and parts of what other members of the committee have said <e> <s> i wish to come down to ground level <e> <s> people count for a great deal in this matter and a great deal more than paper <e> <s> one has to consider the people who are selected for particular jobs <e> <s> local people know far more than those who live in another county <e> <s> for example the postman will call some mornings and make a complaint about something <e> <s> the person addressed can then walk out and look at what the postman has described <e> <s> the postman may be wrong or be may be right <e>"]
