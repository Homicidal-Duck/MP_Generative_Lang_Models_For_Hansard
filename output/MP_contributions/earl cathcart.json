["<cs> my lords it is my privilege in following the noble lord lord richardson to congratulate him upon a notable maiden speech <e> <s> he has given a long and very distinguished service to medicine and in this debate it is also appropriate to record his wartime service in the royal army medical corps <e> <s> however it is the time and the service that he gives on the armed forces medical advisory board and has given since to which we must pay tribute <e> <s> indeed the armed forces are extremely fortunate to have the services and the advice of such a distinguished doctor <e> <s> today with brevity and clarity he has highlighted the problems of the armed forces medical services and i know that there will be many calls on his wisdom and experience in many debates on many subjects in your lordships house <e> <s> but i hope that he will not make this the last occasion on which he takes part in our defence debates because with his distinguished experience he has filled a gap which perhaps has been evident in your lordships house in recent defence debates <e> <s> with great respect i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord hill-norton on his maiden speech and my noble friend lord milverton on his <e> <s> we are all looking forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord henley <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the motion of my noble friend on the effective reserves and i agree with the noble and gallant lord lord carver that in the territorial army was under-recruited and contained a great deal of dead wood <e> <s> however as i shall try to show in a few minutes i think that it was over-pruned at that time <e> <s> i believe that there is a need for a moderate and gradual increase in our reserve forces mostly for security purposes in the united kingdom base but also in order to provide reserves for our forces <e> <s> i also believe that the will exists to man those additional reserve forces <e> <s> i do not share the pessimism of the noble lord lord shinwell that the necessary leadership in this matter will not be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for the opportunity that he has given us this afternoon to debate this important and rather neglected subject <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations on the constructive and effective maiden speech of my noble friend lord murton of lindisfarne and i should like to say also at the start that as the noble lord <e> <s> lord noel-baker will soon see i am unable to follow the distinguished and sincere speech which he has just made except to try to take a more positive line because i think that fine words and fine sentiments are insufficient to protect and give us confidence against the possible aggression of a nation that is clearly on the march <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the confirmation that my noble friend the minister has given that the soviet ability for increased aggression by chemical warfare exists will he confirm that in the government defence white paper which we hope will be issued shortly information will be given to us about what steps we are taking to counter this threat <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the acting leader of the house for his reply <e> <s> will he not agree that the most effective debates in your lordships house are those that deal with a particular aspect rather than those debates which try to deal with the whole wide range of a particular subject such as defence in just a few hours <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that the original question would have been much more appropriate if it had also inquired about our ability to improve not only our defensive equipment but the training of our troops in defensive effects against chemical warfare to counter the ever-increasing offensive capability of the soviet forces <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the question of the noble lord the leader of the opposition might not our prospects of a common project in nato for this type of weapon be improved if we were to include in the pool all types of armoured vehicles such as armoured reconnaissance vehicles armoured cars and armoured personnel vehicles <e> <s> perhaps we might get one of these if we did it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister able to assure us that the government have given full consideration to the idea as an alternative to detention in prison of giving certain prisoners the opportunity to do constructive work which would be of good effect to the community as a whole and would greatly affect the morale of the individual concerned by his being able to do something positive instead of being just s hut away in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton i wish to say at the outset that i am grateful to him for the support he gave to the suggestion i made recently in my question <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for the constructive additional suggestions he has made in his speech today <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the soviets recent action of ferrying soviet arms from their stockpiles in libya to iran further evidence of their total disregard for the helsinki spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister tell us whether when the government have completed their analysis of the lessons learnt from this very important exercise a fuller statement will be made available to the public <e> <s> also could some report of this be included in the annual defence white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although todays debate in your lordships house is devoted to foreign affairs and defence i propose to discuss defence policy only briefly because the details of our defence arrangements can be more fully discussed next wednesday in the debate allocated specifically to that subject <e> <s> however the strong emphasis in the most gracious speech on the importance which her majestys government give to the effective maintenance of western security and the importance of defence is certainly very welcome <e> <s> the need to contribute fully to the north atlantic treaty was clearly defined <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord that germany is abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank my noble friend the minister for his clear summing-up of this long debate and for answering so many of our questions <e> <s> i should also like to thank all those noble lords from all parts of the house who have taken part in this debate for their distinguished contributions <e> <s> i believe the debate may have helped us to clear our minds on a number of current problems of defence policy <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister agree that the most important factor in providing satisfactory amenities and conditions of service for the armed forces is to ensure that there is a high standard of maintenance of barracks and buildings in which they live and work and will he confirm that the maintenance of these buildings is not being curtailed <e> <s> further will he agree that if the maintenance of these buildings is allowed to fall back to a low standard the cost of repairing them subsequently will be far greater <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend the minister agree that the most important <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank my noble friend for that reply which does not really begin to answer my question <e> <s> if as i strongly suspect the figure for the daily average absence of men from baor is a high one and if the majority of those men so absent are in the united kingdom on training courses would her majestys government consider that it would be more satisfactory and achieve better economies in this atmosphere of trimmed defence expenditure to organise training courses either on a central basis or under commanding officers supervision actually in british army of the rhine <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a coincidence that the ballot box has provided us with two short debates today both of which enable us to consider two separate and very important aspects of our defence <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord orr-ewing for the opportunity which his motion gives us to discuss the strengthening of the air defence of the united kingdom and its air defence region <e> <s> it is itself a most important subject and one which in recent years has not received the consideration which it deserves <e> <s> i am particularly glad that the words of his motion emphasise the urgency for improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend confirm that the warsaw pact countries also have the capability of deploying neutron bombs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the three maiden speakers who took part in our debate this afternoon <e> <s> they each spoke from wide and varied experience and they have greatly enhanced our debate today <e> <s> noble lords will be glad to learn that in the interests of economy of time i have decided to make drastic cuts in the speech which i brought here this afternoon <e> <s> if i omit to mention the pros and cons of the various alternative reductions in our defence expenditure and in particular fail to <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the real difference between the noble lord and myself is that he does not appreciate and agree with the policy of deterrence as a weapon to keep war at arms length which i do <e> <s> unilateral disarmament is not only not a viable policy <e> <s> russia will not be impressed by good examples and soothing words <e> <s> we cannot ever effectively argue that they should disarm when we ourselves have already done it <e> <s> nor can we maintain peace in a situation of rising tension leading to all-out hostilities from a position of self-imposed weakness <e>", "<cs> my lords todays debate in response to the gracious speech has been allocated to foreign affairs and defence and it is only right that pride of place should be given to the many international problems which confront us and that defence must naturally be and hopefully will remain a subordinate part but so far in todays debate every speaker has concentrated on this vital subject of disarmament <e> <s> that and also the number of men and women who parade in the streets in support of the cnd show the grave anxiety which exists in this country today and as the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham has said we need to get some success in the field of disarmament which we can all understand at a very early date <e> <s> may i also say that the right reverend prelates experience in amsterdam will be quite fascinating and we shall watch what might come out of it with great interest <e> <s> the problems of defence are giving rise to urgent discussions and many of the cornerstones of our defence policy are being subjected to doubts and anxieties often as the noble lord <e> <s> lord chalfont has said amid much confusion of thought and misappreciation <e> <s> therefore because this subject has already been covered fairly widely in the debate so far i propose to speak only very briefly <e> <s> i am not going to attempt to discuss the many new aspects announced by the minister of defence in his still recent defence review <e> <s> but in saying that i must make the point that in my opinion we need to hold a purely defence debate in your lordships house in the near future if not to discuss defence matters as a whole then surely on some of the more important problems thrown up by that defence review such as for example security and defence of these islands or the protection of our vital sea routes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i am sure that in either case it will make for an extremely good debate if the noble lord becomes successful in the ballot which i hope he will <e> <s> in this matter of controlling escalation we must try to ensure that the mechanism of communication exists at this awful moment as indeed it would be when a nuclear strike occurred in order to prevent the full-scale and unimaginable frightfulness that will then take place <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships would not wish me to detain you at this late hour except to thank my noble friend the minister for the very full part he has played in this debate and for the clear way in which he has summed up <e> <s> i should also like to thank all noble lords from all parts of the house for their contributions to the debate <e> <s> we have heard many distinguished speeches and i hope noble lords will feel that it has <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there is considerable evidence as indicated by their deployment in tactical exercises that the warsaw pact regard the use of chemical weapons as part of conventional warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord molloy is that the reason why the soviet union is not taking any action is because of the western deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that his meeting with the all-party defence select committee was in fact a previously arranged long investigation into the general policy of procurement and was not specifically designed as implied by the bbc in that broadcast to discuss the sea wolf missile <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord kinross <e> <s> perhaps i should declare some interest in what the amendment tries to achieve since not only am i a member of the royal british legion scotland but i am also deputy president of the british commonwealth ex-service league which also wishes to support the amendment <e> <s> i should also say that i was very sorry that i was not able to be present at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my gratitude to my noble friend lord mottistone for giving us the opportunity this afternoon to discuss this <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my gratitude to my noble friend lord ferrier for giving us the opportunity today to debate the first report from the select committee on sound broadcasting of which committee i have the privilege to be a member <e> <s> the six-month experimental period for the new format of yesterday in parliament ends on wednesday <e> <s> after the easter recess as noble lords have heard from the lord chairman of committees it will be reviewed by the bbc to see what changes must be made for the future <e> <s> indeed as a result of a most interesting meeting of the select committee with senior members of the bbcs sound broadcasting staff which has also been referred to by the lord chairman of committees they have undertaken not only to review the experiment as a whole but to look at the allocation of broadcasting time between the two houses <e> <s> therefore the point i am making is that your lordships debate today is not only important but extremely timely <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak only very briefly indeed at the conclusion of this debate because this house still has other business to deal with <e> <s> i am most grateful to all noble lords from all parts of the house for taking part <e> <s> we have had some very distinguished speeches indeed and especially from those noble lords who spoke from personal experience <e> <s> the wide-ranging and very distinguished contributions from all parts of the house are an indication of the interest which has been taken in this debate <e> <s> i hope that the broad assessment of views and experience which this debate has provided will prove to be of value <e> <s> i must thank my noble friend the minister for his summing up of the debate and now i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my priviledge to follow the noble and gallant lord lord lewin and to be the first to congratulate him on his outstanding maiden speech <e> <s> he speaks with a very great experience which covers the whole range of defence <e> <s> the forthright and non-controversial manner in which he has spoken today leads us all to hope that we shall hear him on many more occasions <e> <s> i can assure him that he will always be listened to with very great interest and very great respect <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that noble lords on the other side of the house when they come to argue that it is better for us to increase our conventional weapons will find themselves having to use the arguments that they need high technology and the degree of modernisation of weapons rather than counting the number of guns and the number of men <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that years ago and for a period of three years when i was the british commandant in berlin it was my duty to visit prisoner hess regularly in his cell and that therefore i can confirm that the conditions of the imprisonment of this old man are both harsh and severe <e> <s> would the minister agree that even if he were to be released there would still be need to protect him from the world media and other sensation seekers <e> <s> nevertheless in view of the years that he has served in prison his age which is and his frail health but above all because he has served the last years in solitary confinement a condition of imprisonment to which he was never sentenced does my noble friend agree that her majestys government should now begin urgent discussions with the other three powers to make the conditions of his imprisonment at least kinder and more civilised and preferably absolutely kinder in every degree than they are now <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that it is still the condition that he may not touch either his wife or his son when they visit him that they are kept at a considerable distance and the interviews between them are heavily monitored by the guards <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by apologising for not being able to be present at the start of this debate <e> <s> i therefore failed to hear the opening speech by my noble friend lord renton and the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i must also say how grateful we are to my noble friend lord renton for giving us this opportunity to debate this sometimes overlooked and often misunderstood subject of civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that accidents involving motor-cyclists are unlikely to decrease until motor-cyclists can be persuaded to conform to the normal rules of traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising this question of constructing a village complex of buildings at copehill down on salisbury plain to enable the army to carry out training for fighting in built-up areas <e>", "<cs> in calling amendment no <e> <s> if it is agreed to i cannot call amendment no <e> <s> <e>"]
