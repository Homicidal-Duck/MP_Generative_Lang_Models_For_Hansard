["<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for the opportunity that he has given us this afternoon to debate this important and rather neglected subject <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations on the constructive and effective maiden speech of my noble friend lord murton of lindisfarne and i should like to say also at the start that as the noble lord <e> <s> lord noel-baker will soon see i am unable to follow the distinguished and sincere speech which he has just made except to try to take a more positive line because i think that fine words and fine sentiments are insufficient to protect and give us confidence against the possible aggression of a nation that is clearly on the march <e>"]
