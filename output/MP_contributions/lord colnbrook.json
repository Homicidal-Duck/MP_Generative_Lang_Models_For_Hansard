["<cs> my lords every newcomer to your lordships house must be impressed by and be grateful for the kindness and courtesy shown by everybody as i am impressed and grateful <e> <s> i hope perhaps that that courtesy will be extended one step further this afternoon while i address your lordships for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall start by congratulating the noble baroness lady hart of south lanark on her maiden speech <e> <s> i have heard her speak many times in another place and have always enjoyed it <e> <s> i have not always agreed with her and i expect that when she becomes more controversial as time goes on i shall again not agree with her <e> <s> however i am delighted to congratulate her on a most interesting performance <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to urge my noble friend the minister to look again at this point <e> <s> i find myself very much in support of the noble lord lord mottistone particularly in regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me that we are in an absurd situation because the companies which bring people by air or sea to this country are now expected to do the governments job for them <e> <s> there is nothing new in that <e> <s> throughout the centuries governments have required private citizens to collect taxes for them and so on <e> <s> we believe that the operating companies should act as immigration officers and should be able to do the job of immigration officers before they accept a passenger <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that not everyone on this side of the house agrees with my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> there are many of us who feel that the closure of the westminster hospital particularly the accident and emergency unit will be a major disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an invitation which i cannot possibly refuse and i shall not <e> <s> the further discussions which my noble friend foreshadows will i hope persuade him that the way he is seeking to set about the matter is not the right way <e> <s> one of the difficulties in the debate was that too much attention was paid to rich owners of very fast racehorses <e> <s> there are some of those but there are a good many other people who own rather small slow horses or ponies for that matter and do not have large businesses and are not possessed of enormous fortunes <e> <s> nobody would wish to damage their <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate i believe that i should confine myself to two points only <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench will find the first congratulatory the second i fear they may not <e> <s> i begin with the first point that of congratulation <e> <s> i commend my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my noble friend the minister of state on having arrested the decline in the defence budget <e> <s> we all remember very well nine years ago the adoption by the present administration of an increase in the european nato target of per cent <e> <s> per annum over a period of time and how they struggled to meet that target <e> <s> they did not quite meet it but they made a real effort and our defence budget increased <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that question i can only tell the noble lord that three years ago i did not have the honour to be here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hylton and the noble lord lord prys-davies before him referred to the method of legislating for northern ireland <e> <s> they spoke about the differences between the law in great britain and northern ireland and the republic and referred to the problems which they acknowledge exist in northern ireland <e> <s> perhaps i could say that i agree with them both about the method of legislating <e> <s> it is not satisfactory as we all recognise <e> <s> that is why i was particularly pleased when my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place two days ago made the firm offer of discussions primarily no doubt with representatives of northern ireland but also with anybody who would care to join in about seeking an improvement <e> <s> i think this is a wise move on his part and i hope very much that the offer will be taken up <e> <s> we all wish to see an improved method of providing law in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords will know from their own experience that the delivering of a maiden speech in this chamber is something of an ordeal <e> <s> even if one is accustomed to addressing audiences or courts in other places it is different here <e> <s> we all congratulate the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar on his maiden speech which we enjoyed very much <e> <s> he brings to our discussions a well-informed and balanced approach to the difficult problem of the liberty of the individual and the rights of the state as a whole <e> <s> that is not altogether surprising because he is a distinguished advocate and i understand that his practice was to a considerable extent in the criminal courts <e> <s> i also understand that he is to continue his practice which is unfortunately some miles away <e> <s> we all hope very much that the necessity to continue practising will not keep him away from the house too much <e> <s> we look forward to his contributions to our debates in the future <e>", "<cs> indeed there is my lords but i have made my point and i know that the noble lord will reflect on it <e> <s> i know that he does not want to give any aid or comfort to terrorism <e>", "<cs> i did not think i would have to speak in this debate and perhaps i do not <e> <s> i hope that i do not because i so much agree with what has been said <e> <s> i shall not repeat it and will ask my noble friend on the front bench to consider two points <e> <s> first he knows northern ireland very well but i do not think even he would claim to know it as well as those who live there several of whom have spoken and have personal experience over many years and perhaps all their lives of what it is like <e> <s> they know even better than he does and when they speak as they do their words carry much greater weight than mine or anybody elses <e> <s> i hope that he will pay heed to them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon quite understandably based his case on a lawyers argument <e> <s> that was understandable because he is a lawyer <e> <s> from that point of view i can understand absolutely what he said <e> <s> the noble lord invoked the assistance of two other people to support his case <e> <s> both of those people were lawyers too <e> <s> from the standpoint of a lawyer i can understand his argument absolutely <e> <s> but i am not a lawyer and i want the committee to consider this matter from a laymans point of view for a moment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was good enough to say that he put forward the amendment knowing that it would not meet all the requirements which he believes ought to be met <e> <s> i think he is right on that point <e> <s> however before coming to that i should like to point out that there are two things wrong with the amendment <e> <s> first he suggests that the extension order as it is generally known should be signed by a justice of the peace rather than by the secretary of state <e> <s> i cannot believe that that is a good idea <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to me and said that he could not see me or anyone else on being faced with a request for an extension saying no you cant have it <e> <s> i must tell him that i did <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the noble lord lord hemingford and others whose names are on this amendment have as my noble friend lord trafford reminded us rather lost sight of the purpose of the bill <e> <s> this is the official secrets bill <e> <s> it is an effort by parliament to establish what should and what cannot be said by public servants <e> <s> everyone in your lordships house has agreed all the way through our proceedings that this is a very much better effort than has ever been made before and the area a great deal narrower than before <e> <s> but as everyone will agree there comes a moment when a line must be drawn <e> <s> the bill seeks to draw it <e> <s> it draws it as it stands with a definite and precise instruction beyond this line you shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief first because so many who have spoken and will speak in the debate know so much more than i do about defence matters as a whole and secondly because i have an inescapable engagement this evening which may mean that if the debate is prolonged i shall not be in my place to hear my noble friend the minister reply <e> <s> if that happens i hope that he and the house will accept my apologies and forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> when he says two horses he means two mares does he not <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case it sounds very much i hope that i am wrong as though my noble friend is taking something back <e> <s> is he saying that the only exemption is for someone who keeps just one mare <e> <s> that is a very small breeder <e> <s> it is not what i understood although i may have <e>", "<cs> my lords there is still a little confusion <e> <s> i accept that the government will still not accept amendment no <e> <s> a which would restore the position to what everyone believed it to be <e> <s> i am glad that they are still prepared to have further discussions about the exemption with those engaged in the breeding of horses and ponies <e> <s> i want to make it clear that a great deal hinges on the definition of a small breeder <e> <s> i know that it is difficult to define <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to this dispute some people say that the ambulancemen have been offered per cent <e> <s> and others say that they have been offered per cent <e> <s> can my noble friend help me and the house by saying who has been offered what <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my remarks by reaffirming my belief that the idea of raising revenue from local people by a community charge is very much better in principle than the system of charging rates that we have at the moment <e> <s> after all every single thing that a local authority does is for the benefit of people whether it is the provision of schools roads street lighting parks libraries or whatever <e> <s> all these provisions are for the benefit of people <e> <s> it seems right that it is the people who should pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords so it may be <e> <s> i have read it out and i am inviting your lordships to consider the difficulty that we are in <e> <s> so what happens <e> <s> ordinary people of whom i count myself one in this regard say i dont know whose fault it is <e> <s> it must be the governments fault because the government brought the wretched thing in <e> <s> i do not know but i am sure that this type of misunderstanding is widespread throughout the country <e> <s> the government owe it to us all to give a great deal more time energy and trouble to explaining the whole thing than they perhaps have been able to do up until now <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i wish to advance two reasons why your lordships house should reject the amendment <e> <s> the first has been referred to by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and my noble friend lady young <e> <s> it is the cost <e> <s> if the noble lord lord carter thinks that it will cost nothing he deceives himself <e> <s> it has been suggested by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that such provision would cost between and million <e> <s> i do not know the figure <e> <s> i have no means of calculating it <e> <s> it would obviously cost a substantial sum <e>", "<cs> before i turn to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord winstanley i must <e>", "<cs> my lords compared with almost all your lordships in the house this afternoon i am a very new member of the house <e> <s> i confess to a degree of surprise that we should be considering this motion <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord lord williams of elvel sought to say the motion is critical of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> parliament has always been understanding and sympathetic to people who admit <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point about interim awards will my noble friend encourage the criminal injuries compensation board to make greater use of them <e> <s> interim payments can be an enormous help to people <e> <s> however long delays nullify to a considerable extent the help that is given if that help is delayed for one two three or more years as has been the case <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord colwyn rightly described these amendments when he introduced them as being complex and so they are <e> <s> i intend to comment only briefly on one aspect <e> <s> however before i do so i must remind the committee that i too have an interest as i am a director of transworld communications plc which owns four local radio stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervened briefly in the early stages of the bill not so much on this part but on the part connected with radio <e> <s> i remind your lordships that i have a personal interest in the radio side <e> <s> the amendment relates to television <e> <s> i believe that the house should reject the proposal of the noble baroness lady david not because i can argue the detail with her i cannot but for a different reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord stanley on his achievement <e> <s> let him not misunderstand me i am against him <e> <s> but i congratulate him because he has done something which few of us are able to do <e> <s> by his persistence he has persuaded the government to do something the government did not want to do <e> <s> that is no mean achievement <e> <s> i congratulate him upon it but i am against him for this reason <e>", "<cs> my lords on the occasion to which i referred i must remind the noble lord that i was the opposition chief whip and i thought that the government were wrong
