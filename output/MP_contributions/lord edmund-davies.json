["<cs> my lords i rise to speak in support of the motion of the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington and the brevity of my remarks is in inverse ratio to the vigour of my feelings in this matter <e> <s> i am deeply convinced that any publication or exploring of a jurys deliberations would be highly inimical to the public weal <e> <s> before we ever reach any question of publication any questioning of jurors would constitute in my judgment indefensible tampering with one of the most valuable institutions of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have upstairs but unfortunately not with me here the report of the criminal law revision committee of which at that time i was the third senior member <e> <s> we deliberated at a time when the climate was wholly different from that which obtains today <e> <s> we considered the matter because one or two people had written to us suggesting that the law in relation to the secrecy of the jurys deliberations should be fortified and clarified <e> <s> we had heard no hullabaloo <e> <s> nothing such as we know happens today in some instances the exploratory investigation is of a most deplorable kind then existed at all <e> <s> the conclusion we came to was one which at the time we thought was wise namely that there was not really a public mischief existing at that time so why stir up things <e> <s> accordingly we concluded leave matters alone <e>", "<cs> i am in considerable sympathy with the sponsors of this amendment because one finds it not difficult to understand the sort of domestic situation they have it in mind to meet where people who have been treated as the spouse suffer from a sudden calamity <e> <s> but the drafting of the amendment is something which calls for the greatest care otherwise as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has pointed cut the elasticity of the wording will let in all kinds of situations to which it would be thoroughly undesirable to accord legal recognition <e> <s> with the utmost diffidence i apprehend that the sort of situation which the movers of the amendment have in mind is one which is better covered by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords to one who spent a long part of his life both at the bar and on the bench dealing with the legal complexities arising from the assault of dust diseases the regulations now under consideration come as a most welcome addition to the provisions which were belatedly made to deal with the horrible consequences of the various dust diseases <e> <s> i warmly commend these regulations to the approval of the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords confronted by an extremely difficult problem the noble lord lord wigoder in my view has attained as acceptable a conclusion in the matter as seems attainable <e> <s> whether it is absolutely right is another matter <e> <s> i speak in relation to his amended motion and i do not in the light of the cautionary qualification introduced by the noble lord lord campbell propose to speak to his amendment which i am like the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson not at all sure is still extant or has been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i venture to support the opposition of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on the simple ground which can be shortly stated that subsection is dealing with the ambit of the rules <e> <s> when you get on the other hand to subsection you have the nature of the duty <e> <s> that i should have thought with profound respect to those who speak for the first amendment is the proper place to put it <e> <s> the point has to be covered <e> <s> it is an important point <e> <s> however it is best dealt with in my respectful judgment in the place which the noble and learned lord suggests <e>", "<cs> i seek information from those who are proposing this amendment <e> <s> a licensee goes on to premises and he enters the premises for wholly innocent purposes falling within the ambit of the licence <e> <s> then there he is tempted by the luscious apples on an overhanging branch and he steals half a dozen of them <e> <s> let us postulate also that he is a person of mature years <e> <s> he has undoubtedly committed the crime of theft <e> <s> is that to say that the suggested amendment means that no duty is owed to him under the section at all no matter how grave the danger <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset of my remarks i think it wiser to reveal that i have both a personal and at least a quasi-official interest in the important topic which is currently occupying the time of your lordships house <e> <s> my personal interest arises of course from the fact that i am a welshman <e> <s> any welshman cannot fail to be interested in the matter currently under discussion <e> <s> my quasi-official interest arises from the fact that i have the honour to be the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure there is a misunderstanding here that is the last point i sought to make <e> <s> i think there may have been an attribution here and it is not for me to say what might be the proper locality of the attribution but it is certainly not at my door <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister really consider that it is a reply in relation for example to cambridge to say that they look to the university grants committee having regard to the severe restraints and financial restrictions placed upon that body however willing it may be disposed to help <e>", "<cs> i suggest that there is danger in eliminating the qualification in the alternative <e> <s> if we adhere to impracticable and if that is to be regarded as the equivalent to physically impossible we are in dangerous waters <e> <s> if i had done my homework as i should have done and had had notice of this suggested amendment i believe i should have been able to cull from many an act of parliament particularly the factories acts the mines and quarries acts and other provisions of that kind a similar phrase <e> <s> the word impracticable ought not to be regarded as synonymous with physically impossible <e> <s> if that is wholly understood then i have some sympathy with the suggestion that one can eliminate the alternative <e>", "<cs> some of us regard this amendment as a most attractive one <e> <s> i confess my complete ignorance of the present situation in relation to installation charges <e> <s> can we be told <e> <s> is there any <e>", "<cs> i would welcome enlightenment from the noble lord in relation to his opposition to part of the amendment the non-discrimination part <e> <s> the noble lord cited an example of a rebate <e> <s> that has no relevance to the suggested amendment which relates to discrimination on the basis of geographical location of the installation <e>", "<cs> i had no reason to think that i would be present this afternoon otherwise i should have come prepared to deal with this vitally important constitutional matter <e> <s> i have to say that my time in the chamber must be limited to the next half an hour <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> it has not only the virtue of being reconciled with other statutory provisions in relation to discrimination but it more neatly links up does it not with clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that there have been others than miners on strike since section of the act of came into force <e> <s> for clarification may we be told whether there has been any withholding of rebates from any others than miners since the act came into force <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact has there been a withholding from strikers other than miners since section came in <e>", "<cs> my lords a mere two or three years ago parliament had occasion to consider schedule to the juries act an act which emanated from the admirable report of a greatly loved member of your lordships house and a close friend of mine lord morris of borth-y-gest <e> <s> i confess i have not read the debate which was conducted in both houses of parliament two years ago <e> <s> but one of two things happened either it then occurred to nobody to include under the disqualifications those who had been placed upon probation or secondly they considered and rejected it <e>", "<cs> <e>", "<cs> my lords despite my appreciation of the graceful <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have leave i should like to point out an error which the noble and learned lord made in the course of his contribution <e> <s> it is a purely factual error which i am sure he would regret immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may the house accordingly take it that the noble lord the minister would agree that while in no way reflecting upon the cogency of the statement made by the commissioner of police for the metropolis the causes of crime are contributory and multiple that even in the you never had it so good days of mr macmillan there was a marked increase in the crime rate that the decrease in religious belief and observance is at least a matter that must never be forgotten and that accordingly it would be possibly misleading to regard the rate of unemployment as anything like the sole cause of crime although undoubtedly it is a factor which demands important consideration <e>", "<cs> one matter puzzles me a little <e> <s> i can put it shortly <e> <s> i am for the spirit underlying the amendment <e> <s> but having heard defence pleas in mitigation going on sometimes for an interminable length of time i wonder whether it will usefully advantage the convicted accused by having a transcript of the defence plea in mitigation <e> <s> after all what will count with those who hereafter have to evaluate the fact of conviction is not what the defence said in mitigation but how much of it the judge received how much he accepted and how much of it affected the conclusion he came to regarding the appropriate sentence <e> <s> i wonder whether any advantage enures from having a transcript of the defence plea <e> <s> but most certainly i support having the sentencing remarks of the judge or magistrate <e> <s> i am puzzled by the usefulness of having a transcript of the plea in mitigation <e>", "<cs> i am not myself in favour of supporting paragraphs <e>", "<cs> as one of those whose name supports this amendment i rise formally to say that i support every word which the noble and learned lord lord scarman has uttered <e> <s> there are very important grounds for saying that subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole layout of the clause rightly stresses the importance of having an officer of responsibility and experience <e> <s> as far as invoking the aid of a police constable of any seniority <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek information <e> <s> would the noble lord be content if there were simply deleted from the present clause the last three words of paragraph <e>", "<cs> it is surely a primary requirement of the drafting of parliamentary bills that no unnecessary words should be put in <e> <s> it has to be said that the government stand on a somewhat fragile platform in relation to the respect that should be paid to that rule by their own drafting of subsections and of clause <e> <s> therefore as the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson of ewell has said it is a wholly unnecessary requirement <e> <s> the same can be said of the amendment which is here being urged it is wholly unnecessary and therefore undesirable <e> <s> i am quite sure particularly in the light of the advancement of no cogent reason for this requirement that the amendment should be rejected <e>", "<cs> i desire to identify myself with that view <e> <s> it seems to me at the moment that no answer to the plea contained in the amendment could properly be resisted <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to voice one matter that is troubling me <e> <s> take a situation which is not unique or extraordinary <e> <s> the provision in the new section a is according to the marginal note <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to support the amendment <e> <s> it is in my personal experience highly desirable that there should be a provision of this measured nature introduced into the statute <e> <s> i fully understand and am grateful for the approach of the noble lord lord elton on a previous occasion in relation to this matter <e> <s> so far from any hostility being <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek to make an extremely short contribution to this most important debate which has in large measure and understandably been confined to the extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the noble lord would inform your lordships house whether it remains the settled policy of the home secretary and of the government that a minimum period of years must be served for certain crimes or am i wholly mistaken in thinking that there has been a revelation of second thoughts <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek to make an extremely short contribution to this most important debate which has in large measure and understandably been confined to the extremely important <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the noble and learned lord in relation to this amendment <e> <s> it has the desirable aim and succeeds in that aim of introducing clarity where there is at present doubt <e> <s> clause reads <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness in this matter <e> <s> one cannot deal with this point at this stage without looking at page line of the bill <e> <s> we are dealing here with surrogate arrangements on a commercial basis and payments made therefor <e> <s> as noble lords will see line provides <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may inquire of the noble lord the minister whether he is quite happy about subsections and <e> <s> subsection reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this bill and rise merely in an attempt to assuage the perturbation expressed by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords by my standards the hour is already late <e> <s> i hope that i may be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords accordingly i claim experience and knowledge of what i am talking about <e> <s> there is one matter which has never received consideration before by any of those responsible for the designing and setting up of courts nor of those who have used the courts <e> <s> the jurors have received scant if any attention as to their comfort and their capacity to discharge their vitally important duties <e> <s> a fraud case it does not have to be complex frequently involves the close and accurate study by jurors unused to administering the law of documents complex up to a degree informed and numerous in quantity <e> <s> all of us know that when we do our paperwork we like a flat desk or best of all a kitchen table some place where we can spread our papers and study them properly <e> <s> no my lords there is no court in the country where you will find proper provision made for the capacity of jurors capacity to sit yes to do their work properly <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us whether the information to be forwarded from the driving centre at swansea will include the pamphlet which to my consternation informed me <e>", "<cs> i am unable to agree with the noble and learned lord who has just spoken <e> <s> the previous clause concluded with the words <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the suggestion that has just been made by the noble and learned lord lord wheatley in relation to the addition to the word suspects <e> <s> having said that i should like to express my wholehearted acceptance of this eminently suitable and required clause <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord denning has said it does not impose any compulsion of disclosure upon the bank <e> <s> it leaves it to the banks discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords does this dialogue not indicate that the piecemeal relaxation of the crown immunity is not satisfactory and that the government should quickly address themselves to the question of the total abolition of the crown immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to identify myself with that view <e> <s> the proposed language seems to me to be far clearer than that at present embodied in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords for many the first knowledge of this matter was found on the centre page of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals seductively said that all he seeks is to have the door left open <e> <s> left open to what <e> <s> left open for indefinite length to the present state of affairs <e> <s> can anybody contemplate the position in this country at the present time with any degree of complacency or are we not bound to be convinced that it is a most undesirable and unsettling position which is full of foreboding for the future <e> <s> the problem confronting this house tonight in my submission is not a grave or difficult problem <e> <s> this bill should be adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not considered desirable that a distinction should be made in the house between preventative on the one hand and preventive on the other <e> <s> i suppose that the latter is an adverbal adjective and the former is a noun <e> <s> an example of a preventative would be a condom <e> <s> i do not think that that is what is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords is it too late to ask that there should be some further thinking the sort of thinking that went on before the institution in of a system whereby we have had a welsh-speaking resident social security commissioner in cardiff <e> <s> that is the sort of thinking that appeals deeply i believe not only to welshmen and welsh-speaking welshmen but also to residents in wales for whom this arouses a most important and potent feeling <e> <s> i would ask whether there cannot be some rethinking in respect of this matter <e> <s> it is not suggested that there has been any inefficiency that has gone by the board <e> <s> it is not suggested that there will be any powerful saving of money <e> <s> what is being ignored i respectfully submit is the deep-seated feelings of welshmen and welshwomen <e>", "<cs> my lords on st july this bill was described by a noble lord on the government side as a quite modest bill <e> <s> its modesty lies only in its physical size <e> <s> it is full of the most widespread implications <e> <s> it would be quite wrong and shameful if this bill were considered now in an atmosphere of suppression suppression by reason of time not suppression intended by anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to speak shortly in support of this amendment <e> <s> i take a rather different view of the matter from the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> it seems to me quite clear that the burden of proving guilt under clause is totally different from that under subsection <e> <s> there is no doubt about this <e> <s> under clause the crown has to establish knowledge of the misleading false or deceptive nature of the statement promise or forecast before there can be any conviction <e> <s> that is absolutely clear in terms <e> <s> under subsection as has already been pointed out there is no reference at all to the necessity for knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords partaking of ginger beer can prove a perilous pastime or so it proved at least in the case of one young lady some years ago in paisley on unusually a hot and sunny day <e> <s> as miss donoghue walked along with her friend miss hamilton she remarked that she was very thirsty whereupon miss hamilton recklessly said i will buy you a ginger beer <e> <s> without more ado they turned into a caf it was not called a caff in those days and miss hamilton ordered a bottle of ginger beer <e> <s> a dark opaque bottle was brought with one glass <e>", "<cs> for the reasons that have already been stated i venture to support this amendment <e> <s> apart from the very pungent point made by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington in relation to any person mentioned at the beginning of subsection we have to postulate under

lord lord renton about the questions envisaged in clause being questions which have been put at the committal proceedings stage <e> <s> the noble lord will doubtless remember that clause provides that

amendment have thought deeply about the matter <e> <s> i do not invite from that the inference that we have arrived at the right conclusion but one mistake i can assure the committee that we have not
