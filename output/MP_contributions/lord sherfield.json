from a diversity of angles <e> <s> i regret that the debate was pushed back as so often these european debates are by pressure of other business <e> <s> one speaker has had to fall out and i am all the more grateful to those noble lords who have put off their dinners in order to speak <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his very full reply to the debate the way he has dealt with all the points and i particularly appreciate his positive approach to policy matters <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to the house for missing the first few minutes of this debate <e> <s> i was sitting in a committee in another place in a room which had inadequate information about what was going on in this house <e> <s> i wish to take the occasion of the timely question of the noble lord lord campbell of croy to raise just two points arising on it <e> <s> therefore i shall not add greatly to the number of questions which have already been thrown at the noble earl who is to reply to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for drawing the attention of the house to this council of europe report and draft resolution on the safety and economic effects of the fast breeder reactor and i rise to make a few comments if only to make it a bit of a field day <e> <s> the draft resolution as noble lords have already said is of special significance because after a public hearing and debate it is positive in its attitude to fast reactor safety and on the need to <e>", "<cs> my lords in concluding this debate i should like first to thank noble lords for the kind words that they have used about myself and to reciprocate by thanking them for making the effort to take part in a debate in that most unattractive hour the dinner hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord ohagan for putting down this timely question on the eec budget and for adding to his burdens by coining here at a rather late hour this evening to give us a first hand and authoritative account and interpretation of the proceedings of the european parliament on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords however that may be there was of course an element of compromise in the result <e> <s> it was not practicable to deal with the budget issue in isolation <e> <s> it was necessary to relate it in some degree to the resolution of other issues <e> <s> that was to be expected if not inevitable <e> <s> so i find the objections which have been raised to the settlement somewhat contrived <e> <s> it seems to me that only a committed opponent of the european community would insist upon getting per cent <e> <s> of his opening demand in this kind of deal <e> <s> it was not a perfect solution <e> <s> there may still be some uncertainty about some of its implications but it was a far better outcome than seemed obtainable at any previous stage of the negotiations and our own negotiators and also our common market partners ought in my view to be heartily congratulated on the result <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the sub-committee on air fares i should like to join previous speakers in paying tribute to the outstanding contribution of our chairman whose profound knowledge of the subject and expertise in the chair enabled us to digest nearly pages of evidence and yet <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a by curious coincidence the report of the select committee on science and technology on the scientific aspects of forestry and its accompanying volume of evidence has been published on this very day <e> <s> may i on behalf of the select committee ask him for an undertaking that in working out the policy that he has just proclaimed he will give the most careful attention to the recommendations contained in this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a really useful short debate <e> <s> it has enabled the speakers on the ecc report to take account of a significant change in the commissions programme of research and development since the committees report was published <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour it remains only for me to thank the speakers who have taken part in this debate particularly those in what i might describe as my half <e> <s> the noble lord lord adrian would have made a very valuable contribution but i am afraid that he was struck down by flu and the noble earl lord lonsdale would have spoken but for the effluxion of time <e> <s> but i should like to thank and pay tribute to the noble lord lord dulverton and the speakers in his group for their contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in this debate just to make two or three short points <e> <s> on rd february i presented to the house the report of your lordships select committee on science and technology on the scientific aspects of forestry <e>", "<cs> the countryside beckons my lords and i shall be brief <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl lord gowrie that the debate late though the hour has been well worth while <e> <s> i thank him for his opening remarks and for the substantive and informative statement he has made to the house <e> <s> i also thank all the speakers who have taken part first and particularly the noble lord lord kearton for his effective and weighty maiden speech i greatly value his support on the sub-committee and i hope that the tributes that have been paid to him will encourage him to come more often and participate in the debates in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while giving qualified thanks to the noble earl for that not unexpected reply may i ask him three supplementary questions <e> <s> first when can the house expect a reply on this subject can he quantify the expressions which he used <e> <s> secondly is there any particular road block or hurdle which is holding up the proceedings <e> <s> thirdly would he not agree that this delay shows as suggested in our report that there is something seriously amiss with the machinery of government in dealing with forestry questions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a word from these benches in support of what has been said in praise of the late president sadat and in sorrow at his untimely death <e> <s> i speak particularly of his foreign policy <e> <s> here he showed no ostentation or bravado but pursued his objectives by quiet patient and persistent diplomacy <e> <s> it is greatly to be hoped that his successors will be guided by the force of his example <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord kings norton for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> he is my successor as chairman of the relevant sub-committee of the select committee <e> <s> i started off this report on combined transport <e> <s> i handed over to him what i hope was not too poisoned a chalice and he has brought the report before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another debate on a scientific subject coming up with a number of speakers so i shall make my reply as brief as possible <e> <s> i should like first to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and express appreciation for the constructive ideas which have been put forward <e> <s> one of the advantages of a debate on such reports is that it gives members of a committee an opportunity to place their own gloss on the recommendations in the report and also to range more widely than the recommendations in the report itself <e> <s> then i should like to thank all those noble lords who paid compliments to myself more importantly all those who paid compliments to the committee as a whole and most importantly all those who paid compliments to the recommendations made in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that mr ian macgregor is doing an excellent job as chairman of the british steel corporation and so far at least has earned every penny of the emoluments that he has received <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to join other noble lords who preceded me in thanking the noble earl lord halsbury for his initiative in moving this <e>", "<cs> my lords my initial reason for wanting to take part in this debate was perhaps a frivolous one <e> <s> when i entered the foreign office in september the first serious piece of work which i was instructed to undertake was to write a memorandum on the argentine claim to the falkland islands <e> <s> in the light of recent events i thought it might be interesting to see what i then wrote and perhaps share some of the conclusions with your lordships <e> <s> so i approached the foreign office for permission to see the memorandum if indeed it still survived <e> <s> to my great astonishment i was informed that the memorandum was an active ingredient of the current file that it is still regarded as a key sensitive document and that it must stay in the public domain <e> <s> so your lordships are fortunately spared quotations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to trust my memory after years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am intervening in this debate with three purposes in view first to draw your lordships attention to a report by the select committee on science and technology on the water industry which was published during the christmas recess and to which the noble lord <e> <s> lord bellwin has just referred secondly to refer to some consequences of the abolition of the national water council to which the report draws attention and thirdly to inform the house that i shall be putting down some amendments at the committee stage on behalf of the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a subject on which i should normally be moved to address your lordships but it so happens that a sub-committee of your lordships select committee on science and technology of which like the noble earl lord bessborough i am a member is just embarking on an inquiry into digital mapping and remote sensing <e> <s> obviously the role of the ordnance survey in the development of digital mapping is a crucial one as has been so well described in the admirable maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the initiative of the noble lord lord todd in asking this question and to endorse what he said <e> <s> as the noble lord lord todd observed the sub-committee of your lordships select committee on science and technology of which i was chairman produced two reports on the scientific aspects of forestry <e> <s> in each of them they made strong recommendations about the need to strengthen the research effort in forest products with particular reference to home-grown timber <e> <s> in both we criticised the reducing efforts being devoted to this research and expressed concern at the run-down at the prl <e> <s> in our second report we expressed our greater concern at the proposal which was already then on the cards to close the princes risborough laboratory altogether and to transfer the work to the building research establishment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i am also glad to hear that the department is studying the report of the select committee and in due course will give a full response to it <e> <s> as regards his reply to the amendment of course <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i have also listened with great attention to the remarks of the noble earl lord shannon who has great experience of the nature and the habits of research associations <e> <s> the committee in making this recommendation took account of certain observations that were made by certain people but i understand from what the minister said that the water research centre is not itself now in favour of any such compulsory membership by water authorities <e> <s> i also took particular note of the ministers statement that a power does exist although he thought it was a theoretical possibility to oblige a water authority to subscribe <e>", "<cs> i think that all i need to say is that <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords are aware my interest in this amendment derives from my chairmanship of the sub-committee of the select committee on science and technology which produced a report on research and development in the water industry <e> <s> the interest of the committee and the reasons for it were fully and very ably explained by the noble baroness lady white in moving an amendment at the committee stage which stood in her name and in mine <e> <s> i need not therefore take up the time of this house in recapitulating her remarks <e> <s> suffice it to say that the committees interest was to improve the efficiency of the industry that this needs the application of up-to-date technology and that the existing agency arrangements in some cases at least turned out to be a hindrance in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task in replying to this debate is to thank the members of the committee who have taken part in this debate for their contributions and also to thank the other noble lords not members of the committee who have helped to make the debate less endogamous than it might otherwise have been <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his comments this evening <e> <s> they encourage me to hope that the governments definitive written response to the recommendations of the report which he has undertaken to provide will be a positive one that it will not be long delayed and that it will cover the important points just referred to by the noble lord lord nugent relating to the provision of resources for long-term strategic research <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion moved by the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury introducing the select committees report on the european monetary system <e> <s> it is the latest of the reports on this subject which the committee has produced <e> <s> i also support its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the deterioration in our infrastructure which i believe is the only word to be the same in all known languages is an important subject and one of which those of your lordships who walk to work are constantly reminded as you trip ever more frequently over the discontinuities and inequalities of our london pavements <e> <s> i can inform your lordships that it is only sheer luck that has brought me to my place this afternoon having recently escaped a devastating fall from this cause <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate and many important points have been raised in the course of it <e> <s> the noble baroness lady white said that she thought the debate had come rather late in the day <e> <s> perhaps she overlooks the difficulty which someone from these benches has in getting time for a debate <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will agree that late though it has been it has been well worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion of the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> he has introduced it in a wide-ranging speech for which the house will be grateful <e> <s> i shall refer to only three or four aspects of the report <e> <s> no doubt in addition to what the minister may have to say in winding up this debate the government will in due course communicate to the house their considered reply to the committees recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of all noble lords on these benches i should like to add my thanks to the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement and to associate ourselves with the sentiments of shock and disgust at this dastardly act which has deprived india of its leader at a critical time <e> <s> we too express our deep sympathy with mrs gandhis family and with the indian government and people at this fateful moment in their history <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank all noble lords who have taken such a spirited part in this debate many of them at considerable inconvenience to themselves <e> <s> their contributions have combined to make a very interesting and comprehensive debate and they have incidentally been far too kind to my own contribution <e> <s> secondly i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> as the noble earl lord bessborough said i had the privilege of acting as the foreign office adviser to his grandfather when he went out as the minister resident in west africa in the summer of <e> <s> i have many memories of that experience both serious and amusing and i certainly benefitted a great deal from the experience <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a cut on what was promised two weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege to serve under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord gregson during this inquiry <e> <s> it was one of particular difficulty first because it inevitably involved consideration of our whole system of education from primary level secondly because it drew forth a voluminous and diverse corpus of evidence and thirdly since the subject has been the cause of such great concern and so many reports it was hard to draw the threads together into some sort of coherence and then to say anything in the way of comment and recommendation which had not already been said by others <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad of the opportunity to join in this debate on the question posed by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> nobody that i know knows more about the water industry than the noble lord though perhaps the noble baroness lady white is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a minute <e> <s> my question was what is the effect of these proposed arrangements on research and development in the water industry in the future <e>", "<cs> i rise to intervene in this discussion for the purpose of making one point only <e> <s> your lordships have heard a great deal perhaps rather too much about the interim report of the select committee on science and technology in regard to scientific and technical services available to local authorities <e> <s> unfortunately the noble earl lord cranbrook is away and i speak for a moment in his stead <e> <s> also my name appears to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> this amendment has been well explained by the noble lord lord tordoff and i need add nothing more in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i want to say only this <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> does not go as far as the amendment moved by the noble lord lord melchett but if adopted it would achieve the result of keeping the scientific services together <e> <s> in fact the select committee debated the question whether it should recommend the setting up of an authority but decided against it for reasons which it described but it did not exclude the possibility of an authority for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i take part in this debate in support of the motion moved by the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> he has always looked forward never back <e> <s> his mind has always been active above and beyond the daily tasks and the immediate problems of government and administration and has looked to the goals of policy and the needs of the future <e> <s> so it is entirely in character that he has moved this motion on the consequences of what he among others has called the third industrial revolution or to use the title of alvin tofflers provocative and stimulating book <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i had intended to say that of course we have had only a day or two to read this report <e> <s> we shall certainly study it with great care in the hope that we may find a nugget or two embedded in the prose <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry the outcome of which we are debating today was one cat some complexity owing to the wide-ranging multidisciplinary nature of the subject and the piecemeal and fragmented way in which it is dealt with in this country <e> <s> as a participant i too admired the thorough and tenacious way in which our chairman the noble lord lord gregson approached the task with the assistance of the specialist advisers and the clerk <e> <s> the report was described by a foreign authority to whom i showed it as very lucid and succinct and i am sure sound <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to intervene briefly in support of the pertinet question of the noble earl lord halsbury about the sizewell b nuclear power station <e> <s> it raises what is at this stage a very simple point <e> <s> for what reason and on whose authority has the cegb committed resources to the proposed project before the inspectors report has been completed published and considered <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first time in recent months that we have debated the need for investment in the water industry and the implications of privatisation nor i am sure will it be the last <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble baroness for giving us the opportunity this afternoon to take another canter round the course <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying that owing to the unforeseen popularity of this debate i may have to leave before its end to fulfil a long-standing engagement <e> <s> i crave the indulgence of the house and of the minister for that predicament <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble duke the duke of somerset <e> <s> it is heartening in this rather elderly assembly to hear such a valuable and knowledgeable speech from a young member of the house i calculate that he is at least years younger than the average age of the new entry to this house which has recently been announced <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will hear him often and not only on forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords at this very late hour i shall be brief <e> <s> i must express my regret that the debate was shovelled down to the end of the days order paper <e> <s> i realise that this may not be the responsibility of the noble lord and the noble baroness on the front bench and i appreciate what the noble lord had to say on the subject <e> <s> nevertheless the government must have realised that this was an important debate which would attract an impressive list of speakers <e> <s> i just hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the deficit on international subscriptions in was million <e> <s> i understand too that the government rightly insist on good and indeed better management of science <e> <s> would the minister not agree that a deficit of this kind makes wise and good management extremely difficult and that while the present system may make good treasury practice it does not make very good sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make a few observations on your select committees report on <e>", "<cs> my lords since i have been associated with the select committees on the european communities and on science and technology for a number of years i rise briefly to make a comment on the groups recommendations in that area and to enlarge on what the noble lord lord shackleton said at the beginning of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing my appreciation of the action of the noble viscount lord whitelaw in speaking first for the government in this debate <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness if she will be so kind as to convey that appreciation to the leader of the house <e> <s> secondly i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> we have had some interesting and constructive speeches <e> <s> some valuable suggestions have been made and i welcome the noble baronesss assurance that these observations will be taken into account in the consultative process which is still i think in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the select committee responsible for this report i rise this evening to support the noble lord lord shackleton who had a particularly difficult task in this case in leading the committee through some pretty choppy waters to what i believe is a sound and well-balanced report firmly anchored in the evidence <e> <s> the government appeared to reject the main conclusions of the report out of hand almost before the print was dry on it <e> <s> but we shall learn later this evening whether they have been saved by any second thoughts <e>", "<cs> i too have had a great deal of experience in this matter <e> <s> i entirely support what has been said by the various representatives of the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the recommendation of this report and in doing so i <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose these amendments <e> <s> they seem to me extremely complicated and very difficult to administer <e> <s> this is the sort of thing which ought to be left to the good sense of the police and the magistracy <e> <s> having said that i align myself with what the noble earl lord halsbury said last week in committee namely that i fully support the bill but that i do not propose to spend time intervening in the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he think that even if the medical research council devotes the bulk of this fund so reserved to the same kind of work as that being done by the research unit that the medical research council as a science-led body is the right body to undertake research concerned with the delivery of primary care to the national health service <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the two amendments <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord caldecote has indicated this is a subject which has been before the select committee on science and technology for a number of years <e> <s> in its report on research and development in the engineering industry which was published in the recommendation was first made that companies should disclose their research and development expenditure in their annual accounts <e> <s> in the committees report on civil rd reiterated that recommendation and said that since the voluntary system had not resulted in much progress in the matter it should be made compulsory and legislation should be introduced for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate of this character even as an intermediate speaker it is difficult to raise new relevant points <e> <s> if i emphasise or enlarge only on points that have already been put forward i will at least be brief <e> <s> in the debates on the education reform bill much anxiety was expressed at the degree of centralised and detailed control that could be exercised by whitehall over the management of universities <e> <s> amendments were carried or concessions made by ministers on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak mainly about the nuclear report <e> <s> i wish to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord nelson of stafford for the manner in which he conducted the inquiry <e> <s> as the noble lord has said it was not free from difficulty <e> <s> while it was in progress the government which was in parallel reviewing the british nuclear research effort shot no fewer than three of the committees foxes <e> <s> however it is of some interest that apart from one issue the committee found little to criticise in the governments decisions <e> <s> the exception relates to the decision about the future of the fast reactors <e>", "<cs> no my lords if the noble lord will excuse me i spoke of the pusillanimity of successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody is more conscious or has more experience of the crucial importance of this issue in public opinion than i <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying that owing to an engagement from which it is impossible for me to extricate myself i must apologise both to the house and to the minister that i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate for the support which they have given to the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness said that there was really nothing between us and the government but there is something important between us because she is saying that she does not think an amendment is necessary and we consider that it is essential <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble lord lord williams of elvel said about the interpretation of the clause <e> <s> of course there is a difference between good research and bad <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to intervene in this debate but i should first declare an interest <e> <s> i am becoming increasingly deaf and therefore dependent on hearing aids <e> <s> that has led me to pay some attention to this bill which i might not otherwise have done <e> <s> i support the objectives of the bill which has been so clearly and sympathetically introduced by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start with an apology <e> <s> owing to the demands of a select committee i was not able to hear the introductory speech of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> however i came into the chamber as soon as possible and i have heard a great proportion of the speeches that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring simply to the document put out by the royal society which states the case for human embryological research <e> <s> i believe that that is the definitive document <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the sub-committee which drew up the report i fully support its conclusions and recommendations <e> <s> nonetheless i venture to inflict a few brief personal comments on the evidence as it strikes a non-scientist <e> <s> it was one of the most complicated and intricate inquiries that the select committee has undertaken because of the myriad of uncertainties involved <e> <s> further the hypothetical effect of one uncertainty on the others serves to multiply their total and makes judgment extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i too am interested in a university which is in a high-cost area <e> <s> it is quite clear that unless some flexibility is written into the bill the whole scheme will suffer a distortion in view of the strong variations in the cost of living in different parts of the country <e>"]
