["<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations to those of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby on the maiden speech of the noble earl lord attlee which i found to be both interesting and admirable <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford explained the reasons why he had decided to introduce this bill and i feel that i should declare my interests in it <e> <s> they are two <e> <s> i have been disabled for years and for the last of them i have been concerned with both statutory and voluntary organisations who themselves were concerned with the rehabilitation and training of disabled people for open industry and the provision of sheltered employment <e>", "<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships this evening i invite the usual courtesy and tolerance given by this house to maiden speakers <e> <s> i trust that your lordships will forgive me if i mention that i hold in my hands the notes written by my noble forebear for his maiden speech in <e> <s> there was no word processor in those days and the notes are merely a sheaf of rather illegible phrases <e> <s> the relevance to this debate is that these notes came out of extensive and well-documented archives covering over years in the life of the london hospital in whitechapel with which lord knutsford was closely connected <e> <s> that fact reminds us that not only galleries and museums but also private institutions have extensive archives which they have to fund from their own resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself at odds with previous speakers because they have all had great experience of museums whereas i have absolutely none <e> <s> i can observe only from a base of ignorance and dare to voice some thoughts which i am afraid will certainly not be as profound and spicy as those voiced by the noble lord lord goodman <e>"]
