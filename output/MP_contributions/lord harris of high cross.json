["<cs> my lords in rising to address your lordships house for the first time i am so bowed down by the great privilege and honour that i shall need all the customary indulgence you extend to maidens in distress <e> <s> by way of all too inadequate preparation i applied myself to reading your lordships proceedings in copies of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also much obliged to the noble lord lord ferrier for the opportunity to repay a great debt of gratitude <e> <s> i have gained lasting relief over many years from the ministrations of chiropractors and i know of many more who have gained relief from more acute distress <e> <s> i have a modest interest to declare as a recent patron of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from the cross-benches rather late in the evening to challenge or confront the noble lord lord kaldor on his repeated and central criticism of the governments monetary policy <e> <s> i am not altogether unhopeful of making some progress although i think it may be in stages and modestly over a period because there is much room for misunderstanding in these matters as well as much blindness and wilful misrepresentation of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am personally grateful to the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa for his courtesy in serving notice of his intended chastisement and i was glad at any rate that we share the doubts or disillusion about the eec which i personally have always strongly opposed <e> <s> however i must say that i am fairly unrepentant in my approach to domestic economic problems because my view is that the noble lord played down long-term deep-seated problems by reference to short-term and rather superficial symptoms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to the point that much of the dramatic and disturbing running down of industries is the result of the failure of past policies which in my view we may be in danger of maintaining beyond their usefulness <e> <s> it was the noble baroness lady white who reminded us that this whole problem goes right back into our history <e> <s> in the s the talk was of the depressed areas <e> <s> in the s they became the special areas <e> <s> in the s we had many bewildering changes movements towards what were called development places and development districts <e> <s> by we had development areas covering half the country and a distinction was made between special and intermediate areas <e>", "<cs> and new markets <e> <s> one of the merits for all their shortcomings of competitive markets is that they exert a continual gradual persistent pressure to shift resources from old and declining employments into new and expanding employments <e> <s> it seems to me that it is by obstructing market forces that we have delayed change and then caused a massive aggravation and intensification of the problem <e> <s> i am ready to admit that change creates worrying social problems but my argument is that they are best dealt with by social policies directed to income support in transitional unemployment which would be made shorter by retraining removal grants and all that <e> <s> what we should see is that we cannot secure lasting security by trying to run great industries like the steel industry as appendages of the welfare state <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned hong kong in relation to professor milton friedman <e> <s> i daresay that everyone in this house was brought up to mock hong kong as a source of unfair competition to british industry because the natives were fed on a handful of rice <e> <s> it is now a matter of speculation in what year in the s hong kong will overtake britain in terms of average real income per head <e> <s> that has all been achieved by trade unions and government intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords it was no doubt somewhat foolhardy for me to think of emerging from the no-mans-land of the cross-benches to intervene in what i thought would be a fair old party political dogfight <e> <s> indeed i thought until the noble lord lord kaldor spoke that the argument was conducted with all of the usual decorum that marks debates in your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord certainly injected a great amount of vigour passion and invention into your lordships proceedings <e> <s> we shall look forward to looking at his latest submission in the library and coming back to trying to sort out some of his difficulties in understanding the monetary propositions in forthcoming debates <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first opportunity i have had to follow and congratulate a maiden speaker and i must say that it is a most agreeable occasion for me <e> <s> i have met the noble lord lord keith of castle- acre in the real world outside and had no doubt that he would impart something <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord be wholly astonished to hear that there is some legal support for the view that the proposed clause on the closed shop which involves some kind of inquisitorial process it has been described as an examination of the heart and mind of the individual is wholly inconsistent with the commitment into which the government have entered in the words of the convention to safeguard the individuals <e>", "<cs> may i from the cross-benches support the amendments in the name of the noble marquess lord salisbury and the noble and gallant viscount lord de lisle <e> <s> as i understand it the purpose of these amendments is to unlock the padlock on the door of the closed shop <e> <s> the fact that the door will not immediately fly open in every case does not deter me from advancing these amendments because the door would at least cease to be barred and bolted against the freedom of the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord lever of manchester for his impressive thoughtful and good-natured <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from the cross-benches to second the amendment moved by the noble and gallant viscount lord de lisle for which i may say support has been pledged and promised from many parts of this house <e> <s> i shall not develop the european issue which i think will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting an orc poll conducted in april <e> <s> the single question was <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the single question was <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord for a final clarification <e> <s> i want to ask him about a specific case <e> <s> if unions make a habit of calling days of action or inaction on entirely political grounds would i be accused as hitherto a loyal member of a union i am being hypothetical of suddenly inventing deeply-held convictions and all that if i wished to resign or would political action persistent action by a trade union enable members to resign on the grounds of deeply-held convictions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow a maiden speaker the second maiden speaker in a single afternoon and to welcome him to our <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have waited just a little longer but i am glad to begin by thanking the noble lord lord beswick for the opportunity to join in this wide-ranging debate <e> <s> if i may say so without appearing to patronise i thought that his speech was quite delightful and that it was in parts very plausible and that it tended in other parts towards excessive complacency <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware of a letter which <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular personal pleasure to follow for the first time the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> he always displays such enormous enjoyment in sharing his legendary knowledge with us that we also enjoy listening to him and i congratulate him on getting better at sticking to our rather informal time limits <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for taking up the case of our namesake from sandwell and i fully share the sense of outrage he expressed about the treatment of that courageous young lady <e> <s> i was suitably impressed by the delicate courtship by the noble lord lord rochester of the noble lord lord harris as a social democrat <e> <s> i was enormously impressed by the noble lord lord brookes who i find it difficult to follow with credit for lord brookes as a practised enormously experienced industrialist has given the lie to so much of what we heard in the debates on the employment act about the necessity for the closed shop and he set an example of liberalism to those on the liberal benches who so often uphold individual freedom in principle and acquiesce time and again in its erosion in particular cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank my noble friend lord spens for so kindly agreeing to change places with me because i am prevented by a previous engagement from staying until the end of this debate <e> <s> i have enjoyed every speech that i have listened to and i congratulate my noble friend lord renton on his eloquent expression of a difficult motion and on his moderate proposals with which i would go along the road with him <e> <s> i want to confine myself to elaborating a criticism of the green paper which was voiced by one of our most distinguished columnists mr samuel <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord scanlon said how could we expect unions not to allow employers faced with a strike to resort to other sources of supply to other possible sources of labour he was making the point exactly that in this kind of dispute both sides tried to deploy the alternatives available and the unions purpose is to confine the employer to supply only from the union <e> <s> that is a totally different situation from almost every industry where there is a multiplicity of firms whose interests in many respects are divergent rather than convergent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord longford for casting his motion in conveniently wide terms <e> <s> i have enjoyed and i hope profited from all the speeches including the poignant speech of the right reverend prelate but i want to follow rather a different line of argument <e> <s> i do not know the noble earl personally enough to judge whether his amiable qualities include absentmindedness but i have a special reason for hoping that he forgets to withdraw his motion for papers at the end of this debate <e> <s> i have been wondering what papers we could recommend to the noble earl to advance his education not more blue books not more fabian tracts or official reports of which he may have swallowed too many <e> <s> what other papers would cheer the noble earl and help to persuade him that his plea for greater equality has already gone a long way towards being fulfilled in our lifetime by the remarkable operation of private enterprise in competitive markets <e> <s> my choice of papers to put this debate into perspective would be the social commentaries embodied in the bound volumes not of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady trumpington for bringing this motion before us and to congratulate her on the forceful but cheerful way in which she presented her arguments <e> <s> i was duly impressed by the unusual agreement from the liberal benches from the noble lord lord winstanley and i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> i always listen to his speeches with special care because he develops his argument with transparent sincerity and with a great deal of experience <e> <s> i listened hard in the hope of finding something with which i could agree and i can only say that i must go on listening and hoping <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i thank the noble lord for that rather sparse answer coming six months after the publication of the scott report <e> <s> is the minister aware that statutory and discretionary indexation has been extended rather surreptitiously until it embraces over million people employed in nationalised industries and in central and local government <e> <s> accordingly will the government take a rather hard look at two aspects of present arrangements <e> <s> the first is whether the government actuary underestimated the cost of indexed civil service pensions which he put in the scott report at per cent <e> <s> of salaries whereas the scott report estimated that perhaps a figure twice as high namely per cent <e> <s> of salaries might be more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the second question concerns the choice of index <e> <s> do the government consider that the retail price index is appropriate for calculating indexation when it reflects not only the debasement of the national money but also a rise in relative import prices and shifts to taxes on expenditure such as vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i join others in congratulating my noble friend lord spens in bringing this motion before us and for moving it so forcefully <e> <s> i agree with the kind of approach that he adopted <e> <s> i should like to have said to the noble lord lord mccarthy that i would join him in deploring the present levels of unemployment if he would join me in deploring the rising trend of unemployment before <e> <s> what i think is most deplorable about this saga is the extent to which unemployment has been aggravated over a long period of time by politicians of both parties animated by nothing more <e>", "<cs> my lords from the cross-benches i am very delighted to follow two powerful speeches from the liberal and conservative benches <e> <s> in congratulating my noble friend lord monson on his persistence in this matter i hope that he will not mind my revealing that this bill is the first modest fruit of an informal association of peers from various parts of the house who came together earlier this year under the name of the repeal group <e> <s> the intention of the repeal group was to make a modest beginning with a very long-term endeavour to slim down the statute book and to slim it down by the direct and simple means of identifying subsections sections or other provisions or as we become better whole acts which might be suitable for repeal as having failed to live up to their good intentions having outlived their value or being unduly restrictive of individual freedom <e> <s> your lordships might notice that already there have been read a first time and printed a number of private members bills which adopt this approach <e> <s> these bills are in the names of the noble baroness lady trumpington the noble lord lord spens and the noble lord lord rugby and they will come up for second reading presumably early in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> leaving aside the specific and i think relatively narrow issue of complying with the eec directive may i ask this further question would the noble lord and indeed the government attach no weight to the view that retention on the statute book of the full panoply of the exchange control act leaves the door wide open to periodic disruptive and even mischievous speculation that full-scale control might be reimposed over both direct investment and portfolio investment at some stage between now and the next election whenever that may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other speakers in congratulating the noble lord lord beswick not least on the moderate-seeming terms of his motion which although presented as a call for papers was really in some ways a call for mrs thatchers head on a platter <e> <s> i am afraid that i must start by expressing my regrets that the nearest thing that i personally face to a three-line whip requires my attendance at a meeting of the political economy club later this evening which means that i shall probably miss what might prove to be the bitter ending of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the renault company is pressed into service very frequently and i would advise the noble lord to go to france and discover that they manage many of their arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for that answer but i would like to ask him quite directly whether he might give a pledge that there will be no further requests by the government for adjournments of the hearings before the european commission <e> <s> i want to ask him in particular and most ernestly whether he will bear in mind the trouble into which the government got themselves over the closed shop issue where as in this case they took up an issue coming over from the labour administration and after many adjournments and five years delay it was found to be in breach of the convention and the government were required to make retrospective amendment in the form of compensation in this new employment bill before the other house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i try to help the noble lord in a rather tight spot <e> <s> may i ask this in view of the harsh words the noble lord himself uttered at the time of nationalisation in which he said the compensation terms were having a disastrous effect upon confidence would he personally urge his colleagues that the course of honour might be to present these terms to the european commission without defence and allow the proceedings to go forward i hope to the stage known as a friendly settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords after that agricultural interlude i am very glad to follow the noble marquess lord salisbury and to take my stand with him <e> <s> i must also take my stand with richard crossman at any rate as revealed in his diaries <e> <s> a recurring theme in our debate over recent months has been how far government should go in intervening to suppress or redirect market forces <e> <s> there is plainly room for wide differences of opinion and these came out well recently in a debate on the motion moved by the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord robbins and i urged from the cross-benches on that occasion even the strongest advocate of the market acknowledges that government have a number of positive functions to discharge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i will pursue that with the noble lord another time and hope to win him to my more consistent view in the matter <e> <s> i want to thank the noble lord lord rugby and congratulate him on his persistence and perseverance over a number of years <e> <s> i hope he will not mind my revealing that he is a founder member of the non-party repeal group which i mentioned briefly in connection with the shops bill the other week <e> <s> it is the repeal group which has encouraged him to bring this bill before your lordships and i personally hope that he is ready to carry the issue to a division if that looks like being necessary to jolt the government into taking some action in place of their repeated words of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i join others in thanking the noble lord lord oram for his initiative in bringing forward this motion <e> <s> at the outset i want to say that i fully respect his devotion to these noble causes and i hope that he may give me the benefit of the doubt even though my approach is fundamentally different from his though the disagreements may be more about means than about ends <e> <s> it is the first time that i have followed the noble lord lord hatch of lusby who i have heard many times <e> <s> i am still no nearer to following him philosophically and promise not to do so at any rate at such length <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not too sure that i follow the tendency of the last question <e> <s> if the noble lord would do me the honour of reading my argument he would see that i am quoting a report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to join other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord spens for bringing this bill before us <e> <s> i particularly want to congratulate him for his perseverance in moving from asking polite questions about wages councils to proposing their outright abolition <e> <s> in this he has the support of the informal group known as the repeal group whose efforts i referred to when the noble baroness lady trumpington moved her bill to repeal the shops act on th february <e> <s> i am delighted to follow for the first time the noble lord lord roberthall and i hope to demonstrate that economists are not obliged to disagree on these matters <e> <s> i urge him to keep on raising his voice in the alliance because he may help to lead the noble baroness lady seear back into the paths of true liberalism <e>", "<cs> may i express regret that the noble baroness lady macleod of borve and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes do not appear to be intending to take part in the debate <e> <s> i would not claim to he a very good substitute for either let alone for both of the noble baronesses <e> <s> they spoke on second reading as housewives and as christians who are concerned with attending church but as people who saw no necessary conflict between that and the removal of restrictions on shopping <e> <s> i find myself in an identical position <e> <s> i always find it more convenient to go to morning service at my church <e> <s> after the service and lingering over some fellowship and coffee i would not derive any advantage from the concession offered by the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> it may give somebody else per cent <e> <s> of freedom but it would deny me per cent <e> <s> of my freedom to go shopping with my family on a sunday afternoon <e>", "<cs> i have lived some of my life in scotland in edinburgh and kirkcaldy and i was not even aware that the shops act was different in that country from that of england with which i am more familiar <e> <s> returning to scotland i gather that there has recently been a development particularly in glasgow and edinburgh where some of the large shops have opened on sundays just before christmas <e> <s> again this provides an opportunity for many families to go shopping together <e> <s> not every shop opened some shops opened but others stuck to their guns and did not open <e> <s> the argument that it has to be all or nothing and a free-for-all with the abandonment of any kind of restraint is not one that is fulfilled in experience <e> <s> i urge the noble lord to consider whether the logic and coherence of a simple bill to repeal these old and discredited statutes which the noble baroness lady trumpington is proposing should be marred by an effort to bring back bit by bit some of the old anomalies and whether in the words of the noble lord lord simon of glaisdale we should say that we can rid ourselves of anomalies until one oclock but restore the full effect of them after that time <e>", "<cs> my lords this is my first opportunity to follow the noble earl lord de la warr <e> <s> i congratulate him on delivering from the tory benches a rather half-hearted speech in support of the bill and i think that he almost set an example in brevity which i shall try myself to follow <e>", "<cs> surely <e>", "<cs> one single trade union my lords that asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> i have read the official history and it indicates that the unions demanded these arrangements and they were delivered during the war <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to emphasise that i do not doubt for one moment that many of the early pioneers and the modern inheritors of the trade union mantle were and are inspired by lofty idealism and voluntary action <e> <s> it seems to me that the real error of many of their more political colleagues has been to seek higher wages through monopoly pressure and restrictionism rather than through efficiency and expansion in marketable output <e> <s> their astonishing if unintended achievement has been simultaneously to depress british standards of living while inflating money wages and costs so as to cause an alternation between faster inflation and rising unemployment <e> <s> it has taken the deepest post-war recession to enable managements in the private sector to win support from their employees often over the heads of the trade union leaders for the shedding of decades of slack working habits <e> <s> it seems to me that this beneficial process would be assisted and i think extended into the public sector if this bill went further in relieving trade union leaders of their self-destructive weaponry <e>", "<cs> my lords thanks to the remarkable self-discipline of earlier speakers the pressure of time is not now so acute that i must refrain from pursuing the normal courtesies <e> <s> therefore i wish first to thank the noble lord lord vaizey for putting down the motion and giving us an opportunity to review this important subject <e> <s> i wish also to add my congratulations to the maiden speaker the noble lord lord coleraine <e> <s> i too had the great privilege over a period of to years of knowing his father very well <e> <s> i recall his father as a conservative with marked classical liberal leanings which brought us into much agreement on contentious issues and i have no doubt that his father would have been proud to hear the eloquent and thoughtful speech which we enjoyed this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to add my thanks to the noble lord lord beloff for this opportunity to develop questions about the future of the social science research council <e> <s> i may say it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord vaizey it is a new experience for me and i rather enjoyed it <e> <s> i certainly welcome his forthright criticisms of the ssrc and his candid comments about the limitations of economics or the noble lord lord annan has correctly said and i prefer political economy which <e>", "<cs> since we on the cross-benches are not always animated by the passions which rage on the two sides i wonder whether i could try to reconcile the noble and gallant viscount who moved the amendment with his leader on the front bench <e> <s> there is a problem if you take the issue of inflation and interest rates together <e> <s> it is quite clear that if there had been nil or modest inflation since the s when these settlements might have been made the interest rate in the intervening period would have been typically or per cent <e> <s> that is the real rate of interest which prevails over a period when inflation does not disturb our calculations <e> <s> if therefore i heard the noble earl lord ferrers correctly that there will be a per cent <e> <s> cumulative interest rate allowed that amounts over a five year period precisely to a doubling of the capital sum <e> <s> actuarially a per cent <e> <s> interest rate exactly doubles your money in five years <e> <s> it is known as the rule of five fourteens are <e> <s> therefore i believe that we have resolved the issue <e> <s> the interest rate will accomplish the purpose sought by the noble and gallant viscount and peace may therefore reign on the conservative benches <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl would be patient with us because i recall in the second reading debate that he made a great deal of the forthcoming committee stage <e> <s> indeed at col he talked of how important it was for the house to have a proper opportunity to consider the details of the bill in committee and said that he would allow sufficient time for that preparation to be made <e> <s> it seems to me that he has not fully replied to the support of this amendment which is concerned about the totally unsatisfactory condition of local government at present in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i make no complaint that the noble earl lord gowrie mildly rebuked me for not taking part in the second reading debate <e> <s> i should have apologised to the committee that i was unable to be present that day <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ellenborough for drawing my attention to this bill which i admit would otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords although i congratulate the noble lord on his formally correct reply to the question asked by the noble lord lord beswick may i ask him quite explicitly whether or not he would agree that the victim of this unhealthy interest by the noble lord lord beswick the chairman of the company is the kind of entrepreneur whom the government ought to welcome bearing in mind that since he has built up from scratch without a penny of government subsidy a business with a turnover of million employing staff of whom are in this country <e> <s> ought that not to be welcomed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the vehement opposition expressed by labour spokesmen and also by spokesmen for trade unions about varying the arrangements of the national health service may i ask the leader of the house whether she and the government are aware that in the latest national opinion poll conducted in may for bupa the results confirmed an overwhelming majority even as high as per cent <e> <s> among the members of trade unions in favour of private health treatment not the abolition of the national health service but in favour of the option of private health treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that brief factual reply <e> <s> before we are deluged by emotions from a certain quarter i would like to ask a simple question if i may <e> <s> are the

<s> i was only disappointed if i may say so in his rather unadventurous approach to this challenging question <e> <s> i found myself in much agreement with what the noble lord lord campbell of croy said and i am delighted to follow for the first time the spokesman for the social democrats the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to remove certain restrictions imposed by the truck acts to and the payment of wages act with respect to the payment of wages <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i join others in thanking the noble lord lord renton for initiating this debate <e> <s> i must express the joy that i and i am sure several others felt at the lucid brevity of the speech made by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> perhaps i should start almost as a maiden speaker by asking for the indulgence of noble and learned lords who bring such legal distinction to our discussion of the quantity and quality of legislation <e> <s> as a mere economist my approach will be somewhat more down to earth although others may wish to describe it rather differently <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones partly implied much of the indiscriminate multiplication of statutes has aimed to improve our economic and social welfare yet it has conspicuously failed to usher in the promised millenium <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other speakers in thanking the noble lord lord molloy for this opportunity of discussing ways of improving conditions of employment for staff in the national health service <e> <s> i fear that he will think it a poor return that i should from the cross-benches adopt a radically different approach from his own <e> <s> despite his enumeration of irritations and discontents i believe that he tended perhaps untypically towards complacency in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is some consolation for taking part in this debate to follow the noble viscount lord thurso whose father i recall as archie sinclair was a schoolboy hero of mine in the air flying corps <e> <s> but i must confess that i parade at this hour with the greatest possible reluctance <e> <s> not having served time in the other place it has always seemed to me rather dubious that the serious business of government should be conducted after dark let alone when sensible citizens are thinking of their beds or at least of their nightcaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with others in congratulating the noble lord lord wells-pestell on his ingenious motion which and i think there would be general agreement on this he introduced so appealingly <e> <s> it is a motion that is naturally drawn in order to maximise support by rolling up every conceivable economic and social discontent into a single catch-all effort with some success so far in bringing the social democrats back at any rate on this occasion into the labour lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in bringing this bill before your lordships from the cross-benches i have been encouraged by the non-party repeal group <e> <s> it has three purposes first by the simple device of repeal to slim the statute book which has become grossly inflated until like a fat man we can no longer see where we are putting our feet <e> <s> secondly we wish to reinforce her majestys government on the urgent need to set limits to endless talk and to speed action <e> <s> our third substantive aim is to remove an obsolete barrier to spreading payment of wages by a variety of more modern economic and safe methods than by carting million of notes and coin around the country every pay day <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this i think admirable and brief debate <e> <s> i do not think that a good case has been made out for the amendment and i do not think the noble lord lord rochester gave any reference to the merits of the present truck legislation <e> <s> nothing i have heard suggests the least difficulty about giving the bill a second reading and continuing at committee stage the discussions about <e>", "<cs> my lords in sober truth i believe that too much is being made of all that and of course the ministers advisers and the international bureaucrats have a great interest in mystifying us all and alarming us if we appear to be wanting to take what seem to be quite sensible steps <e> <s> as the noble lord lord orr-ewing and the noble earl lord selkirk said so forcefully years after the karmel committee urged the repeal this amendment seeks to prolong further delays <e> <s> i have noticed before this tendency on the liberal benches to shield behind caution and compromise as a pretext for indecision and inactivity <e> <s> if we are serious in wanting progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other speakers in thanking the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for bringing this motion before your lordships house <e> <s> whatever our differences we might agree that the issue he has raised is central to the economic welfare of this country <e> <s> i believe it is also subject to a good deal of misunderstanding and just occasionally of misrepresentation of which we have had a faint echo from the opening speeches <e> <s> i thought that the view of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe was generally rather complacent <e> <s> it would be only slightly to parody what the noble lord said if i were to present him as saying if only the government will keep out of the way all will be well <e> <s> he certainly said we should not make a fuss about ownership but should concentrate on management as though a responsible owner need not be most meticulously concerned with the use to which his property is put <e> <s> the new truth on which the social democratic party seems to operate is that the publicly owned industries belong to nobody and the implication is that the boards should be left pretty free to do much as they please <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other speakers in warmly congratulating my noble friend lord rugby on his persistence courage and single-mindedness in pursuit of a quarry which i begin to sense we have at bay <e> <s> it was a splendid example of the indefatigable in pursuit of the indefensible and i rejoiced to hear for the first time the noble lord lord northfield denouncing sin and upholding market competition from the labour benches <e> <s> i welcomed that as much as i did hearing the noble lord lord winstanley speaking in those liberal accents for which i often listen in vain from the liberal benches <e> <s> i wish that i could say anything more agreeable of the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne than that it was certainly a brave effort in a bad cause and i think that we should warn the minister the noble lord lord trefgarne that if he does not do better he cannot expect in the future to escape as lightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree and join in congratulating the noble lord lord spens in promoting what has so far proved to be a sober and interesting debate on the merits of more flexible opening hours <e> <s> he pointed out that he has received some support from the informal repeal group which seeks to challenge outdated laws that restrict the freedom of adult citizens to live their own lives without hurting the like freedom of their neighbours <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lord st john of bletso that we take one test of whether legislation is outdated by asking if this law did not exist would it be necessary to invent it <e> <s> i believe on that issue the present licensing laws impose objectionable fetters on millions of people that are not justified by any overriding imperatives of public policy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord gallacher on his highly competent well-informed and cogent maiden speech <e> <s> he said at the outset that he was launching himself on somewhat controversial waters but i think we can all agree that he managed to keep upright and we look forward to hearing from him again in our future debates <e> <s> at the other end of the spectrum from the maiden speaker it was as always a joy to hear the noble lord lord thorneycroft whom i commend to lord gallacher as a model of the old hand that none of us can ever quite emulate <e> <s> i was particularly delighted as a free trader to hear his formidable case against the temptations not only for the labour party but also for conservative ministers to drift into the short-term expedient of restriction on trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i must defer this argument to another occasion <e> <s> i would by no means exempt management from a large share of the blame but i am coming on to ask why did not management do something about it <e> <s> i am saying first of all that the restrictions of which i talk were deep-seated and had come to be widely accepted <e> <s> i want to remind noble lords that when we look even in recent years to examples in printing in the docks in railways in shipbuilding even alas <e> <s> recently in the car industry we find that where managements do tackle restrictive practices or overmanning they are in for costly battles which in some cases can set a term to the existence of their companies <e> <s> but above all against the confrontation that would have been involved to tackle these problems it was so much easier for the cbi and the tuc to get together at their cosy meetings and to press government to stimulate demand for inefficient labour in the sacred name of keynesian full employment policies <e> <s> that is the nub of my criticism of that period <e> <s> i believe it has been the major cause of britains record inflation and i think it is also the explanation of britains poor record of growth and the consequent industrial decline <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a new experience for me to follow the noble lord lord kaldor with whom i have had some disagreements in the past <e> <s> but on this occasion i think it might be best to respect the informal economists protection society by not immediately following his speculations on saatchi and saatchi george orwell and sundry other matters which i found rather difficult to follow <e> <s> rather i would start by congratulating the noble lord lord bauer on what i thought was a notable contribution to our discussion <e> <s> i look forward to further such uncontroversial speeches from that quarter <e> <s> for the present i would only add that i thought his cogent criticism of the welfare state for robbing individuals of responsibility was by no means lacking in true concern and compassion which is often interpreted in a different way by the labour side of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that rather qualified answer <e> <s> may i draw his attention to the fact that when this matter was debated in this house and elsewhere there were enormous expressions on all sides of the need to reform or repeal the shops act <e> <s> if there is any doubt about the matter and the urgency of it will the government draw on the unrivalled experience of the noble baroness lady trumpington who was recently abducted from our repeal group to ornament the government benches as a baroness in waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will allow me i think there is a misunderstanding <e> <s> the last point that the noble baroness read out refers to the concentration of new housing investment exclusively in other tenures <e> <s> the noble lord lord vaizey was pointing out that you would not get investment in rented property while you have the rent control acts <e> <s> i do not think that that is inconsistent with his view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk has made a spirited reply on behalf of the labour party but i think she relies chiefly on assertion and emotion with very little attempt to analyse the operation of the rent acts which will be my chief concern <e> <s> i believe that her reference to the commons committee was highly selective and misleading as will emerge from fuller study <e>", "<cs> my lords we must set some limits to the chewing over of these events because the whole of professor salins report on new york concentrates on places like the bronx <e> <s> he is concerned with the poor end of the market of new york and not with manhattan <e>", "<cs> my lords they say that the majority of witnesses gave this view and the witnesses included shelter the small landlords association professor donnison brighton borough council the city of manchester council chestertons <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant duty on behalf of the whole house to congratulate the noble lord lord dean of beswick on his quite admirable maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure we are all glad to hear and to see that he already feels so much at home among us after his escape from the other place <e> <s> his speech was succinct was well argued was well informed was plainly heartfelt and was gracefully delivered <e> <s> he

motion in the name of the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it exactly reflects my own impatience with the failure of the government to push on more rapidly in reducing the burden of taxation which has grown remorselessly throughout the whole of this century <e> <s> if we look back to we find that governments took per cent <e> <s> of the national income <e> <s> by they took per

encouraging reply <e> <s> i wonder if i may question him a little more on the timing of the governments repeal <e> <s> in the first place i should like to ask whether the government have gone through the preparatory stage of denouncing the ilo convention no <e> <s> which is necessary to clear the way <e> <s> secondly bearing in mind that every week that we delay in removing these antique statutes million in money is shunted around the country on pay day and exposed to wage snatches and that kind of hazard will the noble earl press his colleagues to move forward with all possible speed in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have any whips or scorpions on the cross-benches <e> <s> therefore i cannot pretend to speak for my noble friends many of whom i look forward to hearing later in the debate before this day comes to its end <e> <s> for myself in the absence of radical reform to contain government spending i am content with no more reluctance than that expressed by the noble lord lord bellwin to support the government in their effort to set some limit upon those i have come to regard as local political pickpockets <e> <s> against the noble lord lord bellwin i must say that i wish that a similar statute however draconian might be devised to limit the power of central government to raise taxes which everywhere damage economic efficiency and inevitably therefore reduce employment prospects for our people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord beloff for the wide terms of his motion <e> <s> it is true that it allowed the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos to give us his splendid revivalist tirade against largely vanished abuses <e> <s> his speciality seemed to be looking back through the mists of time to tawney whose own gaze in his day was directed largely to still remoter times <e> <s> my central quarrel with the noble lord which we have rehearsed on other occasions is that in post-war welfare policy he fails to distinguish between necessary support for the minority of poor and the quite different aim of imposing a comprehensive uniformity on everyone to be financed by massive taxes that reduce the freedom of choice for the great majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat dismayed to find that i am the sixth professional economist to take part in this debate although i fear that innocent non-economists among your lordships might be even more dismayed <e> <s> i listened with close attention to the speech of the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx and i thought i detected just a note of conflict between the fun he made of the low level of the exchange rate and the approach of his former economic adviser the noble lord lord kaldor who made rather heavier work of the earlier rise in the exchange rate <e> <s> but i do not doubt for a moment that the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx would be equal to providing a perfectly convincing reconciliation of this apparent disharmony <e>", "<cs> i mean my lords that the level is far higher than it need be for the degree of success of other aspects of policy as i shall try to indicate as i go along <e>", "<cs> my lords i particularly congratulate the noble lord lord mcalpine of moffat for making his points with such commendable brevity <e> <s> it allows me to say at the outset of my contribution that i think this is just the kind of debate to which my noble friend lord robbins would have made his usual wise and weighty contribution from these cross-benches <e> <s> i have to tell your lordships that i have just heard of his death this morning after a severe stroke two years ago <e> <s> i am sure that all who knew him will agree that we will miss him grievously both as a warm friend and a wise counsellor <e> <s> he has served this house and many other institutions with rare i would say incomparable distinction <e> <s> i know we would all wish to join in sending our heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family <e>", "<cs> we must all have been impressed by the wide-ranging opening speech by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> like some other orations from the liberal benches i found myself wondering what link it had with the fundamental principles of the liberal philosophy <e> <s> i shall try to remedy this deficiency by warning against pinning too high hopes on a long-term energy strategy <e> <s> the noble lord displayed a wide knowledge gained from a lifetime of some years in the coal industry <e> <s> i hope however that he will bear in mind that a lot of knowledge can be a dangerous thing unless informed by constant humility about the changing variables that can never be known in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak very briefly from the cross-benches as one who unlike many other noble lords has no specialist knowledge of the long development of southern rhodesia and the unhappy developments in zimbabwe since the high hopes of independence <e> <s> i make no apology because in this respect i am no different from the majority of our fellow countrymen who might overcome any reluctance to speak out of turn in order to join in denouncing the evils we have heard about in this latest marxist regime <e> <s> i wonder myself when i listen to the noble lord lord hatch how someone who can criticise so vehemently every blemish and every imperfection of free societies and liberal economies in the west can moderate his criticisms when confronted by the progressive oppression that appears inseparable from advanced socialist dictatorships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must start with an apology that owing to the record length of many contributions if i may say so particularly from the labour benches i shall almost certainly have to leave before the closing speeches which i shall have to content myself with reading in hansard <e> <s> as a penance i shall speak even more briefly than usual <e> <s> my anxiety from the cross-benches is that the formidable expertise represented by the members of the european communities committee and other speakers in this debate may be in danger of being dissipated in coded exchanges about such mysteries as stabex sysmin derogations the distinction between dialogues on policies and discussions of strategies and the great issue of whether or not we should go for budgetisation <e> <s> the chief exception so far has been my noble friend lord seebohm with whom i am in close agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords several times a day recently the newspapers have told us that faced with issues of high importance and sharp party contention cross-benchers have falling on them a measure of special responsibility <e> <s> if i may recall a phrase of my late noble friend lord robbins unlike party loyalists we on these benches cannot take refuge in what he called the mystic joys of tribal unity although before the night is out the chief whip may wish there was more tribal unity on the tory benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that somewhat delphic reply <e> <s> i want to ask him this in view of the established long success of the specialist contractors in handling the collection treatment and disposal of waste of almost all industrial and commercial companies as well as building up valuable overseas

commonly of between a quarter and a half of the local authority costs <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of supporting the noble lord lord bruce of donington may i urge the minister if there is anxiety about taking stronger action to consider the powerful effect that might be derived from more publicity which could be collected even if it is not collated <e> <s> may i ask him whether he would incorporate in his publicity the fact that when birmingham put out its refuse collection to tender its own direct labour force swept the board and won the contract by volunteering to cut manning by per cent <e>

important economic issues not least that of unemployment <e> <s> i recall that pascal taught us that the first principle of morality is to make the effort to think clearly <e> <s> therefore i make no

ago before lord kaldor on the great maynard keynes <e> <s> if you will dip into the opening pages of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl redeem his rather disappointing reply to the noble baroness by throwing light on two quite specific questions <e> <s> first is he able to confirm from his extensive briefing that the total cost to public funds of support for student unions is well in excess of million <e> <s> secondly can he tell us anything about the recent developments in australia where there has been legislation against requiring students to subscribe and belong to unions

speech <e> <s> when i recall the arguments that we fought and lost with him on the government benches even on wages councils i detect that privatisation has liberated him to make speeches with which i

services like groceries <e> <s> before he sat down it was clear that he did not really think that groceries should be sold like groceries but rather be an extension of the social services <e> <s> when there is time i should like to give the right reverend prelate a refresher course on economics <e> <s> economic theory has long since abandoned the vision he held up of atomistic competiton and has adopted the more robust concept of workable competiton and contestable markets with which this bill is in full accord <e>", "<cs> my lords the sparks coming from the axes might also blind but i thank

possibility that it is confronted by a determined professional conspiracy to use a variety of tricks to preserve its closed shop in the sale of simple reading glasses <e> <s> in view of the evidence that the noble lord lord rugby has recently acquired i want to ask the minister whether the department is prepared to take the initiative to try to establish the extent to which the manipulation of the prescriptions for reading glasses is being used to defeat the purpose of the act which was to open up the supply of reading glasses to beneficial competition <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great delight to follow the noble baroness lady sharples whose teachings from long practical experience seem to me to be more representative than the somewhat alarming memories of the noble lord lord ardwick of life among his fellow journalists <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble viscount lord montgomery for raising the question <e> <s> i should also like to follow him in paying tribute to my late noble friend lord spens who as the tireless chairman of our non-party repeal group raised the last debate we had <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall pick up that point a little later <e> <s> the

noble lord lord ross in opposing clause <e> <s> even from the cross-benches i have begun to learn that in politics if one can find people who will agree with one on a certain action or inaction it is not necessary to probe too deeply to discover whether their reasons precisely coincide with ones own <e> <s> for my money the fundamental objection in principle to clause is that in place of relying as hitherto on financial incentives and disincentives to influence the number and location of dispensing chemists the government are now proposing to unleash the ultimate sanction of compulsion and prohibition against the opening of new small businesses in the form of what are popularly called chemists shops and what the noble lord lord tordoff correctly named the new pharmacies <e>", "<cs> my

like to begin with perhaps the only amiable words i shall utter in this debate by thanking the noble lord lord sainsbury for his weighty support for the governments bill and against the amendment <e>

has been generally welcomed on all sides of the house <e> <s> indeed the noble lord might ponder the enthusiasm it has provoked from some surprising quarters including my old antagonist the noble lord

forgive me for presenting a rather contrasting view perhaps in rather a strong form <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express pleasure which is diminishing by the hour in supporting the noble baroness lady cox in this motion <e> <s> i have been astonished how far labour speakers appear to have gone in minimising the mischief in schools and universities <e> <s> they spoke as though the

different view <e> <s> i agree with those speakers who have said that the ministers interim reply was pretty feeble <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the first time that i have had the pleasure of following straight upon another cross-bencher the noble earl lord perth with whom i found myself in complete agreement <e> <s> as i understand it the facility that we have available for introducing private members bills can serve several quite distinct purposes it may prove a launching pad for some great reform which the government of the day have shrunk from tackling it may tentatively draw attention to some major ill that ultimately calls for perhaps a different form of remedy it may be a modest effort to tidy up some striking anomaly in the law that would draw wide support or less pretentiously

i suspect that this bill introduced by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney to proscribe museum charges and voluntary contributions falls into this last category <e> <s> it is part of the charm of the noble lord that he is never short of an undelivered speech and like me he has his share of bees in his bonnet <e>", "<cs> well my lords that is good news <e> <s> i must say quite seriously that the everyday mechanism of payment for goods and services fulfils a number of perfectly useful purposes <e> <s> it serves to remind us that resources are scarce <e> <s> it teaches what economists call the concept of opportunity costs characterised by the late lord robbins as the invincible truism that you cannot have your cake and eat it <e> <s> payment is a test of demand and a measure of the satisfaction derived from indulging it <e> <s> without payment i would argue attendance figures mean very little indeed <e> <s> their accuracy cannot be vouched for and anyway people may just have dropped into the museum to avoid the rain or to visit the restaurant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that courteous reply <e> <s> i should like to press him on two related matters <e> <s> the first is whether he and his right honourable friend are aware that international travellers transferring between heathrow and gatwick now have to suffer the inconvenience and delay of going through baggage immigration and customs control twice over which is avoided by the helicopter link <e> <s> secondly are he and his right honourable friend aware of the danger both to british airlines and to british airports from the consequent loss of business which will only benefit our competitors in europe and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount were a betting man what odds would he give us that there will be an answer that is both early and favourable <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble viscount lord montgomery on his persistence in pressing her majestys government to reform the licensing laws in england and wales in the light of experience in scotland <e> <s> i am sure that he would join in tribute to our late friend lord spens who showed himself well ahead of his time in raising a motion in almost identical terms three years ago <e> <s> i have thought very hard about this in the meantime and i can think of only one serious ground for not welcoming an early bill to permit freer opening of public houses in england and wales <e> <s> there cannot any longer be the fear of awful consequences from alcoholic excess which scotland has now proved to be without foundation <e> <s> for my money the worst aspect of early reform would be the prospect of a repetition of all those speeches we heard from the temporal and spiritual opposition when we had the shops bill before the house <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble lords amendment i have to express regrets and whatever apology is appropriate that so far i have been unable to take an extensive part in these debates <e> <s> i have attended to what has been said while i have been here and i have read <e>", "<cs> i do not think there can be any possible objection to inserting these words which simply spell out that the function of the director is to maintain and enforce competition <e> <s> the only objection would be that it adds two lines to an already over-long bill <e> <s> but since i have coming up an amendment which would remove a couple of subsections i shall gladly support the addition of these two lines to which i cannot see any objection on the governments side in the hope that i might get some support later in respect of a rather longer passage when the time comes <e>", "<cs> i do not believe it is very persuasive to say that the director general of gas supply would be unable in the absence of these piffling subsections to enunciate to establish and to justify some form of charging that would meet the normal requirements of parity of access between the corporation which happens to be left with these installations and an outside supplier <e> <s> of course the director would have to examine all aspects of the cost and the maintenance and the depreciation and the extension of the trunk pipelines <e> <s> but to suppose that he needs lecturing about appropriate proportions and how that will be decided seems to be implausible <e> <s> if we had someone like mr carsberg i would have complete confidence that after due inquiry after calling for information and discussion he would be able to produce something where this particular i shall not say straitjacket restriction on his discretion might give this monopoly of which i share the apprehensions expressed throughout our long debates an opportunity to justify a setting of charges that would on the whole as the noble lord lord diamond said discourage rather than open the way to competition <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must just add that unlike the noble viscount i am rather tempted to indulge in a little time-wasting because i think that the ministers answer though winningly delivered is not finally persuasive <e> <s> of course there is competition between all the ways by which one might obtain heating <e> <s> the point is that competition is a good deal imperfect and there are costs involved in shifting supplies from one source to another <e>", "<cs> when i hear the noble lord talk about classic liberal free trade principles which he accepts in principle but with which he often has some difficulty in practice i think it is helpful to explain that those of us who take a very critical view of the whole of clause do so partly because the government have allowed the psnc to get them into what seems to be an indefensible position <e> <s> at the very outset of the negotiations more than two and a half years ago the main representative bodies in the pharmaceutical business solemnly signed and sealed an undertaking which affirmed that it was possible to bring about what they called a rational location of pharmacies through the exclusive use of financial incentives and disincentives <e> <s> that was a hopeful line of exploration to pursue <e>", "<cs> may i say that from the cross-benches one sometimes detects a note of what seems to be somewhat exaggerated contention on many issues <e> <s> however i have seldom found myself facing an issue that seems to me to be in some sense such a deep outrage <e> <s> this comes before us as an amendment bill but it destroys entirely the whole basis of the contract <e> <s> perhaps the location of pharmacies has proved to be unsatisfactory though it seems we are not sure whether there should be more or fewer of them <e> <s> however instead of persevering with the effort to find a way of loading the market if you like in order to encourage those facilities in urban and rural areas that would be valuable to the national health service and leaving it to the commercial judgment of retailers to come into the market and take their chance the government have embarked upon a course which is deeply shocking and which says to the vast majority of professionally qualified pharmacists as the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne has just said who are in <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how far i follow the assurances that the minister has given <e> <s> the anxiety in the minds of those supporting these amendments is that there is a sense in which this clause is unprecedented <e> <s> it has a direct effect on the livelihood of intending pharmacists <e> <s> there is anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible for me to exercise the option of re-activating the amendment if the declaration by the minister on her amendment no <e> <s> b is not as i understand it to be that is on the whole to give us what we wanted which was to prevent the chemist contractors or their employees on the sub-committees from taking part in the exclusion of applicants to set-up chemists shops <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall withdraw it in this case and listen to the noble baroness with close attention <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne in congratulating the noble baroness and to thank her for purging clause of one of its most obnoxious elements which in my view invited pharmacist contractors to allow their commercial interests to override their professional principles <e> <s> to that extent i believe that the clause will be less objectionable <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i did not find the opposition of the noble baroness to my amendment completely persuasive <e> <s> i think there has been throughout these long discussions some element of uncertainty or conflict in the mind of the dhss about whether they want a larger number of pharmacies or whether they want to reduce the number of pharmacies in order to reduce the costs to the nhs <e> <s> i mentioned earlier that the new proposals in a variety of ways will in effect squeeze out a number of smaller pharmacies by the removal of the basic practice allowance by compensation for small chemists surrendering their contract and by reducing the number of prescriptions for eligibility for the essential small pharmacy scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally disappointed by the noble baronesss reply on this matter <e> <s> i remain totally unpersuaded that the government have got right this time any more than it did before what the nuffield committee i think called the set of incentives the structure of incentives <e> <s> we have seen a reduction in the number of pharmacies from down at one time to as low as in and we have seen over the last year an increasing number of new pharmacies coming in encouraged as i still believe by the anxiety to beat the gun and obtain a contract with the nhs before this bill comes into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to get involved in a long argument on matters of accountancy with the noble lord <e> <s> however as i understand it in the absence of a stock exchange quotation which applied to only one of the companies an attempt was made to create hypothetically a stock exchange valuation on the basis of the assets in <e> <s> when we look at the progress of many of these companies after until the whole issue is that where a share price might at least be enlarged for those companies that had the prospect of good future earnings the cash assessment of the asset value at the time of might miss out that factor <e> <s> the british aircraft corporation was a highly successful expanding and growing company and to value it on an asset basis would not take into account the prospective earnings in future years as a share valuation would have done <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down finally i should like to ask whether or not he accepts that what was on trial both at the commission and at the international court was not the precise terms of the act for the reason that they would have been out of time more than six months having elapsed <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether or not he agrees that what was under consideration was the implementation of that law and that was still being moulded at that time in or by his colleague the secretary of state for industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the privilege falls to me on behalf of noble lords in all parts of the house to offer our congratulations to the noble lord lord derwent and express our pleasure in his eloquent and thoughtful contribution to our debate <e> <s> older members will confirm that his father will be sorely missed <e> <s> however we rejoice in a hereditary system that yields younger members who can enliven our debates from their recent experience and we look forward to further contributions as often as the noble lord can neglect his affairs to be with us on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to join others in congratulating the noble viscount on this effort to remove obstacles to civilised drinking with meals <e> <s> i rejoice that it has so far been supported by all the previous speakers <e> <s> i am very sad to report that my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale is unable to be with us <e> <s> however i can vouch that he would have lent strength and vigour to the advocacy of this case <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to see how we can approach this issue without rehearsing many of the arguments that will come up under clause <e> <s> i want to add my support to the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> i am unhappy to find myself in total opposition to my noble and learned friend lord denning <e> <s> it would be attractive if we could follow the noble lord lord airedale along the lines of no-fault cover and in a sense collectivise or generalise the risk <e> <s> my anxiety about that as an economist is that at the same time as we suppress the cost we remove the incentive to minimise the risk and take due care <e> <s> however the attraction of that is that by removing any consideration about negligence one would do the lawyers out of a good deal of profitable business of which i would approve and also reduce the toll of insurance upon the cost of production <e>", "<cs> my lords edmonton and high cross are almost adjoining fiefdoms but i fear that my approach remains somewhat remote from that of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i must add my thanks to the noble lord lord bottomley for introducing this debate so gently and modestly though i fear he will regard my remarks as an ill reward for those efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this lively debate and particularly the noble baroness lady macleod as the one representative of the tory back benches who always brings her human touch to our discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> i wish he had had time to continue <e> <s> i find myself in exceptional agreement with his vigorous diagnosis of this problem as i find myself in full accord with the sustained arguments of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the noble earl lord gowrie and my noble friend lord seebohm <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not deny for one moment that there are pockets even large pockets of considerable distress and real unemployment and indeed hopelessness <e> <s> the argument i have been making if the right reverend prelate will heed it is that these figures what the economists call macro or aggregate figures of total unemployment are themselves composed of a whole variety of different elements which by no means correspond with the very gloomy picture which the right reverend prelate has quite rightly pointed to in some areas <e> <s> indeed i was going to risk the wrath of the right reverend prelate by referring to an unofficial survey conducted by an organisation called orc and harris poll which last year found that as many as million out of the million official total might fall into various categories of what could loosely be called voluntary unemployment <e> <s> that includes half a million who are better off on benefits and a similar number who are living off redundancy pay or earnings from the black market economy <e> <s> however i believe that even if official statistics enormously exaggerate the true magnitude of unemployment the residual number who are genuinely seeking work is high enough to challenge complacency <e> <s> but even professor layard in his recent book <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will attend to the matter i shall tell him and these are my last words <e> <s> before the war people with average earnings did not pay income tax <e> <s> the honour of paying income tax was reserved for those with well above one and a half times average earnings <e> <s> the whole tenor of my argument this evening is that although wages costs may be too high for the success of a business net take-home pay is too low to animate and energise people to take jobs <e> <s> the argument that we heard from the noble earl lord gowrie was that we need to increase take-home pay and from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that if we can reduce taxes there will be a smaller reason for trade unions and workers to press for increased gross earnings because through reduced taxation people will be left with higher net incomes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to join others in debating the merits of the gracious speech which i judge to be quite considerable <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord diamond i commend the opening commitment to sound financial policies aimed at reducing inflation and increasing employment <e> <s> in particular i commend the extension of the youth training scheme in place of benefits for school-leavers under at least as a first step <e> <s> here we are following the example of countries as different as socialist sweden and capitalist switzerland which offer lower inducements for their citizens to become unemployed and therefore have much lower unemployment figures <e> <s> thus in both those countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in congratulating the noble lord lord ezra on what i regard as his boldness in bringing this motion before us <e> <s> after all the fact that his formidable talents devoted over a lifetime to the national coal board did not produce a more fruitful outcome is in my view the most plain indictment of the failure of the morrisonian model of nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel truly privileged to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of chester and to congratulate him on his quite splendid maiden speech <e> <s> i thought it was a model of moderation of practical observation and of constructive proposals all the more welcome to me for not looking exclusively to government for solutions <e> <s> above all he was on the whole cheerful amid many difficulties <e> <s> that is a great bonus on a day like this <e> <s> i congratulate him on behalf of the whole house but i have special pleasure personally as another grammar school boy and as a humble member of the anglican community who is sometimes perplexed and less cheerful in following a bishop <e>", "<cs> my lords among the many impressive speeches that we have had following the spirited opening by the noble lord lord ennals i am only sorry that i shall not have time to refer to more than three or four <e>", "<cs> my lords as the only cross-bencher taking part in the debate i feel that i offer a rather thin sandwich between two such practised parliamentary hands as the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord aldington <e> <s> i was delighted to hear an old treasury hand say i believe i have written this down correctly that all taxation is a bad thing <e> <s> i treat that as a good first approximation <e> <s> i was trying to think of some obscure respects in which taxes might help to strengthen our economic performance but that requires all kinds of assumptions about the difference between the impact and the incidence of those impositions <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord jay on using this occasion to advertise the burdens arising from the common agricultural policy <e> <s> they are criticisms which i wholly share and it concerns policies in europe far more deserving of the noble lords indignation than the local government finance bill with which we are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i join others in thanking the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for the opportunity to discuss this issue again in terms of what i found to be a surprising motion <e> <s> the surprise is not the reference to hunger poverty and debt in africa which has become an endemic condition despite decades of so-called aid the surprise in the motion and in the noble baroness speech is the absence of new thinking to replace what i regard as a discredited policy <e>", "<cs> my lords among the interesting observations made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington came the revelation that outer space is littered with debris <e> <s> as i listened to his subsequent reflections on economic affairs i could not help thinking that labour observations and judgments are littered with a good deal of debris <e> <s> at one stage the noble lord said that the government uphold free and unfettered private enterprise <e> <s> there is no dispute that the <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be general agreement that we have had a good crop of speeches with many more to come <e> <s> i hope i will be excused of partisanship if i say how much i enjoyed the powerful arguments deployed by my noble friend lord wyatt and how persuasive i found the contribution of the noble lord lord crickhowell who certainly heightened confidence in the future under the proposed legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords after listening to the spirited warning by the right reverend prelate against what he called the dissolution of the pubs the least we can hope is that the local brewer of the right reverend prelate will name one of its better hostelries the bishop of truro so that we can all visit it to enjoy the local brew <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to intervene because the noble lord lord williams of elvel said particularly that this was partly a manufacturing business and partly a service sector <e> <s> over the past decade or so there has been a transformation of the facilities and amenities and everything related to the industry <e> <s> one cannot say that it is demonstrable as the noble lord says <e> <s> still it remains arguable <e>", "<cs> my lords even by the usual economic standards that i try to set myself this will be a suitably brief contribution to the debate from a struggling and i feel sometimes almost fugitive member of the church of england <e> <s> after the many excellent and conscientious speeches i am unable to add new arguments but can only echo the anxieties that have been expressed by my noble and learned friend lord denning the noble lord lord renton and the noble earl lord lauderdale <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it will generally be agreed that we have had a series of absolutely first-class speeches which have maintained the quality and high seriousness of the opening contributions made by the noble lords lord kearton and lord cockfield <e> <s> i feel that unless the speeches suddenly become shorter i may have to crave the indulgence of the house to leave in the midst of the closing orations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow my old friend the noble lord lord grimond and i specially commend the social and liberal democrats for fielding a second speaker the noble earl lord russell whom i always enjoy hearing <e> <s> i can say with total honesty that i agree with all three speakers and shall largely go over the same ground perhaps carrying their criticisms a little further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord orr-ewing who carries his years in parliament with such sprightliness that it can only encourage those of us who have just arrived at the starting gate of senior citizenship <e> <s> i join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord boardman on tabling the motion which has evoked so many excellent speeches including i thought some unexpectedly decorous professions of faith in the market from the labour benches and even further afield <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the breakdown of the figure though it is no doubt available from the blue book <e> <s> an increase in social provision of per cent <e> <s> in real terms cannot conceivably be waved aside as just reflecting the increase in unemployment <e> <s> expenditure on health and social security separately has increased well <e>", "<cs> concerning that last observation the powers of the office of fair trading and of the secretary of state and other ministers will remain in position after the passage of this bill <e> <s> the concentration that is so much objected to will still come under that kind of surveillance and public attention <e> <s> the amendments that we are dealing with here purport to be concerned with the prevention of monopoly <e> <s> in the long run i believe that they may have precisely the opposite tendency <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise a voice from the cross benches on the matter <e> <s> i recall our debates in july in committee <e> <s> the noble earl lord stockton opened his case if i may say so for the prosecution by saying that these amendments look to the future <e> <s> of course that is exactly what they do not do <e> <s> he promptly followed that by saying that we must return to when the provisions against cross-media ownership were applied which was when circumstances were different <e> <s> then as if to anticipate the observation on developments since he said that proliferation of channels that is more competition or choice may be no protection against concentration or at any rate that is only part of the story <e>"]
