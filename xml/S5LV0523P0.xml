<p id="S5LV0523P0-02681">The QUEEN, being seated on the Throne, and attended by Her Officers of State (the Lords being in their robes), commanded the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, through the Lord Great Chamberlain, to let the Commons know, "It is Her Majesty's pleasure they attend Her immediately in this House".</p>

<title>ADDRESS IN REPLY TO HER MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02725">The Queen's Speech reported by the LORD CHANCELLOR.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0042"/>
<col>5</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02726">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02727"><member>Lord Kimball</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move, That a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty as follows:<lb/>
"Most Gracious Sovereign&#x2014;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament".<lb/>
It is a very humbling and special occasion to be asked to beg leave to thank, on behalf of all your Lordships, Her Majesty for the gracious Speech. Perhaps I may add the loyal feelings and admiration which all Members of your Lordships' House have for Her Majesty, her family and the untiring work that they do within this kingdom, the Commonwealth and the wider world, and to wish Her Majesty well on the two visits she is to make abroad.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02728"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02729"><member>Lord Kimball</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the tenth Parliament of Her Majesty's reign. The opening of the previous 31 Sessions was the responsibility of the late Lord Great Chamberlain who performed this task with all the care, charm and precision he devoted to the responsibilities of the great office of state exercised by his family during Her Majesty's reign. What a pleasure it is to all of your Lordships, and to the friends of the family, to see the present Lord Great Chamberlain carrying on the family tradition in a way in which his father would be proud.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02730"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02731"><member>Lord Kimball</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those of your Lordships who have had the honour to be asked to move this Address know that after soundings from the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, the formal invitation comes in a letter from my noble friend the Leader of the House. As I read it, I was very conscious of the fact that almost 44 years ago to the day I was forced to explain to the then Mr. Ganzoni, the newest of new boys, that if he did not keep my room tidy and stop burning my toast at tea he would never make a success of his life. Our respective positions in this House prove how timely that warning was&#x0021;<lb/>
I cannot guess what has assuaged the Government's appetite for legislation. We are still faced with a vigorous and wide-ranging programme of some 16 Bills and other measures. In fact in the last Session of Parliament we passed no fewer than 45 Acts, although only 15 were mentioned in the gracious Speech. I do not know how we shall progress this time. There is no question that the words of each of the proposers of the Motion for the past three Sessions may have had some effect. But the desire to expedite the parliamentary process by any reform of our procedures makes it easier for a Government to pass their legislation. Time is the weapon of the Opposition; we blunt it at our peril.<lb/>
One thing is certain: many of your Lordships must give many hours to revising work in the coming Session. Even though there are fewer Bills some, such as the Natural Heritage Agency in Scotland, follow
<col>6</col>
from legislation passed during the previous Session. However certain that may be, two major uncertainties face us at the beginning of this Session. The first is the unconditional implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution on Kuwait. The gracious Speech confirms the Government's unwaivering purpose. We all hope that, contrary to previous experience, sanctions will work. However, the similarity of the situation&#x2014;the illegal occupation and the mass of propaganda&#x2014;reminds us all of the period before the last time that the volunteer forces, one of whose uniforms I am privileged to wear today, were embodied. For the past 45 years the role of those volunteers has been an important part of the support that this country has given to NATO. That has resulted in freedom for the peoples of Eastern Europe. There is nothing I can add today to the informed debate that your Lordships had on the Middle East in early September. I can add only that we all hope that the solution can be achieved without bloodshed.<lb/>
Secondly, and nearer home, I speak as one who in another place represented a major agricultural constituency. I must tell your Lordships that I can never remember a period of greater uncertainty in the countryside. The gracious Speech mentions the multilateral trade negotiations now taking place in Uruguay and the need for a continued reform of the common agricultural policy. These negotiations are the most significant and wide-ranging trade talks, and agriculture is the key area under discussion. The economies of all countries in the world stand to benefit from the successful outcome of these negotiations.<lb/>
Her Majesty's Government are insisting that the reform of the common agricultural policy must be on a fair and equal basis among all the Community states. A figure of a 30 per cent. cut in support has been mentioned and, of course, in the case of Great Britain that is backdated to 1986. Therefore, the British farmers have already endured nearly 22 per cent. of that cut. An appreciation of that fact reduces the uncertainty now facing the agricultural community. The health of the countryside is not helped by the livestock market's decline caused by a reduction in the number of people eating meat, the disruption caused by the Middle East crisis, over-supply, Eastern Europe and, above all, the disruption by the French of Community free trade.<lb/>
Other measures are promised. As chairman of the Government's Firearms Consultative Committee I must warn your Lordships that the full financial implications of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 will come before this House this Session. The only way to mitigate their impact will be to extend the licensing periods. Firearms consultations have given me the opportunity to meet many distinguished police officers during the course of the past year. Throughout the kingdom they all stressed that their major problem is the lethal poison of drugs in our society. I welcome the promise in the gracious Speech of further vigorous measures against drug trafficking. There are few towns in Great Britain today where drugs are not available. Worse still is the targeted pushing by the traffickers towards our school children. I do not wish to say
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0043"/>
<col>7</col>
anything controversial on this occasion, but it is my personal belief that we have all learnt to live with and respect the breathalyser for random testing. We may well have to move towards the random testing for drugs in schools.<lb/>
There are better places to be than London in November. I must admit to remarkably few attendances in either House at the opening of Parliament. Plenty of Peers want to attend. In fact the real parliamentary battle comes much later in the Session. However, at the start of such an important parliamentary Session, and one at the end of which there may be an important judgment, I hope that some Members of both Houses will reflect on the advice given as long ago as 1862 by the then Mr. Bromley Davenport, a Member of another place. In his <i>Dream of an Old Meltonian</i> he wrote:
<quote>"Ride Straight for truth's timber no matter how strong. I'll pound you safe over. Sit steady and quiet".</quote>
To complete the programme outlined in the gracious Speech many will need to remain firm and silent and sit steady and quiet.<lb/>
My Lords, I beg to move the Motion for a humble Address to Her Majesty.<lb/>
Moved, that a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty in the following terms:<lb/>
"Most Gracious Sovereign&#x2014;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament".&#x2014;(<i>Lord Kimball</i>).</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02732">3.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02733"><member>The Earl of Shrewsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to second my noble friend's Motion for a humble Address in reply to Her Majesty's most gracious Speech.<lb/>
To have been given such a task is a great honour. I am grateful to my noble friends the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip for bestowing the privilege upon me. In the light of my critical speech made during the previous Session on the findings of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report into the supply of beer I can only think that there was considerable merit in my words or that I have been forgiven my misdemeanours. My noble friend Lord Kimball led me on that occasion too and proferred many constructive comments to your Lordships. I cannot help but think that, as we have been paired once again today, my noble friend and I are rapidly becoming the terrible twins of your Lordships' House&#x0021;<lb/>
When I was asked to take a part in today's proceedings I was given advice by many friends. They suggested that in recent years few Peers from Staffordshire have had this privilege. I consulted the Librarian of the House, who informed me that my late father never spoke in your Lordships' House; nor did my great grandfather, the previous Earl. They were indeed sensible men. They never suffered the pre-race nerves that have been my constant companion during the past few days.<lb/>
<col>8</col>
To wear court dress is completely new to me. It is entirely the fault of my noble friend the Chief Whip, coupled with my noble cousin Lord Mowbray. My noble kinsman told me that as he is the heir general to the Talbot family, of which I am but a mere junior member, he would insist that I was correctly dressed. Even my wife does not recognise me. It is just as well&#x0021;<lb/>
To have the pleasure of following my noble friend Lord Kimball is also a great honour. I know that he had a most distinguished career in another place. Even more important to me is the fact that he shares my interest in the well-being of the countryside, in country pursuits and in the folk who live in rural areas, all of which I hold dear. Life is not always a party in those areas. The upkeep of rural communities is becoming increasingly more difficult. Your Lordships' support of matters rural is most important and it is warmly welcomed by those who live and work in those communities.<lb/>
In addition, my noble friend represented an East Midlands constituency. He and I have our homes in the East Midlands and I work in the West Midlands. What an important part of the United Kingdom is the Midlands. The region's historical fabric of agriculture together with commerce and industry has always been at the heart of this nation's economic success. Long may that situation continue.<lb/>
Her Majesty's most gracious Speech is always the high point of the parliamentary year. We in this House, together with Members of another place and the country in general, wait with much interest to learn the intended programme for the forthcoming Session. In the past, the parliamentary work schedule has been very heavy and this new Session promises to be no different. By now our wives are used to us returning home at late hours. Indeed, I heard from a noble friend that his wife had recently presented him with a new coconut doormat into which had been woven the legend: "And what time do you call this"&#x0021;<lb/>
The gracious Speech refers to a full part being played by the Government in the Commonwealth. I am certain that all noble Lords will support that excellent statement. With member nations coming from the territories in the six continents and five oceans, the Commonwealth, with Her Majesty at its head, is surely the true example of global co-operation. Its expanding nature bears testimony to its past successes and the confidence with which it is viewed by very many in the present day.<lb/>
I am delighted to hear in the gracious Speech that further moves designed to improve and enhance our transport system are planned. As one who is interested in the subject and who appreciates the tremendous cost incurred by commerce and industry as a result of an ageing and inadequate transport network, like many of your Lordships I warmly welcome that good news. A great deal has been done in recent years in that area, but there is still much to do. The demands placed upon the country's infrastructure by the motor vehicle alone grow daily, and there is a very real need to look forward with much greater flexibility and awareness to solve potential problems before they arise.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0044"/>
<col>9</col>
Her Majesty's gracious Speech refers to a continuation of the work to help the regeneration of our cities, and both the public and private sectors in the development field have started to tackle that problem with varying degrees of success. It is not always easy to attract interest into refurbished properties in a previously run-down city area. Attitudes and perceptions must be altered and as always there must be sound financial reasons on a commercial basis with which one can attract potential customers. However, there are interesting schemes for development in the pipeline at present such as the proposed redevelopment of Birmingham's Bull Ring Centre, and the redevelopment of the Fort Dunlop site, which is a landmark, at the side of the M.6 motorway. Any moves to improve the situation in our cities by the supply of low-cost housing within the total equation of regeneration in general would be welcomed by many.<lb/>
That inevitably brings me on to the subject of planning. Like many of your Lordships, I very much welcome proposed legislation to improve and simplify the town and country planning system. That can only be beneficial. Planning is, by its very nature, a complex and contentious issue which all too often adds further complication and a great deal of extra cost to already highly involved schemes. Often the effects of bad planning last for many generations, as can be seen by many of the structures put up in the 1960s, and have a considerable impact in both economic and social terms. I know that when this subject is discussed by your Lordships, it will attract many interesting and highly informed speakers. That promises to be a most lively debate.<lb/>
As a parent, I believe that the family unit is the single most important component of the fabric of daily life. Certainly without my family I should be very much the poorer. I hasten to add that I mean poorer in non-financial terms. School fees are a terrible burden. I warmly welcome any effort made to strengthen parental responsibility including the enforcement and collection of maintenance. I find it quite in possible to understand how a parent can reject his or her responsibilities to their children, and I am sure that a very great measure of support will be forthcoming on all parts of your Lordships' House when the opportunity arises.<lb/>
While touching upon the most important subject of the family, it would be very remiss of me to pass comments without reference to a subject which has touched everyone's heart this year. Of course I refer to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother's 90th birthday last summer. Her Majesty has always been the epitome of so many good qualities, and she is a shining example of selflessness, responsibility and a caring for others which is so often sadly lacking in modern day life. Her Majesty's exceptional qualities are not only attributed to sound family life but also a lesson to us all.<lb/>
Finally, I thank noble Lords for listening to me with the patience and forbearance which is so much a hallmark of proceedings in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
<col>10</col>
My Lords, I beg to second my noble friend's Motion for a humble Address to Her Majesty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02734">4.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02735"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this debate be adjourned until tomorrow.<lb/>
It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the proposer and the seconder of the Motion upon their most interesting speeches. The noble Lord, Lord Kimball, who was the assiduous Member for Gainsborough in another place for many years, gave us in his speech the flavour of his public interests. As he made clear, one of those interests is the countryside upon which the noble Lord speaks with experience and conviction. I fully sympathise with his reference to the problems of farmers, and hill farmers in particular at present. The gracious Speech mentions the reform of the CAP. We shall be returning to that subject in the course of our debate.<lb/>
However, the noble Lord was right to refer to the uncertainty which is felt in the countryside at present, and the duty of the Government to seek to make a response to that. We much appreciate the difficulties which Mr. John Gummer has faced and the fight which he has made, which we should admire. However, the difficulties remain and those must be taken very carefully into account by the Government.<lb/>
The speech of the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, revealed also the range of his interests. I understand that one of those is transport. As we are' to have a package of transport Bills during the Session, the expectation is that the noble Earl will be kept very busy indeed. I know that the Government will be relying on the noble Earl both in debate and in the Division Lobby. We much admire the noble Earl's dress this afternoon; but the Government Chief Whip, who has been advising him about that, will be more concerned with his presence in the Lobby than in what he is wearing.<lb/>
It is a remarkable coincidence that both the noble Earl and the noble Lord share so many interests such as the countryside; the brewing industry; and their recreations. I have noted in the reference books that the noble Lord, Lord Kimball, lists his recreations as hunting, fishing and shooting, and the noble Earl lists his interests as hunting, racing and shooting. I noted that the main difference between the noble Lord and the noble Earl seems to be that the noble Lord went to Eton and the noble Earl to Harrow; but they are both a credit to their old schools.<lb/>
Turning to the gracious Speech, I must say to the noble Lord the Leader of the House that I welcome it particularly in one respect; namely, that it appears to be less burdensome than many we have had for many years. I know that noble Lords in all parts of the House will be glad about that. There is a whiff of the hustings about it. Bearing in mind the weight of legislation with which we have had to deal and the added complication of a flood of new amendments at a late stage, this House has a very worthy record as a revising Chamber, and many Acts of Parliament would be seriously flawed were it not for the hard work of noble Lords in all parts of the House.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0045"/>
<col>11</col>
We shall have some very important Bills with which to deal during the Session. We shall do our best to scrutinise and amend them where necessary. Those include the Criminal Justice Bill. While there are areas of that which we can support, nevertheless we have grave doubts about the proposal to privatise remand centres. That will come before us in due course.<lb/>
As I said earlier, there are to be four transport Bills. There again we shall be looking carefully at the proposed privately-funded road schemes. In Wales we still remember the Rebecca riots, and we do not wish to see a repeat of that. What the country really needs is a coherent transport policy, but I am not sure that two, three or four Bills will provide that.<lb/>
There are a number of Bills mentioned in the gracious Speech which seem to be relatively uncontroversial such as the matters referred to by the noble Earl; namely, planning, new benefits for the disabled; and other matters. I know that on those we shall take a helpful and constructive approach.<lb/>
However, if the legislative workload appears to be lighter as we face the new Session, we must recognise also that below the surface profoundly serious problems are seething. We shall be debating these problems over the next few days. In my estimation their gravity is so great as to make this the most important debate on the gracious Speech for many years past.<lb/>
We agree with the paragraph in the gracious Speech about Kuwait and Iraq. The crisis will be dealt with fully by noble Lords in the debate on foreign affairs next Tuesday. The state of the economy will be discussed on the final day. I must say that Ministers have a tendency to skate over that subject and to refer to maintaining firm financial policies. Again, those are the words in the gracious Speech. However, the experts, including the Government's friends, say that we are in the first lap of a recession; but the gracious Speech gives little indication of concern.<lb/>
I should have thought that the Government would take very seriously the warnings of the CBI. Its latest industry survey shows the largest drop in business confidence for 10 years. It states that demand has fallen much faster than expected, that optimism about exports has declined sharply, that lower investment is expected over the next year and that employment will fall by about 9,000 each month for several months to come. My noble friends Lord Williams and Lord Peston, and other noble Lords, will be dealing with these matters in detail next week and we hope that Ministers will respond openly and frankly about what is, in my view, a basic problem now facing the country. These are not days when we can afford to be complacent about Britain's economic future.<lb/>
The words of Mr. John Banham at the CBI conference yesterday should shake the Government. They certainly disturbed me. He said:
<quote>"Before it is too late get your act together".</quote>
<col>12</col>
Those words from one of the leaders of the CBI, which is sympathetic to the Government, should cause the Chancellor of the Exchequer and indeed the Prime Minister to pause and think carefully.<lb/>
Finally, I refer to the turmoil which exists within the Government. It is a subject one cannot avoid. Personally, I much regretted the departure of Sir Geoffrey Howe from his office and from the Government. Sir Geoffrey was an outstanding member of the Prime Minister's Administration since 1979 and his decision to leave reveals a fatal flaw in the management of our affairs. It is very much in the public interest that this flaw should be recognised and remedied.<lb/>
The argument centres on Europe and the way our relations with the Eleven are handled. These are matters which will very much feature in this debate as it proceeds. Noble Lords opposite will also wish to consider how relations between the Prime Minister and senior and respected members of her party are handled, too. There are problems both at home and abroad. If these matters cannot be resolved perhaps the time has come for the Prime Minister to seek the views of the country in a general election. That would be preferable to months of bickering and uncertainty.<lb/>
In the meantime, the noble Lord, Lord Kimball, and the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, have given this debate an excellent start, and we are most grateful to them. I beg to move that this debate be adjourned until tomorrow.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02737"><member>Lord Jenkins of Hillhead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and to endorse his felicitous words about the mover and the seconder of the Motion for a humble Address. I sat in the House of Commons for many years with the noble Lord, Lord Kimball. Indeed my memory goes back to when I spoke against him at the by-election in the Lincolnshire Wolds in 1956 when, if my memory is correct, my noble friend Lord Walston was the Labour candidate. The noble Lord, Lord Kimball, was thereafter always a forthright and respected spokesman on broad acres and rural values, which did not fail to embrace the virtues of hunting.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, pointed out, the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, also lists his recreations as lying in that direction. Therefore, I cannot help reflecting that if the noble Lord and the noble Earl had attended the National Trust annual general meeting at Llandudno on Saturday and deployed the same persuasive eloquence which they have shown this afternoon my wife's life might have been a little easier. Hunting raises passions; but it is clearly regarded by the Government as a less divisive subject than some others one can think of at present. For example, I would have enjoyed hearing the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, moving or seconding the humble Address this afternoon.<lb/>
The noble Earl also takes me even further back than the Gainsborough by-election. It was at a
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0046"/>
<col>13</col>
remarkable property of his family, already out of their possession and turned over to entertainment&#x2014;Alton Towers&#x2014;that nearly 49 years ago I first experienced frozen parade grounds and the fug of nissen huts on my introduction to army life.<lb/>
The noble Earl, on previous experience and certainly on the basis of his performance this afternoon, must feel the shadow of promotion to the Government Front Bench hanging over him; and he cannot console himself with the thought that there are no vacancies. Under this Government there are frequent and plentiful vacancies. Whatever else may be said about the Government, they cannot be accused of having a stultifying effect on ministerial promotion.<lb/>
I congratulate the noble Lord and the noble Earl most warmly and turn for a few minutes only to the gracious Speech as we have four days of solid debate to come. Except in the transport field, the Government must be acquitted of previous years' sins of overwhelming us with heavy legislation; but that is the most that can be said for the gracious Speech. It recalls to my mind two remarks of former leaders of the Conservative Party. Like Churchill's pudding, it has no theme. I also remember Arthur Balfour's remarks on a lecture to which he had listened. He said that parts of it were original and parts of it were true, but unfortunately the parts which were true were not original and the parts which were original were not true&#x0021; I would rather say that parts of the gracious Speech are incontestable, such as,
<quote>"Estimates for the Public Service will he laid"</quote>
before the House of Commons. Parts are unfortunate; such as the reintroduction of the war criminals Bill. Parts are, frankly, incredible in view of the facts of the past few years; such as the reference that the Government,
<quote>"welcome the unification of Germany",</quote>
or that the Government's anti-inflation policy will be strengthened by the ERM&#x2014;produced at a time when inflation is almost at its highest for a decade and after 11&#x00BD; years of insisting that the position was the other way round and that inflation must come down before membership.<lb/>
The gracious Speech traditionally marks the opening of a parliamentary year, but I have a strong feeling today that this one may be seen in history more as marking the end of a political era.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02739"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, that the debate be adjourned until tomorrow. It is a pleasure to do so. From time to time, usually for reasons of procedure, the Leader of the Opposition has what might appear to be the unenviable task of supporting the Leader of the House, and I welcome the opportunity which this occasion provides to return the compliment. I do so as no mere formality, because my thanks are due to the noble Lord, to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the noble Baroness, Lady Hylton-Foster, and all the members of the usual channels for their co-operation and wise counsel over the past year.
<col>14</col>
Without their good offices, this House would be unable to do the valuable work that it undoubtedly does.<lb/>
This is a day for looking forward and not back, but I should like for a moment to reflect that the last Session was perhaps one of the most interesting that I can remember. Two major Bills involved matters of individual conscience and on many other occasions we debated issues on which there were deeply held convictions.<lb/>
It was a full as well as an interesting Session, yet it finished six days ago and the State Opening has taken place today in the traditional first week of November. I believe that this reflects great credit on the way in which we conduct our proceedings, unique so far as I know among legislative Chambers around the world, in being a wholly self-regulating Chamber.<lb/>
I should like to thank the noble Lords, Lord Cledwyn and Lord Jenkins, for what they said about the speeches proposing and seconding the Motion for a humble Address. During the five years that my noble friend Lord Kimball has been a Member of your Lordships' House he has created his own particular role in our counsels, his interventions always having the hallmark of clarity and brevity, two qualities which are dear to the heart of every Chief Whip and indeed to all your Lordships. But I confess that I hesitated before inviting my noble friend to propose the humble Address today. It was not just because years ago he found me an unsatisfactory maker of toast and brewer of tea. Years ago, and I believe extending into Victorian times, your Lordships' House, so I understand, was accustomed to go into Recess from the summer until the end of the shooting season. I know that my noble friend deplores the passing of that custom.<lb/>
Nevertheless, once I had secured his acceptance, I was looking forward to my noble friend's speech, and I do not think that either I or your Lordships were disappointed. I welcome my noble friend's firm yet wise words about the Gulf crisis. I heed his warnings about the agricultural industry; I endorse his emphasis on the crucial importance of the GATT negotiations, and I am glad that my noble friend feels that this may be a less onerous programme, but one which will nonetheless give your Lordships plenty to do. It was good to see my noble friend in such excellent form today. I should like quite genuinely to repeat the time-honoured sentiment that I hope we shall hear from him on many future occasions.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Shrewsbury is of course heir to one of the most illustrious titles in the land. My noble friend is not unique in your Lordships' House in bearing a name which Shakespeare spoke; but that makes him a member of a select band who represent a remarkable continuity in the history of our country, a continuity of which we can be very proud. I am glad to see that all the honours of my noble friend's title &#x2014;Premier Earl on the rolls of England and Ireland and Hereditary Great Seneschal or Lord High Steward of Ireland&#x2014;do not bear particularly heavily upon him. Indeed as deputy chairman of one of the country's largest building societies, my noble friend
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0047"/>
<col>15</col>
certainly cannot be accused of living in the past. I was therefore particularly interested in what he had to say about housing and the regeneration of the inner cities.<lb/>
My noble friend has made a most interesting contribution to start the debate on the gracious Speech, for instance dealing with issues concerning transport, whose department is introducing no fewer than four Bills in the coming Session. I should like to give him my warmest congratulations on his speech today.<lb/>
Transport is a major theme of the legislative programme which the Government plan for this Session. Tomorrow my noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara intends to introduce one of the most significant Bills in the programme, the New Roads and Streetworks Bill. My noble friend Lord Strathclyde will also introduce the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Bill, taking on the work your Lordships have so recently done on the Environmental Protection Bill. In the next few weeks I expect also that the Planning and Compensation Bill will be introduced into your Lordships' House. In addition to those three substantial Bills, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will be introducing the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Bill, and my noble friend Lady Hooper will introduce the Census (Confidentiality) Bill. If your Lordships do not feel that that is a sufficient diet for the first few weeks, I can say also that my noble friend Lord Ferrers will introduce the Maintenance Enforcement Bill.<lb/>
The arrangements for the remainder of the debate on the humble Address are that tomorrow we shall consider home and social affairs. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will open for the Government and my noble friend Lord Henley will reply. On Monday next, your Lordships will turn to matters concerning the environment and transport. My noble friend Lord Brabazon will open the debate and my noble friend Lady Blatch will reply. Foreign affairs and defence will be debated next Tuesday. My noble friend Lord Caithness will open for the Government and my noble friend Lord Arran will reply. Finally, on Wednesday next, we shall debate the economy. I shall open the debate and my noble friend Lord Hesketh will reply.<lb/>
<col>16</col>
I am pleased to support the Motion of the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition that the debate be adjourned until tomorrow. I should like to join him and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, in warmly congratulating my noble friends who moved and seconded the Motion on the humble Address today.<lb/>

<title>Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02753">Debate resumed on the Motion moved yesterday by Lord Kimball&#x2014;namely, That a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02754">"Most Gracious Sovereign&#x2014;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament".</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02755">3.12 pm</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02756"><member>The Lord Chancellor (Lord Mackay of Clashfern)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, today we are to debate home, health and social affairs in the context of the gracious Speech. The measures which the Government will be putting before Parliament in these areas will touch the lives of many of our fellow citizens. The subjects are therefore wide-ranging and important.<lb/>
But I am afraid I must start with an apology. I shall listen with interest to as much of the debate as I can but I am afraid that I have a number of engagements this evening which will mean that I shall have to leave, I anticipate, before the end of the debate. I hope your Lordships will be kind enough to excuse me.<lb/>
It is a pleasure to begin my remarks by endorsing all that has been said about the two distinguished speeches which the House heard yesterday from the movers of the humble Address to Her Majesty.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Kimball was resplendent in the uniform of the Leicestershire and Derbyshire Yeomanry, while the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, was equally resplendent in his court dress. I can assure the noble Earl that court dress becomes more comfortable the more often it is worn.<lb/>
Both my noble friends expressed their interest in, and concern for, the countryside. My own thanks are particularly due to my noble friend Lord Kimball for this as he has in the past employed one of my cousins as a shepherd at Achness on Strathnaver. I am sure that everyone present in the House was very pleased to be addressed by my noble friend Lord Shrewsbury, thus forestalling the emergence of a tradition of silence on the part of his family. The noble Earl referred to his work and that of the noble Lord, Lord Kimball, in the Midlands. I too can testify to the regeneration of our cities there from a recent visit I paid to Wolverhampton to open the new combined court centre, a distinguished building appropriate to the task of dispensing justice in that important part of our
<col>20</col>
country. Together the two speeches provided an admirable opening to our discussions on the gracious Speech.<lb/>
The legislative programme which Her Majesty's Government intend to put before Parliament will continue to build on the foundations laid in earlier parliamentary Sessions. Two particular themes underlie the measures being introduced; first, the Government's continuing commitment to improving the quality of life of their citizens in all its aspects, and, secondly, the furtherance of policies that confirm the importance of the family.<lb/>
The first of these themes can be seen in the Government's intention to bring forward a Bill for England and Wales to deal with the sentencing of offenders and to strengthen the parole system. This will be the Criminal Justice Bill. The Bill will implement the proposals in the White Paper <i>Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public,</i> which was published in February this year, and other provisions related to the treatment of offenders. The Home Office received comments on the proposals from a wide range of organisations and individuals, and these have been fully considered in preparing the Criminal Justice Bill. I hope your Lordships will understand that I do not feel able to go into great detail about the Bill's contents in advance of its publication. This afternoon I intend to restrict myself to the issues of sentencing and parole.<lb/>
I turn first to the sentencing of offenders. The White Paper proposed a coherent statutory framework for sentencing based on the seriousness of the offence, with each offender receiving his or her "just deserts". The sentence meted out to offenders should reflect the seriousness of the particular offence or offences of which they have been convicted whether that sentence is a financial penalty, a community penalty or a custodial sentence. There should be longer prison sentences for serious and violent crimes where this is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender. The Bill will implement this general framework.<lb/>
At present, the great majority of offenders are fined. We intend to go ahead with the White Paper's proposal for a system of "unit fines" which would relate the fine in any particular case to an offender's ability to pay. There have been successful pilot experiments in four magistrates' courts on the unit fines scheme. The idea behind it is that courts will take into account both the seriousness of the offence and the offender's disposable weekly income in setting the amount of the fine. Poorer offenders will pay less than the ones who are better off under the scheme, but the fine is intended to make similar demands on each. In this way the fairness of different penalties imposed upon different people for the same offence can more easily be tested. The system will help the courts set fines at a realistic level for each offender; this in turn should ensure that more fines are paid and reduce the incidence of imprisonment for fine default.<lb/>
If the offence requires more than a fine by way of punishment, the courts will be able to impose a sentence of punishment in the community. In line with
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0050"/>
<col>21</col>
the White Paper's proposals, the courts will have a wider range of community penalties from which to choose. These will be backed up by national standards for probation supervision, and clear arrangements for enforcement. As the White Paper proposed, the probation order will become a sentence of the court, reflecting its increasing use for rather more serious and persistent offenders. It will be possible to combine the probation order with other disposals, including the fine. The courts will be able to impose a combined probation and community service order in cases where this seems the most suitable punishment. We think this may be particularly suitable for a number of persistent property offenders. Your Lordships will not be surprised to learn that we intend to go ahead with the curfew order to be enforced by electronic monitoring. The pilot projects carried out in three areas demonstrated that electronic monitoring was technically viable.<lb/>
Custody will remain the ultimate sanction for serious offences. Crimes of sex and violence will attract longer sentences within the statutory maxi-mum than the seriousness of the offences themselves might suggest if this is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. But the courts should not be sending to prison those relatively minor offenders whose crimes do not justify a prison sentence. In line with the White Paper's proposals the courts will have to be satisfied that the seriousness of the offence justifies a custodial sentence. They will have to consider a pre-sentence report before passing a custodial sentence for all except the most serious offence. These reports, which will be prepared by the probation service, will provide information on a community penalty that could be provided for the offender if the court so decided. If the courts do sentence offenders to custody in these cases we think that they should also give their reasons for doing so. The purpose of these restrictions is not to fetter the courts' sentencing discretion but to provide a clearer focus on the seriousness of the offence and to provide the courts with better information about the best way to deal with the offender.<lb/>
The Bill will also reform the parole system. It will implement the proposals in Chapter 6 of the White Paper, which itself followed many of the recommenda-tions of the committee under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. The changes that we intend to bring forward will give more meaning to the sentence passed by the courts. At present, many prisoners are eligible for release on parole after serving only one-third of their sentence. In future, all prisoners will serve at least half the sentence and some will serve more than half. All prisoners serving a year or more will be supervised on release in accordance with national standards aimed at protecting the public, preventing reoffending and reintegrating the offender into the community. In effect, offenders will be under sentence for the whole of the sentence passed by the courts, although part of the sentence towards the end will be served in the community. Those who do reoffend before the
<col>22</col>
original sentence has expired will be liable to be returned to prison to serve out the rest of their sentence.<lb/>
The Bill, and the White Paper on which it is based, mark the culmination of a long process of discussion and consultation. It is intended to mark a very significant and constructive development in the way the criminal justice system deals with offenders. I am sure that your Lordships will subject it to close and detailed scrutiny when it reaches this House.<lb/>
I mentioned earlier that the Government intend to bring forward proposals in furtherance of their support for the family. These proposals will focus on parental responsibilities and in particular on improving the quality of life of children who are separated from either of their natural parents.<lb/>
Your Lordships will recall that on 29th October I made a Statement, and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Security made a corresponding Statement in another place, announcing the publication of our White Paper, <i>Children Come First,</i> produced jointly by us and by my noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Your Lordships will know that we are embarked on a wide-ranging review of all aspects of family law. The guiding principles of that review are the rights of the child and the responsibility of the parents. Our proposals on child maintenance are wholly consistent with those priorities. They rest on the principle that every child has the right to care from his or her parents even if the parents' own relationship has broken down. That is why we propose a new system to make the assessing, collecting and enforcing of maintenance payments more consistent, more accessible and more speedy.<lb/>
The Child Maintenance Bill will make legislative provision for the key features of the new system. It will clearly establish that parents are liable to maintain their children. It will provide for child maintenance to be assessed by a simple and consistent formula. The formula will be based on the income support rates for the children being maintained. It will take account of both parents' circumstances and it will allow both parents a portion of their net income to meet essential expenses.<lb/>
This formula will lend itself to being operated in a straightforward administrative way. We intend that it should be used in Department of Social Security offices and the courts from the first half of 1992. From the first half of 1993 a new Child Support Agency will be in operation as a Next Steps agency of the Department of Social Security. The agency will be responsible for the assessment, collection and enforcement of maintenance. The Child Maintenance Bill will ensure that it has the required powers. Among these will be the powers to make and estimate assessments; to obtain and verify the information needed to do so; to determine appropriate methods of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0051"/>
<col>23</col>
payment; and to take enforcement action if necessary. It will also he necessary to provide appropriate ways of resolving disputes about any part of the process.<lb/>
In addition to the Child Maintenance Bill the Government will be taking other action in the short term to strengthen the powers of the courts to ensure that maintenance which is ordered is in fact paid and received. Many maintenance debtors act responsibly but unfortunately there are too many cases in which default occurs or in which payments are made only irregularly so that arrears build up. This can cause serious problems and anxieties for people entitled to maintenance and may require them in some cases to become dependent on benefit support. The present law contains loopholes which irresponsible maintenance debtors can and do exploit. The Maintenance Enforcement Bill to be introduced in your Lordships' House seeks to block these loopholes.<lb/>
The Bill will improve the existing system of collection and enforcement of maintenance for spouses as well as children by giving the High Court, county courts and the magistrates' courts the power to prescribe the method of payment and to attach earnings when making, varying or enforcing a maintenance order. The strategy is accordingly to enable the courts to anticipate and prevent default rather than as now having to wait for default to occur before having the power to act. The Bill is modest in scope but I hope your Lordships will agree that it will provide practical help to many people for whom difficulty in obtaining the maintenance due to them is an added financial and emotional burden which they should be spared. I commend these proposals to the House, confident that, most important of all, they will serve to advance the welfare of children.<lb/>
The next measure that I shall mention reflects both the Government's support for the family in its widest sense and their concern to improve the quality of life for those who are disabled. The Government will tomorrow present in another place the Disability Allowance and Disability Employment Credit Bill. The measures that this Bill contains take forward the final and most important stage of the reforms announced in January this year in the White Paper, <i>The Way Ahead: Benefits for Disabled People.</i> It provides for the introduction of two new benefits for people with disabilities. The first&#x2014;that is, the disability allowance&#x2014;will provide help with the extra costs of disability for people of working age and under. It will incorporate in a single benefit the existing benefits attendance allowance and mobility allowance while extending the scope of the new benefit to nearly 300,000 disabled people who previously were unable to qualify. In so doing it will also extend access to the disablement premium in the income-related benefits.<lb/>
As part of the strategy to create a simpler benefit for which only a single claim needs to be made there will be a three-month qualifying period for receipt of either component. Like attendance allowance, disability allowance will be available immediately to terminally ill claimants without need to serve any
<col>24</col>
qualifying period. For those whose disability starts before the age of 65 there will be no upper limit for receiving the benefit. Attendance allowance will continue to be available to those who become disabled after that age and it will be subject to the same new adjudication process as disability allowance.<lb/>
At the same time the Bill proposes a new system of assessment and adjudication. There will be a much greater reliance on claimants' assessments of their own incapacity and consequently a move away from a strictly medical viewpoint. The new adjudication system will give the right of appeal to an independent tribunal&#x2014;the newly constituted Disability Appeal Tribunal&#x2014;one member of which will ideally be a person with experience of the needs of disabled people.<lb/>
As a result of disability allowance, spending on disabled people will increase by an estimated &#x00A3;230 million of which nearly one-third will go to the least well off through extended entitlement to the disablement premium in the income-related benefits. The new lowest rates will bring new help to some 140,000 disabled people with care needs and to some 150,000 with mobility problems.<lb/>
The second new benefit, disability employment credit, will address, for the first time in social security, the needs of disabled people who are able to work but whose disability restricts their earning power. Those people who wish to become self sufficient through work will be given a means of doing so, while ensuring that their income exceeded what they would have received if they were not in work.<lb/>
It will operate in a broadly similar way to family credit: earnings would be topped up to a level appropriate to the claimant's circumstances. Unlike family credit it will be available to childless claimants as well as to those with families. Again, the emphasis will be on self assessment: claimants will need to satisfy an adjudication officer that their disability handicaps them as regards employment. And there will be protection for those whose experiment with work was unsuccessful: provided they were still sick, they would be able to return to long-term incapacity benefits without need for a qualifying period any time up to two years after ceasing to claim that benefit.<lb/>
The Bill will provide disability employment credit claimants with the same rights of appeal as disability allowance claimants, including the right of appeal to an independent tribunal. It will target some &#x00A3;80 million on an estimated 50,000 disabled people.<lb/>
The Government plan to continue their efforts to improve quality in education. A Bill will be introduced:
<quote>"to establish new machinery for negotiating the pay and conditions of school teachers in England and Wales."</quote>
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science, in a Statement in another place on 23rd July 1990 announced (at cols. 24&#x2013;37 of Commons Hansard) the Government's decisions about future machinery for determining the pay and conditions of school teachers.<lb/>
Since 1987, when the old Burnham Committee arrangements broke down, the pay of school teachers
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0052"/>
<col>25</col>
has been determined by the Government in response to recommendations by an interim advisory commit-tee. The committee has done an excellent job, but it was always recognised as a temporary arrangement.<lb/>
The new School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Bill will re-establish free national negotiations between teachers and their employers under an independent chairman. There will be a time limit for the negotiators to reach agreement, failing which the Government would seek recommendations instead from an independent advisory committee broadly similar to the present IAC. This would not be arbitration: the Government will set the advisory committee a clear and specific remit. If the negotiations reached agreement within the time limit, the Government would hope normally to be able to accept their recommendations. But they would have the power to refer aspects of negotiated agreements back to the negotiators and, in the event of continuing disagreement, to substitute their own provisions on matters referred back.<lb/>
The Bill will also provide for local education authorities and grant-maintained schools to apply to the Secretary of State to opt out of the national provisions governing pay and conditions where they judged they could by so doing respond better to local needs and circumstances. These arrangements will offer full and fair opportunities for negotiations between teachers and their employers, coupled with a means of resolving deadlock. They will acknowledge the interests of teachers, employers and the Government in the determination of teachers' pay.<lb/>
The gracious Speech reaffirmed the Government's resolve to defeat terrorism in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill, which re-enacts, with amendment, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts 1978 and 1987, has been published today. The existing Acts, which are due to expire in May 1992, were reviewed earlier this year by my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross. On the basis of his report, which provided a valuable analysis of the issues and took account of a wide range of opinion, the Government have now brought forward this amending Bill.<lb/>
The Bill seeks to re-enact the main extra powers of the police and Army to deal with terrorism in Northern Ireland, the special arrangements for the trial of terrorist-type offences, and the category of offences against public safety and public order. It also seeks to re-enact the statutory rights of terrorist suspects in police custody; creates a new offence of "possession of items intended for terrorist purposes"; a new power to allow the police and armed forces to examine documents and other materials for information likely to be useful for acts of terrorism; new offences relating to the bypassing of closed border crossing points, and an enabling power to create statutory codes of practice relating to the exercise by the police and armed forces of their powers under the emergency legislation. The Bill also retains the provisions relating to the executive detention of terrorists.<lb/>
<col>26</col>
With the publication of the Bill the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has issued a statement of the Government's security policy in Northern Ireland. The statement does not signal any change in Government policy, but is intended to set out the general principles within which the Bill is introduced. Copies of the statement have been placed in the Library of the House.<lb/>
I now turn to two short Bills; first, the Census (Confidentiality) Bill, introduced in this House today. This will close a gap in the protection afforded by the Census Act 1920 to personal information collected in, or in connection with, censuses of population. It is designed both to extend the protection to census information once the census has been taken and to protect the confidentiality of certain census-related information. Previously, this information has had the blanket protection of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, now repealed. The census-related information with which we are concerned is information given voluntarily in census tests and in surveys following a census which are associated with census data.<lb/>
The second of the short Bills to which I wish to refer is a Bill in which I have considerable interest. The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Bill to be introduced in your Lordships' House will enable the United Kingdom to ratify the 1988 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, which we signed last year. The parties to the convention are the member states of the European Community and those of the European Free Trade Association.<lb/>
The object of the convention is to make it easier to enforce the judgments given by the courts of each contracting state in the other contracting states. It is based very closely on the 1968 Brussels Convention, which was made solely between EC member states, and to which we gave effect by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. If ratified, the Lugano Convention will operate with the Brussels Convention to create a virtually uniform system of civil jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments throughout Western Europe.<lb/>
Finally, the War Crimes Bill will be introduced in identical terms to the Bill which was refused a Second Reading in your Lordships' House last Session. It will give British courts jursidiction over offences of murder, and manslaughter or culpable homicide, committed as war crimes in Germany or German-occupied territory during the period of the Second World War by persons who are now British citizens or resident in the United Kingdom. The Bill will provide also a procedure in England and Wales for the transfer of war crimes trials to the Crown Court without committal proceedings. In re-introducing the Bill, we shall be seeking to secure the support for it of both Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have observed that a considerable amount of legislation will be brought before the House for discussion and comment although, as was noted yesterday, the burden may not be so great as in previous Sessions. I look forward to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0053"/>
<col>27</col>
the usual level of informed debate which characterises this House and my colleagues and I shall be most interested in what your Lordships have to say on the Government's programme. I particularly look forward to the contributions today of our three maiden speakers.<lb/>
For my part, I believe that we have an exciting programme carrying forward policies which will create very important benefits for our people and I feel it therefore a privilege to have the opportunity of describing it to your Lordships, so far as it relates to the subjects we are today considering.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02757">3.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02758"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I had the pleasure a year or so ago of speaking following the noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack, I said to him that he had immediately earned the respect of the whole House. A year later I add&#x2014;I know I speak also for your Lordships&#x2014;that he has earned the very deep regard of the House. I ask only one favour of him, and again I do it on behalf of the whole House&#x2014;that is, please do not resign&#x0021;
It is over the days of the debate on the Address that we in this House consider the state of the nation. We cover wide subjects affecting every part of our national life. In a speech concerning home and social affairs it is difficult to concentrate on more than one or two subjects. Therefore I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I deal only with law and order and our prison system, and my noble friend Lord Carter, apart from other matters of social interest, will deal with education and the measures regarding child maintenance to which the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor referred.<lb/>
I often wonder whether, in order to establish the fundamental principle of the constitutional neutrality of the Sovereign, it would be a good idea at the end or just after one dealt with that all-embracing phrase, "such other matters or measures as may be introduced in the coming Session", if Her Majesty added "and after this Speech my loyal Opposition has the following comments to make". At least it would add pertinent and picturesque language to the gracious Speech. Regarding the aspects of law and order and prisons, I am attempting to make observations that Her Majesty's loyal Opposition wish to make.<lb/>
It is a fact that the White Paper, <i>Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public,</i> to which the noble and learned Lord referred, contains many items with which all of us, certainly on these Benches, agree. In so far as the new Criminal Justice Bill which is to be brought before us follows the lines of that White Paper, we on these Benches will certainly be giving it at the very least qualified support; and I hope we shall be bringing before the House constructive amendments.<lb/>
There are many useful items in the White Paper. The noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack referred to them. It considers the question of making statutory requirements before a custodial sentence is given; the matter of ensuring that proper social reports are in front of the sentencing judge or are
<col>28</col>
available before a custodial sentence is awarded. They are important and vital measures and we shall support them. Unfortunately, in regard to law and order generally, we must deal with matters of grave concern to the whole of the nation.<lb/>
In the gracious Speech last year the following words occurred:
<quote>"My Government will vigorously pursue their policies for reducing crime".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 21/11/89; col. 3.]</quote>
Noble Lords may have noticed that there is a verbal variation in the gracious Speech this year. It reads:
<quote>"My Government will vigorously pursue their policies in fighting crime".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7/11/90; col. 3.]</quote>
The reason for the difference is all too apparent. The promise of last year that crime in this nation of ours would be reduced has unfortunately by no means been fulfilled. Crime has not been reduced; it has been increased.<lb/>
I read to your Lordships from the <i>Home Office Statistical Bulletin,</i> which tells this story:
<quote>"In the second quarter of 1990 the police recorded 1,113,000 offences, 17 per cent. more than in the second quarter of 1989&#x2026; In view of the considerable variations to which quarterly figures are subject, a more stable basis on which to assess changes is provided by comparisons of figures for the two most recent twelve month periods. In the twelve months to the end of June 1990, 4.2 million offences were recorded; this was 466,000 or 13 per cent. more than in the previous twelve months. The annual average increase between 1980 and 1989 was 5 per cent."</quote>
There is concern in the nation, and rightly so. I shall try very humbly to point to a few of the issues which the House should be considering most seriously in its wonderment as to the cause for that increase in recorded crime. The figures are the worst in our history.<lb/>
I wonder whether noble Lords will agree that one cause&#x2014;I cannot mention all of them; I cannot even analyse all of them although I have tried to do so&#x2014;is the loss of the sense of community that we once had. I wonder whether noble Lords would also agree that we, as a nation, have lost some of our sense of values.<lb/>
Much of our youth and many of our ethnic minorities believe that our current social system is not a just one. Many people think that the number of those who have, and immensely have, without having made a commensurate contribution to our national well-being, are too many; and that the number of those who have not, and so substantially have not and are living in poverty, are also too many. That division in our society, which is so stark, builds a belief that our social structure is not a just one.<lb/>
I turn now to the second issue: crime and criminals &#x2014;why the increase? I say at once that our prisons create contempt for authority by their inmates. That is a very serious comment to make. I say as well&#x2014;but here I know I have some support from government sources&#x2014;that our prisons are a university for crime. Those are the words used by the right honourable gentleman the Home Secretary only a few weeks ago. I agree with him.<lb/>
The recidivist rate speaks for itself. So many of those who leave prison return all too soon. It is not
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0054"/>
<col>29</col>
difficult to see the reason why. As recently as 6th November, this week, <i>The Times</i> newspaper, under the heading,
<quote>"'Scandalous' jail unfit for under-21s",</quote>
reported on what Judge Tumim, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, found when he and his other inspectors visited Armley gaol in Leeds. In sheer conscience, this House must consider the following words with all the seriousness that they deserve if we wish to regard ourselves, as all of us do, as proud members of a civilised nation. I quote:
<quote>"A team of inspectors visited Armley in December last year after a spate of suicides and self-mutilations in the infamous B wing, which houses prisoners aged under 21. The team was appalled by what it found, though it recognised the dedication staff displayed in attempting to supervise humanely 1,170 prisoners in a jail built to house only 640. There has been no easing of overcrowding since then.</quote>
<quote>The report concludes that conditions are wholly unacceptable for all prisoners at Armley, but says that regimes for young remand inmates, maximum security prisoners and offenders segregated for their own protection are even worse. While all prisoners stayed too long in their cells, category A prisoners were barred completely from the gym and education classes and young remand inmates were allowed 'association', a period to relax out of their cells with fellow inmates, for only two hours every third day. Only one cell at Armley has a toilet.</quote>
<quote>The inspectorate was so alarmed by the regime on B wing, the subject of repeated criticism by penal reformers, that it considered the only long-term solution was for the Home Office to abolish custodial remands to Armley for offenders aged under 21".</quote>
Behind that miserable, wretched, dishonouring report is the toll of six suicides by teenagers over the past two years in Armley gaol.<lb/>
If one leaves this purely and simply at Armley gaol one is unfortunately doing an injustice to the rest of our prison service. NACRO&#x2014;that well worthwhile organisation that looks after offenders&#x2014;pointed out in a report made only in September last that over 13,000 prisoners in England and Wales are held two or three to a cell built for one; that on present trends 7,000 prisoners will still be slopping out at the end of the century; that a full day's work or education,
<quote>"is available to only a minority of prisoners";</quote>
and that in many prisons remand prisoners are not kept separate from convicted prisoners.<lb/>
NACRO goes on to point out, to our national shame, that many countries such as Austria, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands have incorporated the European Prison Rules in their domestic law. Prisoners can therefore rely on them in support of a complaint. However, and I quote:
<quote>"this country has neither incorporated the European Prison Rules in its legislation nor enacted its own minimum standards".</quote>
I go on to say this. Remand prisoners, most of whom are not in fact given custodial sentences and many of whom are acquitted, form about one-in-five of the present inmates in our prisons and are suffering these conditions. In quoting the Home Secretary I referred to a "university for crime". What else can one expect but contempt for the establishment and contempt for our society that allows such conditions
<col>30</col>
to exist? Is it a wonder that the recidivist rate is as high as it is? What is done in order to try to rehabilitate? Your Lordships will be shattered to learn, as I am telling your Lordships now on authority, that very little training and education are taking place in our prisons; that very little rehabilitation work is done when the inmates leave prison; and that there is very, very little chance of employment being obtained.<lb/>
One aspect of legislation that we must consider is to bring up to date the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act and also to ensure that our probationary service is enlarged and strengthened so that it can do a really good job of rehabilitation and guidance.<lb/>
I wonder whether we cannot, all of us, regardless of party, decide that in our national honour further legislation must be passed as soon as possible. There is nothing in the gracious Speech. If the present Government cannot do it, I promise that a Labour government will do so. We must have a statutory code of minimum standards for our prisons. We must have an end to the absurdity of Crown immunity in regard to our prisons and the conditions that exist in them. We must have a prison ombudsman to see that complaints are dealt with by an independent authority. We must endeavour to deal with all these matters not in order to satisfy ourselves that we have been just&#x2014;that is obviously a principle that guides every one of us&#x2014;but to ensure that our social fabric is not undermined.<lb/>
We must do that because of our national honour. We on these Benches say this to the Government: we would be anxious to co-operate if the present Government will do what I have sought humbly to suggest they should do in order to rid ourselves of this blot on our name and reputation. I repeat, if the Government do not do that, we will.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02759">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02760"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor when he says how much we are looking forward to hearing the maiden speakers this afternoon. I propose to deal primarily with questions involving the administration of justice. My noble friend Lord Russell will deal with the other matters which are the subject of today's debate.<lb/>
Both the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, have referred to the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill. On many of the issues covered in that Bill, and here I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, we are at one with the Government in their central objective of finding sensible and meaningful alternatives to custody. We share their approach entirely. No doubt there will be some matters on which differences will emerge. I hope however that there will be a reasonable degree of bipartisanship. If so I welcome it. Nothing is more foolish than to attempt to create bogus differences between government and opposition parties on criminal justice issues. To suggest, as is unfortunately sometimes the case, that one party rather than another can be trusted to protect the public from the ravages of criminals is absurd. No one
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0055"/>
<col>31</col>
can even agree as to what causes people to turn to crime or why crime rises in one particular year, as is happening at the moment, and falls in another.<lb/>
The influence of politicians in these matters is clearly negligible. Even though this may be the last gracious Speech before a general election, I hope that we shall do our best&#x2014;I am sure that this House will &#x2014;to limit rather than to widen our differences. But that imposes on the Government an obligation to listen seriously to constructive criticism of their proposals when the Bill reaches this House and to amend them when a reasonable case is made out. Unhappily, that has not always been the approach in the past: I hope very much that it will be on this occasion.<lb/>
I propose to deal with three matters, all involving the administration of justice: first, the quality of the service that we are providing in our criminal justice system; secondly, the question of industrial relations in the prisons; and, thirdly, the Colin Wallace affair. As to the quality of the service provided in our criminal justice system, the Government will tell us that they have carried through a major prison building programme and that they have substantially increased the size of the police force. Both claims are entirely justified although the rise in police numbers has hardly kept pace with the increase in the level of serious crime. There is serious public concern about the level of sophisticated crime in the City of London. The Guinness case is but one example. Despite warnings by the commissioner, the size of the Metropolitan Police fraud squad is almost precisely the same as it was 10 years ago. If we do not make adequate resources available to investigate disreputable beha-viour in the City and elsewhere and bring to justice those responsible, serious damage will be done both to the reputation of our country and to the City as a major international centre of financial operations.<lb/>
In many other parts of the criminal justice system there is also a serious lack of resources. I take as one example the last annual report of the Crown Prosecution Service. It referred yet again to its acute problem of securing an adequate number of lawyers. It acknowledges that,
<quote>"the difficulties we have experienced in recruitment have inevitably led to a far more extensive use of agents than we would wish".</quote>
The CPS admitted that some had not provided an adequate service. I do not believe that this is good enough. The Government set up the service with all-party support. From its inception it has not been given an adequate budget to carry through its responsibilities. In turn that has led to severe criticism from the police who in many parts of the country have found the efficiency of the CPS far from satisfactory.<lb/>
I could list other serious inadequacies of the criminal justice system; for instance, the problems in the forensic science service and the serious fraud office. Another problem is the shortage of justices' clerks. That body is still 107 members below its establishment. There is the scandal of the mentally ill being sucked in to the prison system. The House will recall
<col>32</col>
debates in which I believe the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, joined, as did many other noble Lords, on the cases of half-a-dozen sad, confused and sick men who found themselves in prison and in police cells because of the failure to secure treatment for them in mental hospitals. They were the victims of what is described by Ministers as care in the community. If ever there was a cruel hoax it is this. Care in the community, as we know it at the moment, is little more than a clever phrase devised by a public relations officer. Only a few days ago the House of Commons Social Services Committee criticised the Government for not even producing detailed calculations of the cost of implementing their own plans. The committee stated that there was still no guarantee that money said to be available will be spent on the mentally ill and mentally handicapped. Without that, and a commitment by the Department of Health to accept its responsibilities, the prisons will remain filled with hundreds of the mentally ill. That is a deplorable situation.<lb/>
I turn now to the question of industrial relations in a number of our prisons. This is a matter of the highest importance. Eleven years ago Mr. Justice May, as he then was, said in his report which was published just after the election of the present Government:
<quote>"In the last few years"&#x2014;</quote>
He is referring to the period of office of the previous Labour government&#x2014;
<quote>"industrial action has occurred of a type, and on a scale, never previously witnessed".</quote>
Sir John May outlined the reasons. In particular he drew attention to the decision of the national executive committee of the Prison Officers' Association that "forms of action to be pursued on local issues (including sympathetic action) are matters within the discretion of the local branches concerned." Armed with this new power a number of branches of the POA, but by no means all, began to engage in forms of industrial action not previously experienced. Since the publication of the May Report the situation has become even more difficult.<lb/>
We have now reached a situation in which industrial relations in our prisons are worse than those in any other part of the public or the private sector. We have a situation where some&#x2014;I repeat, some&#x2014;prison officers regularly turn away police vans bringing in inmates. So far this year 43 prison department establishments from Aylesbury and Bedford to Wormwood Scrubs and Wymott have either threatened to refuse or refused to admit prisoners. In other words, that has happened in this year alone in one out of every three prison establishments in this country. I draw this information from a reply given to me by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, last week. However, what has happened as a result?<lb/>
Since the publication of the May Report we have seen the establishment of an alternative prison system run by the police in which remand prisoners, who by definition have not been convicted of any criminal offence, are kept for weeks on end in tiny cramped cells designed to keep a prisoner for a few hours before
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0056"/>
<col>33</col>
an appearance in court. On 30th October this year 1,060 prisoners were being kept in such conditions by 24 separate police forces in England and Wales. The result has been shameful conditions experienced by many of these prisoners, including, as I have indicated, some of the mentally ill, with hundreds of police officers taken off the streets to act as gaolers.<lb/>
The cost of this exercise is quite extraordinary. The cost of keeping one remand prisoner in a cell in the Metropolitan Police district is &#x00A3;305 a night; that is, precisely 50 per cent. more than a double room at the Ritz Hotel. When Ministers talk about obtaining value for money, no doubt they will be eager to explain to us how they reconcile that objective with that result.<lb/>
Following the Strangeways disturbances, we have witnessed the surprising spectacle of some branches &#x2014;again I stress, some&#x2014;of the POA refusing to take named prisoners into their prisons. It is a blackballing system which I believe is known in some London clubs but so far as I am aware it has not previously been seen in the public service. We have also seen the refusal of some branches of the POA to allow some inmates to be produced in court. I could continue with other examples.<lb/>
In my view we deserve an answer to the following question: what do the Government propose to do about the situation? I find it hard to believe that they want to be seen as almost passive spectators. It is right to say that last year Mr. Hurd decided to meet the problem head on. It was an act of considerable courage on his part. Many of us will recall that as a result the Metropolitan Police had to take over the running of Wandsworth Prison. In my view that action was entirely right. The militants were seen to be defeated and for a few months, as governors have told me, industrial relations improved significantly.<lb/>
However, unhappily, since the events at Strangeways, it is said that the situation has deteriorated once again. Of course every reasonable effort must be made to settle disputes between management and the POA. I would not for a moment want to suggest that error was exclusively the responsibility of the POA; of course that is not so. Nevertheless, so far this year&#x2014;again, I draw this information from a reply given to me by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, last week&#x2014;we have had industrial disputes in 70 of our prisons.<lb/>
All I have to say to the Government about the situation is that I believe it is essential for management in the prisons to be supported. If there are regular incidents of the kind I have described where people are refusing to carry out instructions given to them by their governors, they should be sent home. It is clear that anarchic behaviour&#x2014;and that is what it is&#x2014;must be stopped. If we do not put a stop to such conduct, the only people who will suffer are the remand prisoners who, as I have already pointed out, have not been convicted of a criminal offence.<lb/>
In addition, if we have incidents where members of the POA are refusing to produce prisoners in court &#x2014;that was one of the findings of the May Report and
<col>34</col>
there have been episodes since that time along the same lines&#x2014;the Government should now accept the recommendation in Sir John May's report (as they should have done 10 years ago) and state that governors should cease to be exclusively responsible for a prisoner's production in court and that warrants should be addressed to each and every member of the staff. That would require legislation. In that way it would be clear that the refusal of members of staff to allow inmates to be produced in court would constitute a contempt of court. I am especially glad to see that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, with his responsibilities for the judiciary, is present in the Chamber. I very much hope that he will take an interest in the matter.<lb/>
I understand, as I believe we all do, why Ministers in different governments have in the past declined to tackle the problem vigorously. It is because of their anxiety&#x2014;and this is the reality of the matter&#x2014;about the political consequences of firm action. No one in ministerial office wants to read the headline, "Prisons in Chaos". Nevertheless, continued timidity will further damage the service and some of the most vulnerable prisoners within the system.<lb/>
I turn now to deal with the third and final issue that I wish to raise. I refer to the case of Mr. Colin Wallace. When he first made his allegations relating to an exercise known as Clockwork Orange, and the Kincora boys' home affair, and suggested that he had been removed from the public service because he had insisted on raising issues which his superiors would have preferred him not to raise, I was extremely sceptical. I did not, and still do not, believe in conspiracy theories. The fact that Mr. Wallace was supported in his claims by some of the leading conspiracy theorists made me even more doubtful about his allegations. However, I fear that I was probably mistaken.<lb/>
Ever since the publication by the Ministry of Defence of its report entitled, <i>Into how papers were overlooked in the case of Mr. Colin Wallace&#x2014;a</i> document published to explain the inaccurate answers given in the House of Commons by Ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the affair&#x2014;I have become, as I am sure have others, increasingly uneasy about the matter. We now know from what we have been told that there was indeed a Clockwork Orange project, although it is said that it was not approved, and that&#x2014;although previously denied&#x2014;Mr. Wallace was involved in disinformation activities, as they are described, which required him to make on the spot decisions on matters of national security.<lb/>
We also know from the report of Mr. David Calcutt, QC into the circumstances of Mr. Wallace's dismissal that shortly before he appeared before the Civil Service Appeal Board ministry officials were, as described by Mr. Calcutt, in private communication with its chairman. Mr. Calcutt said that this approach affected the outcome of the appeal. He added that the secret tasks allocated to Mr. Wallace were not disclosed to the board.<lb/>
All that I should like to ask the Minister about this shabby affair is: first, who were the officials who made
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0057"/>
<col>35</col>
that secret and grossly improper approach to the chairman of the Civil Service Appeal Board? Who gave them their instructions? They were, in reality, involved in jury nobbling, a practice indulged in by a number of professional criminals at the Old Bailey but, hitherto, I am glad to say, unknown in the public service. Let us have no further nonsense about so-called national security on this matter. We are entitled to know whether any Ministers were aware of that approach and when they were informed of the whole circumstances of the case.<lb/>
In view of the level of deceit practised by some of those involved, Ministers should recognise that some of us now entertain considerable suspicion about what went on at the Kincora boys' home. I am of course aware of Sir George Terry's report in 1983. I have a high regard for Sir George, but one is now bound to ask whether those concerned disclosed the truth to him.<lb/>
I find it deeply distasteful to imagine that any servants of the British state were aware that small boys were being sexually abused at Kincora boys' home and took no action. No one can be satisfied to leave the Wallace affair where it is. It is clear that a further inquiry is now required by a member of the judiciary assisted by a team of police officers. Without such an inquiry, our country's reputation and that of the public service will be seriously jeopardised.<lb/>
The three issues that I have raised this afternoon all involve, in one form or another, the administration of justice. All deserve urgent attention. There is the case of Mr. Wallace to which I have just referred; the lamentable industrial relations situation in the prisons, which has significant implications for our courts; and, finally, the serious shortage of resources in parts of our criminal justice system. Yet the gracious Speech tells us that its central purpose is to keep the public expenditure share of national income on a downward trend, using, in fact, precisely the same language as was in the gracious Speech of 1988, although not on this occasion, and perhaps significantly, adding the words:
<quote>"thus providing scope for further reductions in taxation".</quote>
The Government say that despite the evidence of the consequences of that policy: the serious damage, to which I have referred, to parts of the criminal justice system; the closure of wards in many NHS hospitals, including a further 4,500 beds which are to be lost, according to a report published only this week; the deterioration of our public transport system and the disgraceful conditions in many of our schools. If that process continues, we shall have by far the worst public services of any major member state in the European Community. It is time that this country made a change of direction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Autumn Statement</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02761">4.24 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02762"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Hesketh)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement being made
<col>36</col>
in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Statement is as follows:
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a Statement.<lb/>
"Cabinet agreed the Government's expenditure plans this morning. I am therefore now able to inform the House of the public expenditure outturn for this year; the plans for the next three years; our proposals for national insurance contributions in 1991&#x2013;92; and the forecast of economic prospects for 1991 required by the 1975 Industry Act.<lb/>
"As usual, the main public expenditure figures, with the full text of the economic forecast, will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I sit down. The printed Autumn Statement will be published next Tuesday.<lb/>
"In this survey we have had to take some tough decisions in the interests of the economy and the new plans represent a very tight settlement. But it is a settlement which is fully consistent with the Government's commitments and channels extra resources to the areas where the need is greatest. For this, and other reasons, I would like to pay tribute to my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary for the skill and persistence with which he has brought the survey to a successful conclusion.<lb/>
"Since 1984&#x2013;85, while the economy has grown by nearly 20 per cent., total public spending has risen scarcely at all in real terms. As a result, the ratio of public spending to national income has fallen by more than 7 percentage points, the largest sustained fall for over 40 years. Moreover, in the past three years large budget surpluses have enabled us to repay debt totalling &#x00A3;26 billion.<lb/>
"The main objective of economic policy at present must be to bring inflation down. But as we do so, the short-term prospect is bound to be one of weak activity. In the past, during similar periods the ratio of public spending to national income has risen strongly. On this occasion it will not.<lb/>
"Planned public expenditure in the current fiscal year is now expected to be &#x00A3;180.6 billion, rather less than 1 per cent. above the planning total set a year ago. A large part of this extra spending is due to an increase in the financing requirements of the nationalised industries; to a surge of CAP spending on agricultural market support; and to expenditure on the Gulf crisis.<lb/>
"Notwithstanding this cash overrun, public expenditure remains under tight control. Inflation has been higher than forecast but it has not been allowed to feed through fully into expenditure. As a result, the ratio of spending to national income in the current year is likely to be slightly lower than projected at the time of the Budget&#x2014;virtually unchanged from the 1989&#x2013;90 level.<lb/>
"The decisions on public expenditure for the next three years have been taken against a more difficult world and domestic economic background than for some time. Activity at home and abroad has begun to weaken and some countries such as
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0058"/>
<col>37</col>
Canada and the US are expected to grow very slowly indeed over the coming year. The outlook has also been complicated by events in the Gulf with the rise in oil prices and the uncertainty they have produced. Against that background our new plans are designed to protect the most vulnerable groups in society against the effects of higher inflation and to maintain longer-term policies to improve the working of the economy.<lb/>
"But, beyond that, this is not the year for making substantial additions to plans in other areas. The priority must be to honour existing commitments, within a total for public spending which is affordable and fiscally prudent.<lb/>
"For 1991&#x2013;92, the new planning total has been set at &#x00A3;200 billion, a little under &#x00A3;8 billion more than the previously published figure. The planning totals in the following two years are &#x00A3;215 billion and E226 billion respectively.<lb/>
"In recognition of the economic uncertainties and the risks arising from the Gulf crisis, these totals include higher reserves than last year's plans: &#x00A3;31 billion in the first year; &#x00A3;7 billion in the second year: and &#x00A3;101 billion in the third. I think these increases are prudent. Our plans also incorporate an estimate of privatisation proceeds at &#x00A3;51 billion a year. That is in line with the average outturn in recent years.<lb/>
"After taking account of inflation, the level of spending next year will be rather less than implied by last year's plans; that is, the cash additions to the planning total do not fully compensate for the higher level of prices now expected for 1991&#x2013;92. This restraint is necessary but it means that many of my colleagues have had to drop or postpone proposals they would otherwise have regarded as desirable.<lb/>
"Nevertheless, within this total there are substantial extra resources in three main areas: health, social security and central government support for local authority services. These additions to plans total some &#x00A3;7&#x00BD; billion in 1991&#x2013;92. It has also been possible to make improvements to other key areas including education, public transport, and the environment.<lb/>
"We have also been able to make savings elsewhere, including defence. I can assure the House categorically that financial constraints will not hinder in any way the UK's military contribution to resolving the Gulf crisis. However, the options for change announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 25th July will produce increasing savings in the defence budget. Over the next three years the new plans provide for a real reduction in defence spending of about 6 per cent. and further reductions should be achieved in later years as my right honourable friend's proposals are fully implemented. For the first time in the period since World War II we are now able safely to plan on a
<col>38</col>
defence budget that is significantly less than one-tenth of all government expenditure and falling.<lb/>
"In certain other areas we have been able to accommodate increases in expenditure by finding offsetting savings. For example, on the trade and industry and employment programmes we have made selective increases while keeping broadly to existing cash plans overall. Within the Home Office programme, lower prison population forecasts have enabled us to reduce the prison building programme, while considerable resources have been made available for the refurbishment of existing prisons, including Strangeways.<lb/>
"In July the Government announced extra support for local authority current spending which will add around &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; billion to previous plans.<lb/>
"Current spending by local authorities has substantially outstripped central government spending over recent years. This year local authorities in England budgeted for increases of over 5 per cent. in real terms before capping. This has led to community charges which in many authorities are far higher than expected, or justified.<lb/>
"The additional support we are providing for next year should enable local authorities to finance local services without sharp increases in their charges. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has already announced that if required the Government will make vigorous use of their powers to cap high spending authorities. I re-emphasise that.<lb/>
"Nearly &#x00A3;3 billion has been added to the social security plans for next year. This mainly reflects the upratings already announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Security which maintain in full the real value of benefits paid to 10 million pensioners and 11 million people on income-related benefits. The additions also reflect the substantial extra cost of community charge benefit which will help about one in four charge payers. My right honourable friend was also able to announce selective improvements for poorer pensioners, people in residential and nursing homes and families. These improvements will be financed within the social security programme by savings from restructuring the statutory sick pay scheme, as announced by my right honourable friend on 24th October.<lb/>
"As in previous years, the Government have also made very substantial extra provision for health. Between this year and next, spending on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom will rise by &#x00A3;3 billion, so that the real resources over and above inflation that are available for spending on health will increase by over 5 per cent. The total real increase in health service spending since 1979 will be nearly 50 per cent. This has enabled the NHS to employ some 8,000 more hospital doctors and dentists and over 50,000 more nurses and of course to provide for more sophisticated health care than ever before. As a result, over 1&#x00BC; million
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0059"/>
<col>39</col>
more in-patient and day cases are now treated every year. In the largest sustained programme of hospital building ever seen, nearly 500 major capital schemes have been completed since 1979. Our plans ensure that the next three years will see further improvements in services.<lb/>
"Extra finance is also being provided for public transport. Both London Transport and British Rail have large long-term investment programmes which will enable them to extend and upgrade the London Underground and to prepare for the opening of the Channel Tunnel. Between them, they will spend some &#x00A3;&#x00BE; billion on safety alone over the next three years. The new plans also consolidate the substantial extra provision for roads announced last year and include measures to relieve congestion in London. Investment in public transport in the next three years will be double the level of the last three.<lb/>
"Central government spending on education will be increased by over &#x00A3;500 million next year, largely to finance the record number of students in higher education. One in five of the 18 to 19 age group will be in higher education compared with one in eight only a decade ago. The number of higher education qualifications gained as a proportion of the relevant age group is higher in the UK than in Germany, France, Italy and almost every other European country.<lb/>
"Following the publication of the White Paper on the Environment, the new plans provide significant extra resources for environmental research and in support of environmental bodies such as the National Rivers Authority and the Countryside Commission. There is extra provision also for the Government's programme of action on rooflessness.<lb/>
"Throughout the last decade we have sustained a high level of capital spending in the public sector. In total it will approach &#x00A3;30 billion in the current year. Leaving aside defence, our new plans include an extra &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; billion a year for investment by central government and nationalised industries. There is also extra support for local authorities' capital spending on schools, housing and local transport.<lb/>
"Taking capital and current together, real growth in total public spending over the three survey years will be less than 2 per cent. a year, well within the trend growth in the economy. As I have indicated, this is a tight settlement and it means that the ratio of public spending to national income should remain stable at its present level for the next two years. Thereafter, as activity strengthens and inflation remains in check, the downward trend will be resumed.<lb/>
"I now turn to national insurance contributions. As usual the review this autumn has taken account of advice from the Government Actuary on the income and expenditure of the National Insurance Fund and of the statement on benefits made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for
<col>40</col>
Social Security on 24th October. The lower earnings limit at which contributions begin will go up next April to &#x00A3;52 a week, in line with the single person's basic pension, while the upper earnings limit will rise to &#x00A3;390 a week. The upper limits for the reduced employers' rates will also be increased.<lb/>
"In addition to these changes, there will be reductions in the contribution rates paid by employers. As my right honourable friend explained in the House on 24th October, the restructuring of statutory sick pay will add modestly to employers' costs from next April. It is right that the Exchequer should share these costs. Therefore, the main employers' contribution rate will fall next April from 10&#x00B7;45 per cent. to 10&#x00B7;4 per cent. and each of the lower rates will be cut by 0&#x00B7;4 per cent. This relief through contributions will limit the impact of the SSP adjustments on employers of lower paid workers in particular. The necessary legislation will be laid before the House. The contribution rates paid by employees and the class 4 rates paid by the self-employed will remain unchanged.<lb/>
"I am also publishing today the economic forecast required by the 1975 Industry Act, the first since we have joined the ERM.<lb/>
"I must emphasise at the outset that the Gulf crisis and its effects on world oil markets make the future unusually difficult to predict. The UK, along with other countries, has already seen some of the adverse impact on consumer price inflation. The oil price rise is likely also to contribute to the general slowdown in the world economy that was already under way before the Gulf crisis. For the Industry Act forecast I am following the practice of international institutions such as the IMF and assuming some fall in oil prices from recent levels to around 25 dollars a barrel by the end of 1991. But I must reiterate that the situation in the oil market remains very volatile.<lb/>
"Despite these uncertainties, however, it is now clear that the tight UK policy stance of the past two years is bringing about an easing of domestic inflationary pressures. This will make possible both a sharp fall in RPI inflation next year and a strengthening of output.<lb/>
"So far this year the public sector debt repayment has been running below both last year's outturn and our expectations at Budget time. Local authority borrowing was particularly high earlier this year as some authorities experienced delays in collecting non-domestic rates and the community charge. Public corporations' finances have been adversely affected by the slowdown in economic activity and central government spending has also been higher. Nevertheless, despite this I still expect a significant debt repayment in the year as a whole of &#x00A3;3 billion. This amounts to &#x00BD; per cent. of GDP and represents a strong fiscal stance at this stage of the economic cycle. Indeed we have a stronger fiscal position than Germany, France, the US and the other members of the Group of Seven industrial countries with the solitary exception of Japan.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0060"/>
<col>41</col>
"Thus our public finances are strong. Given our membership of the ERM and the counter-inflationary strategy we are pursuing, it is essential that they remain so. As I made clear to the House last month, the Government remain committed to the medium-term objective of a balanced budget. That is why we have continued our firm restraint of public expenditure.<lb/>
"Turning to demand and output, it is clear that growth has now slowed down sharply. GDP is forecast to grow by 1 per cent. this year. This figure is the same as the forecast I made at the time of the Budget but the path has been slightly different and I expect output in the second half of the year to be down on the higher than expected level in the first half.<lb/>
"This period of weak activity should last until early next year, after which I expect growth to resume. GDP is expected to grow by over 2 per cent. in the course of 1991, though year on year growth is forecast to be only &#x00BD; per cent.<lb/>
"Unemployment has been rising since the spring and may continue to rise in the months immediately ahead. But job prospects will improve with a resumption of growth, the more so if employers keep tight control of costs, including pay rises.<lb/>
"Within domestic demand growth of consumer spending has now slowed markedly from over 7 per cent. two years ago to under 3 per cent. in the first half of this year. The signs are that it will fall further over the year ahead as consumers continue to adjust to lower growth of real incomes, following the high borrowing of recent years.<lb/>
"Business investment rose by an unprecedented 45 per cent. in the three years to 1989 taking investment to an historically high level as a share of GDP. It has fallen slightly in 1990 and is expected to fall a little further next year. A modest downturn from such a high level is not surprising; indeed it would be extraordinary if it did not occur at this stage in the cycle. It will still leave investment over 50 per cent. higher than in 1979.<lb/>
"The current account has now begun to improve markedly. With low growth of domestic demand, import volumes have shown virtually no growth over the past year and import prices have been falling in recent months as a result of the firm exchange rate. Export growth on the other hand has remained strong over the past year so that the UK's share of world trade in manufactures has risen for the second year running. The deficit on visible trade has followed a welcome trend and virtually halved since the middle of 1989. This progress has been partly offset by poor figures for invisibles in recent quarters, though in the past these have more often than not been revised up later, at times substantially.<lb/>
"I now expect that the current account deficit in 1990 will remain close to the forecast I made at the time of the Budget, at just over &#x00A3;15 billion; and with domestic demand and import growth likely to stay low, I expect a considerably improved
<col>42</col>
performance next year, with the deficit falling to &#x00A3;11 billion despite some slowdown in export growth as world trade decelerates. As a proportion of GDP the deficit is expected to fall from 3&#x00BE; per cent. last year to l&#x00BE; per cent. in 1991.<lb/>
"I am now confident that inflationary pressures have been brought firmly under control. The monetary indicators show this clearly: the growth of MO has fallen every month since April and is now comfortably within its target range, while growth of the wider measure, M4, and lending have fallen sharply to 14&#x00BD; per cent. and 15&#x00BD; per cent. respectively. With demand and output slowing markedly over the past two years, it is clear that inflation will come down next year. The fall in the headline figure will be very sharp as the effects of past mortgage rate rises, the high initial level of the community charge and recent petrol price increases cease to influence the inflation rate by the end of next year. From a peak at the current level of about 11 per cent. I expect RPI inflation to fall to around 5&#x00BD; per cent. in the fourth quarter of next year.<lb/>
"In summary, the plans I have announced today honour our existing commitments and provide additional resources for key areas, notably for the health service, for pensioners, and for investment. However, they are within an overall total we can afford and they avoid the sharp upturn in the share of expenditure in national output which has occurred at similar stages in previous economic cycles. They are therefore consistent with the tight fiscal and monetary policies which will lead to a falling trade deficit and a sharp reduction in inflation. These are the right policies for building on the economic achievements of the past decade and I commend them to the House".<lb/>
My Lords, that ends the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02763">4.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02764"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for repeating the Autumn Statement. It is extremely difficult to comment on it as one has it in one's hands only an hour before doing so. I was always amazed at how well my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington coped in such circumstances. Now that I have to comment on the Statement, I am even more appreciative of his achievement.<lb/>
We are rather unfortunately interrupting a debate on the gracious Speech. Therefore there are many aspects of the Statement that I shall have to ignore. However, we shall be debating the economy next week and I hope that I can cover the points then that I shall have to miss today. I for one have found it hard to follow a Statement of this length. I must confess that I did not understand large parts of it and I shall need to reflect on them at greater length. That is particularly true of many of the details of public expenditure. However, my general impression of the Statement, especially viewed as an economics document, is that it is the most complacent Statement that the Government could possibly have put out. I do not believe that it addresses the real problems that confront our country and our economy today.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0061"/>
<col>43</col>
The most preposterous statement of all was contained in the very last sentence:
<quote>"These are the right policies for building on the economic achievements of the past decade and I commend them to the House".</quote>
The economic achievements of the past decade have been a vastly high rate of inflation, a reduction in the rate of growth of the economy well below its underlying rate, rising unemployment, the largest balance of payments deficit in British history and other matters of that kind. If those are the policies for building on the economic achievements of the past decade, the mind boggles at what the Government would do in any other circumstances. I have to ask myself whether I read about the results of a survey last week that was conducted by the CBI on what was happening in British business. I wonder whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer or his officials read the newspapers any longer as there was certainly nothing in this Statement which bore any resemblance to the description of the economy given by the CBI.<lb/>
A further problem we have is that the Government clearly cannot make up their mind whether they think public expenditure is a good thing or a bad thing. In one part of the Statement the Government tell us that the ratio of public expenditure is lower than it was at some other point in time but in another part they tell us how excellent all the public expenditure measures they have engaged in are. In order that no doubt can exist about the views of my noble friends and myself, I should say that we broadly regard public expenditure in the areas referred to in the Statement as a good thing. We say that with no sense of shame whatsoever. I hasten to add that in the present circumstances it is not at all obvious to me that the Government's claim that public expenditure will be lower in real terms is the right policy for our country.<lb/>
I wish to refer to one or two of the details of the statement, partly to seek clarification. I wish to draw the attention of noble Lords first of all to the remarks on defence. I was somewhat taken aback by the sentence which states:
<quote>"We have also been able to make savings elsewhere, including defence".</quote>
I was also taken aback by the sentence which states that the Government can assure the House categorically that nothing that will happen in the Gulf will be held back by these cuts. I hope that the Minister can give me a rather stronger assurance on defence expenditure. I hope he can say that at this time none of the traditional desire of the Treasury&#x2014;in other circumstances I would support such a course of action&#x2014;to cut defence expenditure would remotely influence any decision that we may regretfully have to take on the Gulf in the near future. I hope the Minister can produce a rather stronger statement on defence than the one he offered to us. Are we to take seriously the noble Lord's statement about the financing of local services and the poll tax? Listening to his remark that the poll tax will not rise, my immediate reaction was to recall the words of his right honourable friend the Prime Minister: I assume that the Government are
<col>44</col>
living in cloud-cuckoo-land in their approach to the poll tax. Is it seriously to be believed that poll tax bills will not rise strongly next year?<lb/>
On the question of public expenditure, I ask the noble Lord to reflect a little on his remarks about expenditure on safety in London transport. Is that not a very good example of the fact that the failure to spend in the past has led to the need to spend disproportionately now, whereas a more serious and rational approach to that and other matters would have been much more economical in the long run?<lb/>
Noble Lords know that education is an interest of mine. I draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that we are told that the increase in spending on education &#x2014;which is an increase in nominal terms and given the current rate of inflation it is not by any means obvious that there will be an increase in real terms&#x2014;is almost all to finance the record number of students in higher education. I favour students in higher education, but I was under the impression that most of us felt that the main problems in our education system lay in the schools. If this Statement is to be taken seriously, does it not follow that there will be no extra resources for schools, and is that not a worrying matter?<lb/>
In that connection will the Minister clarify the sentence:
<quote>"the number of higher education qualifications gained, as a proportion of the relevant age group"?</quote>
That is not a calculation that I have come across before. What is meant by the number of higher education qualifications gained? I should like to hear much more about what the noble Lord has in mind. The point he has tried to make would not convince anybody who knows anything about education in this country compared with the rest of Europe. It is a very strange expression.<lb/>
There are many other aspects of the Statement which are of interest; but, as I promised noble Lords, I shall not follow them up now. One advantage of having the Statement now is that there is still plenty of time in the debate on the gracious Speech to ask about detailed aspects of the Statement in connection with other topics. I hope that noble Lords will do so. However, I should like to ask a few questions about macro-economic policy.<lb/>
I am surprised that the Government have forecast oil prices at the low level of 25 dollars a barrel. Almost all of the advice that I have received suggests that it would be prudent to plan for a rather higher oil price. Can the noble Lord tell us more about that?<lb/>
I had difficulty following his remarks about the Government budget and debt repayment. Will the Government budget be in surplus this year and next year? I am not an expert in the field and that is the easiest way that I can put the question. Is the budget currently running in surplus? I ask that question because there is a little in the Statement about debt repayment but there is another set of weasel words to the effect that the Government remain committed to the medium term objective of a balanced budget. The
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0062"/>
<col>45</col>
medium term objective of a balanced budget means that it is averaged over a few years, implying that it may go into deficit quite soon.<lb/>
I should also like to draw noble Lords' attention to the remarks made on unemployment. There was a great deal of reference to the fact that this or that will definitely happen. On unemployment there is another preposterous remark to the effect that unemployment has been rising since the spring and "may" continue to rise in the months immediately ahead. I do not know whether noble Lords are familiar with the expression "racing certainty", but if I were asked which of the predictions was most likely to be correct, it would be that unemployment will, rather than may, rise in the coming months. Why are the Government so restrained in their view as to what is likely to happen to unemployment?<lb/>
That leads me to two final questions on macro-economic matters. First, I should like to believe that the out-turn for the balance of payments on current account in 1990 will be as low as &#x00A3;15 billion. Even more should I like to believe that it will fall to &#x00A3;11 billion next year. However, most forecasters &#x2014;including me, with my puny efforts&#x2014;are rather staggered by a figure of &#x00A3;15 billion for the coming year. No work that I have seen suggests that the current account deficit could be as low as &#x00A3;11 billion. The best measure of the catastrophe that this Government have produced in this country is that I refer to a deficit of &#x00A3;11 billion as low. That is an indication of what is wrong with our current economic policy. I do not believe that the deficit will be as low as &#x00A3;11 billion.<lb/>
Secondly, my final question could apply to the document as a whole. I wrote down as an <i>aide-m&#x00E9;moire</i> the sentence "how seriously are we to take the figures?". I did so because by sheer chance I kept last year's Autumn Statement and the Financial Statement for March. They were buried under all the papers on my desk. Fighting my way through the papers I found those dust covered objects. What did I find for the fourth quarter prediction for inflation, which, as we are always reminded, is the judge and jury of government policy? The Autumn Statement of a year ago said that for the fourth quarter of 1990 the inflation rate would be 5.75 per cent. per annum. In the Financial Statement in March, the forecast had risen to 7.5 per cent. per annum. I believe that this Statement shows that the out-turn is 11 per cent. per annum. That must be a contender for the world record for the worst forecast ever made, certainly in my lifetime.<lb/>
What then happens? The Government have lost that game so they have started a new one. They now predict t gat the inflation rate for the fourth quarter of 1991 will be 5.5 per cent. per annum. One wonders therefore whether any of this is worthwhile and whether the Government are in the serious business of forecasting or are simply pulling numbers out of a hat in order to lull the country at large into a false sense of security.<lb/>
I have gone on for as long as I dare for the moment without trying your Lordships' patience too much. I
<col>46</col>
simply repeat the warning that we shall all have a second chance next week when I hope to raise even more esoteric matters with the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02765"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord for reading us the Statement. Like the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I am fully conscious of the fact that next week we shall have an opportunity to dwell in much greater depth on these economic matters. Therefore I shall limit myself to asking four questions relating to the economic forecasts, because it is on the basis of the economic forecasts that other policy decisions, particularly in relation to expenditure, have to be taken.<lb/>
My first question relates to growth. The Statement accepts that growth is running at a very low level at the present time&#x2014;1 per cent. But there is an expectation that growth will resume after the early part f next year. That is a little surprising in view of' the fact that it is stated further on in the Statement that consumer demand will continue to run at a very low level. Right at the start of the Statement it is indicated that the view is that there will continue to be a fall in growth in the world as a whole, and in particular in the developed world, during the whole of next year. I should like to ask the noble Lord, how robust is the estimate that there will be a resumption of growth in the UK, as an oasis in the whole world, whereas the rest of the countries in the world will show a continued fall in growth?<lb/>
My second question relates to business investment. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, touched on that matter. The Statement emphasises the unprecedented growth in business investment in the three years to 1989 and states that it is not surprising that from time to time there should be some slight fall but that growth is expected to resume before very long. That is in total contradiction to the views expressed in the CBI survey, to which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred. The CBI uses such terms as "technical if not actual recession" and makes its worst forecast of business intentions for many years. Are the Government being realistic when they say that business growth is only momentarily slightly down and will quickly resume? How do they reconcile that view with what many of us feel are the more realistic views of the CBI?<lb/>
Thirdly, I come to the balance of payments. The Government have repeatedly said to us when we have had a bad month in terms of balance of payments that we should not take that as an indication of the trend. We happened to have one month when the figures added up for various reasons to a rather better result than expected and they seemed to be taking that as a trend. But one has to go beneath these balance of payments figures. We are going through a period of very low growth, whether one calls it recession or not. That is bound to restrict imports. It is also admitted that the slow down in world trade will eventually restrict exports as well. Even though we may show some improvement in the ultimate balance of payments figure, the underlying reasons could in fact be negative. If and when growth resumes we could see
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0063"/>
<col>47</col>
the same awkward trend as we have had before. I should like to have the noble Lord's views on that matter.<lb/>
Finally, I turn to the question of inflation, the beating of which is the main object of Government policy. We are told that, whereas inflation now is running at about 11 per cent., in a year's time it will be cut in half. This needs to be queried somewhat. Bearing in mind the point about which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, reminded us, of earlier forecasts only a year ago, it is difficult to visualise how in effective terms such a massive improvement can take place. The Government properly refer to the statistical changes which will naturally occur because of the lapse of time in relation to the impact of the poll tax and the impact of mortgage costs. But even allowing for those, it is difficult to see, against the background of increasing costs for a whole variety of reasons and of recession throughout many parts of the world, how the inflationary pressures in Britain can be reduced to that extent, and particularly how the underlying rate of inflation can come down to that level.<lb/>
I summarise my questions by saying that there is something a little surprising about the economic forecasts made by the Government in the Statement. They do not seem to bear a precise relationship to what is being said elsewhere in this country and to what is happening elsewhere in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02766"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by taking this opportunity at the Dispatch Box to welcome the arrival of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, as my interrogator on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peston, having closely observed the Statement which I repeated to your Lordships this afternoon, then proceeded to smile as he referred to the economic achievements of the last decade. In fact it would be fair to say that his countenance acquired a quizzical nature. I refute his suggestion by saying that the income of an average family has risen by 34 per cent. in real terms since the Government took office and that the health service has received 50 per cent. more investment in real terms since the Government took office. That makes a decade of which the Government can be reasonably proud.<lb/>
The noble Lord wishes me to clarify the Government's position with regard to defence expenditure and the Gulf. I remind him that the phrase used in the Statement is "categorically". I cannot add a great deal to that. I also draw his attention to an item later in the Statement which points to the increase in the reserves for the three years ahead in the event of further expenditure being required.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred, again with a quizzical look, to investment in public transport. The record there is one of which the Government can be proud. Investment in British Rail in real terms in this decade has risen by 40 per cent. There is an even more important figure because we now have private sector
<col>48</col>
money as well as public money in the infrastructure and that is shown by the &#x00A3;8.5 billion being invested in the Channel Tunnel. That is a public infrastructure project if ever there was one.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to higher education and said that he found the figures that I quoted from my right honourable friend's Statement unusual. I was not entirely surprised by that. The figures showing success in education may not be quite what the noble Lord would like to see, but that is what they do. I hope that he will see it as a chance for his industry to profit from that investment in higher education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02767"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not for one moment wish to underestimate the achievements of my colleagues and I in academic life. I just wanted the expression "higher education qualifications" to be defined for me. I did not want to underestimate the achievements. I simply wanted to know the meaning of the expression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02768"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am always rather uncertain about higher education qualifications but I believe that the expression refers primarily to qualifications gained in universities and polytechnics.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred to predictions and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, has a great interest in statistics, a matter which I have discussed with him at the Dispatch Box in the past. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, asked whether the figure of &#x00A3;15 billion would be achieved. Only a few months ago noble Lords on the Benches opposite were confidently predicting a trade deficit of &#x00A3;20 billion. The figures are now confirming what the Chancellor originally said. They are heading in that direction. If one combines that with the suspicion of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, as regards imports and his view that having a tighter economy cuts them down temporarily, I would suggest that the evidence of our export performance is more certain for the future. The record there is good&#x2014;two years of increased world share, not of retreat.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that a reduction in inflation from 11 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. would be difficult to achieve. The Government have gone to considerable lengths to improve their statistical evidence. The statistics show that there will be a fall, and a substantial fall, in inflation, which will come to that figure of 5.5 per cent. That will bring us alongside European inflation figures in 12 months' time. I hope that I have covered the basic points raised by the two noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02769">5.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02770"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend most warmly for repeating this immensely important and, to those of us who have not been given copies of it, extremely complicated Statement. The Statement began with a reference to the maintenance of the same level of public expenditure as a percentage of national income. Can he indicate what the percentage figure is of public expenditure as a percentage of national income? The Government, rightly I think, regard that as important. It would be extremely interesting to have the figure.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0064"/>
<col>49</col>
Can my noble friend confirm whether or not that percentage figure includes or excludes local government expenditure? I am referring not to the grants made to local government but to the total expenditure of local government. As he made clear, in that context local government expenditure is rising very substantially. Can my noble friend indicate whether Her Majesty's Government are prepared to take firm measures to prevent that local government expenditure rising so fast and so far as to undermine the whole success of the central government's policy? I should be grateful if he would deal with that point.<lb/>
I also congratulate him on the small but useful reduction in employers' national insurance contributions. However small, it will help with the difficult task of keeping down costs and making our industry more competitive. Will he accept that the Government's battle to maintain some serious control over public expenditure, in the face of all the agreeable invitations given to them to increase it, is absolutely crucial to the survival of our economy, its recovery and its ability to remain competitive? Will he emphasise that this is a major part of government policy?<lb/>
Finally, perhaps I may join him in congratulating my successor as Member for Kingston upon Thames in another place&#x2014;otherwise, the Chief Secretary&#x2014;on the extremely effective work that he has done in the difficult circumstances of this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02771"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly bring the last remarks of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter to the attention of the right honourable Member for Kingston upon Thames. The figure that my noble friend requires is 39&#x00BD; per cent., which includes local authority expenditure. He drew out the crucial difference between the two sides facing each other across this Dispatch Box. We believe that the private sector is the engine of growth which pulls the train that delivers a better society. We do not believe that the better society should be the engine that destroys the engine behind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02772"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have only one question to ask the noble Lord on this occasion. At paragraph 38 of the Statement, with reference to output, he was very coy. He made some soothing noises about output in general but did not refer to manufacturing output, which is of vital importance to the United Kingdom.<lb/>
The noble Lord will recall that in the Financial Statement that accompanied the Budget earlier this year manufacturing output during 1990&#x2013;1991 (I refer now to Table 3.9) was estimated to be roughly the same as last year with output for the first half of 1991 of some minus &#x00BE; of 1 per cent. Those were the times when were still talking of the great economic miracle. In view of the latest report from the CBI, to which my noble friend Lord Peston and the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred, does he still think&#x2014;as apparently he does in Table 1 in the <i>Economic Prospects for 1991</i>&#x2014;that manufacturing output at the end of 1991 will remain at the figure predicted in March and that it will be exactly the same? Does he
<col>50</col>
believe that in the following year, 1991, it will be only 0.5 per cent. below what it is likely to be during the current year?<lb/>
These matters appear very odd to me. There may be some statistical error. The Government's current Treasury bulletin, which I had the opportunity of perusing, refers to the unsatisfactory state of government statistics generally and gives specific reasons for that. However, I have a straight question for the noble Lord: does he believe that manufacturing output in the current year will run at the same level as in the previous year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02773"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we return to statistics. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, who I anticipated even from his new position would continue to harry me in my new position, would be surprised if at this Dispatch Box I decided to change the prediction in the Statement that was made by the Chancellor. I can draw to his attention the fact that export volumes achieved this year have risen. As I pointed out to him the other day, in vehicle production, which is an area that a decade ago many had given up as lost forever, they have been rising most encouragingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02774"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has not answered the question, which related to output. There are sources open to him and to the Treasury, if they are on speaking terms with the CBI, which will enable them to arrive at some estimate of what manufacturing output is likely to be during the current year and a reasonable forecast within tolerable limits of error for the following year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02775"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not go beyond the position that we predicted. I shall have to stand my ground at that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02776"><member>Lord Jenkin of Roding</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that large numbers of people applaud the substantial capital investment programmes which are currently being made in such industries as telecommunications, water and pollution, gas, and a number of other comparable industries? Has he formed any view as to by how much greater the public expenditure totals would be if those sums, amounting in total to some tens of billions of pounds a year, had still to be found by the taxpayer instead of by the market?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02777"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as always, my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding makes an extremely fine point. I am certain that if those operations were still being run in the public sector there would be tens of billions of pounds above the tens of billions to which he has drawn attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02778"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may bring the noble Lord back to the Government rather than to the Opposition. I should like to ask him a short question. Bearing in mind that the Statement made many other forecasts, can he give any estimate of the trend of interest rates over the next months and the next year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02779"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I could and I did, I might be in rather serious trouble. In order to lower interest rates we have to destroy inflation. That is what this Government are engaged in.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02780">5.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02781">Debate on the Address resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02782"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am slightly sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, was not present when the Statement was read. I am sure that he would have been cheered to hear that the building programme for new prisons is being curtailed.<lb/>
Returning to the debate on the gracious Speech, a number of measures are to be greatly welcomed. But there is one notable absentee. We are told that other measures will be laid before us. I venture to hope that there is still the possibility of a charities Bill under that heading. We have been assured that the Government propose to legislate during the lifetime of this Parliament. Obviously I do not know how long that will be. However, time is running on and the needs do not diminish.<lb/>
We have debated charity law on a number of occasions. In May last year the Government produced a paper which, although coloured bright blue, was technically not a blue book but a White Paper. We debated that White Paper on 30th November. I see that I was unwise enough to conclude the debate with the reflection that it would not fall to me,
<quote>"to propose a sixth debate on charities but that the next one will be the Second Reading of the charities Bill".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 30/11/90; col. 590.]</quote>
That now makes rather sorry reading.<lb/>
I am well aware that the charity commissioners have been making progress without new statutory powers. They have tackled in earnest the computerisation of the register of charities. In the next few months they will be asking every charity whose name appears on the register to submit a return. As a result, the register for the first time will be shorn of those charities which once existed but which have ceased to exist. It will contain up-to-date and accurate information.<lb/>
The commissioners have made alterations in the distribution of staff in order to strengthen the investigative capacity of the organisation. They have made good use of the powers conferred on the Inland Revenue by a recent change in the law about supplying information to the Charity Commission. As I understand it, there is now a similar arrangement with the DTI but for some reason it does not yet apply to the board of Customs and Excise.<lb/>
However, there is a limit to what the commissioners can do without fresh legislation to sharpen their powers and to give them authority to require and not simply to request. Without new powers they cannot satisfactorily raise accounting standards. All the effort of updating the register will not be put to full use without new requirements on charities to send in financial and other information.<lb/>
Without fresh powers to take remedial and protective action, the ability of the commissioners to deal with abuse will be muted. I take one example. It
<col>52</col>
will continue to be possible for a trustee who has been convicted of fraud or dishonesty, or who has been removed from his post by the commissioners, to go blithely ahead and involve himself in setting up a new charity. Without new powers the regeneration of parochial charities, which it is hoped to achieve through a new local review initiative, could be a rather damp squib. The continued absence of a power for the Charity Commission to go direct to the courts may well continue to be exploited by some of the more sophisticated operators. The staff of the official custodian have the rather melancholy task of continuing to work on his investment responsibilities when they know perfectly well that the plan is to do away with those responsibilities. They would certainly be much better employed on strengthening the enforcement side of the commission.<lb/>
I could go on. However, I hope that I have said enough to make the point that without the promised new powers the commissioners simply cannot do as effective a job as we would wish them to do in supervising charities, clarifying the responsibilities of trustees, dealing with abuses and ensuring that the sums which are generously subscribed are safeguarded. In appealing to potential donors, it is not yet possible to say in as clear and uncompromising terms as one would wish that they can trust charity to use their money without risk of impropriety and that if there is abuse it is very likely to be identified and dealt with.<lb/>
It is only fair to say that the Government have increased the resources available to the Charity Commission. However, government must realise that they are not obtaining the return from this increased investment which they could look for if the Charity Commission was enabled to take more effective action in using its resources. The case for amending the law is very strong, as the Government have accepted. I still hope to see a Bill introduced this Session to supplement the rather modest list before us. I believe that all of us could face with equanimity arguments about public schools and about religion.<lb/>
I wish to mention a topic to which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, referred. It is of some importance against the background of the Criminal Justice Bill which we shall be considering and the issues to which the noble and learned Lord referred in opening the debate. I refer to crime statistics. I would not for a moment seek to deny that there is too much crime and that it is increasing. I appreciate that someone mugged in, say, Westminster, is not likely to derive much comfort from the reflection that he would have been at even greater risk in, say, Manhattan.<lb/>
It is also disappointing that all the money which the Government have poured into the police&#x2014;and, my goodness, they have poured in plenty&#x2014;and all the efforts made for crime prevention seem to have had very little effect on the rise in crime. However, I wonder whether more might not be done to try to counter a fear of crime which may well be exaggerated. The publication each quarter of offences known to the police in England and Wales&#x2014;preceded as it usually is by the figures for the Metropolitan Police&#x2014;tends to be
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0066"/>
<col>53</col>
treated at any rate by the popular press as a precise indication of the level of crime. I do not suppose that it is now possible to cease publishing those returns without incurring charges of censorship. But we do not hear perhaps as much as we should of warnings that only a proportion of crimes is reported and that the size of the proportion which is reported is affected by a variety of factors including notably the police's own methods of recording.<lb/>
It is a rather complicated subject. One must consider that there are more policemen to report to. There is an increasing tendency to report, for example, domestic violence. There are requirements too for insurance companies to report to the police. Nor is it always made clear that only about 6 per cent. of the crimes reported are crimes of violence and that unlike, for example, thefts from motor cars, such crimes have not increased all that much.<lb/>
In 1982, 1984 and 1988 crime surveys in England and Wales, a quite large random sample of the population was questioned about offences it had experienced whether or not reported to the police. The information that those surveys obtained&#x2014;it was reasonably consistent&#x2014;gave a picture which differed quite considerably from that conveyed by the police figures. This is obviously not an occasion for going into detail. However, suffice to say that between 1981 and 1988 the crimes covered by the survey increased by 30 per cent. That was significantly less than the increase of 41 per cent. recorded in the police figures. For example, assaults increased by 12 per cent. compared with the police figure of 40 per cent. Burglaries in dwellings increased by 3 per cent. a year compared with the police figure of 7 per cent.<lb/>
I am somewhat alarmed by rumours that, in the interests of economy, plans for a fourth crime survey are being scrapped. The Conservative Party always prides itself on being the party of law and order. It would be a thousand pities if, just when the Government are proposing substantial changes in the criminal justice system, they are thinking of abandoning the only check which enables police figures to be seen in better perspective besides throwing additional light on criminal behaviour.<lb/>
That is a somewhat melancholy note on which to conclude. I am however looking forward to the Criminal Justice Bill. I hardly care to think of the number of such Bills with which I have been concerned. I remember paying my first visit to the uncomfortable official gallery in the other place in 1938 in connection with a criminal justice Bill. It was killed off by Adolf Hitler. I hope that the Bill will make new provision to safeguard the interests of people with a mental handicap who are deemed to be unfit to plead. That is an area in which justice has not always been seen to prevail.<lb/>
We are looking forward to hearing the noble Baroness, Lady Eccles of Moulton. I recall the occasion on which I made my maiden speech. Immediately before I was due to speak a Statement was repeated and I sat poised for almost an hour waiting to make my contribution. At least the noble Baroness has been spared that ordeal.</membercontribution></p>
<col>54</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02783">5.31 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02784"><member>Baroness Eccles of Moulton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with some diffidence that I rise to speak on a subject about which many of your Lordships know a great deal more than I do. I am nearly as new to the workings of the National Health Service as I am to your Lordships' House. Making a maiden speech is a quite frightening experience but the friendliness that I have been shown during the past few months and the good wishes that I have received today make it a lot less daunting.<lb/>
In the short time that I have been a district health authority chairman I have seen the reforms grow from a twinkle in the eye of the NHS Review Committee to the changing management and funding approach which we are in the throes of applying. The Government's commitment given yesterday in Her Majesty's gracious Speech, to continuing improvements in the health service has allowed me the opportunity to make a few observations.<lb/>
From the moment the White Paper <i>Working for Patients</i> was published in January 1989 the wheels began to turn, starting with assessment of the work to be done and the drawing up of timetables. Some of the reforms could take place without primary legislation but the main part of <i>Working for Patients</i> could not be put into effect until the Bill was passed.<lb/>
During that time it was not unknown for a health authority member to propose that no management action could be approved that had White Paper legislation implications. Common sense usually prevailed when it was demonstrated that so far reaching were the reforms that if such a constraint was imposed management of the local health service could grind to a halt. The Bill was passed not long before the summer holidays. Thanks to the great efforts made by the department, helped by regions and districts, the non-executive members of the new slimline regional and district health authorities were appointed within a few weeks. The authorities officially came into being on 17th September.<lb/>
It would not have been possible to contemplate the 1990 reforms if the foundations of general management had not been laid in 1985. However, it is strange to work in a service where the purpose remains the same but the management undergoes a revolution.<lb/>
With your Lordships' permission, I should like briefly to mention the reforms from the point of view of a health district. The health service, particularly during the past 10 years, has moved from providing services meeting people's real needs to a position where it is also increasingly being asked to meet their wants. The public tends to judge the service not only on the purely medical result but on how the system looks after it in all other respects; for instance, clear information on subject, such as visiting times, how long people will stay in hospital and explanations about the proposed treatment.<lb/>
The belief so strongly held when the NHS came into being&#x2014;that the consequence of health care free for all at the point of delivery would be a fitter nation, declining demand and therefore a reducing call on
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0067"/>
<col>55</col>
public funds&#x2014;has been massively disproved. As your Lordships will be aware, this is not because the first premise is at fault. Mortality and morbidity records show that we are undoubtedly fitter than we were. What could not have been foreseen in the late 1940s was that people's expectations in the light of medical scientific progress would make a continually increasing demand inevitable. This means that not only do we have to try to link needs with wants but it must be made clear that there will always be limits and therefore choices.<lb/>
How do we involve the people for whom the service is being provided in making those choices? This has become even more important now that we have moved from representative health authorities to a more corporate style of management. Primary health care by general practitioners and the services provided by a health authority need to draw closer together. People visit their GP surgeries off and on throughout their lives but acute hospital treatment tends to be infrequent and episodic. A very high percentage of hospital admissions is the result of GP referrals. The two services are inextricably linked and the reforms encourage information on the health needs of the population to be integrated. This is valuable to health authorities, as who better to understand what patients are likely to want than their family doctor? In Ealing we have seized the opportunity and our newly-appointed director of public health is shared with the Family Health Services Authority.<lb/>
Although our knowledge of needs and wants will continue to be imperfect, that will be the basis on which the contracts will be drawn up which we finance with funding allocated on a <i>per capita</i> basis. Money following the patient makes very good sense. I shall give your Lordships an example of how the present system does not always work very well. We opened a new maternity wing about three years ago. It replaced a new maternity hospital where about 1,700 babies were delivered each year. An allocation for 2,000 deliveries was found out of the budget. However, since then, due to the unit's popularity, the number of deliveries has increased to 2,400 and is still rising. This is bound to result in an overspend. Any efforts to limit the number of deliveries would restrict the mothers' choice. However, under <i>per capita</i> funding, as long as we get the contract right we shall be paid for each baby delivered, and if mothers and GPs wish the unit will be used to capacity. The fine tuning which will match facilities to demand could not happen without modern information systems.<lb/>
In many instances in-patient care is becoming more expensive in parallel with lengths of stay becoming shorter. Accurate costing necessary for contracts will pick this up quickly. As some of the more simple operations are carried out on a day basis there is a rise in the levels of care, and therefore the costs, of those who have to be treated as in-patients.<lb/>
Changing from the present system of funding is complicated, to say the least, but I am sure that my noble friends on the Front Bench will understand when I stress the urgency of moving with all speed to
<col>56</col>
accurately weighted <i>per capita</i> funding that is not heavily top-sliced. The purpose and motives driving the reforms will be sadly diluted or even lost without that essential component being fully implemented.<lb/>
The last factor which I wish to mention is the purchaser-provider split. Without that there can be no contracts. A great deal has been said about the anomaly of entering into a contract with a part of yourself. All the hospitals and community services which are not self-governing trusts remain directly managed. If they overspend, the district is ultimately responsible. If there is an outbreak of food poisoning, the district carries the can.<lb/>
Logically this must be regarded as a transitional period, even if it is a very long one. It is hard to think of another way of granting hospitals and other services self-governance within the NHS. However, the basic contradiction will remain until self-governance is complete. With tolerance and imagination as a transitional measure it can be made to work. Already the need to make a contract is having interesting effects. In a general hospital in my district the consultants who have become clinical directors are enthusiastic about making business plans and managing their own budgets, thus having a greater say in how the money is spent in their own departments.<lb/>
There is no doubt in my mind that we are heading in the right direction, but no matter how splendid reorganisations and new structures may look they are not worth the paper they are written on without the people to put them in place. It is occasionally said that the NHS is a huge monolith inevitably prone to bureaucracy. The reforms, with their emphasis on devolution, will allow room for enterprise and even create a wish to short-cut unnecessary bureaucracy. Many remarkable people work in the service and a great deal of enthusiasm has been generated, so that in order that they are not disappointed the momentum must be sustained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02785">5.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02786"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is an exceptional pleasure to be allowed to follow and congratulate the noble Baroness. I should have followed other maiden speakers with much pleasure because they are dealing with topics dear to my heart. However, there is a double pleasure in following the noble Baroness. Her father-in-law, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is a very old friend from my New College days. A number of people with us at New College at that time made a mark, whether or not one likes that mark, in the world; for example, Hugh Gaitskell, the noble Lord, Lord Jay, Kenneth Younger and Dick Crossman. They took one view of things and I ultimately joined that side of the argument. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, persisted in the other view. We always thought that he would go a long way. I thought that he would make his fortune in buying and selling books because that is what he was doing when he was an undergraduate. I hope that he has done that in the course of his activities.<lb/>
He has also achieved great eminence in the field of education. Many people&#x2014;and I am not necessarily
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0068"/>
<col>57</col>
referring to myself&#x2014;say that he was the best Minister of Education since the war. I do not believe that any person belonging to the Labour Party would say that, but many people hold that view.<lb/>
I point out also that he has a unique distinction. His daughter-in-law is now in this Chamber. I do not believe that there is a precedent for that. I am rather shortsighted, but unless I am mistaken I see his son and his grandson, so one might say that the whole family is here. That must be quite unprecedented in the history of this Chamber. I knew that the noble Viscount would go far but I did not believe that he would go as far as that.<lb/>
The noble Baroness spoke with much eloquence. She dwelt on topics with which I am very much involved in connection with mental offenders, about whom I propose to speak in a moment, and hospices, on which I am opening a debate next week. The noble Baroness will not expect me to agree with everything she said. Therefore, I congratulate her on her style and charm. I feel sure that she will always be a valuable Member of this Chamber along with her father-in-law. In time perhaps her husband and her son will be here. There is no limit to what can be achieved.<lb/>
I propose to say a few words about mental offenders. That is a subject about which I opened a debate at the end of 1988. As we all know, that is an incredibly complicated subject because the two factors of crime and mental illness overlap. In itself that makes it likely that it will not receive very good treatment because on the one hand there is the Home Office and on the other hand the Department of Health. As usual, the worst administration results where there is that kind of gap or overlap, whichever way one likes to look at the matter.<lb/>
It is impossible for anybody to be very encouraged as regards this matter. Even the noble and learned Lord, who earlier set out the Government's position, can hardly claim any great triumph in this respect. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, explained the horrific character of the present situation and touched on the report by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the situation at Leeds Prison where there were cases of suicide. That is a terrible story. I do not say that that is the fault of any one government. A number of governments have allowed that situation to come about. However, this Government have been in power for 10 years so they must assume a rather heavier responsibility than those in office earlier.<lb/>
As regards provision for the mentally ill either in or out of hospital, some of your Lordships may have seen the report by the House of Commons Social Services Commit tee on community care and services for people with mental handicap and mental illness. I do not believe that anyone would say that that is not a damaging report.<lb/>
Whichever side of this issue one is looking at&#x2014;the penal or the national health side&#x2014;it is a very bad situation. However, it is no good despairing. Let us see what can be done about it. There seems to be general agreement that a number of people&#x2014;no one can calculate the figure correctly because it is so much a
<col>58</col>
matter of opinion&#x2014;are now in prison who should be in hospital and some of them should be in the community outside hospital. On an earlier occasion the Minister gave a low figure but no one can tell what the figure is. If one talks to professors of forensic psychiatry and so on, they say that the number of people judged suitable for transfer depends very much on the amount of accommodation available. If the hospitals are very short of accommodation, they are reluctant to take those people so the prisons decide that it is not worth trying to transfer them. Figures do not have much validity in this case. However, everybody agrees that a number of people are now in prison who should be in hospital because they have mental disorders.<lb/>
During the course of the summer five of the most relevant organisations wrote a letter to the Home Secretary. According to <i>The Times,</i> the letter demanded urgent action to reduce the growing number of prisoners suffering from psychiatric disorders in prison. Five organisations called attention to that. The Home Office did not seem to be altogether allergic to that point of view.<lb/>
On 1st September the Home Office, in conjunction with the Department of Health, issued what were called guidelines for dealing with mentally disordered offenders. Much of the circular was descriptive, explaining what could be done under existing arrangements. The message was clear:
<quote>"Prison should be avoided wherever possible".</quote>
We must assume that there is some disposition in government circles to reduce the number of mentally disordered people in prison. It is obviously not easy to do that, for reasons at which I have hinted and to which reference will no doubt be made by later speakers, possibly my noble friend Lord Carter. That is due to the poverty of the provision in the National Health Service for the mentally ill.<lb/>
One may consider the situation of large mental hospitals. Their numbers have been reduced. I will not say that nothing has taken their place, but much less provision is being made. In East Sussex, the county where I live, there is a mental hospital called Hellingley. That was built to cater for 1,000 people. At one time there were as many as 1,400, which no doubt was too many. A few weeks ago when I visited there were only 100 people. The numbers are being reduced and soon Hellingley will cease to exist. There are authenticated rumours that it is to be turned into a prison. That would be an ironical result. Whether or not it is turned into a prison, one is hound to ask where the 1,000 people are now being looked after. They were not held in the hospital against their will, and it is the duty of the community to care for them.<lb/>
The schoolbook answer no doubt is that smaller units will be provided. To some extent that is correct. I tried to discover how much provision of that character there was. I visited an excellent example with which some noble Lords may be familiar, St. Anne's at Hastings. One may ask where the equivalent of those 1,000 people are being looked after there. At the present time in that area, so far as can be judged,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0069"/>
<col>59</col>
there is smaller unit accommodation for 200 people as against 1,000. It is hoped that that number will be increased to 400, but that is a lot fewer than 1,000.<lb/>
That gives the House an idea of the kind of situation with which we are confronted. Hospitals are being run down and community care has not yet been built up. There is no sign at present that community care is approaching the filling of that gap. No one, not even the most optimistic Minister, will say that that position will be rectified. It will not. It is a grave situation which will continue to plague this country for a number of years.<lb/>
I ask the Government to realise that we cannot deal with the problem of the mentally disordered in prison unless accommodation is found for them in the community. That accommodation cannot be found unless the services in mental hospitals or smaller units are greatly expanded. That is the situation. I ask the Government at least to realise the gravity of it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02788"><member>Lord Perry of Walton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Eccles of Moulton, on her notable maiden speech. I also apologise to the House. Due to a previous engagement I shall have to leave before the end of the debate.<lb/>
It may not surprise some noble Lords that I turn to the subject of education. For a decade this Government have been prepared to confront all manner of vested interests and force them to accept change. They have tackled the unions, local authorities and the establishments of medicine, law and education. For such courage and determination, they deserve much credit.<lb/>
What is disappointing about some of those confrontational challenges is that there is little sign of imaginative alternatives to replace what has been forced to change. There is often a shortage of new ideas. All too often the Government seem to seek to preserve and maintain into the 21st Century systems and practices that were devised to match the needs of the 19th and 20th Centuries, or even earlier. They appear to look backwards rather than forwards.<lb/>
I should like to consider that outlook in respect of education. Before I do so perhaps I may make one comment regarding Europe. Here, if anywhere, there seems to be an absence of vision and imagination. We are living in an epoch that is as pregnant with possibility as that which saw the coalescence of the United States of America. The vision that produced their constitution, their preservation of state's rights within a federal system, is seen by many people not as a shining example, but as a threat to something we call sovereignty. That seems to be little more in this modern world than an illusion that feeds on our undoubtedly glorious past.<lb/>
There is only one mention of educational legislation in the gracious Speech. It declares continuing commitment to quality, and promises a better deal for school teachers in England and Wales. That at least is
<col>60</col>
to be welcomed. But it only nibbles at the problems that have been with us in education for many years and which are becoming steadily worse.<lb/>
In a previous Session we passed the Education Reform Bill. No doubt during this Session, under yet another Minister, it will be further implemented. The new Act undoubtedly moved in the right direction by improving the breadth of school education up to the age of 16. But it stopped short in tackling A-levels. Since then almost every educational group in the country has called for changes in A-levels. But the Prime Minister has set her face&#x2014;a very strong face &#x2014;against any such change. That is another classic case of looking backwards and not forwards. It seeks to maintain an outmoded system.<lb/>
The ancient English universities catering for the children of the aristocracy and wealthy merchants devised a system for completing specialised honours degrees in three years. That was an excellent system for training the scholars and the mandarins of the future. It was a system copied by all the new universities. In my academic days universities took a positive pride in the fact that they achieved a 90 per cent. success rate in graduations. They were out of step with the rest of the world which took four years to award an honours degree and which had success rates as low as 50 per cent. At first sight that looks like a record for legitimate pride; it is not. It is purchased at enormous cost. It commits few errors of commission simply by committing large numbers of errors of omission; by denying entry to many who could benefit.<lb/>
That was the root cause of the political decision of Harold Wilson and Jennie Lee to found the Open University system. I am enormously proud to have been involved in the birth of that institution. I believe that it is the only imaginative change in our educational system that has taken place this century.<lb/>
The real tragedy of the three-year honours degree was its effect on secondary schools. The universities had to insist on early specialisation at school in order to achieve the three-year honours degree; they had to insist on the A-level and still do. They impose on all children a curriculum which, however admirably designed for the 5 per cent. of scholars&#x2014;albeit illiterate scholars, illiterate scientists and innumerate humanists&#x2014;denies 95 per cent. of the non-scholars any chance of a broad and balanced education.<lb/>
A-levels perpetuate the myth popular in my day that the only really worthwhile education is study in depth, knowing more and more about less and less. What modern society needs is education in breadth, knowing enough about more and more. That means some mathematics, some economics, some foreign languages, some science, some technology and some computer science. All are essential for success in modern life.<lb/>
The Scottish education system was devised by people who had divided the hierarchical structures of the feudal system of the Episcopalian Church. It followed the principle of universal literacy advanced by Calvin. Children of all classes went to university.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0070"/>
<col>61</col>
There was much less of a feeling of "them" and "us" &#x2014;a feeling that is still prevalent in England. There was a four-year honours degree and no A-levels. No wonder we export so many broadly educated men to take up jobs in the South. We must get rid of A-levels.<lb/>
However, that alone is still merely tinkering with the main problem, which is that our education system is in a state of crisis. Many of our children are being taught mathematics by teachers with no mathematical knowledge, no mathematical training, and precious little mathematical skill. Improving salaries will not solve the problem. The shortage of mathematics teachers&#x2014;a critical shortage&#x2014;was evident in 1975. At that time I offered the then Labour Government to run a crash programme from the Open University to upgrade teachers in mathematics. The offer was rejected by that Government. Since then, matters have steadily gone from bad to worse.<lb/>
We have the solution in our own hands. The only problem is that it demands an imaginative leap into the future, and another challenge to the teaching profession, comparable to the leap that created the Open University. We have all the technology that is needed. We could create a dozen different courses in mathematics: each covering exactly the same topic; each taught by a gifted expert teacher; each using a different kind of technique ranging from a talking face to an interactive video disk or a computer program. We could offer all the courses to pupils and let each pupil choose which excited and which stimulated. All that that requires is the provision of the hardware and the work stations in the schools. That could be done&#x2014;I offer it as a suggestion for privatisation&#x2014;by someone who wanted to lease work stations to the schools.<lb/>
I believe that the results would be astonishing. Children are naturally curious and anxious to learn. What is more, they revel in computers and in videos. Instead of switching children off, as we now do, so that they come to regard mathematics as beyond them, they would nearly all advance rapidly. We could, by using a self-paced individualised instruction system in this way, achieve a better educated population in a shorter period of initial schooling.<lb/>
We do not need to introduce such a system on a national scale, which would be extremely costly. It could be done in selected areas as pilot schemes. However, such a change requires an act of faith as profound as that which led to the Open University; and it must be a political act of faith. The profession' will never move, unless forced to do so, any more than the universities of Britain would, off their own bats, have introduced the Open University. However, vision of that kind seems to be wholly absent from the programmes of this Government; and that is why I call them unimaginative and find them unsatisfying. We have little time left. We need such acts of faith.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02790"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the gracious Speech stated that the Government,
<quote>"will continue to take action to improve quality in education".</quote>
<col>62</col>
So I hope it is appropriate for me to spend a few minutes on the question of quality assurance in higher education by sharing with your Lordships some of the impressions I have gained during eight years as a member of the Council for National Academic Awards, for the last five of which I have been its honorary treasurer.<lb/>
The Council for National Academic Awards&#x2014;the CNAA as it is generally known&#x2014;is a chartered body which awards more degrees than any other organisation in the United Kingdom. There are about 250,000 students in the polytechnics and colleges on courses which lead to one of our awards. The universities, of course, each have their own Royal Charter under which they govern their affairs and award their own degrees.<lb/>
The CNAA validates the courses under its auspices through a system known as "peer review". I can reassure those noble Lords who may not be familiar with that expression that it is not one of your Lordships' activities which has escaped attention. Peer review is a system whereby groups composed largely of academics visit our institutions and review their courses with the staff who teach them. Conformity to certain standards is thus assured throughout the sector.<lb/>
I hasten to add that I am not an academic. I sit on the CNAA as one of the obligatory representatives of commerce and industry. In real life I have spent much of my time as a reinsurance broker. So the impressions that I shall give your Lordships are those of an outsider looking in at the world of higher education in this country. I must say that it struck me as a pretty strange world when I joined it in 1982. It certainly did not do a lot to initiate someone from what it called the "world of work" into its mysteries. Indeed, I have been struck by the contrast between that reception and the kindness and courtesy with which I have been received in your Lordships' House. I take this opportunity to thank all of your Lordships most sincerely for the generous and friendly welcome which has been shown to me by all sides of the House. It really has made all the difference in what might otherwise have been a very daunting experience indeed.<lb/>
I return to the world of higher education in 1982. I resolved to read all the voluminous paperwork, to learn at least something of an entirely new language, and to keep my mouth shut for at least a year. However, I could not resist breaking the last of those resolutions when the expression "the continued and participative discussion mode" had appeared in my papers. I put up my hand and asked whether the phrase "the continued and participative discussion mode" could have been translated as "talks". I am afraid that was not well received. At about the same time I realised that I had been hearing an awful lot about things called "units of resource" and it came as something of a surprise to learn that "units of resource" were much the same as "students", about whom I had not heard quite so much.<lb/>
I am glad to say that matters have improved since 1982 and I have made many good friends in the sector. Furthermore, I pay tribute to the work of the CNAA,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0071"/>
<col>63</col>
particularly during the last four years. I believe that our system of peer review has ensured that most polytechnic courses are at least as good as most of their university counterparts. So convinced are we of this that we have felt able to grant what we call "accreditation" to all the polytechnics and several colleges catering for some 86 per cent. of our 250,000 students. Accredited institutions now take care of their own course validation and the CNAA will only go round for a check-up every five years or so. Taken together with the Government's recent policy of allowing polytechnics to enjoy corporate status independent of local authority control, I believe that accreditation will continue the good work which the CNAA started.<lb/>
I hope it will add credibility to the praise which I have just given to the CNAA and its sector if I say that in my view our good work is not quite completed. Although I would say that the "technic" side of the polytechnic movement is generally first class, there are one or two areas on the "poly" side where it seems to me that academic rigour is still perhaps not all that your Lordships would expect. For example, I am quite worried about some of our teacher training and, indeed, about the whole process of training teachers in this country. Teacher training can be likened to the soil in which the roots of the great tree of British state education feed and I feel sure that the national debate, which is beginning to focus on this area, will bring nothing but goodness in its wake.<lb/>
As part of the general debate about quality in education, there is one question which I feel I should bring to your Lordships' attention. In these days, when all sides of our political spectrum are committed to more students entering higher education, it seems to me very important to ensure that "more" does not mean "worse". The question therefore is: to what extent should we expect quality to be self-regulated by our institutions of higher education? The 1985 Lindop Report went some way to answering this question. It gave birth to one key statement which has become accepted wisdom in any discussion on this issue. It goes like this:
<quote>"Quality in Higher Education is best assured when institutions accept the maximum responsibility for their own standards".</quote>
The CNAA has responded to this concept by granting accreditation as widely as it feels is prudent. But it has rightly retained background powers of quality control. If something goes wrong and an institution cannot or will not put it right, the CNAA has the power to remove accreditation and, eventually, to remove its degree from the course or courses in question. No degree would mean no students, which would mean no units of resource, or no money, and therefore no course.<lb/>
It is very important to stress that this would happen entirely within the world of academe without interference of any kind from central government. It is most unlikely that these powers will ever come to be used, but the very fact that they exist is a strong incentive to successful self-regulation and quality
<col>64</col>
assurance. Even the threat of losing its accreditation would in my view be bound to motivate an entire institution into appropriate action.<lb/>
Looking across the binary line at the universities, we see the recent creation of their academic audit unit which is setting up a system of quality assurance for the university sector. I feel sure that this is much to be welcomed.<lb/>
I have spoken about quality in higher education. I finish by pointing out that no sector of our education system is independent of another. The primary, secondary and higher sectors feed into and depend on one another. What goes on in higher education, perhaps particularly in teacher training, influences what goes on in our secondary and primary schools, and so the wheel turns again. The quality of every part of our system should be of paramount importance to all of us involved in education. It is certainly of vital significance to our children and young people. I believe it is of crucial concern to the nation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02792"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to be the filling of a sandwich of two maiden speeches is an awesome position to occupy. I have never had this experience before. It imposes on me a double duty. First, there is the pleasant one of congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch. The second duty is that I must not stay too long in the way of the noble Earl who is to follow or he may begin to suffer from undue tension. I must be kind to him. The latter duty is the most difficult for me, as noble Lords will understand. I shall do my best.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, is a notable addition to the stock of knowledge and experience which makes your Lordships' House unique in our parliamentary system. We have heard two maiden speakers so far; a third is to follow. Each one adds to the value of deliberations in your Lordships' House. How any political party thinks that we can be adequately replaced by a bundle of county councillors elected by proportional representation, God only knows&#x0021; Such is the path of folly which some of my political friends appear to have set for themselves. Time will tell whether any such fate shall befall your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I was especially interested to hear the noble Lord's amazing survey of the whole field of education. I hope that when we come to the subject of teachers' pay and conditions we shall be able to dwell on some of the aspects of primary and secondary education which are the important stepping stones to higher education. I can modestly claim to have conducted the only independent inquiry into teachers' pay and grading in the past 16 years. All that has happened since has been patchwork or has been imposed on the profession and the system by an impetuous Secretary of State. It is now time that we should be able to discuss that.<lb/>
The quality of education depends on the ability and enthusiasm of the teaching profession. I shall refresh my memory in due course concerning the introduction that I wrote to my report 16 years ago. It was intended to point the way and to draw the vision of the future
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0072"/>
<col>65</col>
of the teaching profession. Little attention was paid to direction. Eyes went straight to the appendices where all the pay scales were published. Pay at the back and cost at the front were about as far as anybody got. So education became neglected. Everyone lost his way. The behaviour of the the National Union of Teachers was indistinguishable for a time from that of the Transport and General Workers Union. I felt that a great opportunity had been lost.<lb/>
It is said that the gracious Speech is thin and that it contains only 15 Bills. Such is our insatiable appetite for legislation that we go in for the numbers game. There are Bills, and there are Bills. Noble Lords know that vary well. I do not believe that we shall have any spare time in this Session as events unfold. I said in September that the British people are being confronted with an ordeal for which they may be inadequately briefed or insufficiently braced.<lb/>
The clearing of the decks, which the gracious Speech is supposed to be, in order to make room for a general election, is in my opinion a clearing of the decks for war. It seems that there is little hope for peaceful settlement of the Gulf dispute. More specific utterances are being made by the day as to what is to happen if Saddam Hussein does not vacate his unlawful occupation of Kuwait. The weeks pass and something is going to happen before Christmas. That something is a matter which we should not shirk. This is probably the first experience for the world of the absence of super powers to order, influence and regulate the peace. That role may now fall to the United Nations. The situation will be the first test of its adequacy to meet the challenge. Unless we face the challenge, I believe that we shall have a period of chaos.<lb/>
We also have to talk about Europe; we have not settled that problem yet. More debate may be needed before we do so. Some of us feel quite specifically one way, others another. Clearly, we have to work our way through a period of decision concerning the destiny of this country. This Session may well provide that opportunity.<lb/>
Turning to the gracious Speech itself, I observe, along with the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, the absence of a charities Bill. I deplore that on two grounds. The first ground the noble Lord has explained very fully. The second is that an experiment in co-operation was being undertaken involving an all-party committee comprised of both Houses of Parliament in order to help the Secretary of State produce a discussion document and eventually an outline Bill. That process was used most successfully in 1986 when we had the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Bill which covered animal experiments. I believe that this is the way to work towards agreement on a Bill containing possibly controversial measures. I am sorry for those who spent so long on the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, and myself were all part of the team. We published conclusions at our own expense so that everyone could see the sort of advice we were offering to the Home Secretary. Two Home Secretaries co-operated in the work, but now it
<col>66</col>
looks as if it will run into the sand. It will be two years before we get a charities Bill. In that time the development of the charitable industry&#x2014;I call it an "industry&#x2014;will be very swift indeed.<lb/>
Next week the charities annual conference will take place at which the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, is to make a keynote speech. In its brochure there is a photograph of the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw. The theme of the conference is "Five multiplied by &#x00A3;2 equals &#x00A3;10". That is an example of simple arithmetic. However, the front of the brochure states that the conference is about raising the levels of support from &#x00A3;2 to &#x00A3;10 per household during the 1990s. It is a conference to plan an assault upon the generosity of the public to support more charitable work by greater charitable giving.<lb/>
The situation raises questions which at one time arose in connection with building societies; namely, how big a movement can become before something has to be done about defining its role and limiting its activities&#x2014;or expanding them as the case may be&#x2014;so that we know what place it has in a changing society. In my view we are losing that opportunity, and I am very sorry indeed. If we had only achieved in respect of dogs and dog registration what we did in connection with animal experimentation, and what we have done on charity law, we should not have had the mess we had last Thursday when we tried to decide at the very last minute of the Session the attitude of your Lordships' House towards a controversial matter. That alone is a great disappointment to me.<lb/>
One other feature of the gracious Speech troubles me greatly. I refer to the strengthening of parental responsibility for children. What is proposed is not the strengthening of parental responsibility but the enforcement of it. No doubt noble Lords noticed that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, introduced the Bill as the Maintenance Enforcement Bill. That is indeed what it is. If we are to pursue those who are fathers of children or who have fathered a child or children&#x2014;there is a big distinction between the two&#x2014;we must scrutinise most carefully the methods which will be adopted to do so. In my view, what is proposed is a step in the wrong direction.<lb/>
I have spent most of my life promoting the independence of women, especially their independence in marriage. It is the economic independence of the woman, married or single, which should be our aim in the new society. However, we are now setting up a new kind of detective and pursuing agency to hunt down erring fathers, delinquent husbands and so on, in order to compel them to contribute to the maintenance of their children. The more you do that, the more you increase the agony of the women concerned. A greater contribution raises the question of access. Some women do not want contributions because they do not want to grant access&#x2014;sometimes for very good reasons. We must be careful not to cause more unhappiness.<lb/>
I very much fear that so intensive will be the hunt for these fathers that the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security will be recruited as part of the detective agency. I shall strongly object if that
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0073"/>
<col>67</col>
proves to be the case. I see no reason at all why departments seeking information about individuals for one purpose should then use it in the course of a detective exercise to try to track down a person for some alleged failure to comply with his responsibilities as regards a child or children. I am bound to say that I have very strong objections to what I believe to be the aim and the methods of undertaking this operation.<lb/>
I conclude by expressing my deep regret that we shall have the war crimes issue thrown into the cockpit of parliamentary strife once again. However, if the Bill reaches this Chamber for the second time&#x2014;I hope it does not&#x2014;I shall circulate to your Lordships beforehand a copy of a broadcast shown on BBC2 on 4th July 1990 given by defending counsel of the one war criminal so far tried in Canada under the kind of general accord which we now think should apply to us. He expressed his condemnation of the resources at the disposal of the prosecution with nothing comparable at the disposal of the defendant. It seemed that money was no object to the prosecution. Indeed, people were brought from Hungary in large numbers to give evidence much of which was vague and contradictory. It is true to say that old men forget. Sometimes, it is impossible for them to recollect accurately what they believe is so vivid in their memories.<lb/>
If the occasion arises, I hope that the BBC will lend me the film. It is not a long one. Members of both Houses will be able to see defending counsel in the case. His client was acquitted of all charges; namely, manslaughter, theft, cruelty and assaults in prison, following a trial lasting months and months. He tells the sad story of an old man of 79 in the dock all that time with his feet up on a chair, fast asleep every day. That is the sort of trial which took place in Canada. All the people concerned in these crimes are about 79 years old, or almost that age. Many are infirm. Moreover, although this particular man was acquitted, he was ruined in health, in social status and economically.<lb/>
There it is. I must now make room for the noble Earl. I have kept him waiting for too long. I apologise to him for that fact. However, we all look forward to hearing what he has to say. I am grateful for having had the opportunity to rid my conscience of the few items in the gracious Speech which cause me considerable anxiety.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02793">6.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02794"><member>Earl Howe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware that I am not the only Member of your Lordships' House to welcome that part of the gracious Speech which referred to criminal justice and the ways in which our courts are empowered to sentence convicted offenders. Changes in that area have been in gestation for some considerable time now, and at the beginning of this year the Government published their White Paper <i>Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public.</i> It proposed a more coherent and flexible framework for sentencing than exists at present.<lb/>
<col>68</col>
Pressure for change stems from discernible public anxiety on two fronts: that prison is often not an appropriate or especially effective punishment for crimes at the petty end of the scale, particularly for young people, and at the opposite end of the scale, where we are dealing with crimes of violence and sexual offences, sentences administered by the courts are often watered down by remission, which is virtually automatic in most cases, and further watered down by the separate system of parole for which many prisoners are eligible after serving as little as one-third of their sentence.<lb/>
At both ends of the scale it is a question of insufficient flexibility. People feel that for less serious crime there should be a more graduated range of punishments, short of a custodial sentence, at the court's disposal, and that for serious offences it should be possible to keep the prisoner behind bars for most of his sentence if he is still a danger to the public. Those are worthy objectives. I am sure that all of your Lordships will look forward to the publication of the Bill in due course.<lb/>
We need to remember that at the back of any legislation of that kind is our common wish to reduce crime and, in particular, to reduce rates of recidivism. There is no question of being soft on crime, but rather there is a need to look at ways of making punishment a force for good, rather than something unconstructive and therefore poor value for money. It is not often when reading a government document that one is conscious of an element of light relief. There is an insistent theme running through the White Paper that offenders should receive their just deserts, spelt throughout with "ss" as in puddings. No doubt there are many of us who wish that the matter were as simple as letting the nourishment fit the crime. We should remember however that what constitutes a person's just deserts rests essentially on subjective instinct rather than any utilitarian considerations. I have no doubt that that is a subject which will exercise your Lordships considerably when the Bill is debated.<lb/>
That said, there are two ideas which hold out the promise of real benefit. The first is that punishments themselves can be made more useful to the community than the often sterile exercise of keeping a man in gaol. For example, it should be possible to release an offender on probation and require him to perform community service under constructive supervision or, in the case of a fraudster, to impose a fine in conjunction with a probation order so that he cannot derive financial gain from his misdemeanours. At the moment courts can do neither of those two things because probation is not a sentence that they can impose.<lb/>
The second aspect of what I hope the Government will propose is the likely effect on the number of young offenders going to prison. That is an area of particular anxiety to many people. It is also a topical area in the light of this week's disturbing report on conditions at Armley Gaol where a number of young offenders have committed suicide. Nearly half the offenders dealt with each year by the courts are aged 14 to 20, and the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0074"/>
<col>69</col>
vast majority of the convictions relate to theft and opportunist burglary. To lock up such people in prison must be a last resort.<lb/>
We detest the crimes about which we read in the newspapers, but how much more should we detest our own stupidity if we believe that prison is the appropriate punishment for most young offenders. On the contrary, a prison is often a direct route to worse trouble as youngsters are disillusioned and corrupted by the prison culture and the influence of hardened criminals. How much more constructive it is to make a youngster compensate his victim out of his weekly pay packet or to attend a day centre where he can be made to face up to what he has done and discuss his personal difficulties. It is interesting to note that since 1983, despite a halving of the number of young offenders sent to prison, there has been no discernible increase in the levels of juvenile crime. That reflects the welcome measures in judicial sentencing which have already been taken.<lb/>
All of that of course begs a large question about the state of our prisons. If one reads papers by criminologists&#x2014;never a cheerful experience&#x2014;one frequently finds that a sense of pessimism prevails about the ability of prisons to rehabilitate and reform. Despite the old term for a prison as a "house of correction" no one now looks at imprisonment on its own as a way of putting an offender back onto the straight and narrow. A life of enforced idleness, where daily responsibilities and temptations are removed, is not conducive to correction or self-help. Most prisoners would agree with that analysis, but many will also tell you that it is not slopping out, or living three to a cell, which makes life oppressive&#x2014;bad as those things are&#x2014;as much as the depersonalising culture of prisons and the often brittle relationships which exist between prisoners and prison staff.<lb/>
If personal feelings cease to matter, one soon learns not to consider other people's feelings, and any sense of personal responsibility is squashed by peer pressure. That is why prisons are such dispiriting places and why the Government's extensive prison building programme should be seen as a means to several ends: not merely to ease overcrowding but rather to enable offenders to spend time in constructive occupations, especially vocational training and further education, thereby instilling in themselves some degree of personal responsibility. Even then one will find experts who say that education does not work. For me to question the experts is perhaps to "plunge the finger of inquiry into the pie of impertinence", but theirs is not an especially constructive approach.<lb/>
Similarly, there are those who say that the criminal makes his bed and should therefore lie upon it. It strikes me that we tend to treat the prison system all too readily like the bed of Procrustes, by taking the existing prison regime for granted and expecting prisoners of all types to conform to it. We should examine ways of altering the prison culture and, lest anyone considers that fanciful, we need look only as
<col>70</col>
far as Grendon Prison in Buckinghamshire, which for 28 years has operated under a system different from any other in the country.<lb/>
Grendon is a category B closed prison. One of its main aims is to treat prisoners who are in some way mentally disordered&#x2014;not schizophrenics who require drug treatment but those who are merely maladjusted and who can respond to group therapy and other psychiatric techniques. They are made to face up to their weaknesses and learn how to overcome them. It is doubtful whether group therapy can be much applied outside Grendon with any degree of relevance, but what is of interest about Grendon is the way of life. Prisoners are put on trust to go as they please in the prison during daylight hours. The prison officers are regarded by the prisoners as part of the team and are known by their first names. They do not carry sticks and there are no dogs. The prison is effectively run as a democracy by the prisoners. If anyone is violent, that is an infringement of the rules and that person is voted out of the prison by the other members. No segregation of sex offenders is necessary because everyone in the prison shares overriding common values. It is an extraordinary and largely unsung success.<lb/>
What Grendon illustrates, of course, is that if one gives responsibility to the right prisoner that responsibility will be honoured and built upon. The Government's plans to open 12 new prisons over the next two and a half years surely provide us with an opportunity to see whether, say, one establishment could be set aside for adult, first time offenders&#x2014;properly assessed for suitability&#x2014;who are more likely to respond to a Grendon-type regime and to benefit from it.<lb/>
The common thread in any changes we may attempt in the system of criminal justice is the need to instil a sense of personal responsibility and maturity in the offender. Certainly, we should not forget that such changes&#x2014;particularly those in judicial sentencing&#x2014;will be an experiment. They therefore carry the risk of setbacks as we try them out. But it is only when we think in new ways that we can move forward. Then, too, in your Lordships' House we can fulfil that great and wonderful purpose with which we are all entrusted.</membercontribution></p>

I was nervous for the noble Earl because the first two speeches in their absolutely different ways were exceptionally good and I thought that he might not come up to scratch. As the first chairman of Grendon and a very keen member, I am extremely biased about his speech. I should have praised him even if he had spoken badly. However, he did not. I wish to tell him that we have a group of sometimes 10, sometimes 20 noble Lords who always turn up at penal debates. We know one another very well. We have been making these speeches for 30 years and we are jolly glad to welcome a new member.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0075"/>
<col>71</col>
It is a great pleasure to say that, but I now wish to turn to something rather less interesting. On an evening like this the main subjects being discussed are so desperately difficult that lesser subjects seem to me to be left out. I shall speak tonight only of the voluntary social services and the arts, both of which are minor affairs compared with the dreadful matters we have to talk about such as the NHS, education, the social services, unemployment and prisons. These are all concerned with billions of pounds, not millions. I must remind noble Lords who often, I dare say, make the same mistake as I do that a billion is 1,000 million, so that the figures are inconceivable to people like me. We want &#x00A3;1,000 here, &#x00A3;100,000 there, and sometimes &#x00A3;1 million there for social services and the arts. So it is important that these secondary matters should not be entirely left out. Therefore I thought I would mention them.<lb/>
Without the voluntary services and the arts, society could still carry on but it would be a pretty miserable society. Those two groups act, each in its own way, as lubricants to the grinding realities of modern life, and sadly under the grinding realities they are always the first to be cut.<lb/>
Perhaps I may look first at the voluntary societies and later the arts. These societies have always been the Tories' favourites, so it is surprising that they are left out in such a way. Every kind of voluntary agency is affected: the many societies for helping the blind, the deaf, the disabled, one-parent families, the invaluable law centres and the equally invaluable citizens advice bureaux, hostels for the homeless, smaller ones like the family service units, the Simon Community and MIND. I could go on for ages. These and many more are the only comfort and hope for millions of our less fortunate fellow citizens. Without exception, they have been set up by private people on locally raised money. Where they have proved to fill a need, they have qualified for a partial subsidy from the government department concerned. This has enabled them to expand and to justify increased assistance. They have seen this eroded and underfunded in recent years by the oldest Treasury trick of all which allows an increase for inflation much less than the rise which follows.<lb/>
However, there is now a further threat of the most serious kind. To keep down the poll tax and to escape charge capping, local authorities are cutting the voluntary agencies right, left and centre. I hear from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations that every kind of agency is affected. A sum of &#x00A3;15 million will be cut from London local authorities alone, with heavy cuts in Derbyshire, Barnsley, Bradford, Haringey, North Tyneside and many other authorities. This is official, coming from the local authorities' own association. I do not wish to go into elaborate detail but most noble Lords will be able to quote their own examples, as the noble Earl, Lord Longford, will do in the debate on hospices on Thursday.<lb/>
I wish to give one example from my own personal experience. This time it is not Grendon but NACRO,
<col>72</col>
which was referred to earlier by my noble friend Lord Mishcon. I was its first chairman and I am still the first president. As a result of departmental cuts, it has had to close five of its 25 youth training schemes in Rotherham, Greenwich, Warwickshire, Cannock and Leigh. NACRO's youth training places have thus been reduced from 2,600 to 1,800.<lb/>
We are following up the casualties resulting from cuts in these schemes, all of which were for young offenders and other disadvantaged young people. Some have abandoned training altogether, some are already in further trouble with the law and some have gone back to training agencies where they had already failed before coming to NACRO. We also face a reduction of 11 per cent. in funding for our employment training centres for those aged over 18, from &#x00A3;14,000 to &#x00A3;11,300. No one has suggested that the work NACRO does is either unnecessary or badly done. It is simply stupid to interfere with essential work which is going well, when we consider what has been said in the House this evening about the problems of crime. This is one organisation which deals directly with the problem.<lb/>
In every walk of life we find effective voluntary bodies, some large, some small, employing underpaid but devoted professionals who do sterling work to assist the helpless and unfortunate. These are acutely at risk as a result of government policy. Each of these bodies is trying to help the unfortunate to help themselves and the present policy seems not only callous but once again stupid.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn to the arts. Here, the threats are almost exactly the same, with one or two added for good measure. The underestimating of inflation and the worries of local authorities about the poll tax and charge capping apply equally here. Another favourite government method of trying to improve matters without spending any money is to reorganise everything while omitting to note that the costs of reorganisation are almost certain to outweigh any savings made. The poll tax is the most superb example of that on a large scale. However, something of a similar nature now seems to be occurring with the Arts Council.<lb/>
The arts are particularly sensitive to recession as they are so deeply dependent on sponsorship, which is a form of giving that does not thrive in a depression. We can all agree that the Minister did well to squeeze out an overall increase for the Arts Council of 12.5 per cent. last year, but provision for the future is quite inadequate. The proposals for the grant to the Office of Arts and Libraries for 1991&#x2013;92 allot an increase of 5.1 per cent. against a current rate of inflation of 10.9 per cent. For 1992&#x2013;93 an increase of 3.9 per cent. is allotted against the most optimistic estimate for inflation of 6 per cent. Those two shortfalls will amount to &#x00A3;28 million in 1991&#x2013;92 and &#x00A3;41 million in 1992&#x2013;93. Those are massive cuts.<lb/>
The Arts Council is responsible for the performing arts and museums and galleries. I shall say no more about the latter except that they will have to share the shortfall with the performing arts, because my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris, who was a
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0076"/>
<col>73</col>
distinguished chairman of the Museums and Galleries Society for several years and who knows the subject better than most noble Lords in this House, will speak later tonight on this subject. I fear he will be no less pessimistic than I.<lb/>
The Government always put a good face on the arts problems by saying that although there will always be problems and the arts will never be satisfied with what they get&#x2014;that is certainly true&#x2014;the arts today are in better shape than they have ever been. That is demonstrably untrue. I agree with the statement of Joan Bakewell in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on 23rd September when she wrote:
<quote>"The tumbrils are starting to roll for the arts as the poll tax and charge-capping cuts are declared. Many local authorities have been raiding their reserves to soften this year's cuts. Next year there will be no such cushion".</quote>
Local authorities in England and Wales spent &#x00A3;200,000 last year on the arts, but how much will they be able to spend this year? What about Britain's glory, the so-called big four made up of the National Theatre, the RSC, Covent Garden and the English National Opera? Every one of those splendid bodies is in mortal peril. Once they have cut themselves to the bone&#x2014;they have already done so&#x2014;they can do no more. The next step is a lowering of standards. I am glad to be able to say that not one of those bodies is prepared designedly to do that. Prices are already too high and they cannot get out of their problems by raising them any more, at any rate at this moment.<lb/>
ENO needs a 14 per cent. increase in grant to keep up with inflation but it has only been offered a 2.5 per cent. increase. Covent Garden was promised that its grant would be maintained at the rate of inflation when the Priestley Report's recommendations were in general approved. However, it is &#x00A3;2 million short of what that would have meant. The RSC was promised the same but it is 63 per cent. down on inflation. However, there is the fullest demand for what is provided, even at the prices that are charged. The National Theatre has filled its three theatres up to 75 per cent. capacity for the year. The Royal Opera House has averaged 92 per cent. capacity for opera and 91 per cent. capacity for ballet. The same thing can be seen wherever one turns. I shall not mention any more examples although there are hundreds, not least from outside London.<lb/>
Is it really the Government's intention to allow both the voluntary social services and the arts gradually to run down in this way? We know pretty well what the deficit is in the arts&#x2014;if any noble Lord does not know what it is we can soon tell him&#x2014;but I hope that the Government will admit that there is a deficit and arrange to wipe it out, perhaps over a phased period if necessary. We have little idea of what the deficit amounts to for the voluntary services. That deficit must involve a number of Ministries and we all know how difficult that makes it to find out anything at all. I hope I may persuade the Government to try to make an estimate and to arrange to wipe that out too over a period. I doubt whether that will occur, but there is no harm in asking.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02798"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be brief. First of all, I wish to congratulate those who spoke so brilliantly yesterday in the debate on the Royal Address. We should all thank them for their contributions. I also wish to congratulate the three maiden speakers this afternoon. It is rare to have three maiden speakers in one afternoon. However, I believe that all of us who have had the pleasure and privilege of listening to them would like to offer our congratulations. Each one in their separate ways and on different subjects taught me a great deal, and entertained the House. I hope that each one of them will speak on many occasions in the future.<lb/>
I face a difficulty in that I cannot stay much longer this evening. Further, the first three speakers this afternoon spoke on the subject on which I had hoped to say a few words. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor in his wisdom gave us much advice about the Criminal Justice Bill. That was backed up by the noble Lords, Lord Mishcon and Lord Harris of Greenwich. Therefore I do not have very much to say. However, I have one suggestion to make. I have sat as a presiding magistrate for many years. In that position I had the opportunity, if I wished to await the receipt of reports, to send a defendant out on bail, to send him to a bail hostel or to remand him in custody before he appeared with full reports. This matter has been mentioned this afternoon. I believe it is quite wrong to mix up those who are on remand in custody with those people who have already been sentenced and are serving terms of imprisonment. Therefore I suggest that those who are remanded awaiting reports should be sent to a different place altogether.<lb/>
I believe it was the noble Earl, Lord Longford (who unfortunately is no longer in his place), who mentioned Hellingley Hospital. There are many hospitals which are no longer used because they are unwanted or are surplus to requirements. Those hospitals would make excellent remand centres for people who are not convicted but on whom one needs reports. I put that idea forward as a suggestion. As a former member of the parole board, I welcome the idea that release after serving one-third of a sentence should now be amended to release after serving one-half of a sentence. The prisoner would then know how long he has to serve.<lb/>
However, I wish to concentrate mainly on the concept of the family which was an important aspect of the gracious Speech as my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor pointed out. However, I have looked for a reference to the family in the gracious Speech and all I can find is the sentence which states:
<quote>"My Government are concerned to strengthen parental responsibility for children".</quote>
There is one further sentence on this matter but that is all. I do not know whether the Government intend merely to strengthen the responsibility of parents for children if the children appear in court. That might well be the Government's intention. However, I hope it means that the Government intend to strengthen the responsibility of parents for their children in the context of family life. I suspect that the Government
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0077"/>
<col>75</col>
wish to concentrate on the responsibility of parents for their children when the latter appear in court. I wish, however, that the Government were more concerned with parental responsibility in the context of family life. Much hard work has been carried out recently in producing reports on family life and many ideas have been put forward. I hope therefore that in the not too far distant future we shall have the possibility of discussing family life as it is today in far greater detail than has been the case hitherto as a result of the many reports that have been produced. The trend in parental separation, followed by divorce, is creating untold misery for parents, but more especially for the children who desperately need stability and love. Therefore, I am very disappointed that the Government have not made more of that particular difficulty in our society.<lb/>
Outside Parliament we have read that trained workers will be able to help those parents who are in difficulties. My view is the same as that of the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, who, at the tender age of 92, should know a good deal more than I and some other Members of your Lordships' House. My view is that life is a training ground and the experience of older people should be used to help people in difficulties. I was horrified the other day when I was told that a lady who I know well was not suitable to help people in trouble in any capacity because she did not have a university degree. I replied that she did not have a university degree because she had fought for her King and country and then had had children, therefore there was no time for her to study for a university degree. However, she had no less experience of life and could help people in need as much as anyone else.<lb/>
On the subject of maintenance orders, I also share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Houghton. I know a great many desperately unhappy fathers. They will pay maintenance if they can see their children, but if they are not allowed to do so even after a court hearing before a judge, they are apt to say, "No children; no money". That will be one of the problems.<lb/>
For so long as I can remember it has been possible to make an attachment of earnings order if the father agrees. That is not new. However, as the noble Lord said, access will be the main problem when it comes to collecting money from the fathers. Those fathers are deeply unhappy. They are usually out of work because of their unhappiness. Something must be done; but in my view it is no good expecting that when fathers are chased up they will automatically pay maintenance. They will automatically lose their jobs because of their unhappiness.<lb/>
There is a great deal more that I should like to say, but I shall not do so because time is marching on. The Queen's Speech has been well received throughout the country; but I hope that the other measures that will be laid before the House will include something about the families.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02799">7.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02800"><member>Lord Nathan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as time is getting on, I shall confine myself to brief remarks. However, before I do so I, too, should like to refer to the outstanding maiden speeches which have been made this afternoon. The outstanding feature which struck me was the positive, affirmative and hopeful tone of those speeches on the subjects chosen by the speakers, about which they clearly know so much.<lb/>
If I refer particularly to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, it is because he spoke about sentencing, to which I want to address my remarks. His speech had a broad sweep. It contained a great deal of information, and he is obviously knowledgeable on the subject. His speech also contained that essential element of humour which helps us so much in these long debates. He hoped that the purpose being fulfilled at Grendon would be extended. Those helpful elements were extremely encouraging. However, I wish to confine myself, with my feet on the ground, to a narrow point which I thought should be brought before your Lordships.<lb/>
As your Lordships may know, the Government have recently been found guilty in the European Court of Human Rights of a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights relating to questions of sentencing. I wish to refer merely to that point because it is very important and a matter on which the House should be informed of the Government's view.<lb/>
The case to which I refer is that of <i>Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell.</i> The decision was given on 25th October. It did not come as a surprise. The questions which arose in the case have been anxiously discussed over many years, and much concern has been expressed in many quarters about the United Kingdom law and its administration in that respect. The Government were well aware that the current situation was likely to give rise to the decision which has now been given.<lb/>
The essential point is this. When a life sentence is imposed&#x2014;and this may be objectionable in itself but is not the subject of that particular decision&#x2014;the trial judge writes to the Home Secretary through the Lord Chief Justice as to the appropriate period of detention to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence. In plain English, that means punishment. That period is often referred to as the tariff. The question as to whether the prisoner is to be released after the end of the tariff period depends on whether he would be a danger to the public. It follows that at that stage the punitive sentence will have been served.<lb/>
That was the basis of the European Court of Human Rights' decision in all three of the cases before it&#x2014;the applicants were entitled to judicial control of their detention after the tariff period had ended. The court specifically reserved the question of whether judicial control could be exercised during the tariff period because that did not arise in the cases before it. The article in the convention (Article 5, paragraph 4) cannot be regarded as some strange, foreign idea introduced into the English scene. It embodies principles which have been inherent in the English system for centuries. It is short, and I quote it in full:
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0078"/>
<col>77</col>
<quote>"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall he decided speedily by a court and hit; release ordered if the detention is not lawful".</quote>
That seems to me to be an unexceptionable statement of principle.<lb/>
Over the years, and particularly in the past 20 to 30 years, the nature and purpose of the life sentence in the United Kingdom has developed so that the period of detention required in relation to punishment is established and is distinct from any further period for which the prisoner may be detained for reasons of dangerousness. It is, I suggest, no longer open to the Government to argue that any prisoner serving a life sentence and who is released on licence is benefiting from a n act of mercy and that independent review of continued detention by a court is therefore out of place. That may have been the case centuries ago, but as the European Court of Human Rights found, it is not an argument which has any validity today. The cases decided by the Court of Human Rights, and previous cases, relate to discretionary life sentences. They are cases in which the judge has discretion whether or not to impose a life sentence, such as in cases of rape.<lb/>
Much concern has been expressed over the years by your Lordships about life imprisonment and the working of arrangements for release in cases of murder. That concern was expressed in all quarters of the House in a debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in 1987. As a result, on 21st July 1988 your Lordships appointed a Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment of which I had the honour to be chairman, and we reported on 24th July 1989. I will say no more here than that we recommended, having taken into account the European Convention on Human Rights as one of the factors which influenced us, than life sentences imposed for murder should be dealt with in the same way as the Court of Human Rights has decided in the recent cases.<lb/>
I emphasise here that the tariff&#x2014;the period of detention representing what is appropriate for punishment&#x2014;may be very long, and indeed we envisaged that in some cases it might extend to the whole life of the prisoner. But the fact is that over many years past, when a life sentence&#x2014;whether discretionary or mandatory&#x2014;has been imposed it has been very exceptional for the prisoner to be kept in prison for the rest of his life. Therefore, in practically every ca se the question of release on licence has had to be considered. Therefore, discussing release on licence and related matters is not a case of discussing a soft option. What needs to be discussed and, I suggest, embodied in the Criminal Justice Bill which is to be brought forward, is the mechanism by which the decision to release or not to release on licence is reached Logic and justice require that the same procedures for these two types of life sentence&#x2014;if, indeed, a mandatory life sentence for murder is to be retained&#x2014;should be applied.<lb/>
When our report was debated in your Lordships' House, there was general support, other than from government, for the recommendations that we made on these matters. The recent case before the Court of
<col>78</col>
Human Rights prompts me to ask that the Government give early consideration to these matters with a view to their being incorporated in the Bill to be brought forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02801">7.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02802"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join in congratulating those noble Lords who have spoken in the House for the first time. Each speech was well informed, interesting and had a touch of wit. I know that we all look forward to hearing each of them again.<lb/>
I have the honour to serve as a magistrate. What prompts me to speak is the number of youngsters who come to court, who are unemployed and virtually unemployable by virtue of the fact that they have missed much of their schooling and are educationally disadvantaged. There are many more who do not appear in court. There seem to be two main reasons for this lack of schooling. First, there are those who for one reason or another play truant and simply do not attend. The Government have made dire threats to parents of truant children. While there are cases where parents are at fault, I believe that in the great majority of cases the parents do all they can, but the children, having registered, then disappear out of school. The number of truants is small in proportion to the number of children&#x2014;just 1 per cent. in my county&#x2014;but it nevertheless adds up to 900 children, which means 900 problem cases for the future.<lb/>
The second reason for lack of education, and one that is far more common, is late development. Many of us can speak with the experience of our own children, who have shown no promise whatever at school but have taken off at the age of 16, 17 or even 18. Some have sailed into academic study such as the law, to the astonishment of their schoolmasters who had written them off. But it is much more difficult for this late run to occur in the public sector of education, where there is no provision to keep a youngster in education once the appropriate age is passed. In the private sector, of course, a boy or girl can go to a crammer and get the results needed for university. While these two cases are quite different they have a similarity in that in both cases the youngsters reject or fail to respond to education at an early age, but will respond to it, if it is available, a few years later, when they find that they actually need to read and write and do sums to enjoy their life with their motorcycle spare parts list, their computer instructions or even to read the programme at the football match.<lb/>
I was therefore interested to hear recently about Osmond House in Birmingham. This Barnardo school somehow manages to attract school drop-outs back into education and turn those heading for a life of social security and crime into useful people. I believe that there should be provision in the public sector to remove from school those youngsters who are either late developers or who are playing truant and to put them into some occupation that they enjoy. That might be practical work to do whatever appeals to them, inspires their enthusiasm and turns them on. After a year or so they would be ready to come back into academic education, and learn that much more

quickly. Think, for example, how quickly one can learn a language on a crash course, compared with the lack of success of learning it over the 10 years of one's school days. Motivation is what it is all about. Such a scheme would allow greater progress for those who followed the normal school process, and the cost of dealing with the slow stream would surely be justified by the decrease in unemployable youngsters.<lb/>
My second and last point relates to those who come to court. Many of those who come to court are unemployed and living on social security. By the unit fine system, they now cannot be fined the appropriate amount. For example, while the tariff for no insurance on a car may be &#x00A3;100, the unemployed may have to pay only &#x00A3;50. First, this means that he will probably risk being caught, as he cannot get insurance for &#x00A3;50; and, secondly, it is very bad luck on the lorry driver who is fined the full amount, loses his licence and possibly his job, and has to find twice the amount while also out of work. At best the lorry driver will have to work for several weeks to earn the money to pay his fine, while the unemployed man will sit around for perhaps years, while he pays off his fines from his weekly social security allowance, bored, with no money to spend, no work, no future and quite unable to give any maintenance to his girlfriends and their many children who, unfortunately, seem inevitably to be a feature of this kind of case.<lb/>
Fairness and prevention of crime dictate that punishment for the unemployed should be the same as that for the employed, which is not the case with the unit fine system, but somehow provision must be made for the man to be able to pay the fine. How can that be achieved? He should be offered work such as hand brashing of trees by the Forestry Commission, strictly on piece work. Very little supervision would be needed, as he would be paid only if the job was done as directed. Once the work was completed he would be paid in the form of a certificate for the sum of money. There would therefore be virtually no cost to the employer&#x2014;in this case the Forestry Commission. The certificate, adjusted to take account of the cost of travel and tools, would be acceptable to the fines office as payment for the fine. By volunteering for this work, he would be able to pay off his fine in a few weeks, but above all he would have learnt to get himself to work and would have been occupied and out of temptation to commit further crime to relieve his boredom.<lb/>
There are many more details to this scheme that overcome the various criticisms that have been mounted against it. I really do think that it should be given a good deal of consideration. It combines the benefit of punishing the miscreant adequately, enabling him to pay those fines with his own labour, enabling the defaulter to be kept out of prison, training him to work, and, on top of that, freeing his state benefit for deductions for maintenance payments or compensation, all of which individually are stated aims of the Government.<lb/>
To sum up, I believe that we are wasting the talent of many of our young who could achieve scholastic success if their schooling could be timed to coincide
<col>80</col>
with the late arrival of their motivation. The second point is that the aims of the Government to punish the criminal, to make him pay compensation and maintenance, are totally incompatible with the unit fines system, while work in lieu of fines&#x2014;and this is not the same as community service&#x2014;can help to achieve those objectives.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02804"><member>Lord Ritchie of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my words of congratulation to those of the three maiden speakers whom I heard. Unfortunately, I did not hear the third, the noble Baroness, Lady Eccles. However, I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, particularly because I happen to agree with what they said, which I did not expect to do as they are on the opposite side of the House. I have the impression that nobody wants to stay unduly long. Noble Lords are probably becoming thirsty and hungry. I have been shedding sheets from my speech at a fast rate. But there are certain matters of great importance that I should like to mention, and I hope that noble Lords will bear with me.<lb/>
Reference has been made this afternoon to the serious concern which is felt about the condition of the country in certain ways. I have in mind in particular the words of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, who spoke of the worrying rise in the crime rate. The state of the education service is also a matter of grave concern. In fact, the noble Lord, Lord Perry, described the education service as being in a state of crisis. I agree. No one can say that the Government have not done anything about it. On the contrary, many people, especially educationists, would say that they had done too much but that they have done the wrong things.<lb/>
I think that we all agree about the chief cause for concern, which is closely related to what the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, just said. Far too many of our young people leave school at 16-plus, hardly more than half-educated and without the beginnings of skills or training. It is perhaps only a small percentage but it still adds up to a considerable number and constitutes an appalling waste of human potential. Our record with regard to 16 year-olds staying on at school for further education or going to college for training is the worst in the European Community except for Greece. The figure is one of the lowest in the industrial world. One-third of our 16 to 18 year-olds do not receive even part-time education or training.<lb/>
The fact is that for too many of our children school becomes irrelevant after about the fourth year of the secondary level. Many begin to truant. They leave school without qualification and, despite the valiant attempts of the youth service, too many find themselves jobless and homeless and may drift into drugs and delinquency. I believe that that must be one potent cause for the disturbing rise in the crime rate. I am sure that it is one reason why it is impossible to walk from one end of the Strand to another without encountering young people crouching in doorways begging, unable to find lodgings because they have no
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0080"/>
<col>81</col>
work and unable to get work because they have no address. I have not encountered that before in our streets&#x2014;not in all my life.<lb/>
I am speaking of a major social problem. I have no doubt that one can point to many causes for it. A former Secretary of State&#x2014;I think it was the one before the last (they follow each other in such quick succession), the last one having shown unwelcome signs of listening to the unions and teachers&#x2014;said that secondary-age school children were bored because they were not being taught the things that they wanted to learn. I believe that he was right.<lb/>
Mr. Tim Eggar has disclosed that the Government have plans to change that situation and to make provision for non-academic youngsters in their fourth and fifth years by offering a range of vocational subjects as an alternative to the academic ones and as a preparation for gaining qualifications at 17 or 18. That is excellent. That should lead to more young people in their last two years of compulsory education finding, something to be gained by staying on for education or training after 16.<lb/>
But there is another very potent cause of secondary age school children opting out. They are failing. The strongest incentive to effort is success. If it is realised that one can do something well, one is powerfully motivated to do it even better. Conversely, failure has the opposite effect. If at school one finds that after reasonable effort one cannot do something that everybody else can do, there is a strong tendency to lose heart and stop trying. One then resorts to disruption or truancy, which one can view as fight or flight.<lb/>
The commonest cause of failure is incompetence in the three Rs. How often does one meet adults who, when pressed, will confess, "Well, you see, I never could learn to spell" or, "My trouble was that I hated reading" or, "I couldn't add two and two"? I have taught boys of 17 and 18 who did not know the alphabet. That can persist through life. I merely say what we all know&#x2014;even the present Government&#x2014;that sound foundations are quintessential. The Government have stressed that but have they taken the right action?<lb/>
We on these Benches believe that over-legislating and under-resourcing have been the fatal flaw in this Government's work in education. A crippling burden of paperwork has been piled on to LEAs, governing bodies, heads and all assistant teachers. At the same time under-resourcing has meant cuts in the areas that are most crucial for the help of children at risk: nursery schooling, peripatetic remedial support and good teaching materials. Those two factors, over-legislating and under-resourcing, have contributed to the gravest failure of this Government; namely, the alienation and demoralisation of the teaching force.<lb/>
It is as though the Government have thought of everything but the pearl of great price&#x2014;the teachers themselves, without whose support and co-operation all the radical innovations and reorganisations in the world are worthless. As we all know, the result has been the flight from the profession which, according to
<col>82</col>
a survey by the teacher unions published on Monday last, has left 10,000 vacancies. Many of those vacancies are temporarily covered by supply staff; others by teachers who are not qualified to teach the subject in question; and others by teachers on fixed-term contracts. That has enabled the Government to ignore them as statistics and claim that there are far fewer vacancies than in fact there are.<lb/>
Constant changes of teachers&#x2014;say, three in a year&#x2014;have a devastating effect on the progress of children, in particular children who tend to be in special need, which is of immense concern. The shortage is especially acute at the primary stage where firm foundations should be laid.<lb/>
On these Benches we are by no means sanguine about the Government's intentions regarding the new negotiating machinery for teachers. To judge from what the last Secretary of State said in the summer, there are three snags. The first is that there is to be a time guillotine on negotiation, which means that just when some final, perhaps comparatively insignificant, issue is about to be resolved, the Government can intervene and settle the problem by <i>diktat,</i> so that many weeks of painstaking negotiation can be wasted.<lb/>
The second snag is that settlements will not be permitted to go outside the so-called median range. In order that teachers' pay should catch up with the pay of comparably skilled professions, it will have to go outside the median range, which is currently 6 per cent. If it cannot, teachers will never be properly paid.<lb/>
Thirdly, the fact that LEAs and grant maintained schools can opt out of national bargaining is likely to mean that richer boroughs and schools will be able to divert the limited teaching force from poorer areas where it is really most sorely needed.<lb/>
With regard to the improved quality mentioned in the gracious Speech, is that to be quality for all or quality for only some? There is much that Liberal Democrats would like to see changed, but the problem of the wastage of young human potential is perhaps the one that is in most urgent need of a solution. The most important single factor in the achievement of that solution would be a fulfilled, revered and plentiful teaching force. Alas, from what we at present know, it does not sound as though the Government will achieve it by any forthcoming measure. Somehow, sooner or later, however, it must be achieved. I hope that the Government will listen to the suggestions and proposed revisions of your Lordships' House when we come to discuss the Bill to set up the new negotiating machinery.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02806"><member>Lord McColl of Dulwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my congratulations to the three maiden speakers on their splendid contribution to this debate. I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Eccles, for dealing so well with the problems of the National Health Service. I too was very pleased to hear in the gracious Speech about the Government's determination to continue to improve the National Health Service. In the past few months we have already seen a considerable improvement as a result of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0081"/>
<col>83</col>
the reforms. The district health authorities have been reconstituted. We have no more chaotic, disorderly, unpleasant and ineffective authority meetings&#x2014;a remarkable change.<lb/>
I should like briefly to draw your Lordships' attention to the many hard working nurses, doctors, managers and others in the hospital service who have been trying to get to grips with the problem of financial control. One ward sister, in her effort to get to grips with this problem, was amazed to find 2,000 pairs of disposable underwear in the store cupboard in her ward. Ward sisters are not usually surprised by anything these days, but she was surprised at that because hers was a surgical ward entirely confined to men. When she inquired about the cost, she was told that it was not possible to obtain that information because it was a special contract. One can therefore never find out the cost. When she threatened to inform the press, she was quickly informed that the cost was &#x00A3;1.40 a pair. She thought that that was very curious because she could buy them at half that price in the local high street. As a result of her inquiries, the culprit left his employment in rather a hurry.<lb/>
However, on a more serious scale, the works department at a hospital was thought to be under-performing. An inquiry was announced; and that evening the room in which all the records of the works department were kept was burnt to a cinder. Nothing much happened for another year. Disquiet continued. A formal inquiry was announced; and that evening the whole four-storey building was burned to the ground. It could be said that these are just anecdotes. But there are many such anecdotes which cry out for much better financial control and management of the hospital.<lb/>
It was good to hear in the gracious Speech that we are to have another &#x00A3;3 billion for the National Health Service. However, it has been shown in many parts of the world that when one pours more money into a health service, it tends to be absorbed into other functions rather than in improving the service to the patients. That again emphasises the great need for much stricter financial control to ensure that the money is spent in the interests of patients.<lb/>
In the debate we have heard yet again&#x2014;we hear it frequently in this House and other places&#x2014;that more beds are being closed. We are told that that is the subject of regret. I should like to emphasise yet again that the number of beds in the National Health Service has been declining at a steady rate for the past 30 years irrespective of which political party is in power. All political parties are agreed that the resources in the National Health Service should be much more fairly distributed throughout the country. That means that money inevitably will flow from the South East into other parts of the country. All are agreed that the hours worked by junior hospital staff should be reduced to more reasonable levels. All are agreed that the number of those doctors working in hospitals should also be reduced in order that there may be a more reasonable chance of them obtaining permanent jobs in hospitals.<lb/>
<col>84</col>
Furthermore, the advances in medicine mean that patients spend much less time in hospital. For instance, let us consider the commonest operation on the abdomen&#x2014;taking out the gall bladder. Patients used to stay for two or three weeks only 25 years ago. Now we have the exciting development of being able to take the gall bladder out through a one-centimetre incision at the navel. One puts in a small camera and has the most wonderful view of the inside of the abdomen&#x2014;much better than if one opens it up, strangely enough. The patient can go home next day. It is being called "running repairs". All those facts mean inevitably that we need fewer beds and therefore fewer hospitals. Nothing could be simpler.<lb/>
Finally, perhaps I may remind the House that there are still out-patient clinics in the United Kingdom where all the patients are asked to come at the same time, at nine or 10 in the morning. There may be 40 of them. As a consequence, some have to wait several hours. The fact that they are all eventually seen within four hours means that one could have an appointment system, if one had proper management, so that they did not need to wait inordinate lengths of time. These chaotic out-patient sessions have nothing to do with shortage of resources. They have everything to do with a fundamental lack of consideration and courtesy for the patients.<lb/>
It is small consolation to look to other fields where the situation is even worse. I refer to some magistrates' courts where people are instructed to attend early in the morning although their cases are not to he heard until the afternoon. Perhaps George Bernard Shaw was right when he said,
<quote>"all professions are conspiracies against the laity".</quote></membercontribution></p>

I speak on housing and the homeless, bearing in mind two statements in the gracious Speech. It stated:
<quote>"My Government will continue to work to improve the quality of Health and Social Services".</quote>
Earlier in the gracious Speech it is stated that the Government,
<quote>"will maintain &#x2026; control of public expenditure with the aim of keeping its share of national income on a downward trend".</quote>
I shall refer to that issue later.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack spoke of the significance of the family in the life of our nation. The matter was taken up by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and my noble friend Lady Macleod.<lb/>
I speak on the need for low rented, affordable, social accommodation in the community. I understand that Her Majesty's Government hope to achieve the provision of such accommodation by encouraging private landlords in the market-place to provide it. Her Majesty's Government hope that through allocating money to the Housing
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0082"/>
<col>85</col>
Corporation the corporation will channel grants to housing associations which will in turn provide low rented, affordable, social accommodation.<lb/>
I have consulted lawyers, surveyors, architects, businessmen and house agents. With one voice they tell me that the open market is most unlikely at this stage to supply the amount of accommodation that is required in our country today. We learn that the Housing Corporation, to which the Minister proposes to allocate money, has a cash flow difficulty at the moment.<lb/>
The Minister states that the corporation has nine offices throughout the country. During the current year it was allocated &#x00A3;1 billion and that will rise to &#x00A3;1.7 billion in 1992&#x2013;93. But the corporation has a cash flow problem because it gave approval to the housing associations to begin certain projects. The associations worked so quickly that they managed to deal with all the projects in one year and the Housing Corporation did not have the money to pay. It has had to take money from this year's allocation, which will therefore be less than is necessary.<lb/>
I am grateful for the help and information that the Minister gave me. He told me that Her Majesty's Government will rely on the housing associations, which are voluntary bodies, to meet the need to house the homeless and to provide low-cost rented social accommodation. In telling me that the Minister appears to be at variance with the housing associations because they tell me that they cannot possibly undertake to carry out the work. The housing associations began as adjuncts to the local authorities. It was never their intention to take over the provision of housing for homeless people and the provision of low-cost rented social accommodation.<lb/>
There are 2,400 registered associations managing and maintaining 500 homes. They offer 48,000 hostel bed places. Those figures are trustworthy and obviously correct. However, in England, Wales and Scotland during 1988 the people in 150,000 households were accepted as homeless and they totalled 430,000. The increase in England has been greater. In those circumstances, is it possible for the housing associations to meet the needs of the people of this country who require low-cost rented social accommodation?<lb/>
Who are those who need low-cost rented social accommodation? There are the people discharged from mental hospitals, as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Longford. There are the young people who were brought up in statutory or voluntary children's homes, and some in penal institutions, who were removed from their home by court order and when discharged from the care of the local authority had no families nor homes. Research carried out in 1983 showed that 33 per cent. of homeless young people in this country had been brought up in local authority or voluntary homes.<lb/>
There are also the young married couples without the resources to raise the money for a mortgage. There are many such couples in this country. There are young widows and unsupported mothers. There are
<col>86</col>
also many students who, I am told on good authority, sleep on the floors of houses of friends or perhaps of those who are not even friends. That is a devastating situation for young people starting university, polytechnic or further education courses.<lb/>
I have consulted the Association of District Councils, which commissioned research carried out by Dr. Glen Bradley of the Bristol School of Advanced Social Studies. I have also consulted the Association of County Councils, which set up a working party on housing and the needs of the homeless. Furthermore, the metropolitan authorities have looked at the problem. They all agree that it is beyond the capacity of the housing associations to meet the country's total need. That was also stated in the Church's report on rural areas. Under the National Health Service and Community Care Act, provisions of which will not be implemented for two years, Her Majesty's Government will need such accommodation. The Children Act 1989 will also make such accommodation necessary. The noble Lord, Lord Joseph, chided me some time ago because he said that every time I spoke I made recommendations for money and resources which were not available. But we in this country have wasted money appallingly on bed and breakfast accommodation. However, in many ways that waste is not as bad as the terrible effect that living in such accommodation has had on people. I point out to noble Lords in the medical profession, although I am sure that I do not need to do so, the terrible waste of money when the health of women and children has suffered as a result of living in such accommodation. I have that on good authority from the health visitors.<lb/>
My difficulty is in costing the loss to the country of our housing policy. I believe that the answer is that local authorities, in partnership with the housing associations, should be allowed to provide low-cost rented social accommodation in the community. The housing associations are voluntary organisations and they started as adjuncts to the local authorities. However, it was not intended that they should take over the local authorities' work. I pay tribute to the voluntary agencies and the housing associations, which carry out the work very well. I am also grateful to Mr. Spicer, the housing Minister, for agreeing to meet a group of those concerned with housing for the homeless. However, I consider that I am a voice speaking on behalf of the voiceless.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02810"><member>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a gracious Speech made long ago it was wisely said that man does not live by bread alone. I was reminded of that yesterday as I listened with great care to the the Government's proposals for legislation during the coming Session. Amid plentiful plans for dealing with crime, transport and the weapons of war, not one word was said about the arts, sciences, research, the theatre, orchestras, art galleries, museums or Britain's national heritage in any shape or form. Yet legislation is desperately needed in those areas. That great growth industry requires and demands vision and guidance from government if it is to contribute properly to national prosperity.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0083"/>
<col>87</col>
Some of your Lordships may be aware that I am in the last few dying weeks of my chairmanship of the Museums and Galleries Commission of which I have been a member for 15 years and chairman for the last five years. I shall leave it with the utmost reluctance and the deepest regret because that wonderful body of men and women are doing this country great service. The commission is the Government's adviser on all matters concerning museums and art galleries throughout the United Kingdom and since it was set up in 1931, it has built up an unrivalled knowledge of the museums business.<lb/>
I use the word "business" advisedly because these days museums and art galleries are big business. There are more than 2,500 museums in this country and together they attract more than 100 million visitors per year. That is more people than go to all the football matches and theatres in this country.<lb/>
Your Lordships will know of the 19 national museums with their 50 branches and out-stations funded mainly by central government and run by boards of trustees. There are those in the centre of London; there are those in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast and on Merseyside. Your Lordships are probably aware of the 600 and more local authority museums owned and funded by county or district councils. However, your Lordships may be less conscious of the 250 university museums and collections, mainly funded from money which universities receive from the Universities Funding Council. Therefore, they are presently in imminent peril. Your Lordships may be unaware also that there are 200 or more regimental and other armed services museums, many of them housed in Ministry of Defence premises, and 1,300 or more independent museums. More than half of the museums in this country are small independent museums. Many of them are owned by a trust and most receive no regular funding from central or local government.<lb/>
It has been calculated that one new museum opens somewhere in the United Kingdom every 14 days. It is probable that one closes about every month. However, it is a growth industry which is not afraid of its failures. Are your Lordships aware that there is a bakelite museum in Dulwich, a bagpipe museum in, of all places, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and a mousetrap museum in Glamorgan? All those museums are the result of the enthusiasms and delights of people who collect and wish to display their collections. Yet no government policy is declared on museums. They are covered by no general legislation. No less than seven government departments are concerned with museums. The designated Minister for the Arts is in charge of the Office of Arts and Libraries and yet it funds only 11 of the 19 national museums and its general concern for non-national museums is shared with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland offices.<lb/>
The bulk of central government funding goes to the national museums which together receive some &#x00A3;200 million per year. If one adds all other public sector expenditure on museums, it amounts to a further &#x00A3;100
<col>88</col>
million making a total of &#x00A3;300 million in all. One could hardly find better value for money than that provided by the museums business in this country.<lb/>
For years my commission pleaded, unsuccessfully alas, for a government policy, for funding and for legislation, particularly in six areas. First, as regards heritage, we advocate that the Government should confirm that they accept the principle that museums are the proper repositories for objects judged to be of outstanding importance to this country and threatened with export. We advocate that the Government should double the purchase grants of our national museums and return the two MGC purchase funds to something like realistic levels. We point out also that in the past the national heritage memorial fund has been seriously under-funded. Surely it is time for export legislation to be put on a much sounder footing and full responsibility for arts and heritage, including export control, vested in the Minister for the Arts.<lb/>
Secondly, the Government have a clear responsibility for the basic funding of a national museum's essential activities. Sponsors can be found for exhibitions, not for infrastructure. I long to see in one of our great museums a plaque which says, "The drains in this museum by courtesy of Harpic plc&#x2014;clean round the bend&#x0021;".<lb/>
Thirdly, the area museum councils, which are the commission's main agents throughout the country, are a highly cost-effective and successful way of improving our museums' standards, but they too are significantly under-funded. For years the commission's long-standing aim has been to double the funding of those councils. It has not yet succeeded.<lb/>
Fourthly, the university museums are an important part of our heritage and the universities holding them in trust have a duty to secure their adequate funding. I can assure your Lordships that the universities, in trying to do that, are at their wits end.<lb/>
Fifthly, those independent museums, well described by one of my predecessors as the primeval slime out of which all museums in this country have developed, for all museums were independent museums once, should no longer be impeded in what they are trying to do. Legislation should enable them to benefit directly from private treaty sales. At present they cannot.<lb/>
Sixthly and lastly, I draw attention to the armed services museums which are an essential part of the services fabric. A walk through the approach to Westminster Abbey today shows how important is the past of regiments and corps to their present morale. The Ministry of Defence should acknowledge and adopt a consistent policy towards them and fund them adequately.<lb/>
I hope that the new Minister for the Arts will bring the flare and energy for which he is justly renowned to solving these chronic problems. Perhaps the most serious danger is the steady erosion of scholarship and research. The silent seepage, the internal haemorrhage, of the life blood of curatorial care, is all the more insidious for being unseen.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0084"/>
<col>89</col>
In its 1988 report on the national museums the commission said that:
<quote>"scholarly activity is a major part of the work of senior curators and conservators in a national museum &#x2026; research and this sort of scholarly activity are not luxuries, to be cut when money is scarce. They are fundamental to the role and purpose of a great museum".</quote>
That is why I was saddened and my mood was tinged with autumnal melancholy when I found that all those matters were loftily ignored in the proposals for legislation. Museums look not to the past but to the future. They feed the creative imagination. They cleanse the vision of the people and it is well said that,
<quote>"where there is no vision, the people perish".</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02812"><member>Lord Swinfen</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, towards the end of Her Majesty's gracious Speech, as was mentioned by my noble friend Lady Faithfull, Her Majesty said,
<quote>"My Government will continue to work to improve the quality of Health and Social Services".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report;</i> 7/11/90, col. 3.]</quote>
Part of that improvement we are already aware of; it has been discussed before. That is care in the community.<lb/>
Care in the community will not work unless there is accommodation in the community for those who need care. At the moment there are large numbers of severely and not so severely disabled people in hospitals who are not able to leave hospital because there is not adequate accommodation for them. If matters in the Gulf go badly and there is a war we may also well have a number&#x2014;possibly a large number&#x2014;of our young men severely disabled and kept in hospital for long periods. We owe those men, who will be doing our dirty work for us, the opportunity of proper accommodation out in the community. They should not be incarcerated in hospital. I hope that that will not happen. There are already numbers of people who should be able to move out of hospital into properly designed accommodation.<lb/>
Over the past five years there has been a large body of research carried out that reinforces the view that housing provision for physically disabled people is inadequate, and that service providers are often insensitive to or unaware of the housing needs of physically disabled people. As I have already mentioned, with the community care reforms shortly coming into effect it is vital that action is taken to remedy that situation.<lb/>
Figures for the past 10 years show a startling decline in both local authority and housing association new build. The number of wheelchair units built between 1978 and 1988 declined from 827 to 184. The number of units of mobility housing declined from 7,383 units to 902 units in the same years. That is only local authority build; it does not include housing associations.<lb/>
A report by the Royal College of Physicians on physical disability in 1986 and beyond, stated that a large proportion of hospital beds were occupied inappropriately by patients waiting for adaptions to their homes or housing transfers. Both a report, on lifetime homes, edited by Andrew Rowe, a Member of
<col>90</col>
another place, and a report by Outset, on an analysis of discussions relating to housing design for disabled people, stressed the difficulties in persuading designers, architects, surveyors and manufacturers to take on board guidelines for a design to improve the basic flexibility and accessibility of all buildings.<lb/>
One possible way forward, as I have previously mentioned, is to amend the building regulations. Without a change in the building regulations, private developers will not be prepared to pay the additional cost of building houses to mobility standard. They will be frightened that their rivals will be able to sell houses at non-mobility standard at a slightly lower price and capture the market. It would be much better for everyone if their house was built to a proper standard.<lb/>
It would appear that in many instances local authorities do not have proper schemes for housing disabled people. They do not have any plans. Would it not be wise to impose on local authorities a statutory duty to plan with housing associations for the housing needs of disabled people, and to plan those needs prior to a person's discharge from hospital? That duty was placed on them in the community care Bill in this House, but that was removed by another place. I still believe that the Government will find that they need that duty as the Act, as it now is, takes effect.<lb/>
That is enough on housing. I wish to bring to your Lordships' attention one other matter on disability. It involves the severe disability allowance. As many noble Lords will be aware, if someone has not lived in this country for 10 out of the past 20 years, or a complete 10 years if they are under the age of 10, they are not allowed to receive a severe disability allowance. That situation affects families of Crown servants.<lb/>
Families of Crown servants who are abroad supporting the Crown servant who has been sent abroad by the nation to look after its affairs, may be caught in that trap. It does not affect the Crown servant, but it affects the family. It may affect a number of civil servants in the EC. I doubt whether it affects our diplomats. I believe diplomatic property counts as United Kingdom property in whichever country it is. However, it affects a certain number of people in the services; not often in the Navy, rarely in the RAF, and hardly at all in the Marines. Most of their service is alternately abroad or in this country. It affects some people in the Army, mainly the armoured units. Over the past few years they have been inclined to be stationed in Germany rather than in the United Kingdom because of the training facilities. Those are the units which will take the brunt of any action in the Near East should war come about. I believe the figures amount to only five or six people, but that could grow.<lb/>
I hope that the disability allowance and the disability credit Bill, as mentioned by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor when he opened the debate, can be used as a vehicle to correct that position. I gave notice to my noble friend Lord Henley before the debate began that I would be asking what steps the Government would be taking to correct that anomaly. I hope that he will be able to answer when he winds up.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02814"><member>Earl Russell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is my pleasure as well as my privilege to congratulate today's three maiden speeches. Anyone winding up the debate and having to congratulate three maiden speeches feels a little like Paris. I am afraid I must advise the maiden speakers that I shall not award any apples; I know what that led to&#x0021; Fortunately, since they were all so excellent, it would be quite impossible for me to decide, even if I tried.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Eccles of Moulton, in a speech which was beautifully delivered, said a great many things which I shall not answer; that might hinder their claim to be non-controversial. They will make me think a great deal and will call for thought in all quarters of the House.<lb/>
To the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, I should like to offer apologies on behalf of my profession for any coolness in the welcome he received. I hope that the warmth of my welcome to him in one capacity may make up for any coolness in my profession, which is my other capacity. I assure him that I entirely agree with his feelings regarding the phrase, "the unit of resource". I have made inquiries of its origin. I discovered it came not from the academic profession, but from the University Grants Committee. It is a bureaucratic phrase.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made a point about "just deserts", which I have been longing to hear somebody make. He also gave us a great deal of Benthamite wisdom, which will call for thought from all of us. I listened to him with a great deal of interest.<lb/>
A winding speech, inevitably, must speak about everything by turns, and nothing long. It is inevitable that any government, when they come to power, comes to power because an agenda has built up to which their principles are thought to be applicable. But as they work through the agenda, they reach a point where carrying out their ideas in their full, logical and pristine glory slowly takes them out of the range where they become acceptable to practical people.<lb/>
If one looks ahead along the sort of ideological road that was embarked upon in 1979 one might see it leading&#x2014;and this is <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>&#x2014;towards the position in Orange County, California, where the local privatised hospital is surrounded by armed guards to keep out uninsured pregnant women. In the health service review, the Prime Minister, and others, decided the Government were not going down that road. I wonder whether, just as Karl Marx once proclaimed, "I am not a Marxist", that represents the point where the Prime Minister, however reluctantly, decided she was not a Thatcherite. But when a government gets to that point, inevitably parts of their programme become vague. Looking at the list of the Cabinet in last Sunday's papers I was reminded of Disraeli's phrase about the Front Bench of the first Gladstone administration in the last year of its life&#x2014;"a row of exhausted volcanoes".<lb/>
I do not complain that we have a smaller gracious Speech than we have had for a number of years. I
<col>92</col>
remember the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, about legislative incontinence. I do not complain that this is a more continent gracious Speech than some others; but I am going to say that I see here a sensible set of consolidating measures with occasional volcanic minor eruptions of ideology, some of which may detain us for some time.<lb/>
I have given a warm welcome, in principle, to the maintenance enforcement Bill. It addresses a problem which needs a solution. I hope that in Committee we shall be able to address that in a constructive spirit. I have some doubts about the proposals. I have a doubt on whether the level of protected income which is to be allowed to fathers and their second families, if they have any, is set high enough to make it viable. If one sets it too low, enforcement becomes difficult.<lb/>
I also have considerable anxiety&#x2014;and more since the Statement&#x2014;about the prospect of mothers being deprived of benefit for refusing to name the father. Whether one thinks that is right or whether one thinks that is wrong&#x2014;I admit that there can be two views &#x2014;I do not believe that it is enforceable. At the very least, before that Bill leaves this House I hope it will contain an absolutely clear exception for women who have been victims of domestic violence.<lb/>
I am also worried about a 20 per cent. cut in entitlement to what is, after all, a subsistence benefit. We have yet another example of the principle of disentitlement from social security benefit. That is a principle which I believe is capable of a great deal of dangerous extension and I think we should consider how far we are prepared to let it go.<lb/>
In regard to the disability Bill, I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said about the severe disablement allowance. I am prepared to welcome the disability employment credit as an imaginative idea; but I wonder whether the amount of money to be put into it is big enough to make it as effective as I am sure the Government hope it will be. On the disability allowance, I am aware that there is a great deal of debate about how far the OPCS has accurately assessed the true costs of disablement. I will listen to debates on that subject with a great deal of care.<lb/>
I also hope that while that Bill is being prepared the department will take the opportunity of looking at other issues concerning disability, such as those raised by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. In that context, I hope the department will look at the report recently produced by Age Concern entitled <i>Old and Clean.</i> The report is about bathing and washing services for those physically unable to do it for themselves. The principle at the moment is divided between those who need this service for medical reasons who are the responsibility of area health authorities, and those who need it for social reasons who are the responsibility of local authority social services departments.<lb/>
At the launching of that report in this House we listened to a nurse from Newham who told us that the authorities had endeavoured to carry out an exercise to work out this distinction in practice, but they could not do it. In these times of financial stringency there is, to put it no higher, a temptation on each party to leave
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0086"/>
<col>93</col>
it to the other. This is a problem of bureaucratic terms. Good will is required to solve it and I believe that that good will is there on all hands. I hope the Government are prepared to co-operate in the task of making that good will effective. If ever I heard of an issue that calls for effective chairmanship, that is it.<lb/>
Like many other noble Lords, I regret finding the War Crimes Bill in the gracious Speech. I do not intend to go into the arguments in that respect, but I make two points. First, is there any other case of a criminal measure which has reached the statute book against the opposition of all those Lords of Appeal and former Lords of Appeal who have expressed any opinion about it? That, I believe, is a perturbing precedence.<lb/>
Secondly, is a free vote a free vote, or is it not? When we were given a free vote on the previous Bill, I was under the impression that we actually had authority to accept or reject it. If that was not so, and if it was a measure to which government authority was committed and we were expected as a duty to let the Bill go through, we should have been told.<lb/>
I shall not deal with the Criminal Justice Bill because my noble friend Lord Harris of Greenwich has covered those issues. That Bill was of concern to many speakers this evening.<lb/>
The other theme which has run through the whole of this debate is the reference in the gracious Speech to quality in both health and education. Clearly that has been the subject of a great deal of anxiety throughout the House, much of it backed by the feeling that it should have been dealt with more in the Autumn Statement than in the gracious Speech.<lb/>
It is a little early as yet to analyse the detail of the Autumn Statement. I notice that once again we have unplanned increases, which I welcome, in health and education. I wonder whether that is beginning to mark the point where the Government have to abandon the principle of the 1980 White Paper that increases should he tied to the Retail Prices Index and not to the index of costs in the service under discussion. If so&#x2014;I think that, in fact, it is so&#x2014;it marks the Government's failure to solve one of the major problems on which they came into office.<lb/>
The problem is the tendency of the costs of our public services to grow faster than our productive capacity. However, to say that the Government have failed to solve that problem is not to say that it is not a real problem. It is a real problem. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Eccles of Moulton, said about the continually increasing demand. That is a problem on which the Government came into office and that they will bequeath to their successor; and I wish their successor luck with it. It is a problem to which I do not see a solution and to which, in due course, one must be found. However, until a solution is found I hope governments of all persuasion will be careful about making sure that their eyes are not bigger than their stomachs and do not take on commitments which they cannot afford to finance.<lb/>
There is always a temptation when it comes to Autumn Statements to say, "Yes, we can do it, but not
<col>94</col>
at the stated price". So we get a great many provisions which are partially financed and the Treasury, as usual, cast as the Old Man of Thermopylae of the body politic. In some cases it is much better to say that if a provision cannot be financed properly it cannot be done.<lb/>
The Government thought that they could reduce the cost of public services by increased efficiency. They have been using a somewhat impoverished notion of efficiency to do that. For example, the Universities Funding Council has recently told the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals that it expects more savings by increased efficiency. When I find a library cutting back on buying books my pupils come to me and say that they cannot write their essays because they cannot get the books. The Secretary of State perhaps sees efficiency, but I see inefficiency.<lb/>
I think the definition of efficiency needs a little widening. We need to think about the problem raised by my noble friend Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, about basing public spending plans on forecast figures for inflation instead of actual inflation. The effect of this can be seen if one looks at the comparison between the social security budget which is financed on the past year's actual inflation and the health and education budgets which are financed on the coming year's forecast of inflation. The effect is that the percentage of government spending going to social security has increased steadily with a comparative dropping back for health and education. That is the measure of real cuts.<lb/>
I am not saying there is not a need for spending more money on social security. I believe that all your Lordships know that I think otherwise. There are areas in social security where the spending of money could be avoided. The cost of concealed unemployment on the social security budget is very severe indeed. In a Written Answer dated 16th October my noble kinsman gave me a set of figures on unemployment and income support. There are 1,216,000 people on income support who are not of pensionable age; neither are they in receipt of a disability premium or registered as unemployed. That is quite close to the figure given by the unemployment unit of 926,300 as an estimate of the number of people who are actually unemployed and not appearing in an unemployment register.<lb/>
I was also interested to note that the auditor general's report on the appropriation accounts said that one of the errors discovered in the social security account was that a good many people were getting income support who should in fact have been paid unemployment benefit because they were unemployed. That is a significant error. A good deal of the money that is spent on income support and, I imagine, on housing benefit as well is the result of low wages, especially in the field of part-time work.<lb/>
In the NACAB report entitled <i>Hard Labour</i> there are a number of cases where the Department of Social Security made inquiries and cut benefit because it could not believe that people were being paid as little as had been reported. In some cases wages for part-time workers were as low as &#x00A3;1.33 an hour. In
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0087"/>
<col>95</col>
that context, if we were to investigate the social dimension of Europe a little further, and in particular the EC directive for part-time workers, we might find that one of the beneficial effects of that was saving money on the social security budget and therefore having more to spend on provisions where that money is desperately needed.<lb/>
In general, I have spoken against increasing costs on industry. However, I think the cost of employing labour is properly a cost on industry. To allow it to pay wages below the subsistence level and to top them up with income support and housing benefit is a significant distortion of the market. The Prime Minister is on record to the effect that you cannot buck the market. It may be that this is a case where she should apply that principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02815">8.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02816"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had a wide ranging debate which has covered the field of home affairs and social policy. We have had a number of notable speeches, none more notable than the three excellent maiden speeches that we have heard today. I know that I speak for the whole House when I say how much we are looking forward to further contributions to our debates from all those who have spoken in this House today for the first time.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mishcon has covered most adequately Home Office and legal matters. I shall deal with social policy matters; namely, education, health and social security. As we know, the debates on the gracious Speech provide the opportunity to consider the measures which are proposed in the Speech and to draw attention to those problems in policy which are not mentioned in it. At the beginning of this Session (perhaps the last of this Parliament) it is appropriate to reflect briefly on what has happened in the field of social policy since 1979 and to look forward to some of the reforms in that sphere that will be introduced by an incoming Labour administration.<lb/>
Although education is centrally important in considering social policy, I do not propose to deal with the topic at length this evening because my colleagues on these Benches intend to put down a Motion for a full five-hour debate on education for the Labour debate on 21st November. There are some brief points I wish to make. On these Benches we broadly welcome the proposed Bill dealing with teachers' pay and conditions and to restore the negotiating rights of teachers. We shall certainly wish to question any provisions enabling local authorities and grant-maintained schools to opt out of national agreements. We fear that such provisions would undoubtedly exacerbate the existing teachers' supply problem in the poorer areas. We also fear that they could worsen the shortages which are now being experienced.<lb/>
The problem of teachers' pay was brought home to me graphically the other day by an old friend of mine who is a man in his mid-50s and the head of a department in a large comprehensive school. He told me in passing that his son aged 23, who is an industrial chemist, would catch up with his father's salary after
<col>96</col>
his next increase in pay. I wish to put a few specific questions on education to the Minister. When he replies can he tell the House in terms what is the Government's policy on education vouchers? We all understood that vouchers were off the education agenda, but it seems from the Prime Minister's speech to the Conservative Party conference that they are very firmly on the agenda again. It will be helpful to know just where the Government stand on that issue.<lb/>
Can the Minister also confirm that the backlog of repairs in maintained schools now amounts to about &#x00A3;3 billion? We understand that there has been a very patchy uptake of student loans and a good deal of variation in administration of the access funds. It will be helpful if the Minister can give us the latest information he has on this point. A number of your Lordships have quoted the cryptic statement in the gracious Speech that,
<quote>"My Government will continue to work to improve the quality of Health and Social Services".</quote>
In the light of that statement can the Minister say how that can be reconciled with the information reported only this week about big closures of waiting lists and a financial crisis in the health service? The <i>Independent</i> newspaper yesterday quoted a survey of health authorities which said that 4,500 beds have already been closed this year. The College of Health has said that waiting lists may reach 1 million this winter. The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts reported today and confirmed all these figures. Sixty per cent. of health authorities have only been able to keep within their cash limits by freezing posts, drawing down reserves, reducing services, cutting the number of staff employed, closing wards at weekends and holiday periods, cutting back on drugs and equipment budgets and freezing maintenance. It seems that the much vaunted reforms in the health service appear to be unravelling before they are introduced. Apart from the under-estimation of inflation and the underfunding of pay awards, health authorities may face the problem of having to wipe out their deficits and balance their books by April 1991 so that the new internal market can operate on a level playing field. That is to put book keeping before treatment. The Government have written off literally billions of debt in the nationalised industries in order to fatten them up for privatisation and have then spent millions on fees and promotion of privatisation. Why cannot they do the same as regards the &#x00A3;70 million to &#x00A3;100 million of underlying debt in the National Health Service? What is achieved for patients by this obsession with book keeping?<lb/>
I should like to put three specific questions to the Minister. I hope that he will not reply by quoting the global figure for health service expenditure from today's Autumn Statement. First, what is the Government's estimate of the total number of bed closures in the health service for the year ending April 1991? Secondly, what is the Government's estimate of the peak figure for hospital waiting lists between now and April next year? Thirdly, will the Government undertake to write off the underlying deficit in the health service which will be there in April 1991 or, if
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0088"/>
<col>97</col>
they are unable to do so, will they allow health authorities to spread the wiping out of the deficit over a period of two to three years instead of two to three months?<lb/>
We welcome the Government's proposals regarding child maintenance and the Child Support Agency. These are right in principle. However, the Minister and the House will know that considerable concern has already been expressed regarding the practical operation of the proposals and their possible effect on the families involved. There is a genuine fear that in some cases recipients of benefit will have a marginal tax rate of 100 per cent., losing &#x00A3;1 of benefit for every &#x00A3;1 of maintenance received, thereby reducing the incentive of the lone parent to seek employment.<lb/>
We know that the &#x00A3;15 disregard on family credit will be more than swallowed up in child care costs. Indeed, if the Government increased the disregard and allowed the child care costs, there could be a net gain to the Treasury through the reduction in social security payments as lone parents would then be encouraged to take up employment. There is a strong suspicion that the Government's main intention is to reduce the &#x00A3;3.6 billion cost to the Exchequer of lone parents and to ensure that the absent parent's first duty is to meet the cost to the state of the family situation, with the duty to the children coming into play only after the bill to the taxpayer has been reduced.<lb/>
There is also a very real concern regarding the proposal to punish lone parents by deducting one-fifth of their benefit if they refuse to name the absent parent. How is that proposal supposed to help the children who are, after all, the innocent victims in such a situation? Rather than supporting children, the Child Support Agency could in fact place many more in poverty because the first family may not receive all the payments or the second family will suffer from low income through benefit. That could put more children at risk and in need of the social services and their "preventive" measures than would otherwise be the case. The one piece of excellent government legislation, the Children Act 1989, will, we fear, have to fight an uphill battle with other new government social security legislation in this respect.<lb/>
The proposals in the gracious Speech regarding social security relate to the two new benefits for disabled people; namely, the new disability allowance and the disability employment credit. We welcome both measures. In introducing the debate today, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor referred to the "simplicity" of the new disability allowance. As I understand it, the merging of the mobility allowance and the attendance allowance will produce a matrix of no less than 11 variations of allowance. That need not be wrong, but it is hardly the simplification of the benefit system which we were promised in the Social Security Act 1988 or indeed that was mentioned earlier today. With the new disability employment credit, the Government must ensure that this helps disabled people to find employment and does not put at risk their future entitlement to long-term disability
<col>98</col>
benefits. Can the Minister tell us whether there will be a consultation document which will be circulated on the new system of employment credit?<lb/>
We welcome the proposals for self-assessment for the two new benefits. It is to be hoped that this will overcome some of the anomalies and injustices which exist in the adjudication at present, certainly as regards the mobility allowance. However, we shall need to examine the proposals in detail.<lb/>
There are many other problems in social security besides those dealt with by the introduction of the two new benefits. I fear that it may be too much to hope that the Government will deal with them in a social security Bill in the coming Session. There are disabled households which are &#x00A3;200 to &#x00A3;500 a year worse off as a result of the switch from rates to poll tax and the ending of rate relief for disabled households. There are then the 100,000 or more people who are still on transitional protection and who in April next year will face their fourth year running without any increase in their benefits. There are poor families who are above the level of family credit. There are also poor families with three or four children who have received a 3 per cent. or 4 per cent. increase in their child benefit compared with rich families with one child who have received a 12 per cent. increase.<lb/>
There are also the 22 per cent. of children under the age of 16 in Scotland who are now dependent upon income support, compared with a figure of 8 per cent. in 1979. There are pensioners who have lost &#x00A3;22 billion since 1979 by the ending of the link between pensions and earnings and all those who have suffered from the cumulative cutback in real terms of some &#x00A3;27 billion in benefit since 1979.<lb/>
I do not know whether your Lordships have seen the report produced during the past few weeks by Barnardos entitled <i>Missing the Target.</i> It is a damning indictment of the operation of the Social Security Act 1988. Sometimes the Prime Minister and her Ministers quote the parable of the Good Samaritan to support their social policy. They point out that the Good Samaritan was only able to help because he had money. That is a curiously utilitarian exegesis.<lb/>
According to every independent survey and the Government's own figures since 1979, there are more people on low incomes, more people on the minimum safety net level of benefit and more people with incomes below the safety net level. Moreover, since 1979 there has been a negligible income growth in real terms for the poorest groups, accompanied by a significant income growth among the rest of the population especially as regards the &#x00A3;26 billion handed back to higher rate taxpayers. When we consider all that, I suggest to the Government that if they wish to call in aid the parable of the Good Samaritan, a more suitable role model for their social policy would be the rich man who passed by on the other side.<lb/>
In conclusion I must point out that time does not allow me to cover the many other issues which arise in respect of social policy: the continuing shortfall, despite the recent increases, between income support
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0089"/>
<col>99</col>
and the cost of residential and nursing care; all the problems resulting from the postponement of community care, as referred to by many noble Lords today; the shortfall, despite the &#x00A3;30 million ring-fenced grant, in the provision of services for those with mental handicaps or suffering from mental illness; and the continuing and agonising problems of carers. There are of course many more such issues.<lb/>
Noble Lords are entitled to ask: what will a Labour Government do about these problems? We have proposals, set out in detail in our policy documents, which deal with pensions&#x2014;both state retirement pensions and personal pensions&#x2014;and child benefit. There are proposals for a new disability benefit and increases in existing benefits. There are new carers' benefits and proposals to extend respite care; a national minimum wage; ring-fencing of community care; and the funding in full of health service pay awards. The pension and child benefit proposals will be introduced immediately. The other policies will be introduced over time and as resources allow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02817"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security (Lord Henley)</member><membercontribution>: Ah, my Lords&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02818"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought that the Minister would say that. The question of resources is crucial, and I shall tell the Minister why. I do not intend to intrude upon next Wednesday's debate on the economy, but the incoming government, whoever wins the next election, will face a massive economic problem. We have a structural deficit on the balance of payments of some &#x00A3;15 billion while the economy is in recession. What figure will it reach if the economy starts to grow? We face the painful adjustments that will flow from entry into the ERM. We face an economy which is fundamentally out of balance as between consumption, investment and public expenditure.<lb/>
For all those reasons, some harsh choices will have to be made in putting essential social policies into effect. Those harsh choices will face any government. Only a Labour Government will make the choices on the grounds of social equity, justice and fairness&#x2014;the grounds which have been so signally missing since 1979.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02819">8.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02820"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join with other noble Lords in congratulating my three noble friends on their excellent maiden speeches. My noble friend Lord Howe made an informed speech on the Criminal Justice Bill and prisons and their problems. My noble friend Lady Eccles, as a distinguished chairman of Ealing District Health Authority, spoke about the NHS. My noble friend Lord Pearson spoke with great expertise on higher education as an outsider. How welcome it is to hear an outsider from higher education give us the benefit of his advice in the House where we have so many insiders on that subject.<lb/>
The debate covered a wide range of subjects and departments. We occasionally went way beyond the subjects that are normally part of this debate. One
<col>100</col>
noble Lord mentioned the Gulf. The subject of housing was mentioned. That may be more a matter for my noble friend Lady Blatch when she speaks on Monday in the debate on the environment and transport. I am sure that noble Lords do not expect me to cover every point raised, especially as many of them relate to legislation which will come before us later. Those points can no doubt properly be made in the context of those Bills. I shall try to answer as many points as I can. I give the assurance that I shall write to noble Lords on the points that I do not cover, which I imagine will be the vast majority because of the number of cases that were put before us. I have listened to every speaker and noted every point that has been made.<lb/>
I shall try to deal by department with matters that have been mentioned. I intend to touch briefly on education, because, as the noble Lord, Lord Carter, pointed out, we are shortly to debate that subject. I shall then touch on health and the arts briefly, the various Bills covered by the Home Office and last, and by no means least, merely because it happens to be the department that I have the honour to represent, the Department of Social Security.<lb/>
I turn to education, a matter raised by various noble Lords. I should like to say a word or two in addition to what my noble and learned friend said about the new teachers' pay machinery. The proposal was broadly welcomed by various noble Lords.<lb/>
The Government's proposals for new teachers' pay machinery will restore teachers' negotiating rights. That is what most of the unions and the employers wanted. They also provide for individual LEAs and the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools to opt out of the national arrangements and determine the pay and conditions of their teachers locally where they think that will better enable them to meet local circumstances and needs.<lb/>
The proposals offer full and fair opportunities for negotiation between teachers and their employers, and a means to resolve deadlock if the negotiators cannot agree. They acknowledge the interests of employers, teachers and government in the determination of teachers' pay. They afford a basis for the peaceful resolution of questions of pay and conditions, and their adaptation to the changes which face our schools in the 1990s.<lb/>
As I said, noble Lords will have an opportunity to debate the details of the proposals fully when the legislation is brought before the House, and during the debate that we are to have in two or three weeks' time.<lb/>
It has been alleged by various noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Ritchie, that there is severe under-resourcing of education. Perhaps I may remind him that spending per pupil in primary and secondary schools has risen by some 40 per cent. in real terms since 1979&#x2013;80. I shall take just one item: spending on books and equipment. That has risen from some &#x00A3;20 per head per primary and secondary pupil in 1979&#x2013;80 to &#x00A3;49 per pupil in 1988&#x2013;89; the ratio
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0090"/>
<col>101</col>
of pupils to teachers in primary and secondary education has fallen from 18.7:1 in 1979&#x2013;80 to 17:1 now.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Carter, mentioned a number of detailed points upon which I shall not touch now but about which I shall write to him. I can say only that a t present we have no plans to introduce vouchers.<lb/>
I shall make just one comment on the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Pearson and his tribute to the Council for National Academic Awards. I share his views on the outstanding role it has played over the past 25 years in maintaining and enhancing the quality of higher education. He referred to the review of its role. I understand that my right honour able friend the Secretary of State has consulted widely on the recommendations and is currently considering his response.<lb/>
I turn now to the Department of Health and the various reforms of the NHS. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor outlined the steps now being taken to improve the quality of health and social services through the introduction of the reforms of the NHS, which I am pleased that my noble friend Lady Eccles welcomed, and the identification of health priorities and setting targets for them. That is a significant programme of action. We have received 66 applications for NHS trust status which are awaiting approval from the Secretary of State for Health, and 350 applications for GP fund holding are being considered. Major efforts are being made to ensure the readiness of the NHS contractual system which will come into effect from April next year. We can look forward to a new style NHS: one which is responsive to the needs of patients; one which provides greater satisfaction and reward for those employed in the service; one which has consistently received a real term increase in financial support throughout the period of this Government; and one which is working to improve the health of the population.<lb/>
Both the noble Lord, Lord Harris, and the noble Lord, Lord Carter, referred briefly to the report by what used to be called NAHA and is now, I understand, called NAHAT relating to bed closures. NAHAT claimed that bed closures constitute the one barometer of hospital provision universally recognised. The figures that the report quotes take no account of the fact that while some beds have closed others have opened or are in the pipeline. It also takes no account of the fact that, as mentioned in the very informed speech of a medical professional, my noble friend Lord McColl, it is activity levels that matter and not bed numbers where patient care is concerned. Similarly NAHAT concedes that bed closures, both temporary and permanent, mostly occur for medical or policy reasons rather than as a response to financial pressures
Perhaps I may take up one other point on waiting lists. My noble friend Lady Hooper dealt with this very well at Question Time only recently. She made the important point that should be repeated again and
<col>102</col>
again that it is not the waiting lists that are important but the waiting time. Waiting times are lessening and improving.<lb/>
I move to the subject of government funding of the arts. I welcome the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Donaldson and Lord Morris of Castle Morris. I regret that I shall not be visiting either the bakelite museum in Dulwich or the bagpipe museum in Newcastle. My noble friend Lady Faithfull mentioned the mousetrap museum and similarly I have no plans at present to visit that museum, wherever it might be. I have heard that there is a museum of barbed wire somewhere in America. Possibly that shows the ingenuity of man in finding new items to collect and in which to take an interest.<lb/>
The Government's aim is to encourage public access to and appreciation and enjoyment of the arts and the nation's cultural heritage. They will keep up their support and create conditions in which the arts can develop. The three-year funding programmes, which the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, welcomed, have provided the means to implement the policy and the assurance that the Government are honouring their commitments. They have given and are giving arts bodies the incentive to plan ahead and the opportunity to increase resources overall for development and growth. However, I must stress that it is a matter of resources; there have not been cuts, we have seen a growth of 48 per cent. in real terms since 1979&#x2013;80. However much we provide, I am sure that noble Lords and individual bodies will always want more; but we must recognise that everything for which each organisation or body asks will not necessarily be met.<lb/>
I turn now to various subjects that we could refer to loosely as Home Office matters. Drug trafficking and misuse were not discussed a great deal by noble Lords in the debate, but it would be worth saying a word or two about them here because the gracious Speech referred to the Government's vigorous efforts to combat the evils of drug trafficking and misuse. I wish to emphasise how wide-ranging these efforts are.<lb/>
Strong powers already exist for the confiscation of the profits of domestic drug trafficking. We have taken the lead in negotiating multilateral and bilateral agreements to complement these powers at the international level. We hosted the world ministerial drugs summit last spring at which 126 countries reaffirmed their commitment to tackling both the trafficking and the demand for drugs. At the summit too we announced the creation of the United Kingdom demand reduction task force as a practical demonstration of our commitment to help other countries tackle their drug problems.<lb/>
Within Britain we are going ahead with the establishment of 20 teams working with the community in inner cities and other at-risk areas against the threat posed by drug misuse. These and other initiatives take place against the backdrop of the unremitting work carried out by the police, customs, teachers and health workers against the trafficking and misuse of drugs. I know that the House will join me in paying tribute to their work.<lb/>

On the Criminal Justice Bill, I welcome what I took to be partial support from the noble Lords, Lord Mishcon and Lord Harris, for the Bill. As my noble and learned friend said in opening the debate some hours ago, the Bill is largely based on the proposals in the White Paper published in February. These were broadly welcomed by most of those who commented on it. When the Bill is published, its general tenor will, I think, come as no surprise to most people.<lb/>
The White Paper itself should be regarded as a development of our thinking on the way in which the criminal justice system treats offenders rather than a completely new departure. The proposals also to a large extent build on the existing sentencing principles which the Court of Appeal has developed. As to sentencing, the White Paper developed the ideas canvassed in the Green Paper <i>Punishment, Custody and the Community,</i> published in July 1988. As to parole, it took up many of the recommendations in the report of the committee that reviewed the operation of the parole system in England and Wales. This was published in November 1988. My noble and learned friend has explained in fairly general terms how the Bill will deal with these issues.<lb/>
Following my noble and learned friend, I am afraid that I cannot go into points of detail on the Bill. Nevertheless, I shall try to respond to some of the points made by noble Lords within that constraint. Both the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon and the noble Lord, Lord Harris, took the Government very much to task over the state of the prisons. We feel that state will undoubtedly be helped by the proposals which the Criminal Justice Bill will contain to divert offenders from custody. We feel that the Bill will help to ensure that many more minor and less serious offenders serve their sentences in the community. The new order combining probation and community service, for example, could divert 4,000 offenders from custody.<lb/>
I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that the probation service will be given resources to cope with the additional offenders. Following the Autumn Statement of my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, there will be an extra 360 probation service staff next year, and a further 480 by the end of 1993&#x2013;94.<lb/>
I also listened to the Autumn Statement repeated in this House. I noticed a sense of sadness in the House when the Statement mentioned that the prison building programme is being scaled down a little. This reflects the success of our policy so far in diverting offenders from custody and the intended effects of the Criminal Justice Bill's proposals. Nevertheless, 13 new prisons remain in the programme, which should meet the demand for places. An extra &#x00A3;50 million will be spent in 1991&#x2013;92 to improve the prisons' estate, especially following the Strangeways incident. The intention is that 75 per cent. of prison places will have access to integral sanitation by 1993&#x2013;94. I should also stress that expenditure on the prison system has risen by 100 per cent. in real terms since 1979. So the Government have a record of providing resources to meet the perceived needs. Both noble Lords also asked
<col>104</col>
whether we would introduce legally enforceable minimum standards. As I have said, the Government are succeeding in improving physical conditions through a greatly expanded programme of new building and refurbishment. The plans for this work take account of the need to reduce overcrowding, as far as is practical, and to provide access to sanitation. Particular emphasis is placed on work that is designed to raise standards of hygiene.<lb/>
The matter of a code is one of the issues which I understand the Woolf Inquiry has taken evidence on. We shall consider the views of Lord Justice Woolf, but the mere existence of a new code would not necessarily alter anything. The Government's view is that it is more effective to set out clear priorities to reduce overcrowding, to increase the proportion of cells with integral sanitation and to continue to extend regime opportunities by increasing the number of hours that prisoners are usefully occupied in work or recreation.<lb/>
I turn now to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, on whether the Criminal Justice Bill will include provisions on mentally handicapped persons who are unfit to plead. I am glad that the noble Lord is looking forward to the Bill. I shall pass his comments on to my noble friend Lord Ferrers, who will welcome the noble Lord's involvement in the Bill as he is a distinguished former Permanent Secretary in the Home Office. The noble Lord will see the Bill soon as I understand that it is to be published tomorrow. He will have an opportunity, as will others, to table amendments in due course if he thinks it is right to do so.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, mentioned the judgment of the European Court in the case of <i>Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell.</i> We are urgently considering our response to that judgment. I can only say that we shall announce our conclusions in due course. The noble Earl, Lord Longford, mentioned the position of mentally disordered offenders in the criminal justice system. The Government seek to ensure that mentally disordered offenders receive the most appropriate and timely placement. Our aim is to ensure that in suitable cases they are dealt with without resort to the courts or, failing that, the penal system. We recognise that there is scope to increase the level of diversion. This can best be effected&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02821"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister repeat that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02822"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, our aim is to ensure that in suitable cases they are dealt with without resort to the courts or, failing that, the penal system. We recognise that there is scope to increase the level of diversion. This can best be effected by increasing local awareness of non-custodial options and encouraging closer and more effective working relationships between all the professional agencies and individuals involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02823"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the noble Lord appreciate that there are hundreds of such people going through the criminal justice system and that no one wants them? In particular, the National Health Service will not accept those people. The result
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0092"/>
<col>105</col>
of that is that they get sucked into prison. What specifically are the Government going to do? Expressions of good will are, unhappily, no solution to this problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02824"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can tell the noble Lord that the Home Office has recently issued guidance to the courts, the police, the probation service and other bodies on how to deal with mentally disordered persons who commit offences. The guidance has the full support of the Department of Health and has been circulated to both health and social services authorities. The Government's policy aims to ensure that people with mental disorders who are suitable for and would benefit from care in the community should receive such care. However, it was never intended that all mentally disordered offenders should be accommodated in the community. Some would certainly not be suitable for such a placement and each individual case has to be considered on its merits, taking account of the clinical judgment and the need to ensure the safety of the public. No mentally disordered person detained in hospital should be discharged from the hospital until the strict criteria laid down in the Mental Health Act are met. No patient should be discharged until proper care and attention while he is in the community have been arranged.<lb/>
I now turn to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Allen, who spoke of crime statistics and mentioned the potential weakness of all forms of crime statistics. He praised the British crime survey, which to date has been carried out in 1982, 1984 and 1988. We accept that its findings have been of great value and we have no plans to discontinue it. However, large-scale services are costly. Although we should like to mount a fourth sweep in 1992, finding the money will not be easy and we may be forced to defer plans for a year or so.<lb/>
I turn now to charities. The noble Lords, Lord Allen of Abbeydale and Lord Houghton of Sowerby, asked when there would be a charities Bill. We remain committed to the proposals contained in the White Paper entitled <i>Charities: a Framework for the Future</i> which we published in May 1989. Equally, it remains our hope to introduce legislation within the lifetime of this Parliament. However, this is a complex area of law and it is right that we should not be in too much of a hurry to proceed.<lb/>
I now turn to the War Crimes Bill. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said:
<quote>"The War Crimes Bill will be introduced in identical terms to the Bill which was refused a Second Reading in your Lordships' House last Session".</quote>
My noble and learned friend also said:
<quote>"In reintroducing this Bill, we shall be seeking to secure the support for it of both Houses of Parliament".</quote>
I shall not add anything to what my noble and learned friend said on that occasion, nor shall I rehearse the arguments for or against that Bill. However, I wish to make one brief point about the Parliament Acts.<lb/>
Under the terms of the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1945, the House of Commons may suggest amendments to a Bill which has been reintroduced following a defeat in the House of Lords in the
<col>106</col>
previous Session. Such amendments are not inserted in the Bill but are sent to this House with the Bill after it has completed all its stages in another place. If this House finds the amendments acceptable, they are treated as amendments made by the House of Lords and agreed by the House of Commons. Should the House of Lords once again reject the Bill, it will pass into law without the suggested amendments.<lb/>
I now conclude my remarks on what I referred to as Home Office matters. The Maintenance Enforcement Bill should not be confused with the Child Maintenance Bill. I believe that both my noble kinsman Lord Russell and the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, confused the two Bills. The Maintenance Enforcement Bill will, in our judgment, make an immediate and practical contribution to making the present maintenance system work better. It will ensure that creditors receive their maintenance regularly, which can be as important as the amount of maintenance ordered. The Bill is focused on the short term, and accordingly complements the Government's wider initiative to reform the whole maintenance system. It highlights the importance which we attach to making parental responsibility a reality.<lb/>
Turning now to the last department that I intend to cover, I shall start with the Child Maintenance Bill &#x2014;not to be confused with the Maintenance Enforcement Bill. The current system of obtaining maintenance payments for children is fragmented, inconsistent, often slow and ineffective. For example, only 30 per cent. of lone mothers and 3 per cent. of lone fathers receive maintenance regularly, and over three-quarters of a million lone parents and their children depend on income support. Reform is long overdue.<lb/>
The Government are convinced that the proposals which will be contained in the Child Maintenance Bill will bring order and equity to that very complex area. The proposals in the Bill will seek to ensure that there will be an easily understood, universal formula for assessing maintenance; that the formula will produce maintenance assessments which are fair to all parties and realistically related to the costs of caring for children; that caring parents who wish to work will have the incentive to do so; and that there is a clear legal responsibility for both parents to maintain their children and that that responsibility is honoured.<lb/>
Both my noble kinsman and the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, suggested that the proposals do not strengthen responsibility but enforce it. I accept that that is the case. However, even if parents' relationships break down their responsibilities as parents continue. It is not right that they should be able to avoid those responsibilities. We are seeking to make the assessment, collection and, where necessary, enforcement of maintenance simpler and fairer.<lb/>
Various noble Lords feared that some lone parents would not wish to name the other parent. I can assure noble Lords that at present some 80 per cent. of lone mothers name the father. However, we understand that there will be circumstances in which it is entirely reasonable for the caring parent not to wish to co-operate. We are giving very careful consideration
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0093"/>
<col>107</col>
to what those circumstances may be and we shall certainly make provision for them. It is a matter that we shall be able to discuss at some length when the Bill reaches the House.<lb/>
There was also some criticism of the benefits sanction on the caring parent if she refuses to co-operate. I say "she" in this case because it is my understanding that in most cases it would be the mother, but obviously where I say "she", "he" could also be appropriate. Any sanction would apply only to the caring parent's own personal allowance and not to benefit in respect of children. The basic principle is that, just as an absent parent should not be able to throw his responsibility on to the state, so a caring parent should not be able to do so.<lb/>
Lastly, the noble Lord, Lord Carter, suggested that the only reason for making the savings is to satisfy the Treasury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02825"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that it was the main reason, not the only reason.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02826"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept the correction by the noble Lord. However, I know that he and his noble friends always mistrust the aims of the Government and seem to impute everything to the allegedly malign influence of the Treasury. The interests of the taxpayer are important. There is no reason why taxpayers, many of whom are bringing up families on modest incomes, should subsidise those who choose to avoid their responsibility. However, our real motive is to put children first and to ensure that regular maintenance payments are made through efficient and non-confrontational means.<lb/>
I know that these issues are of deep concern to your Lordships. I am sure that the House will welcome the spirit of the Government's intentions in this matter, in spite of what I have just said about the noble Lords' quibbles about the Treasury. The House will have an opportunity to debate the details of our proposals. I am certain that together we shall strive to ensure that, to adapt the title of the White Paper, children really do come first.<lb/>
I have now been speaking for some 30 minutes but perhaps I may briefly say a few words about benefits for disabled people. I am grateful for the partial welcome that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, gave to the new disability Bill which will be introduced in time. The introduction of new disability benefits demonstrates the Government's continuing commitment to improving the position of disabled people, building on our already substantial achievements. Since taking office we have increased spending by &#x00A3;4 billion, which is an increase of almost 100 per cent. in real terms. The number of people able to claim disability benefits has increased dramatically. To quote only two benefits, numbers receiving attendance allowance have increased by over 300 per cent. and numbers receiving mobility allowance by nearly 650 per cent.<lb/>
We have also made substantial increases for carers. By extending invalid care allowance to married women we increased the number of claimants from 5,000 to 111,000. In the uprating statement the
<col>108</col>
Government announced that the carers' earnings disregard will increase from &#x00A3;20 to &#x00A3;30 a week. And from this autumn, we have introduced in the income-related benefits the carer premium, which is payable on top of other premiums. We have also announced a further improvement: that the premium can continue for eight weeks after caring ceases.<lb/>
These measures exemplify the Government's care and concern for disabled people, as do the new benefits proposed by this Bill, which would add a further &#x00A3;300 million to the very substantial amount &#x2014;more that &#x00A3;8 billion&#x2014;already being spent. They also carry forward our expressed aim of targeting resources on those most in need, in particular people disabled from birth or early in life, who have had least opportunity to make provision from earning and saving. This Government's record on disabled people is one to be proud of. The proposals in the Bill carry this still further.<lb/>
Perhaps I may deal briefly with the question asked by my noble friend Lord Swinfen. I note his remarks; indeed, we recently met and discussed this subject. I have to tell him now what I told him then. The future of the severe disablement allowance residence test is still a matter which we are considering in the broader context of arrangements for disability benefits generally.<lb/>
Over the past 11 years this Government have proved that they have the energy, determination and vision to tackle some of Britain's most intractable problems head on. As a radical, reforming government we know and accept that there is unfinished business. Today a more self-confident, meritocratic society rightly demands higher standards from public services and greater opportunities in their lives. We want to see that those demands are satisfied. This Government have been sustained for more than a decade by an understanding of, and sympathy with, the aspirations of families throughout Britain. Our plans for the next Session show that we remain in tune with the people of this country.<lb/>
We want an even more responsive, efficient health service that is able to meet the growing demands we all make of it. We understand that parents demand higher standards and more say as to how, and where, their children are educated. We are determined to do more to protect the public from violent criminals. And we want to keep less serious offenders out of gaol and away from the malign influence of hardened criminals. We will end the scandal of only three in 10 lone parents receiving the regular maintenance payments which are theirs by right with our plans for a new Child Support Agency. We are continuing the major shake-up of the benefits for disabled people, removing barriers to work and creating a system more attuned to the needs and circumstances of disabled people.<lb/>
The Queen's Speech underlines the continuing dynamism of this Government. We remain, as we have throughout these past 11 years, determined to meet the real concerns of people throughout this country. Our proposals for the next Session are designed to do precisely that.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Satellite Broadcasting</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02843"><member>Lord Donoughue</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02844">Whether and how they propose (a) to ensure that no non-EC national controls 50 per cent. of a British satellite service and (b) to prevent any newspaper proprietor from owning more than 20 per cent. of a British television franchise.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02845"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, under the Broadcasting Act of 1981 and under Schedule 2 to the Broadcasting Act 1990, which comes into force on 1st January 1991, non-European Community nationals are prohibited from controlling a domestic satellite service. Schedule 2 also limits newspaper interests in a Channel 3 or Channel 5 licence to 20 per cent. We intend to make supplementary rules also limiting newspaper interests in domestic satellite services to 20 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02846"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his Answer, although I am not quite clear where it will leave Mr. Murdoch. Perhaps I may ask him this precise question. Exactly when did the Government know of the proposed merger between Sky and BSB? Were the relevant Minister, the Home Secretary in regard to the broadcasting industry, and the relevant authority, the IBA, informed at the time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02847"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at four o'clock on Friday afternoon officials were told that it was likely that an announcement would be made affecting BSB and Sky. At nine o'clock on that evening both BBC News and Sky News said that the two companies were merging. I understand that at three-thirty in the morning of Saturday the legal deal was signed. At ten o'clock on the Saturday my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State spoke to Mr. Andrew Knight, chairman of News International. I think I am right in saying that the IBA was not consulted in advance; but that of course is a matter between the IBA, Sky and BSB.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02848"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister deny the statements made in the newspapers that the Prime Minister and 10 Downing Street were alerted to this matter several days before, on Monday, 29th October?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02849"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what I said to the noble Lord was that my officials were informed formally at four o'clock on Friday. I understand that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister had a conversation about a number of matters with Mr. Murdoch earlier; that he said that the companies were in difficulties and that the possibility of a merger was in the offing. But that was only a matter of informative conversation and not an official indication.</membercontribution></p>
<col>112</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02850"><member>Lord Thomson of Monifieth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that what he has just said raises very serious issues indeed? Does he not recognise that the Prime Minister was informed of this impending merger, with all its implications, while the Broadcasting Bill was still before Parliament? Had Parliament been aware of this and not been kept in deliberate ignorance, the decisions that we took might well have been different. Is it not too serious a matter to be dealt with simply by Question and Answer across the Floor of the House? Should not the Government make time available for the matter to he debated properly?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02851"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am merely responding to a Question that was put down. If the noble Lord considers that there ought to be another method of dealing with the situation, he is entitled to take such action as he wishes.<lb/>
With respect, I believe that the noble Lord is mistaken. This was a conversation&#x2014;as I understand it; I was not privy to it&#x2014;between Mr. Murdoch and the Prime Minister on a number of questions in which he indicated that Sky and BSB were both in difficulties and that there might at some juncture have to be some form of merger. It was not an indication that a merger was imminent. If I may say so, the noble Lord is also mistaken on this. The Broadcasting Act 1990 does not as yet affect the merger which has just taken place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02852"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl not agree that the action proposed is a take-over by Sky rather than a merger? Does he also agree that it must result in less competition, less choice and lower quality television for British viewers, which is contrary to the Government's intentions as stated in the White Paper and in the Broadcasting Act 1990? Was the Prime Minister aware of that when she obviously gave her blessing to Mr. Murdoch?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02853"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness really is putting words into the mouth of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. She never said anything about a blessing. She was informed as a matter of conversation that the two companies were in difficulty. I believe that the noble Baroness is mistaken. It shows what a highly speculative business satellite broadcasting is, and if, as the noble Baroness states, it will result in less choice, it would have resulted in even less choice had both companies gone bust. I am bound to point out to her that Schedule 11 to the Broadcasting Act 1990 permits the existing DBS contracts to be replaced by a licence in 1993. The Broadcasting Act 1990 does not affect that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02854"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must return to part of the question to which the Minister did not reply. Having read the papers and the reports on the matter, and the acknowledgment from 10 Downing Street that the subject was discussed with the Prime Minister, is it right for anyone to draw the conclusion that if the Prime Minister had objected there would not have been an announcement some days later and that action would have been taken by the relevant Ministers who were not informed?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0096"/>
<col>113</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02855"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness can read what she likes into newspaper reports but I doubt whether the reporters were present at the conversation. I was not and therefore I cannot comment on that issue. The merger took place under the auspices of the Broadcasting Act 1981 and not the Broadcasting Act 1990, and therefore the companies were entitled to do what they did. The 1990 Act will begin to bite only in 1993.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02856"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, is the Minister aware that the entire matter has grave implications? Can he say whether the meeting at 10 Downing Street took place at the request of Mr. Murdoch in order to discuss matters about which the Prime Minister had been given proper prior notice? In view of the substance of the conversation, will the Minister say whether anyone from his department was present to advise the Prime Minister, especially in view of the fact that the Broadcasting Bill was then going through this House? I realise that the Minister may be in a difficult position, but it may help the Government if he can clarify the situation so that there is no doubt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02857"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first of the noble Lord's questions is no and the answer to his second question is no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02858"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister ready to let the House know whether the Prime Minister, having had the formal or informal information from Mr. Murdoch about a matter of great public interest and about a Bill which Parliament had been discussing for more than a year, passed on the information to her colleague the Home Secretary?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02859"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my understanding is that the subject arose during the course of a conversation about a number of matters. When officially there was a likelihood of a merger, Sky Television got in touch with my right honourable friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02860"><member>Lord Wade of Chorlton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the merger of the two companies is most important and beneficial and that it was wrong that many shareholders' funds were being lost through unnecessary competition? Does he further agree that what has happened is in the best interests of the public, the investors and all those who wish to see good television?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02861"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his comments, with which I agree. It is important to remember that the venture was highly speculative and that both companies were running into trouble. If both companies had been allowed to go bust there would have been a loss of 1,000 jobs.<lb/>
I commend to your Lordships the remark made by Mr. Andrew Knight in a letter to <i>The Times</i> published today. He said:
<quote>"As for Mr. Murdoch's television interest, he now controls just half of a deadlocked company, heavily in debt, whose programmes will be subject to regulatory control, and whose viewing audience is at best 3 per cent. of that controlled by the BBC and ITV".</quote>
I do not believe that to be a coveted monopoly.</membercontribution></p>
<col>114</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02862"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister clarify his comment that if any organisation threatens the Government that it may be going bust it will be given licence to thwart the desire of Parliament and, if necessary, to get round the policy of Her Majesty's Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02863"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, is mistaken. Perhaps I may explain the matter as succinctly as possible. At present the two companies are contractors to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. Under the Broadcasting Act 1981 they are permitted to merge provided that they have the approval of the IBA. That issue is governed by questions such as whether the company should be controlled by another company based outside the European Community and whether there should be newspaper interests which have had or will lead to results that could be contrary to the public interest. That is what the IBA must decide and what it is now deciding. The fact that the Broadcasting Bill 1990 has gone through Parliament does not affect this merger at this time, but it will when the company becomes a licensee in 1993.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02864"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are not the public policy implications of the merger currently under consideration by the IBA? Will they not again come under public consideration by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and probably by the licensing authority when it comes into effect? Furthermore, is it not wise not to fish in troubled waters in the meantime?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02865"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02866"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to that extraordinary unparliamentary guffawing noise from the Opposition, I can say only that the observation made by my noble and learned friend, particularly the latter part, was extremely apposite. It would be bad to fish in troubled waters&#x2014;not that the waters are particularly troubled for the Government&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02867"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02868"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the IBA is considering this matter, as is the Office of Fair Trading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02869"><member>Lord Ardwick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for a long time it has seemed probable that Sky and BSB would be driven into a reluctant merger. Did the Government frame the legislation so as to make the conditions of the two companies incompatible in order to deter that or did they not notice that point which would arise, if not now, then in 1993?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02870"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government framed the legislation particularly to deal with domestic satellite broadcasting, which has five frequencies which are internationally allocated to the United Kingdom, and non-domestic satellite services, which are totally different and which can number up to 30 or even 40 different services. In the Broadcasting Act the Government sought to set the scene aright so that those companies which wished to participate could do so.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Electricity Industry: Wage Settlement</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02871">2.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02872"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02873">What is their attitude to the next wage settlement in the electricity industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02874"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the wage settlement is a matter for the electricity industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02875"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is hardly an answer to the Question. I am asking what is the Government's attitude. Is it not the case that over the previous two years the wage settlement in the electricity industry has been well above the inflation rate? Is the noble Lord aware that it is expected that in the next agreement it will again be well above the inflation rate? Is that not connected directly with the Government's desire to privatise the electricity industry and avoid trouble while that privatisation is being conducted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02876"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect, I did answer the Question. This matter is for the electricity industry. Of course general levels of pay are of interest to the Government, but negotiations are squarely a matter for the industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02877"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that as a former employee of the electricity supply industry and having had quite a lot to do with the negotiating process in that industry, in my view wages and salaries in that industry&#x2014;and I hope the noble Lord will agree with this&#x2014;are certainly a matter for discussion and decision between the trade unions and the management of that industry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02878"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I defer to the noble Lord's experience in the matter. However, I do not see that that has a bearing on the Government's attitude towards pay and negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02879"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the electricity industry is about to be privatised on the market? Is it not the case that it would be extremely damaging in the event of a flotation that there should be any form of industrial dispute? Does the no ale Lord seriously believe that that is not a consideration which the management of the industry bears in mind when settling wages?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02880"><member>Lordl Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept that any dispute is damaging but, as matters stand, it is beyond the Government to take part in those negotiations. It is a matter for the industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02881"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not suggesting that the Government are going to take part in a settlement. I ask again what is the Government's attitude. They have expressed their attitude towards wage settlements in a large number of industries. They have expressed their attitude towards wage settlements generally and have urged settlements to be kept below the level of inflation. What is their attitude towards a settlement in the electricity industry in view of the fact that that is very clearly linked directly to the privatisation of that industry?</membercontribution></p>
<col>116</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02882"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I could not have been clearer than I was in my original Answer. The wage settlement is a matter for the electricity industry and, therefore, the Government are distanced from those negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02883"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question relates to the Government's attitude. Arc we to understand from the noble Lord's reply that the Government have no attitude whatever towards this industry and that this is a matter for the electricity industry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02884"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note the noble Lord's remark. As I say, the Government have an attitude towards pay negotiations which is well known to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Soviet Army: Numerical Strength</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02885">2.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02886"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02887">What is their latest estimate of the numerical strength of the Russian Army, the number of nuclear missiles and the tonnage of material usable for chemical warfare possessed by Russia; and whether these figures represent an increase or a decrease on comparable figures for five and two years ago respectively.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02888"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (The Earl of Arran)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, our latest estimate of the current numerical size of the Soviet Army is 2.2 million; namely, a 20 per cent. reduction over the past five years. The number of Soviet strategic nuclear missiles is currently assessed at 1,398 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 924 sea launched ballistic missiles. These figures show little change since 1985. Finally, we continue to assess that the Soviet stockpile of chemical warfare agents is several times greater than the figure of 50,000 tonnes declared by the Soviets themselves in 1987.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02889"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for those somewhat disturbing figures, is not the inevitable conclusion that this country and its allies should be very cautious indeed about believing that this is an opportune occasion for a peace dividend?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02890"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is correct. Even disregarding Eastern European nations, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union alone retains a considerable advantage over NATO. That is why under our <i>Options for Change: A Study,</i> we are pursuing a policy of both caution and realism. The details of that are being worked on at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02891"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while noting what the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, said, is the Minister aware that we welcome the signing of the CFE treaty on 19th November? Taking account of the great changes in Europe, notably the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, is there not a case for proceeding with urgency towards a second CFE treaty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02892"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords welcome the signing of the CFE treaty in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0098"/>
<col>117</col>
Paris on 19th November which, as your Lordships will know, is next Monday. Furthermore, it is very much hoped that there will be follow-on negotiations almost immediately after that, mostly concerning manpower reduction levels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02893"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while acknowledging that the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, has asked a vitally serious Question, will the Minister acknowledge that in addition to the points made by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, in the past few months there have been statements by Mr. Gorbachev which are encouraging? Would it not be possible for our Government and our allies to make a direct approach to Mr. Gorbachev to make a reality of his suggestions as well as our suggestions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02894"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Government in line with all NATO governments are continually striving to have and, indeed, are being successful in having negotiations with Mr. Gorbachev, such as the CFE negotiations and the CSBM negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02895"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will her Majesty's Government make it clear to Mr. Gorbachev that his peaceful intentions would carry a great deal of weight if he did not continue to impose on the struggling Russian economy that enormous defence expenditure for which no explanation has yet been given?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02896"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand very well the point made by my noble friend. Indeed, that point is being stressed to Mr. Gorbachev as frequently as possible in line with negotiations now taking place and future negotiations.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Kuwait: Population Structure</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02897">2.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02898"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02899">Whether it is the case that only 28 per cent. of the inhabitants of Kuwait are Kuwaitis, and if so whether this is being taken into account in deciding whether or not to launch a military attack.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02900"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, according to Kuwaiti statistics 28 per cent. of the inhabitants of Kuwait before the invasion were Kuwaitis. Since the Iraqi invasion thousands of Iraqi servicemen and civilians have entered the country and tens of thousands of Kuwaiti citizens have fled. The actual population of Kuwait now, and the proportion of Kuwaiti nationals, is not known.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02901"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a most unusual situation in any country in which, to say the least of it, the majority of the people living in the country are not nationals of that country? Is it not the case, as is suggested in my Question, that that consideration must affect the question of whether it is possible to launch a successful military attack?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02902"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think what the noble Lord said in the latter part of his Question necessarily follows. The point is that before the invasion of Kuwait, the Kuwaitis were able to
<col>118</col>
decide who lived in their country. They have now been invaded by Iraq and have no means of stopping the Iraqis coming in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02903"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is a growing feeling in this country, especially among the Churches, that the evil which could be released by offensive operations further than those already undertaken with forced sanctions would be much greater than the peaceful pursuance of sanctions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02904"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not certain that I detect the growing feeling to which the right reverend Prelate refers. Having read an article in one newspaper this morning, I am not even sure that it is a view universally held within the Church. The point is that Iraq must be made to leave Kuwait. It must be made to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions which provide for unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02905"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that his last reply will certainly meet with a happy response from this side of the House? It does not matter a tuppenny damn who are Iraqis and who are not. Saddam Hussein has no right to walk into an undefended country like Kuwait and tear it apart.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02906"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right. Fortunately that is what the United Nations decided in many resolutions passed since the illegal invasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02907"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that the total obliteration, without the smallest justification, of a recognised member of the United Nations by another, if it were allowed to pass without resistance, would bring the whole fabric of international law into disrepute? Would not the Churches be a great deal more respected in this country if they realised the clear moral and legal implications of what has happened?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02908"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with what my noble and learned friend said. I cannot answer for the Churches. As I said in an earlier answer, I do not believe it is a view universally held by the Church. However, Kuwait must be freed of the Iraqi presence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02909"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while we are all agreed that the Iraqis must be forced to withdraw from Kuwait, the Question sought to point out the difficulties of bringing that about by military attack. It was intended to suggest to the Government that they should persist with sanctions and other means rather than begin a military attack, the consequences of which might be much worse than is now appreciated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02910"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, obviously sanctions must be allowed time to work. Nobody has ever said otherwise. However, your Lordships will have an opportunity to debate this matter in full tomorrow afternoon. I answered the point raised by the noble Lord in his Question. Further debate would be better in the context of a full debate tomorrow.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02912"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although Munich was before my time, from all that I have read there seems to be a distinct similarity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02913"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may say to the Minister, in the light of the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Annan, that the statement by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, as a sinner who repented from his posture at the time of Munich is greatly welcomed on this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02923">Debate resumed on the Motion moved on Wednesday last by Lord Kimball&#x2014;namely, That a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02924">"Most Gracious Sovereign&#x2014;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament".</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02925">3.6 pm</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02926"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that the House is having this opportunity so early in the new Session to debate the subjects of transport and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0100"/>
<col>121</col>
the environment. It is timely to debate them so soon after the publication of the Government's White Paper on the Environment, <i>This Common Inheritance.</i> For my own part, I am particularly glad to have this opportunity to explain the Government's transport policy, and especially how it links into the Government's policies on the environment, with which my noble friend Lady Blatch will deal in greater detail later.<lb/>
The Government are pursuing a balanced transport strategy. We do not seek to determine which form of transport people should use. We believe that ordinary people are the best judges of the form of transport that is most suitable for them. Therefore, we want to give people greater choice, and so we are seeking to improve all forms of transport so that each can make its proper contribution to a safer, more environmentally sensitive and more efficient transport system.<lb/>
We are bringing about improvements, both through investment and through liberalising transport services. In aviation, the Civil Aviation Authority is investing heavily in improved air traffic control facilities. The United Kingdom Government have been in the vanguard in pressing for liberalisation both in Europe and further afield. We have enjoyed considerable success in removing layers of pointless regulations and replacing them with arrangements within which airlines can compete fairly.<lb/>
I should now like to speak at slightly greater length about land transport. In pursuit of the Government's balanced transport policy, we are investing in the strengths of both road and rail. A year ago we announced a step change in the level of investment in both roads and railways. This year, as announced in the Autumn Statement by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week, we have made further increases, especially in the railways.<lb/>
British Rail will be investing more than &#x00A3;4 billion over the next three years, its highest level for 30 years, and 58 per cent. more in real terms than in the previous three years. It has been suggested in some quarters that this increase is all very well but that it is on top of historically low levels of investment. I must point out that that is totally incorrect. Railway investment in the last three years has been at a higher level, in real terms, than at any time since the war, apart from the great modernisation between the mid-1950s and the mid-1960s.<lb/>
It is on top of those already high levels that there will now be this further large increase. British Rail will be able to go ahead with its ambitious programme of investment in Channel Tunnel services, in new trains for South-East commuters, in further new rolling stock for InterCity and provincial services, and in the modernisation of the trainload freight business. A total of over 1,500 new passenger coaches will be delivered during the next three years. The settlement also provides British Rail with &#x00A3;330 million for specific safety measures&#x2014;all that it asked for.<lb/>
The settlement will allow London Transport to invest up to &#x00A3;3 billion over the next three years, an
<col>122</col>
increase on the previous three of over 90 per cent. in real terms. The Government will be providing &#x00A3;2.5 billion in grant over that period. The highlights of LT's investment programme include East-West Crossrail, linking Paddington to Liverpool Street, the Jubilee Line extension to Stratford via Docklands and Greenwich; the complete modernisation of the Central Line with new trains and signalling; reconstruction of Angel station; and refurbishment of trains. London Underground will invest approaching &#x00A3;400 milion in further safety improvements over the three-year period.<lb/>
Improving the road network to meet the needs of the economy, by providing good communications within the country and with the Continent of Europe, remains a major government priority. Investment in trunk roads and motorways will rise to &#x00A3;5.6 billion over the next three years, an increase of about 25 per cent. in real terms compared with the previous three years.<lb/>
This year's settlement will provide additional resources to help us to make better, more efficient use of our existing network. The additional funds will allow a fast start to be made on motorway widening. This method of increasing road capacity can in most cases be carried out more quickly than building new roads and with less impact on the countryside. We shall be able to get ahead with red routes to ease the flow of traffic in London. We shall be putting more money into developing driver information systems which will tell motorists about the road conditions ahead and alternative routes to take. Work will also continue on bypasses and relief roads. There are over 150 projects in our current programme.<lb/>
The Government, in their commitment to providing an efficient transport infrastructure, also recognise that those whose homes are affected should be treated as generously as possible. Improvements to compensation are proposed in the Planning and Compensation Bill<lb/>
Before I leave the subject of transport infrastructure I should like to say just a few words about our ports. The Government will be introducing a Trust Ports Bill to enable trust ports to draw up schemes for privatisation without having to go through the cumbersome process of each promoting a private Bill. The Bill will enable the ports to enhance their development prospects through access to share capital and to diversify their businesses. It will also stimulate the development of land.<lb/>
The Bill will give the trust ports the chance to share in the opportunities open to the already privatised ABP and to take maximum advantage of the abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme. Ports are, and will continue to be, a vital link between every region of Britain and the Continent of Europe.<lb/>
We must recognise that as a nation we are now and have been for some time heavily dependent on road transport. Over 90 per cent. of passenger traffic and over 80 per cent. of goods lifted go by road. Road traffic has risen dramatically. For example, the average daily flow of vehicles on all roads in Great
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0101"/>
<col>123</col>
Britain has increased by almost 50 per cent. since 1979 That is mainly the result of prosperity. As people have become more prosperous under this Government, their mobility has improved and their desire to travel has increased. Road traffic is expected to grow further, not least because there is still great scope for higher car ownership in this country. We are still well below other developed Western countries in the car ownership league.<lb/>
However, although road transport has many advantages, it affects the environment locally, regionally and globally. At local level it creates noise and Dollution. It can also sever communities by making it difficult for people to cross the street. Regionally, road traffic contributes to acid rain and low-level ozone. At the global level, it contributes to the accumulation of carbon dioxide&#x2014;one of the major greenhouse gases about which there is now widespread international concern. The Government are certainly not complacent about those environmental effects. We are committed to civilising road transport and we are doing so through a package of measures. Let me now explain the main elements of that package.<lb/>
First, we want to encourage attractive and efficient public transport so that people have an alternative to using cars. Public transport of all kinds must attract passengers through quality, reliability and good marketing. Public transport has a particularly important role in urban areas, where there are large flows of people travelling in a similar direction. I have already mentioned our support for the current massive investment in rail.<lb/>
Some people would have us believe that if only there were more and better rail services road traffic could be significantly reduced. In fact, it is quite unrealistic to expect a major national shift from road to rail because people prize highly the convenience and flexibility of road transport and because the sheer scale of the shift required would be so massive. At present rail accounts for only about 6 or 7 per cent. of passenger traffic in Great Britain. Even a 50 per cent. increase in rail traffic would reduce road traffic by less than 5 per cent.&#x2014;less than one year's growth in road traffic, as recently experienced.<lb/>
Nevertheless, the Government certainly want to see the railways playing as full a part as possible. The completion of the Channel Tunnel presents the railways with a new opportunity; and British Rail has published its plans for through international services to serve both passengers and freight. For passengers, the railways will become much more competitive with the airlines, particularly over the relatively short distances between London, Paris and Brussels. For freight, the much greater length of through haul made possible by the tunnel will again improve rail's competitive position. Initially, BR expects to carry 6 million tonnes of freight a year through the tunnel.<lb/>
In some urban areas investment in light rail schemes may make good sense. Light rail vehicles can penetrate urban centres more extensively than heavy rail. They arc able to carry more people than buses, and more quickly where they are segregated from other traffic. Light rail may thus help to attract people
<col>124</col>
away from cars. The Government are prepared to consider grant for light rail in appropriate cases. For the Manchester Metrolink we are paying a grant of about 50 per cent. towards the estimated cost of &#x00A3;120 million.<lb/>
For many communities bus services will continue to offer the main means of public transport. Buses have the advantages of being much cheaper and more flexible than rail. The Government's policy of deregulation has encouraged the exploitation of these advantages and has led to an 18 per cent. increase in bus mileage. The Government are now particularly keen to work with the bus industry and local authorities to find ways, through better traffic management, of helping buses to provide faster and more reliable services. In London, the proposals in the forthcoming Road Traffic Bill for a red route scheme will benefit buses through the introduction of bus lanes and traffic signal priorities.<lb/>
The second main element in the Government's package of measures to civilise road transport is our effort to relieve traffic congestion. Unreliable journey times impose extra costs; and stop-start traffic is much more polluting than traffic moving freely. In some cases the best solution will be to build a bypass. We have provided, since 1979, over 100 trunk road bypasses which have provided much needed relief to local communities.<lb/>
Many more bypasses are planned, along with our major programme to widen the most heavily congested motorways. However, the Government will not provide, or encourage local authorities to provide, more road capacity simply to facilitate more car commuting into already congested urban areas. In urban areas traffic congestion can often be relieved by better traffic management, which can also help to improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists as well as public transport. I have already mentioned our red route proposals for London. These will involve severe restrictions on parking, stopping and unloading on the selected priority routes within the capital. The measures proposed on those routes will be aimed specifically at helping people and goods to move more easily, reliably and safely throughout London. In most urban areas, traffic management is the responsibility of the local authorities, but the Government are helping by sponsoring research and by issuing guidance.<lb/>
On Thursday of last week, your Lordships gave a First Reading to the New Roads and Street Works Bill. It is designed, first, to facilitate privately funded roads and, secondly, to make utilities fully responsible for their street works, improve the speed and quality of their repairs to the road surface and enable local highway authorities to co-ordinate both their own and utility street works so as to reduce the disruption they cause. It is part of a package of transport legislation, the most comprehensive for many years, which shows the Government's determination to deal with road congestion and road safety and to diversify the ways in which transport infrastructure is provided. We shall
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0102"/>
<col>125</col>
be debating that Bill very soon and I therefore propose to say nothing further to your Lordships at the present time.<lb/>
The third way in which we are civilising road traffic is by reducing vehicle emissions and noise through fiscal and regulatory action. We have introduced regulations to reduce the maximum permitted lead content of leaded petrol by two-thirds. We have encouraged the use of unleaded petrol through the favourable rate of duty. Unleaded petrol now accounts for well over a third of all the petrol sold in this country; and that proportion will rise steadily because from 1st October effectively all newly manufactured cars must be able to run on unleaded fuel.<lb/>
Regulations have been introduced to control other vehicle emissions and noise. By the end of 1992, virtually all new cars will have to be fitted with catalytic converters. That will mean a dramatic reduction in emissions of local and regional pollutants from road transport. We are now pressing the EC to adopt the strictest practicable emission standards for goods vehicles and buses. The noise a new lorry is permitted to make now is roughly half the level permitted in 1980. And we shall be looking for further progress as the Community considers another round of tightening the limits next year.<lb/>
Fourthly, and very importantly, we are seeking to encourage greater economy in the use of fuel. Unfortunately, there is no means to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, other than by burning less fuel. To a large extent, it is up to individual motorists to adopt a more responsible attitude. They can choose more economical cars. Before starting each car journey they can consider whether it is really necessary to use the car. Perhaps they could walk, or cycle, or use public transport instead. If they must drive, they should do so in a responsible fashion. Drivers can reduce fuel consumption by up to 15 per cent. simply by adopting better driving habits such as smoother acceleration. The Government warmly welcome the guidance which the AA and the RAC have prepared to encourage such improvements. And the Government are also preparing better guidance for motorists.<lb/>
We are also proposing to introduce an emissions check into the MoT test to encourage motorists to keep their engines in tune. In the Road Traffic Bill, we are proposing measures to improve the enforcement of speed limits which will bring benefits in terms of fuel economy as well as road safety. The Government will consider whether it would be appropriate to encourage greater fuel economy through changes in the taxation of fuel and vehicles.<lb/>
I should like to turn now to another area where we have taken account of environmental concerns; namely, aircraft noise. There are various well-established noise abatement measures in place at major airports, such as noise preferential routes, restrictions on night flights and noise insulation grant schemes. I should like to take the opportunity of this debate to refer to two recent developments.<lb/>
<col>126</col>
As announced in the White Paper on the environment, we are reviewing the current arrangements for dealing with aircraft noise, particularly with regard to small airfields, to ensure that they afford sufficient protection for local people. In addition, we will be examining whether there is a need for action to limit the temporary use of land for helicopter take-offs and landings.<lb/>
I am pleased to announce to the House that only a fortnight ago agreement was reached in the international civil aviation organisation on a framework of phasing out those aircraft which do not meet the latest internationally agreed noise standards. The United Kingdom has been a driving force in securing this major advance towards an improved noise climate.<lb/>
Your Lordships may recall that the Government recently implemented a ban on the addition to the UK register of these older aircraft, known as Chapter 2 types. Phasing them out over the period 1995&#x2013;2005 will substantially reduce community noise disturbance. The necessary legislation will be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity and well in advance of the operative date.<lb/>
I have spoken at some length about the contribution of transport to economic growth and how transport can contribute to the Government's environmental objectives. I should like to say, finally, just a few words about transport safety. Safety on all forms of transport is the top priority. I have already mentioned the very large sums being invested on specific safety projects by both British Rail and London Transport.<lb/>
On the roads, our target is a reduction in casualties of one third by the year 2000. In the Road Traffic Bill we shall be bringing forward major reforms of road traffic law in the light of the North Report's recommendations. The Bill is designed to improve the contribution which the law makes to road safety, through its influence on driver behaviour.<lb/>
This Government are investing record sums in transport, to improve the infrastructure in all forms of transport and to improve public transport services. We are bringing forward a wide range of measures to civilise road transport and to improve the environment. And we shall be introducing in this Session the most comprehensive package of transport legislation for many years to enable us to improve road safety, to make better use of the existing roads network and to increase the scope for the private sector to contribute towards providing new roads and developing the trust ports.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend Lord Underhill will be responding on the transport side at the conclusion of this debate.<lb/>
I hope that the House will also forgive me if I treat the environment rather more widely than it is treated
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0103"/>
<col>127</col>
in the gracious Speech. I do so for two reasons. The first is that the Queen's Speech is modest to the point of invisibility about environmental issues. The only major legislation proposed on the local government and planning front is a Planning and Compensation Bill which, I understand, is to have its First Reading this week. We shall be debating that in a couple of weeks' time. Perhaps it would be better if our detailed discussion of that Bill were postponed until then although it would be very helpful to have an introduction to its provisions from the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, when she replies to the debate.<lb/>
The other reason is that the debate has now gone very much wider than the modest legislative plans of this Government. They are facing either the last full Session of Parliament or the last Session of all. What is proposed in legislative terms is not critical to political debate in this country. What is critical now is the policies of the next Labour Government which will be in power in the 1990s. Therefore, I propose to refer to those policies rather than indulge in attacks on the dying phase of the present government.<lb/>
I wish to concentrate on two particular aspects of environmental policy. The first is the environmental issue as raised by the Government's White Paper published in September. The second is the particular issue of local government. I hasten to say that I shall not be attempting to cover all of the ground on any of these issues. My noble friend Lady Nicol will have something to say about the environment and my noble friend Lady Hollis will have things to say about local government and its finance. My noble friend Lord Dean will be making a contribution from the depths of his very extensive knowledge of housing policy.<lb/>
I wish to speak in more general terms about the Government White Paper and to consider to what extent, if at all, it is adequate to the needs of this country and of the world as a whole. My right honourable friend Gerald Kaufman described the 1983 Labour election manifesto as the longest suicide note in history. The kindest way to describe the Government's environmental White Paper is as the longest, most beautifully produced and the most recyclable damp squib ever produced by this Government and possibly by any government. Each time one looks at the policies where there is a clear need for a policy commitment, one finds a withdrawal. One finds a qualification and an "if" or a "but" rather than any real commitment to action.<lb/>
The most obvious example is global warming. This country has already been completely isolated on many occasions, and most recently last month, concerning targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases in order to prevent what is now universally acknowledged to be the very real threat of global warming. It is agreed by virtually every major developed country that if we are to bring down the rate of increase in global warming, let alone to freeze or to reduce global warming, we must have a complete freeze on emissions of greenhouse gases by, at the latest, the year 2000, and a reduction thereafter. What do the Government say? They say that there will be a freeze by the year 2005 but only if other countries adopt the same policy.<lb/>
<col>128</col>
There is not even a clear commitment to a freeze by the year 2005 let alone by the year 2000, which is an almost universally recognised international objective and which is indeed the objective and the commitment of the Labour Party.<lb/>
Let us look at the whole issue of how to encourage green behaviour, if I may put it that way, or environmentally friendly behaviour by government and by business. Here the White Paper is almost entirely silent. The only positive proposal is one which has already been blown sky high&#x2014;the proposal that there should be in each ministry concerned with environmental matters a nominated minister. It is significant, is it not, that the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Energy have nominated themselves as being the Ministers to be concerned with the environment. In other words, they want to be absolutely sure that they will not be outranked in a Cabinet committee by the Secretary of State for the Environment and that they can go their own sweet way without let or hindrance.<lb/>
The Labour Party's proposals, on the other hand, provide for an effective environmental unit in each department; in other words, an effective executive influence on the policies of these departments. We provide for an independent Environmental Protection Agency rather along the lines of the Health and Safety Executive. We propose that there should be a European environmental audit rather like the Valdez principles which your Lordships agreed only last month should be included in the Environmental Protection Act. We propose that there should be improved environmental statistics to help government and business to achieve universally recognised environmental objectives.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02929"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be fair to acknowledge that the fact that the chief Minister in that department takes on the role himself is proof that the Government attach some importance to the matter, and not the other way round, as the noble Lord appears to suggest?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02930"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I may be more cynical than the noble Lord but I rather think that the reverse is the case. I think that they are there to hold their corner and to make sure that they are not outnumbered or outranked in any Cabinet committee. I could be wrong, and it might be that with different people there could be different results. But I do not think so.<lb/>
It is well recognised by many noble Lords that Europe is a central force for improving environmental quality. All the White Paper proposes is strong monitoring of compliance with European directives. The Labour Party proposes that there should be majority voting on environmental directives to increase their effectiveness against those who might be recalcitrant. We support the European Community Environmental Charter and we support the European Community Enforcement Agency. That is a very much more positive approach to environmental issues than that taken by the White Paper.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0104"/>
<col>129</col>
I turn now to energy, which is one of the most important elements of environmental policy, as the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, recognised in his opening speech. What does the White Paper say? It says that the Government will encourage energy labelling, although we now understand from their intervention in European negotiations that they propose that there should be energy labelling only for good appliances and that there should not be any compulsion for less good appliances, which I should have thought was absolutely essential if energy labelling is to mean anything. They say that they will monitor energy efficiency standards in new buildings. They do not say that they will impose higher energy efficiency standards in new buildings but that they will monitor the energy efficiency standards that now exist.<lb/>
They also say that the work of the Energy Efficiency Office will be expanded. That is literally true, but it is not true in real terms. What has happened is that the Energy Efficiency Office has been given responsibility for the Department of Employment scheme for energy efficiency in low-cost housing. Inevitably, the budget which used to be with the Department of Employment is now with the Energy Efficiency Office. That is the only increase in the real budget of the Energy Efficiency Office. The budget for the Energy Efficiency Office, taking aside that transfer of functions, stands at &#x00A3;15 million, which is therefore a reduction of 10 per cent. in real terms. How the Government can seriously say that they are encouraging energy efficiency measures when they are cutting the budget of the Energy Efficiency Office by 10 per cent. in real terms is beyond belief.<lb/>
The Labour Party, on the other hand, says that we must have mandatory energy labelling and that it should cover bad appliances as well as good appliances. We say that there should be a continuing improvement in building standards. That is certainly technically possible and there is no reason why the Government should not support it. We say that there should be particular government support through local authority capital spending where it is environmentally friendly. We say that an Energy Efficiency Agency should be given the resources to do the job, resources which are patently being denied to the Energy Efficiency Office as things stand.<lb/>
I shall say only a few words about transport. I do so for completeness although my noble friend will cover this subject. It is interesting that all the White Paper says about transport policy is that the Government will continue with the &#x00A3;12 billion roads programme and will consider whether further changes to fuel and vehicle taxes are needed to encourage greater fuel economy. One could hardly have a less firm commitment than that. Our policy would be to review the roads programme with environmental considerations in mind, which hitherto has clearly not been the case; to encourage and allow pilot schemes for road pricing; to tax large cars more heavily; to provide greater investment in rail infrastructure; and
<col>130</col>
to boost public transport. That is a very much more effective programme of environmental improvements than that proposed in the White Paper.<lb/>
I turn to the issue of waste. After all, your Lordships spent many long hours during the last Session debating the Environmental Protection Bill. Here again the White Paper is fatally cautious in its approach to what could be done regarding waste disposal both at home and world wide. It refers to an objective that developed countries should be self-sufficient in due course in their own waste disposal. That is not what is required. What is required is global control of toxic waste and an end to the commercial trade in toxic waste. That is what the Labour Party is committed to. We have to have a national waste strategy which enables us to deal with dangerous polluting wastes in the most effective way. To that extent a greater role must be given to local authorities, which are already deeply concerned in these matters and have the expertise to deal with them.<lb/>
I shall pass very briefly over the issue of water because that matter can be dealt with by other people. I shall just look at the difference, when we turn to the issue of dumping at sea, between the Government's commitment to aim to stop dumping at sea and the Labour Party's commitment to stop dumping at sea. That is typical of the difference in approach which is to be found throughout the White Paper, throughout our response to it and throughout our response to these substantive issues.<lb/>
The White Paper says almost nothing on food and agriculture. There is no reference to the opportunity which is now available to replace the common agricultural policy, or large parts of it, with green premiums which would provide income for farmers and yet would stop the production of foodstuffs which are far too expensive and which put up food prices in this country and throughout Europe.<lb/>
When I turn to deal with the countryside, I risk treading on the ground of my noble friend Lady Nicol. However, it is a commitment of the Labour Party&#x2014;and I should say this from the Dispatch Box&#x2014;to carry out the commitment which the Conservative Party had in its last manifesto; namely, to implement the policies of the Common Lands Forum and to encourage the possibility of opening up rights of way where they exist and where they have been extinguished.<lb/>
Therefore, when we look at the Government's environmental White Paper, we find it in every respect defective, silent and timid. Moreover, in comparison with the policies which are necessary and which will he the policies of the next Labour government, we find the Government's approach to be wholly inadequate.<lb/>
I should like now to deal with the question of local government. I do so not so much because there is any particular reference to it in the gracious Speech&#x2014;and certainly not to go into detail on the issue of the poll tax; others are far more qualified to talk about it than I am&#x2014;but because even the very small Planning and Compensation Bill which we are now promised, although much of it is perfectly welcome, is evidence
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0105"/>
<col>131</col>
of the continuing determination of this Government to centralise everything that they can lay their hands upon. It is rather like the old army saying, "If it does not move, paint it", except that this Government would say, "If it does move, centralise it and bring it under the control of Marsham Street". There is nothing wrong with the Bill's improved provisions for enforcement and compensation for those affected by compulsory purchase orders. I do not think that there is anything wrong with the proposal for simplified planning zones. However, on every issue where there is any real choice to be made between the powers of local authorities and those of central government, the Bill will take the side of central government.<lb/>
Let us look at the issue of controls over planning gain, over what used to be called Section 52 agreements. What is happening is that the determination or planning gain is no longer being left to local authorities which, after all, reflect the views of local people who are affected not only by planning policy but also by the resources available to the local authority. No, this is now to be the sphere of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
Let us also look at the question of disposal of vacant land which in these straitened times has become a very important source of revenue for local authorities. It is now proposed that the Secretary of State shall have the power to order the disposal of named pieces of land to named individuals, if necessary below the market price. Moreover, there appear to be provisions for wholesale disposal of vacant land. I suggest to your Lordships that that is yet another example of unnecessary and undesirable centralisation. I could go on in this respect. There is no provision in the planning Bill for the territory of the urban development corporations to be included in plans as they should be if a comprehensive structure plan is to be effective and complete. In my view these are all symptoms of the determination of the Government, who have become more powerful as the years have passed, to centralise everything in sight and discourage all the ideas of pluralism and local democracy which I thought were dear to the hearts of the people of this country.<lb/>
I know it is true that all oppositions are decentralisers and all governments are centralisers. I am perfectly well aware of that fact. If anyone wished to look back, I have no doubt that they would find examples of Labour governments acting in a high-handed way in relation to local authorities. Moreover, if there were ever Liberal governments, I am sure that they would do the same. For example, a Liberal government might like to do something about Tower Hamlets; that is, if they knew how to control it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02933"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with all due respect, I think that that remark ought to be withdrawn. To suggest that my friends in Tower Hamlets are somehow at odds with the criminal law is not a proper remark to make in this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02934"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that there are matters which will go before an election court and the truth or otherwise of the noble Lord's observations will be seen in court. Neither he nor I will have any influence upon them. That is perhaps the best conclusion of all.<lb/>
However, if we are looking at the way we want our society to progress and if we want our society to reflect technological and social change, we must break ourselves of the habit of seeking to control everything from Whitehall and Marsham Street; in other words, from the centre. Of course that is a very difficult thing to do. It is very difficult to tell local authorities&#x2014;as we would wish to do&#x2014;that they must have minimum standards. If I object to this Government saying that local people cannot spend money on that which they want to spend it on&#x2014;and I do object to that&#x2014;it follows that I must allow certain things to happen. For example, in Sussex, which does not really have any nursery schools, I must allow its local authorities not to have such schools. That is their choice and although I think it is wrong, we should not be imposing minimum standards if we object to the idea of imposing maximum standards. That is the extent to which all of us, whether in Government or Opposition, must recognise the values of a plural society and the values of decentralisation and decision-making.<lb/>
Everything we have learned about government over the past 20 or 30 years has led us to recognise the fact that big is not beautiful and that the analogy which was made in local government in the 1960s and 1970s with big business, where you needed to have large-scale units for efficiency and for a wide range of services, is no longer true. The nature of management and of local government has changed. The sooner we recognise that change, the sooner we shall provide a society in which people feel that they are involved in their local community. They will then want to vote in local elections and take part in local democracy. To that extent, the changes of the kind that have been introduced over the years by this Government are not only irrelevant, they are actually damaging. I leave noble Lords with that thought because I believe it to be the crux of the difference between the approach of the Labour Party and the approach which this Government have increasingly adopted over the past 11 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02935">3.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02936"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as has been said, we spent an enormous amount of time in the last Session of Parliament discussing and trying to amend the Environmental Protection Bill. Many noble Lords in this House attempted to improve that
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0106"/>
<col>133</col>
Bill by moving amendments and putting forward suggestions for the Government to consider. On the whole, the answers which we were given were either that the amendment was not appropriate for that Bill or that we should wait for the publication of the White Paper.<lb/>
We have now seen the White Paper and, as has already been said, it is full of good intentions. It outlines the situation as the Government see it, but it is completely lacking in suggestions as to how we might put the matter right. I looked forward to the opportunity in the Queen's Speech for the Government to legislate in respect of some of the problems with which we are faced. But, as has been said, we have had a Queen's Speech which is not really full of legislation. It would have been an opportunity to do something about a problem which is perhaps the greatest one we have; namely, our own environment and the future of our planet.<lb/>
However, there was nothing much in the Queen's Speech, except, I believe, for four Bills on transport upon which the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, spent quite some time in his opening speech. If I understood it correctly, there is very little in what is proposed&#x2014;I know that my noble friend Lord Tordoff will speak on this subject at the end of the debate&#x2014;which stops and prevents carbon dioxide emissions. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, admitted that that is one of the big problems. He suggested that we should encourage better driving habits. That is true, but we cannot solve the problem merely by hoping that people will acquire better driving habits.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, mentioned tax incentives to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We are generally agreed that the bigger the car the greater the emissions of carbon dioxide. What is wrong with having a differential tax system for motor cars? In other words, one pays more tax if one drives a large car and less if one drives a small one. It is not a new idea. We had such a system. When I first came to live in this country one paid a great deal to drive a big motor car but only a little to drive a small Morris. I cannot see why that should not be one way of attempting to control carbon dioxide emissions from motor cars.<lb/>
The only other point relating to the environment that I can find in the Queen's Speech is the creation of a natural heritage agency for Scotland. On the Second Reading of the Environmental Protection Bill on 18th May many noble Lords said, when discussing Part VII, that they could not understand why, if it was right to merge the two bodies in Scotland, it was not right to merge them in England. In that debate the Government admitted that in a year or two we should do the same in England. I am still convinced that it is wrong to put that issue on one side now so that we shall have to have a second lot of legislation and upheaval instead of dealing with England in the same way as Scotland.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, pointed out, there is nothing in the Queen's Speech which reflects the Prime Minister's special interest in global warming
<col>134</col>
and ozone depletion. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh: I was devastated that in Geneva the Prime Minister was unable to agree with our Community partners that 2000 should he the date by which to stabilise CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The Government continue to insist that 2005 is the earliest date that that can happen. We are again lagging behind our European partners. We all regret what the United States is doing with regard to this question. I am a little nervous that this country, with what it claims is its special relationship with the United States, may be hoping that that will stop us from having to take unpalatable decisions. That is not right. We should be able to do what our Community partners are hoping to do.<lb/>
Your Lordships would be surprised if I did not say that I was disappointed that there was nothing about CFCs in the Queen's Speech. As my Private Member's Bill passed through the House, I had hoped that the Government might be prepared to accept some of the proposals that it contained.<lb/>
The Queen's Speech was deficient in another way, and that is a great tragedy. As was discussed on Report on the Environmental Protection Bill, one of the best ways to stop polluting our environment is to minimise our use of energy. There is no doubt that we could reduce the need to produce more energy if we became more efficient users of our planet's limited resources. I introduced on Report an amendment relating to energy conservation. It included insulation, combined heat and power and energy-efficient light bulbs. That amendment reflected, word for word, what was contained in the Government's White Paper. It was not accepted by the Government, but I should have thought that the topic was one that the Government might have included in the Queen's Speech for this Session. It is completely in line with proposals contained in the White Paper.<lb/>
The Government's reply to that amendment was that it was unnecessary because it was all contained in the White Paper; but governments do not govern through White Papers. They govern by Acts of Parliament to ensure that local authorities and private individuals conform to a set of standards. It is not enough glibly to say, "It is in the White Paper". Legislation is needed to enforce such requirements.<lb/>
We who are alive today have a great responsibility to ensure that we do not do more damage to the environment than we have already done. We must ensure that the environment that we pass on to future generations is in the same or better condition than that which we inherited.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02938"><member>Baroness Stedman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a way it was encouraging to realise that the Queen's Speech proposed, for this Session at any rate, no major local government Bill, because over the past 10 years local authorities have been under consistent and relentless attack from central government. However, would it not have been nice, in what is perhaps the last Session of this Parliament, to have seen a change of heart by the Government and to have had just one more Bill
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0107"/>
<col>135</col>
which might have given local authorities the power to do anything that was in the interests of their area so long as it was lawful?<lb/>
I am talking about a power of general competence; that is, the power to act and undertake any activities not specifically prohibited. If local authorities had such a power, they would be able to run their services in a much more innovative way. They would not have to hunt for statutory authorisation to take action, and they would not be in fear of legal challenges. The whole climate within which councils operate would change dramatically.<lb/>
Concern for the environment is a well established local government principle, but there is still a need to build up awareness of the indirect effect of our actions, both locally and nationally. All economic decisions have an environmental impact whether they relate to new power stations, new large scale developments or even the raising of interest rates or increasing the level of external debt.<lb/>
We say that we believe that the polluter should pay, and it environmental protection legislation relating to industrialists using high technology in their manufacturing processes there has been the incentive to adopt the cleanest available technology because the law says they must do so. What incentives are the Government offering industrialists to encourage them to go further and to develop even cleaner technology? If charges were to be made for pollution, industrialists, with all their knowledge and resources, would find ways of cleaning up processes which cause pollution. We could even have a pollution tax which, if it were successful, would not raise revenue but would encourage people to act. By taxing dirty technology and products, the economy could be transformed and could become much more environmentally friendly. In effect, we should be starting to make the market work for the environment.<lb/>
I welcome the new planning legislation for tighter and speedier planning enforcement procedures. Town and country planning has always been concerned with amenities. We need to extend the protection afforded to the habitat, to the SSSIs and AONBs, and I welcome the proposal for the new Midlands forest. But planning needs to look more to greening our urban areas and to meeting the challenge of the changing rural economy.<lb/>
Our social and economic policies must ensure that the countryside does not suffer from adverse change. Many parts of our country have lost much in recent years because of changes in agriculture. The opportunities now created by reduction in the demand for land ought to be used to create better amenities for all. The countryside is a living environment but it is also a place where the decline in work opportunities causes not only personal hardship but also a downgrading of the countryside.<lb/>
I welcome the decision also to retain the county structure plans for effective strategic planning. Through those plans we can hope to see a pattern of new settlements which might minimise the need for travel, particularly by private car. We can protect the
<col>136</col>
open spaces in our towns and villages and refuse developments which adversely affect the SSSIs, the national nature reserves and other sites. We can require all new industrial development to incorporate waste treatment facilities. We would also be able to check on mineral workings and their impact on the environment.<lb/>
I should like to have seen more emphasis on housing. Yes, more money has been made available for housing associations and the problems of homelessness; but not enough to provide sufficient low cost, affordable housing to rent and buy. Nowhere is this more important than in the rural areas where local authorities and local estates have been selling off many properties. If the local country people cannot afford the available accommodation, then strong communities cannot be maintained. We will not maintain strong, rural communities if the village shops have to close because of the impact of the uniform business rate and if public transport becomes less and less, and even non-existent.<lb/>
I have a friend in the Lake District. No public transport passes nearer than five miles from his village. Although he is only in his forties, he has suffered a severe stroke which has left him with little sight and a weak arm and leg. He can no longer drive his car or even walk safely along the country roads because he cannot see the traffic coming. I advised him to apply for a mobility allowance, to help to keep the family car on the road and perhaps to provide an occasional outing away from home. He applied; he went for a medical and was told that he was not eligible because his disability did not prevent him getting on to public transport. That is fine if there is public transport, but not so good if one has to walk five miles to the main road and back to catch an infrequent bus either to Keswick or Penrith. Perhaps some flexibility in situations like this could be looked at in the improvements proposed for disabled persons. Transport needs to be much more flexible in the rural areas than in the towns. It should be geared to the needs of particular groups and for particular purposes.<lb/>
We have to accept that the UK economy is probably road-based at the moment. Better roads will significantly reduce pollution if they remove congestion. However, we also have to accept that the United Kingdom is on the periphery of Europe. The other regions of the United Kingdom also need good road links to the growing markets of the South East and mainland Europe.<lb/>
All new public transport facilities ought to be planned with the disabled and the elderly in mind. All new buses and coaches and all new railway coaches should provide standards of access and mobility to enable the disabled and the elderly to enjoy the same lifestyle benefits that the rest of the community are able to enjoy.<lb/>
The toll road proposals are interesting but I suspect that they will be on a very minor scale and are no panacea for our problems. I hope that the Government will also look at road pricing because I believe that a consistent system of road pricing would
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0108"/>
<col>137</col>
be better. It would finance road maintenance, which is one of the big problems today. I shall be interested in the development of the toll roads, but I am reminded that the original turnpikes were toll roads and they did not last that long.<lb/>
I welcome the proposal for increased expenditure on public transport. We need more bus lanes and more cycle ways; we need to do something about single occupancy of private cars, which should be restricted to slower lanes, as in parts of the United States. We need more use of park-and-ride facilities and more effective policing of bus lanes and parking in our busy urban streets.<lb/>
I conclude by referring back to housing. The Building Employers Confederation recently issued a gloomy report on house building. In 1989, 71 per cent. of its members were working at full capacity. Now only 23 per cent. are at full capacity; most of them are working at two-thirds or three-quarters of their capacity. The restriction of local authority spending on building houses for rent, the high interest rates and inflation all work against help for the tens of thousands of homeless persons living in bed-and-breakfast hotels or sleeping in doorways. It seems to me inconceivable that we have so much need of affordable housing and yet we have building operatives unemployed. At a national level, employment in the building industry fell this year by 50,000. It is expected to fall by a further 50,000 in 1991.<lb/>
In the Autumn Statement a considerable sum was allocated towards the relief of homelessness. I hope that that money will be spent quickly. Labour and building materials are readily available, so please will the Government urge the authorities concerned to do something quickly to help the homeless and the depressed construction industry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02939">4.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02940"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I follow three interesting speeches on the environment and I wish to say a few words about transport, I realise that my speech does not key in as well as I should like with what has gone before. I sympathise with the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, about the need to preserve village life by maintaining the single village shop. That is all we have in my village; it is next to the village school and it is vital in order to keep the village going. My word, we certainly try hard there to do that. The noble Baroness mentioned other matters which I shall not follow up since my speech concerns transport.<lb/>
I begin by congratulating my noble friend the Minister on his major programme of transport legislation. I especially liked his concluding observation on his intention to civilise road transport. I agree with him, but he has quite a long way to go. In my experience of 40 years in this House and in another place, four transport Bills in one Session is a record. I particularly congratulate my noble friend on getting our old friend the street works Bill in. I am sure it will receive a welcome from the noble Lord, Lord
<col>138</col>
Underhill. If ever there was a Cinderella, it is that Bill, which was first proposed for legislation, I believe, 50 years ago.<lb/>
Every Minister has looked at the legislation and decided that there were not many votes in it. Therefore it has always gone to the bottom of the list. In fact, it is a very important Bill and I congratulate my noble friend on bringing it forward. I look forward to debating it and supporting him as he takes the Bill through the House in the near future. My noble friend's proven track record in the world of transport will be especially valuable in dealing with this heavy programme.<lb/>
As my noble friend said, transport is a major element in the lives of all of us today. It has a major influence on the cost of everything that we buy. Comfort is a major factor in every journey that we make. I speak as a daily commuter on British Rail and London Underground. I hope that some of the 1,500 new trains which are to come into service will be used on the Portsmouth line, but I have not seen any of them yet.<lb/>
The Government's investment programme for transport&#x2014;road, rail and civil aviation&#x2014;amounts to &#x00A3;16 billion. That is a tremendous sum. It is substantial by any standard and it will provide many valuable improvements. Even so, we have to expect a staggering increase in road traffic movements over the next generation, of the order of 100 per cent. There will be greater use of vehicles and there will be more vehicles. Therefore, irrespective of the very heavy expenditure which my noble friend is to provide, the utmost increase in capacity that we can provide cannot meet our needs. As well as hard cash, more hard thinking is needed to develop the best solutions.<lb/>
I should like to offer my noble friend two thoughts in that context, one of which he has partially taken on board. The first concerns the greater application of scientific traffic management such as the admirable prototype which my noble friend is to introduce in the Road Traffic Bill for the London traffic management scheme. However, for the general development of traffic management more traffic engineers are required, by which I mean engineers who study the movement of traffic, which is not the same discipline as that of engineers who build roads to carry traffic &#x2014;county surveyors please note.<lb/>
We can learn from the United States, where there are eight times as many motor cars as there are here, although it is true that it is a bigger country; but nevertheless it manages to keep the traffic moving very well. Every American city of any size has a traffic commissioner and a team of traffic engineers continually studying traffic movement and working out methods of improvement, including tough disciplines which are enforced stringently. In London there is a team of traffic engineers, but it is split. with half coming under the Department of Transport and half under the Metropolitan Police. It is a great credit to the officials working in those two separate teams that the system works at all. It is an illogical split, presumably a product of history from the days when traffic intersections were controlled by policemen
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0109"/>
<col>139</col>
wearing white gloves. The officials have produced the London traffic management scheme and deserve great credit for it. I believe that it promises a significant improvement in the movement of London traffic.<lb/>
Over the country as a whole it is a rare exception for a city to employ a team of traffic engineers. It is common form for the county or city surveyor to be responsible, and usually he knows more about building roads than managing traffic on them. Here, I welcome the observation by my noble friend the Minister that his department is advising towns on traffic problems. I know that his officials have been advising Guildford, but those who have tried to motor through Guildford will know that the advice has not penetrated very far yet. More than advice is needed. With a few honourable exceptions&#x2014;Birmingham is outstanding&#x2014;city and county engineers are not interested in traffic engineering.<lb/>
Years ago, when I was Parliamentary Secretary for Transport in the 1950s, I visited the United States to make a brief study of traffic management in that country. I learnt that the Americans had developed the applied science of traffic engineering which they had successfully applied to their urban traffic movement. All cities of any size in the United States had a traffic commissioner and a team of traffic engineers. The benefit to their traffic movement was obvious. I returned to England with a clear intention to introduce traffic engineering here.<lb/>
When I consulted MoT officials they informed me that my plan was stillborn. There were no traffic engineers and no university offered a course in traffic engineering. I was astonished. However, two universities&#x2014;one of which was Birmingham&#x2014;wished to set up postgraduate courses in traffic engineering, which would mature in the next five years. However, I learnt that a course could be started immediately if I could raise &#x00A3;150,000 privately to finance the first few years before the UGC took it on. The motor industry, the oil industry and the insurance industry rallied round splendidly. I raised the &#x00A3;150,000 and the money was delivered to Birmingham, which set up a postgraduate school. It was running within 18 months under a splendid character called Professor Kolbuszewski, who ran it with great success and trained a number of valuable traffic engineers.<lb/>
Picture my horror and disappointment when, two years ago, I learnt that Birmingham University was closing down its postgraduate school of traffic engineering. No clear reason was given, but it appeared to be a lack of funds and lack of demand for students. It is devastating that now, when traffic problems bedevil us every day&#x2014;and heaven knows what they cost us&#x2014;we should be losing one of the few schools of traffic engineering in the country just when we most need traffic engineers. Words fail me.<lb/>
I mention that sad affair to illustrate the general indifference throughout local authorities and the ignorance and indifference in my noble friend's own department. Traditionally the attitude has been that we did not need it. My word, we need it today&#x0021; I welcome the fact that my noble friend said that he was helping some cities. They certainly need that help. I
<col>140</col>
urge my noble friend to take on board the message that there is an acute need to look at the universities. I believe that Newcastle still offers a postgraduate degree. Is there any other? We need far more. Every town in the country and every county highway authority needs traffic engineers to apply the science of the movement of traffic to make the best use of their roads.<lb/>
I repeat that I welcome what is being done in London. That is a splendid prototype which I hope will be followed in the rest of the country. I congratulate my noble friend on that initiative.<lb/>
My second point concerns road pricing. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, will have something to say on the subject, and the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, mentioned it. Road pricing is one of the management techniques which can be applied to urban traffic to improve traffic movement. It is my belief that the natural growth in traffic over the next few years will swamp us. We shall have to introduce disciplines of that kind.<lb/>
My idea in this respect is fairly simple. I believe that there is very little experience of road pricing. Singapore has apparently tried it, but I suspect that the form of government in Singapore is different and the scheme could not necessarily be applied here. Nevertheless, there are lessons to he learnt from studying what has been done in Singapore. The gleam of hope comes from Cambridge, and I see the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, sitting there. Apparently they wish to set up a scheme of road pricing in Cambridge. What splendid people. Good luck to them. It is going to be uncomfortable and it is going to be painful. It is frightfully difficult to get a scheme that will be fair to rich and poor alike, but nevertheless I am sure that we shall need to do it.<lb/>
If my noble friend could get an important city like Cambridge to set up a scheme and try it out, it could be carefully designed with all the help that he could give it. It could be carefully monitored to see how it worked, so that after a few years it would be possible to say what is the best way of setting up road pricing schemes for cities. I am sure that we shall want to do it within the next few years, however much we may spend on the many improvements that my noble friend is making. This really would show us the way. If the benefits were achieved, then the Government could legislate for general application.<lb/>
All this would take some years. It would take five years for Cambridge to set up a scheme and have it working for enough time to see that it worked all right. By the end of that time&#x2014;five years&#x2014;I should think that the worsening traffic jams would make every town in the country say, "Let us have a road pricing scheme". But in all seriousness I say to my noble friend that this is something we need to learn about. It is full of problems, but for heaven's sake let us get splendid Cambridge set up with its scheme to show us how it might work. I conclude by congratulating my noble friend on his immense transport programme and I give my best wishes for its progress.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02942"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so now we know. After all the hype, all the rhetoric, all the months of labour, we find in the gracious Speech the one tiny sentence:
<quote>"My Government will promote further international co-operation on environmental issues."</quote>
And that is all we are going to get. It bears out what my noble friend Lord McIntosh said during the debate on the Environmental Protection Bill that there will be no more legislation on the environment during this Parliament.<lb/>
Within a few days of the gracious Speech being given to us it was the inter-governmental panel on climate change, the leading 600 scientists in the world, who were warning humanity that if we are to prevent the increase in global warming which has already started and which is already taking place then it would be necessary to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. They proposed that there should be a cut of 20 per cent. by the year 2005. They warned us that if the rise in carbon dioxide emissions and its accompanying global warming continued as it has already started, then within the next quarter to half a century we shall see the seas rise, storms increasing and increasing in severity, floods, drought, famine and the mass movement of peoples escaping from their destroyed environment. Every human being living, and generations yet unborn, will be affected by this forecast and the prospect of this catastrophe. What do this Government do to meet that challenge? They will continue to co-operate internationally.<lb/>
In the transport Bills, the Bills on the use of roads and cars, is there anything there connected with the reduction or even the stabilisation of carbon dioxide emissions? Is there anything said about catalytic converters? The Government have been rich in words, in rhetoric. Those words need to be tested by their performance. For example, the White Paper that we have awaited for so long includes only one really new proposal&#x2014;the emphasis on energy conservation. It was promised that the Government would step up the work of the Energy Efficiency Office.<lb/>
Only last week the Prime Minister in Geneva was promising ambitious programmes to promote energy efficiency. Rhetoric, my Lords. What was the performance? As my noble friend Lord McIntosh has already pointed out, in the Autumn Statement last week the energy efficiency budget, the conservation budget, was in real terms cut by 10 per cent. because of inflation and because of the additional burdens that it has to carry. How does that measure up either to the promises in the White Paper or by the Prime Minister in Geneva? It is to be &#x00A3;.15 million this year; a cut in real terms by 10 per cent. I wonder whether the noble Baroness who is to wind up will answer that point?<lb/>
Again the White Paper referred to the Government pressing the European Community for
<quote>"minimum energy efficiency standards to be set for a range of appliances."</quote>
<col>142</col>
That was the rhetoric in the White Paper. And yet it was only last week that the government representatives were opposing the European Community's proposals on energy saving standards for domestic appliances. Rhetoric and performance. How can they be equated?<lb/>
I understand that California had perhaps the most imaginative environmental scheme that has yet seen the light of day politically. But I understand that unfortunately it has been defeated, and that the main agents in that defeat were Shell, ICI, and BP, who contributed massive amounts to fight that environmental Bill. It makes one wonder whether the same kind of commercial pressures have been applied here in this country.<lb/>
Above all in this contrast between rhetoric and performance, between promise and action, we come to the second world climate conference held last week. Britain was the only one of the European Community members to stand out against the agreed target of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000. Why? I believe because they are frightened of the effect on electricity privatisation; on the cost in connection with the power stations plus, of course, their fears of the coming general election.<lb/>
How is it that, when the Prime Minister can tour the world and make these rousing speeches about the environment, it is her Government that opposes the European Community's target of the year 2000, when the West Germans have promised to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by 25 per cent.&#x2014;cut them, not stabilise them&#x2014;by the year 2005? That is the year by which the British Government say that they can stabilise emissions. The Netherlands has promised a 5 per cent. cut by the year 2005. The GDR has promised a 20 per cent. cut. Whether or not it will be able to achieve it is a different matter, but that is its target. Britain is lagging behind and is relying upon the other poor members of the EC to make up the leeway in order to achieve the EC target by the year 2000.<lb/>
I should like to ask another question of the noble Baroness. The British Government continually state that they are pledged to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000. Does that statement include their previous reservation that the pledge is conditional upon other nations making a firm commitment, or are the British Government sufficiently courageous to say that they will go ahead regardless of others?<lb/>
At the end of the week the agreement was signed in Geneva, but it was signed without targets. It is to be welcomed that the Japanese came into the picture and that there is to be participation by the United States of America and the Soviet Union when negotiations commence next February. The fact that no targets were laid down shows that the politicians are defying the advice of the scientists&#x2014;and this time there is no doubt about the unanimity of scientific opinion.<lb/>
In the final agreement, what was said about the important use of renewable energy in order to reduce the greenhouse gases; for example, wind, solar, hydro-electric and wave energy? What part did the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0111"/>
<col>143</col>
British Government play in introducing those elemenis into the conference? Their record on renewable energy does not bear examination, particularly when one considers the way in which the prospect of using wave energy was virtually destroyed in 1982.<lb/>
It is puzzling why the Government find so much difficulty in producing a positive policy. They appointed Professor Pearce to produce a report on pricing carbon and pricing roads. What have they done with it? One does not have to agree with everything that the Professor states, but as far as I know the Government have made no response whatever to the report. Professor Pearce is supposed to be the adviser to the Secretary of State for the Environment. This issue is not as tremendous as is often pointed out, and indeed as the Government often try to point out in order to demonstrate that they are doing something marvellous in stabilising carbon dioxide emissions.<lb/>
In the United Kingdom the per capita emissions of carbon dioxide were only 10.5 per cent. higher in 1988 than in 1950. In recent years there has been a drop in emissions caused by the increasing use of natural gas. We are possibly totally stable in regard to emissions and we have achieved that without trying or planning. Would it be impossible to increase the drop by 20 per cent. through positive action by the year 2000?<lb/>
At this point self-interest merges with environmental interest. Environmental considerations are not a burden on industry. There may be some initial expense but many industries have found that they cut costs by reducing the use of energy. If one reads the booklet produced last week under the patronage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, <i>Your Business and the Envirorment,</i> one sees that companies like IBM, Marks and Spencer and even St. Thomas's Hospital are saving money by the introduction of energy consenation. The one thing that business in this country has refused to implement, whereas it has been done very successfully in West Germany, is the concept of environmental audit. The audit has shown that in many West German companies like AEG there is an incentive to protect the environment within the industry.<lb/>
However well the business world conducts itself (and we are way behind the business practice of continental companies), intervention is essential. At that point our party parts company with the Government&#x2014;or does it? I wonder, because last week the Secretary of State, Christopher Patten, had this to say:
<quote>"I don't pretend for one moment that it is enough to use market forces. Invisible hands are all very well but they need some direction".</quote>
If that is Mr. Patten's philosophy, he would be very welcome as a member in the Labour Party because that is the central issue of division between our two parties. We believe that intervention is essential in order to protect our planet&#x2014;intervention wherever possible with industry. It is being done on the Continent and some companies in this country are trying to achieve the same ends. They are also
<col>144</col>
pleading for legislation to help them. Due to the obsession with market forces and non-intervention on the other side, they have so far failed. However, if the Secretary of State has been converted to that way of thinking, perhaps there is hope for the future.<lb/>
Finally but by no means least, we must never forget that we are living in a privileged society which is being subsidised by the poor of the world. We live in a society which uses 70 per cent. of the energy used throughout the world, although we have only a quarter of the world's population. The remaining 30 per cent. is all that is available to three-quarters of the world's population. We should also remember that we have caused the pollution of this planet. From the time of the Industrial Revolution we have been endangering its future as a habitat for the human being. The three-quarters of the world's population that is today living in poverty is demanding better standards of living, standards that will at least sustain life. That part of the population is rapidly increasing. The population of the world is 5 billion and by the end of the century it will be 6 billion. The extra demands upon energy and resources will be a tremendous menace to the future of humanity. We have a responsibility to meet that situation.<lb/>
What are the Government doing in terms of giving aid to developing countries so that they can develop, not in our dirty way, but in more modern, environmentally benign ways? What arc the Government doing to help provide the technology that alone can prevent this massive disaster which now faces us? These people have a right to live, and to live decently. To do so they have to effect a revolution in their economic world. Unless they are given better help and the opportunity to do so, the whole of the planet is in danger.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02944"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to start by complaining to the Leader of the House and the usual channels about the format of our debates on the Queen's Speech. I think that they might split the subjects up a little better. I know that transport has much to do with pollution but the two do not really go together. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, made an excellent speech full of technical points about what will be done. It is ridiculous that the poor chap has then to listen to the remainder of the debate; and for the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, to reply on a different subject. That does not appear logical. It should not be beyond the wit of the usual channels perhaps to split the subject into two. We could then hear from Ministers who know something about the subject. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is enormously knowledgeable. She is learning fast on agriculture from me, I understand. The noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, is listening throughout the debate, looking nearly interested. If the subject were split she could reply on agriculture - a subject about which she knows a great deal.<lb/>
I hear constant complaints too about defence and foreign affairs being lumped together. The speeches become mixed up. Although defence, or war, was supposed to be an extension of foreign affairs, it does
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0112"/>
<col>145</col>
not appear to me always to be a tight debate. I therefore hope that the usual channels&#x2014;including my noble friend who sits in front of me&#x2014;will take note. Perhaps we could spend more time on the gracious Speech with a less mixed-up approach.<lb/>
Agriculture is coupled with the environment debate. I am not sure whether that is a compliment &#x2014;it certainly has a great deal to do with the environment&#x2014;or whether it is an insult that it is not in the economic section because it is of enormous importance to the well-being of this country, especially in view of the enormous deficit in our foreign trade at the present time. However, although agriculture is placed with environment, I shall take the matter out of the realms of the ducks and daisies, which appear to be the main subject of the environmentalists' concern, and move into the realms of agriculture and the people on the land who have a great deal to do with the environment.<lb/>
The world about which the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, has been so eloquently extolling, suffers from industrial pollution and from population expansion. I know from my work in the Council of Europe that the Government are not doing nearly enough to help the United Nations to fund population control. In Mexico and Sri Lanka such measures have been most successful in controlling population.<lb/>
The gracious Speech states that the Government will strive to perfect the performance of the CAP and to push forward the negotiations on GATT. Those of course are of tremendous importance. The Americans have put forward proposals of a radical nature on agriculture. However, I suspect that their proposals are more concerned with regaining their dominant place in the world than in not protecting their own farmers as their subsidies are in excess of the subsidies spent per head in Europe on farming.<lb/>
We must accept that Europe has a perfect right to feed herself. What she has no right to do is to subsidise production and to export it on to the world markets to the ruination of a great many primary producers in the developing countries and the very competent producers in Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>

There would obviously be a carry-over in bad times &#x2014;because we shall have bad years as well as good. The common agricultural policy is in a mess because for years the Council of Agriculture Ministers for political reasons did not listen to the proposals of the Commission. It allowed prices and production to rise to an extent which has led us into the present surplus position and the enormous expense from which we suffer today in Europe, and in this country, because of the large amount spent mostly on export subsidies to remove the surpluses and to dump them on the world market.<lb/>
<col>146</col>
Despite that, the curious paradox is that farmers as a whole are in a very bad way. Extraordinary changes are taking place all over the country. When I went to farm at Benshie 45 years ago, I put in a day, and we had 12 full-time men on the farm, quite apart from the casuals for the fruit and so on. Today I believe that there are three men on that farm. On Saturday while out shooting I met an enormously efficient young man who was farming 600 acres with one man. I reckon that he will survive. But what an extraordinary change has taken place the countryside when one considers such figures.<lb/>
I speak anecdotally, but some interesting surveys have been carried out. A survey on full-time farms was carried out in two parishes in Lincolnshire. I cannot give the exact origins. There were 13 full-time farms in 1970; in 1990 there were five. That is an enormous drop of over 60 per cent. In over 282 farms in 16 parishes, 35 per cent. lost their independent full-time status in 20 years. That makes an enormous difference to the environment in those parishes.<lb/>
I do not speak in a nasty way, although it may appear so. I am all for the environmentalists but I believe that they have some things wrong. In the <i>Guardian</i>&#x2014;a paper much read by the other side, I dare say&#x2014;it states that many farmers are now on the knife-edge of economic survival in sharp contrast to the big cereal farmers whose incomes continue to rise. That is absolute and total rubbish.<lb/>
I spoke to a most distinguished economist in the farming business, Mr. Murphy from Cambridge University, and I now have the figures from 1978 to 1988. In relation to mixed cropping, the figures showing real income per hectare are &#x00A3;246, &#x00A3;251, &#x00A3;189, &#x00A3;152, &#x00A3;200 and &#x00A3;326. The figures for 1984 onwards are &#x00A3;145, &#x00A3;62, &#x00A3;160, &#x00A3;26 and &#x00A3;31. They relate to East Anglia, an area of large farms, and they show clearly that the industry is in a precarious state.<lb/>
A number of farmers who are competent and fully capitalised and who are not borrowing large sums of money will continue to make money. If the situation continues they will be able to take over the smaller farms at lower prices. There will be opportunities for people who are competent and who have money. However, that will be no good for the environment and the countryside. We cannot support small farmers with up to 200 acres. They cannot make the kind of living that they have a right to expect, given the prices that we can afford or that should exist given the great advances in agriculture.<lb/>
As regards the environment and agriculture, the Government must be more definite about their policies. It is true that a small experiment in organic farming is taking place in Scotland. The Government's set-aside schemes are alleviating the surpluses a little in various districts. However, none of them will touch the heart of the problem. In any common agricultural policy there must be a bottom in the market. The myriads of primary producers in agriculture are subject to the ebb and flow to a ridiculous extent. A figure that I constantly quote is that a 5 per cent. surplus can produce a 50 per cent. drop in price.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0113"/>
<col>147</col>
The Government must now make a definite promise. It is curious that the Minister of Agriculture has said that he will stand by the farmers and will not let them down while at the same time backing a 30 per cent. cut from 1986. That is only a bargaining figure. If the GATT negotiations are to succeed it is likely that the figure will be higher. It may well be that with competence the larger and well-capitalised farmers will be able to withstand such a cut. However, the small farmer, the social backbone of the countryside, will be unable to do so. The Government must put forward a definite set-aside scheme for extensive or organic farming. At the same time there must be a proper standard of marketing for such produce. There is a large market, although it is not major.<lb/>
In regard to the environment, the Government must support the hill farmers. The hill farming subsidies per head must be retained and adjusted. They must take account of the admirable income which can be obtained by reducing the number of sheep, planting heather and then providing grouse shooting for people who are foolish or good enough to pay the prices. That provides a great deal of extra income for the countryside.<lb/>
The Government must also do something about housing in the countryside. Throughout Scotland, there are instances of people coming up from the South to buy houses at prices which local people cannot afford. Government policy and the sale of council houses has not helped the situation one bit. I hope that the Government will support Scottish Homes by providing sufficient money to ensure that rural housing is affordable by people who live and work in the countryside. I know of nothing more devastating than a rural area that is populated by people who have no interest in it.<lb/>
Not only must the Government provide a subsidy of 50 per cent. towards the upkeep of the walls on hill farms, but they must also provide a subsidy for the planting of hedges and trees. That takes land out of cereal production, for example, and puts it into a product that we need; that is, timber. However, it must be made profitable for the farmer to do so. For instance, if I am making money in farming I am willing to spend 50 per cent. of the cost of erecting something that is pretty or on planting a wood. However, if like many small farmers I am not making money I need 100 per cent. cost and something for my labour if I am to produce environmental improvements.<lb/>
I could go on and on about the number of steps that could be taken, but the Government know them all. I say only that they must be more serious about them; otherwise we shall have a farming desert in the countryside. A great deal of land will be farmed in a most extraordinarily efficient and competent manner but there will not be in the countryside the people who make it what it is. The farmers do not want feather bedding but the Government must watch that they do not throw the baby out with the bath water when making the proposed cuts in GATT.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02948"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the fact that one Angus man follows another is not necessarily down to the usual channels. No one could have described rural depopulation and the plight that affects us all in Angus better than my noble neighbour, Lord Mackie. I pay tribute to what he has done in Angus. It will come as no surprise to your Lordships that on Friday night the Kerriemuir and District Agricultural Association decided that next year's show will he held on the farm that for the past 45 years and until recently was run by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie. That is an indication of his stewardship and the way in which he left Benshie farm. I shall not speak today about farming but will leave that to experts such as the noble Lord.<lb/>
The gracious Speech contained a phrase which interested and concerned me. It stated:
<quote>"My Government will promote improved efficiency and safety in transport".</quote>
I had cause to remember those valuable words as I tried to cross the road outside my office this afternoon. I was tempted to think of two types of Peers&#x2014;the quick and the dead. I remain among the first. I ask whether the Minister can encourage us in one of my long-standing enthusiasms and passions; it is the railways. I declare an interest because in my youth I was a great railway enthusiast at Forfar station. It is in desuetude because there has been no passenger service from the station for 23 years. The only indications that there ever was a station are the remarks made every other Saturday at Station Park, the home of Forfar Athletic football team. I believe that at the moment the station is due to be turned into an upmarket housing estate.<lb/>
Also, over the years, I have been a great user of railways. Indeed, anybody who lives in our particular region of Scotland needs to use railways. Occasionally we can use air transport to reach your Lordships' House but railways are the standby transport for many of us in rural districts and, above all, over long distances.<lb/>
When I used to return from Scotland to school in England, that was a major excursion. To go from Dundee, which was then the main station, on the east coast route to London used to take 10 hours. That was in the 1950s. That journey can now be done six, seven, eight or even 10 times a day in six hours or not much more than that. That shows the massive improvement in technology. Let us never forget that that six-hour journey is completed over the same railway track which existed in the 1950s and, indeed, in Victorian times, because, with minor adjustments, it is the same railway track which was constructed by the Great Northern Railway, the North British Railway and the North Eastern Railway all along the east coast route.<lb/>
That aspect of British Rail and its operations emerges very clearly when one makes the comparison with some of our Continental cousins. The TGV in France and the intercity express system in Germany are thoroughly modern and very impressive, though Germany will soon have to take account of what was
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0114"/>
<col>149</col>
the Reichsbahn in East Germany. Nevertheless, both those major operations are rather different from British Rail.<lb/>
The TGV system in France is held up as a great example of swiftness and modernity in rail transport. Indeed, the new system which is to be opened towards Nantes, the TGV Atlantique, is a most important prospect. However, the TGV which extends south to Lyons and as far as Marseilles runs over completely new track. My holiday in the south of France this summer was enlivened each morning by reading of massive protests in Provence about the construction of a new line to carry the TGV directly towards Nice, avoiding Marseilles. The protests in Provence made anything that has happened so far in Kent seem like a child's teaparty.<lb/>
In Germany there is no new TGV-type track. The train has its core route between Cologne and Basle along the Rhine. I referred to this in a debate earlier this year. Germany has exactly the same problem as us in not being able to carve out completely new track for a TGV-type train. One has to try to make use of existing track. That is what British Rail has done with outstanding success.<lb/>
There was a reorganisation of operations in 1982 and the core of the publicity is concentrated on what is called "intercity". That means mainly high speed trains using increasingly high technology. One or two interesting comparisons as regards figures have been produced recently. British Rail's total costs are about &#x00A3;1.50 per train kilometre, whereas in Germany the cost is nearly &#x00A3;6 and in France it is &#x00A3;6.70. Those are the costs per kilometre for a train travelling along existing track. Operating costs show a similar and increasing efficiency on the part of British Rail. Those sets of figures provide a very valuable lesson for our European cousins. I understand that managers from Europe come across to take lessons from British Rail in efficiency and value for money.<lb/>
We read a great deal about the Channel Tunnel. Earlier this year British Rail announced a new scheme called InterCity 250. I am given to understand that 225 and 250 kph are the cruising speeds of the trains. I believe that 250 kilometres per hour is equivalent to something in the region of 150 miles per hour. That is the speed at which trains will be expected to cruise. The InterCity 250 programme will enable trains to travel from Manchester to London in less than two hours. It will also enable international trains to link Manchester, Liverpool and London with Paris and Brussels, operating by 1993 on what was the old London and North Western route. The old LNWR route, which will be combined with the old east coast route main line, was constructed in the mid nineteenth century and onwards, with one or two minor adjustments. Here we have not had the major operations which one has seen undertaken in France in order to cope with the TGV and its very high speeds. The InterCity 225&#x2013;225 kilometres per hour is approximately 140 miles per hour&#x2014;will reduce the journey time between London and Edinburgh to under four hours. I believe that that record, which
<col>150</col>
belongs to British Rail, is second to none. That underlines the robust comments of my noble friend the Minister at the outset of his remarks.<lb/>
My noble friend mentioned the &#x00A3;4 billion investment which is to be made by British Rail over the next three years, not just in new trains but also in safety. That is far more important, especially in the eyes of my noble friend Lord Nugent. That investment will also help to provide improved and more comfortable stations. Of course in trains, as opposed to on the roads, speed is delightful. However, even in trains speed must be linked to safety. Therefore, it is gratifying that &#x00A3;70 million is to be spent this year and &#x00A3;330 million over the next three years to upgrade every aspect of British Rail's operation so that the speed which all of us will enjoy will be linked to the very highest standards of safety.<lb/>
The Minister also referred to provincial services. In my youth those used to provide many hours of fascination for me. Sadly, provincial services on British Rail have less and less to do with glamour and individuality and far more to do with reliability, efficiency and value for money. One can no longer spend hours at Forfar station watching the many different locomotives: Forfar station no longer exists and at Dundee the aptly named Sprinters and more recently the 158 series of express trains have been introduced. I have an excellent brochure which I obtained from British Rail called <i>Speeding into the 90's.</i> I believe that my noble friend's department may choose a less controversial motto because, if we try that on our rubber tyres, it could involve us in a clash with the criminal courts. However, speeding into the 90s could be a very valuable motto for British Rail with the Type 158.<lb/>
I have ridden on two of the Type 158 routes. There are many advantages over the old type of stock, but the particular motto which seems appropriate is <i>mnltum in parvo.</i> It is far easier for me to get into some of the seats, even the first class ones, than it would be for my noble neighbour Lord Mackie. Space is at a premium. I found that the 158 was akin to being on an aeroplane. I tried to remove one of the plastic trays and everything fell into my lap. However, the speed and comfort of one's journey is more than reasonable and I hope and believe the reliability will also be increased.<lb/>
I have one minor gripe which I do not believe will necessarily concern my noble friend. The <i>Dundee Courier</i> on Saturday indicated that there is a fascinating problem with the Type 158. Your Lordships may be aware, although this has not happened over the past three winters, that in Scotland as well as large parts of England snow occasionally falls in winter. I understand that the Type 158 is not able to operate at full efficiency&#x2014;and indeed it is feared it may not be able to operate at all&#x2014;in falls of snow over six inches, or 15 centimetres, deep. In Scotland, with its routes to Aberdeen and Inverness, let alone between Edinburgh and Glasgow, falls of snow of that depth are commonplace in winter. That does not take into consideration the new service sampled by my noble friend Lord Mountevans and me
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0115"/>
<col>151</col>
over the old London and South-Western route, Waterloo to Exeter. That route also experiences harsh winters. I hope British Rail will consult the <i>Dundee Courier</i> report. We will pray for a mild winter, and hope to see efficient snow ploughs fixed to he front of the Type 158 so that it will be able to operate in the form and with the reliability that British Rail seek.<lb/>
I note the encouraging remarks and figures given by my noble friend. I congratulate him upon all that he and his department have done to help British Rail. Investment in new equipment, new track, new signals and the prospects for InterCity 225 and 250 are marvellous. However, I do not believe any of us should forget that it is the immense talent, enthusiasm and dedication of everyone who works in British Rail, from the chairman to the station manager in the Kyle of Lochalsh, Wick, Thurso and Mallaig&#x2014;all of those far flung areas in Scotland&#x2014;which contribute to a network that is already second to none. With the figures, comments and encouragement given by my noble friend and his right honourable friend. British Rail can go a long way to fulfil what is set out in the gracious Speech.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02950"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I turn to the environmental matter which most concerns me I should like to pick up a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Nugent. He was kind enough to refer to the traffic scheme proposed for Cambridge. I hate to disappoint the noble Lord but that particular traffic scheme caused a public outcry. I believe a lot of it is about to be dropped.<lb/>
That scheme included banning cycles from the centre of Cambridge city. It is a small city which at the last count had 60,000 cycles in regular use. Anyone who has been there in the morning when the students are changing lecture rooms, and have only a few minutes in which to do so, would realise the dismay caused by that particular part of the proposal. Therefore, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, that we need traffic engineers, but we need sensible ones with sensitivity to the local conditions, otherwise they will get nowhere.<lb/>
I turn to the environment part of the gracious Speech, which is the part with which I am most concerned. When my noble friend Lord Cledwyn moved the adjournment of the debate on the gracious Speech, he observed that the forthcoming programme appeared to be less burdensome than previous years&#x2014;those were his words. We all welcome that. However, there was one notable omission from the programme, a Bill for which many of us have been waiting and which many of us would not have found the least bit burdensome. I refer to the long promised legislation to safeguard common land. It will come as no surprise to the noble Baroness who is to wind up that I raise this matter.<lb/>
I should like to give the story so far. In 1958 the Royal Commission on Common Land published its report and made a number of recommendations to safeguard common land and improve public access to it. A necessary first step to its recommendations was to
<col>152</col>
compile registers of all common lands. That led to the passing of the Commons Registration Act 1965. Since then successive governments have expressed sympathy with the recommendations of the Royal Commission, but very little has happened.<lb/>
In 1975 the Department of the Environment set up an inter-departmental working group to make preparations for the next stage of legislation. That report was completed in 1978 and led to wide consultations with interested parties. The registration Act 1965, to which I referred, proved defective in practice. There was concern regarding the lack of progress on further legislation. In June 1983 the Open Spaces Society convened a national conference on the subject under the chairmanship of Sir John Cripps. Arising from that conference was the suggestion that interested parties should be brought together to consider how to make progress. In the autumn of 1983 the Countryside Commission set up the Common Land Forum.<lb/>
The forum first met in January 1984 and produced its report in May 1986. The forum membership was widely based. It included local authorities, conservation bodies, the Country Landowners' Association and the National Farmers Union, to mention just a few. In addition, over 150 papers were submitted by other individuals and organisations, including the organisation for game conservancy. Following the report of the forum some grouse moor owners felt that their interests had not been fully taken into account and formed the Moorlands Association to resist the recommendations in the report which they felt were detrimental to their operations.<lb/>
Long and difficult discussions ensued&#x2014;I put that mildly. Nevertheless, in the Conservative manifesto of May 1987 we find these words,
<quote>"We will legislate to safeguard common land on the basis of the Common Land Forum".</quote>
Since that time repeated Questions, both here and in another place, resulted in assurances that legislation was intended. I have found 15 such assurances and I am still counting.<lb/>
We are now debating what could well be the last gracious Speech of this Government's tenure, and there is still no sign of the promised legislation. I am informed that the main stumbling block is the Moorland Association's resistance to unrestricted access on foot to grouse moors. I understand the depth of feeling on the part of both those who ask for access and those who resist it. But while the arguments are raging commons are being lost; once lost they can never be regained.<lb/>
I plead with the Minister to put the disputed issues on hold and to bring in a short Bill to safeguard our remaining commons before it is too late. There is wide agreement on the need to safeguard what is left of our common land. At one time we had 1.5 million acres. That has now diminished to 1.3 million acres and diminishes further month by month.<lb/>
As privatisation progresses, such as the privatisation of the water industry where publicly owned land was removed from public ownership and where access
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0116"/>
<col>153</col>
therefore immediately became more difficult&#x2014;other measures are in the pipeline which have the same effect &#x2014;the remaining common land becomes more precious than ever. It is more important than ever that we should have access to it.<lb/>
I hope that the Minister will feel able to offer some encouragement that the last phrase of the gracious Speech,
<quote>"Other measures will be laid before you"</quote>
will include that short Bill which will save what is left of our common land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02951">5.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02952"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the great pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, with her wide experience on environmental matters. I am sure that the noble Lady will not be upset if I do not follow her down that path; she knows more about that than I, and I shall stick to my own personal subject.<lb/>
I most warmly welcome the gracious Speech which Her Majesty addressed to both Houses of Parliament last week, and in particular the paragraph beginning,
<quote>"My Government will promote improved efficiency and safety in transport",</quote>
as well as the other measures proposed.<lb/>
Noble Lords will recall that I had the privilege of introducing a debate on "Road Users and the Law" in April of last year. That was in response to the excellent report of Dr. Peter North into the road traffic law review. That was welcomed unanimously, and at last we shall be putting it into law. I said then and repeat now that when the Bill is passed by both Houses it will have a significant effect on the campaign to reduce road accidents, and the target for a one-third reduction in road casualties by the year 2000 should be accomplished.<lb/>
The latest accident statistics, published the week before last, regrettably show an upward trend in one or two areas. This is particularly so for total casualties, which are up 6 per cent. on the previous year&#x2014;the highest for 11 years. On the plus side, the drink-driving statistics show a downward trend. Nevertheless, the figure of 840 deaths is far too high. Total road accidents still account for 14 deaths and 1,000 injuries on the roads every day.<lb/>
We shall need to look carefully at the proposals when they come before us. Apart from the items given in the press over the past few days such as a dangerous driving offence replacing the reckless driving offence and the new offence of driving badly, both of which I welcome, I am pleased with the proposal for drivers to be convicted of speeding or traffic light offences on evidence obtained by the use of a video camera. Traffic light offences in London are appalling. Every day all types of vehicles blatantly break the law, and that can be extremely dangerous.<lb/>
I also hope that provision will be made for the strengthening of MoT regulations. To my mind there are far too many vehicles on the road which clearly should not be there. I hope that provision will be made
<col>154</col>
to cover lane discipline on motorways as well as lane speeds. We must cater for the vehicles travelling at very slow speeds, usually in the middle lane. Both areas need to be addressed and I look forward to seeing the Bill when it comes to us from another place. I shall give the Bill my full support as it is a measure that is long overdue.<lb/>
In the Autumn Statement last week I was pleased to see the increased commitment by Her Majesty's Government to easing congestion and providing high quality, safer transport. A rise to nearly &#x00A3;16 billion is proposed over the next three years an increase of &#x00A3;1.5 billion on last year&#x2014;with a rise of 25 per cent. in real terms for trunk roads and motorways, thus allowing for a much faster start to be made on motorway widening.<lb/>
I hope that the M.1 will be at the top of the list of priorities. Noble Lords will know that the northbound section from the M.25 to Northampton is extremely congested due to the weight of traffic. It is so bad that traffic comes to a complete halt. In the main that is due to the heavy lorries grinding their way up the hills. Much time and money could be saved if this section of the M.1 had a better traffic flow.<lb/>
I would also include the M.4 as an urgent priority. It may interest your Lordships to learn that last Friday, leaving at 2.30 p.m., it took me five hours to get to Bristol&#x2014;a distance of about 120 miles. I believe that the delay was due more than anything else to traffic management in a contraflow section.<lb/>
I was also pleased to see in the Autumn Statement that &#x00A3;7 million is to be spent on publicity campaigns to improve road safety and that an additional &#x00A3;10 million will be provided over the next three years for further safety campaigns directed at children. Although I am no longer president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, we have long campaigned for safety to be taught in schools, so this will go a long way towards meeting some of our requirements.<lb/>
I also warmly welcome the proposals to go ahead with the red routes in London. We all know that London is slowly grinding to a halt and I am sure that if this proposal is enforced, together with other proposals, the traffic flow in London will be greatly improved. To work and to be a success all the new legislation will have to be enforced so I hope that funds and people will be made available for that purpose; otherwise we shall be wasting our time. In regard to the red routes, I hope that provision will be made for emergency repairs whereby contractors' vehicles can get near to an emergency but not disrupt the flow of traffic.<lb/>
Another measure which I also welcome is the New Roads and Street Works Bill. This Bill has taken a long time to come forward but I know that the Utilities Group and the highways authorities have jointly developed a number of codes of practice which will form the basis of the Bill. I shall say no more on that subject as we shall be discussing the Bill in greater detail in 10 days' time.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0117"/>
<col>155</col>
All the measures announced in the gracious Speech, together with the increased funding, should go a long way towards making our roads much safer and less congested for road users. I congratulate my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02954"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sympathise with the noble Lord, Lord Brougham, in the problems that he had last Friday on the M.4. I believe the delay was due to a lorry crashing and burning out on a contraflow section. It will give the noble Lord no pleasure to learn that that same accident not only caused a 25-mile tailback on the M.4 but completely seized up the traffic in Reading and Newbury for the whole of Friday evening&#x2014;indeed, until very late in the evening. Therefore, it is clear that measures must be taken to avoid such accidents occurring and during the course of my speech I shall put forward some suggestions which I hope will achieve that.<lb/>
It was, and always is, a great pleasure to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon. He is so reasonable. He puts everything so nicely. Indeed, on this occasion even his message was to some extent acceptable on all sides of the House. Therefore, I can tell him that I enjoyed his speech and that I welcomed it. However, the fact is that we are now suffering from the results of many years of neglect. I remember in the late 1950s and earl y 1960s we had the phrase "private affluence and public squalor". Now of course we have squalor in both areas. However, it is the public squalor that is causing considerable difficulty in so many of our services, particularly transport.<lb/>
Over the past 10 years we have had the enormous bonus of North Sea oil. We have had &#x00A3;80,000 million of revenue from North Sea oil, but during the whole of that period, when we should have been building up and improving our infrastructure, we have failed to do so. Therefore, there is so much more to be done to make good that neglect.<lb/>
I have already said that the latest announcements of increases in road and rail transport expenditure are to be welcomed, but I have to say, and repeat, that it is too little and far too late. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that I enjoyed the noble Lord's speech, we see the Government's continuing failure fully to realise that, short of road pricing&#x2014;there are many difficulties about that; and I say that advisedly to the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, and to my noble friend Lord McIntosh &#x2014;an enormous improvement in public transport of all forms is the only answer to the massive traffic congestion that is throttling our major towns and cities. That congestion is adding to health dangers, especially for people living on main roads.<lb/>
The projected increase in car ownership by the year 2006 shows a minimum of 28.3 million cars on the road compared with the present 20 million. Some estimates go so far as to project a doubling in car ownership to 40 million by the year 2006. Clearly such an increase in traffic cannot be accommodated without enormous damage to the environment and to our quality of life and at a crippling cost to public funds. Therefore, we must seek to ensure that such as
<col>156</col>
scenario is avoided. To achieve that, road transport will have to become much dearer in real terms and public transport much cheaper and more readily available. In addition, older cars which cannot meet safety and environmental standards should be phased out over a shorter timescale than at present. That is not going to be popular but it is one of the options that will have to be considered.<lb/>
I now come to the railways. I have had some awful experiences with railways, having represented Swindon. I saw the closure of the Swindon railway workshops. The following week its products were required but the workshops had been wilfully closed down. When I first became the Member of Parliament for Swindon I had complaints from places like Faringdon that there were heavy transporter vehicles taking body shells from Pressed Steel Fisher in Swindon to Longbridge. I was most incensed about it. I contacted the firm and asked why it did not send the body shells by rail. The company said that it would love to but British Rail would not accept the traffic. Who would credit that British Rail would not accept the traffic, although there were sidings at Pressed Steel Fisher in Swindon and at Longbridge? Eventually the company did send the bodies by rail but only because of my intervention at the highest possible level.<lb/>
It may be that that kind of thinking is still prevalent in British Rail. There is still a failure to understand and to get to grips with the needs of travellers. There have been enormous fare increases and cuts in the frequency and quality of services. Countless numbers of people have been driven back to using their cars, hence the greater congestion in London and the desire of 50 per cent. of the people to get out of London in order to live elsewhere. The British Railways Board still does not seem to understand that travellers are customers who are buying something from British Rail. They deserve to be treated like customers and should be encouraged and respected. There is a failure by British Rail to grasp the opportunities that exist to move freight.<lb/>
The railways and the Government should realise that every heavy lorry displaced is a bonus to other travellers on the roads and reduces congestion in our towns and cities. The railways have an enormous advantage which does not seem to be understood by British Rail. If one goes to see the chairman one is told that 80 per cent. of the traffic must be carried by road. However, 1 per cent. extra carried by rail would make an enormous difference. For example, most large towns and cities have a railway station in the centre. Properly organised, it would be possible to use town centre railway stations and yards to receive the goods for supplying the shops. That in turn would virtually eliminate monster 40-tonne vehicles from town centres and approach roads. They do enormous damage not only to the environment and people's lives but to the roads themselves.<lb/>
I now turn to the measures to improve traffic management. These are often frustrated not only by road engineers. I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Nugent. The road engineers pore over computer programs and out-of-date maps. They never get out
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0118"/>
<col>157</col>
by the side of the road to see what is happening to the traffic. They do not seem to realise that there is congestion when they say there is none and that there is no congestion when they say that there is. I agree absolutely with the noble Lord. He has described the situation absolutely spot on.<lb/>
The problems of traffic management are often aggravated by quarrelling local authorities and the conflicting policies followed within the local authorities themselves. I live in Reading. On the one hand, the local authority, is urging the county council, which is the highways authority, to take measures to reduce the number of cars coming into the town centre. That is absolutely right and I agree with it. On the other hand, in connection with another development it is planned to increase the number of car-parking spaces by 2000. What can be sillier than to tell people on the one hand that fewer cars are wanted in the town centre and, on the other, to make plans to accommodate extra cars?<lb/>
The local authorities need to understand exactly what they are doing. The pricing policy in Reading and in many other towns is in favour of bringing in the car. It is half as expensive to bring in a car as it is to travel into the town centre by public transport. If public transport is to be encouraged, the reverse has to be the situation. Public transport has to be cheaper and as convenient as coming in by car.<lb/>
We have heard about red routes, dangerous driving, speeding and so forth. I support all these measures because they are absolutely right. However, they will be completely useless unless they are properly and rigidly enforced. At the present time the great problem is that the measures we already have are not rigidly enforced. One has only to travel along a motorway to see heavy lorries speeding along at 80 and 90 miles an hour only a few yards behind private cars to know that the existing regulations are not being enforced.<lb/>
I believe that before anyone is allowed behind the wheel of a heavy lorry he should be given intelligence and psychological tests. The behaviour of drivers on our motorways and other roads is frightening and should be dealt with. I have considerable sympathy with the police. They have had duties imposed on them by government, this House and another place which are far beyond their capacity. The police say that they cannot enforce various measures.<lb/>
I have another experience concerning Reading. There is a need for a peak hour bus lane. However, because the police say that they cannot enforce it, the local authority is now proposing a 24-hour bus lane. We have reached a situation where local authorities are imposing regulations that are 10 times more draconian than they need be because the police say that they cannot enforce the lesser measures. Something has to be done about that. All kinds of regulations are blatantly ignored; we see that happening every day.<lb/>
I make a suggestion which is not new. However, it is time to take it seriously. The normal police force simply cannot cope with the load of criminal work and
<col>158</col>
traffic enforcement work as well. We have reached a stage where we need separate traffic police. I know that there are arguments against that and I know of the problems involved. But it is time that we examined this measure as a serious proposition. A traffic police force would not only enforce the law but advise and educate as well. I should like to hear from the Government that they believe that this is a proposition which deserves examination in the months and perhaps years ahead. I am sure that I speak for all noble Lords on this side of the House when I say that so long as the Government bring forward decent measures for dealing with the present traffic nightmare they will certainly get our support.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02956"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest in that I am in receipt of a small pension from British Rail. Noble Lords will probably realise by now that when the subject of the railways comes up I tend to defend British Rail. I am not quite sure that I shall do so today. I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, because I agreed with almost everything he said. I should like to commiserate with him on one point. He said that he lives in Reading. I once tried to shop in Reading. I inquired my way there three times but each time I became lost. I gave it up and have never been back. Indeed I never intend to go back there unless I absolutely have to.<lb/>
I too enjoyed the Minister's speech. However, I felt that he saw the future of transport and of the environment through rose-coloured spectacles, which is possibly better than the way the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, sees it. He seems to be building castles in the air about a future Labour government but I believe that they are castles made of sand.<lb/>
I shall speak mainly on transport but I shall refer to the environment where it affects transport. I should like to mention Red Star. I cannot understand why people use private delivery vans for getting goods quickly around the country when, as the noble Lord said, most towns have central stations where people can take their goods. They can then be sent quickly and fairly inexpensively to their destination by Red Star.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said that he has seen heavy goods vehicles driving on the motorway at between 80 and 90 miles an hour. I do not believe that the average heavy goods vehicle can travel at those speeds. I am talking about heavy goods vehicles whose drivers require an HGV licence. In my experience the drivers certainly have brains. If one gives them a little room they are almost without exception courteous and very safe drivers. Coaches and light vans are driven in a terrible way. Their drivers are absolute shockers. But I travel a good deal on motorways and I have never seen a heavy goods vehicle travelling at the speeds mentioned by the noble Lord.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord 100 per cent. about the need for traffic police. It is the obvious answer. I shall refer later in my speech to the number of times the law
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0119"/>
<col>159</col>
is disregarded by the public and by the police. It is obvious that what we require is a dedicated traffic police force.<lb/>
I travel almost every day on what is now Network SouthEast. I use the Basingstoke service from Fleet. Our trains almost always arrive on time. This morning of course the train was five minutes late. We normally arrive on time and we seldom have cancellations. It is a very good service. The rolling stock is old. If one travels first-class one sometimes finds that there are no light bulbs, that the seat covers are torn and that there are no ash trays in the one and only smoking compartment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02957"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl referred to the fact that there is only one smoking compartment on his train. I sympathise with him. I believe that there ought to be far more smoking carriages as smokers represent 33 per cent. of the population.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02958"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I meant to say that there is a single smoking compartment in first-class and one in ordinary class.<lb/>
When I travel into London the trains are normally fairly empty. Nearly always there is a ticket collector on the train. Coming back in the evening the first-class smoking compartment will more often than not be full. When we reach the first stop, almost all the other passengers leap out. One can guarantee that very few if any of those passengers have first-class tickets but they know that there are no ticket collectors. Once or twice in the next few months I should like to see British Rail putting a ticket inspector in each of the first-class compartments leaving Waterloo. British Rail would increase its revenue and it might frighten off quite a few people and stop them travelling first-class with a second-class ticket.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, said that everyone admires French railways but that people think our railways are terrible. I do not think that is true. Southern. Region is the most highly utilised railway system in the world and has the lowest subsidy. In future, trains will come from all over Europe at high speed. They will go through the Channel Tunnel and for the most part will be fed into the existing track network on Southern Region. If that happens, high-speed trains will be tangled up with commuter traffic and they will creep into London. If we are to have dedicated toll roads, a matter we shall discuss on 20th November, why cannot we have a dedicated twin track from the port into London? Private enterprise could pay for it and could run all the channel traffic. Everyone would benefit.<lb/>
I use the Underground every day. What appalls me is not the standard of service but the graffiti. It is obvious that nearly all the graffiti on the outside of the trains is rut there in depots. Those who put it there do not do so from platforms. That would be dangerous and would be rather easy to spot. I suggest that the British Transport Police should have watchmen at their depots.<lb/>
We now have automatic ticket barriers, which seem to be working very well. If one has not paid one's fare
<col>160</col>
or one does not have the right fare, the gates will not open and one has therefore to buy a ticket. I should like to know what increase in revenue per thousand passengers has been produced as a result of the money going to the Underground and not into the pockets of ticket collectors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02959"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: Oh&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02960"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I should say a high proportion of the fares collected goes into the pockets of ticket collectors.<lb/>
A report appeared in the press the other day which stated that some new H-registration vehicles failed an exhaust emission test. If that can happen to brand new cars, I hate to think what is happening in respect of the majority of other cars. My own car dates back to 1980. I had it converted so that it would run on green petrol. It has recently passed its MoT. However, you have only to look at some of the cars on the roads in London today to see what is happening. I come from North Hampshire, where I have thousands of acres of Ministry of Defence land with its clean air, but when you come into London and breathe the air it really stinks.<lb/>
I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, mentioned bus lanes. If noble Lords go outside the House and turn left at a time when the bus lanes are in operation, they will seldom see a bus there; but they will see any number of private cars. However, the police do nothing about the situation.<lb/>
I should like now to deal with speeding on the motorways, but not by HGVs. I know that the A.3 is not a motorway, but it has three lanes each way. When I was travelling on that road yesterday I saw a motor cyclist approaching. As he went past I estimated his speed to be about 120 mph. Obviously the driver in a police car parked on the hard shoulder had similar thoughts. The police car took off. The motor cyclist saw the flashing lights and promptly took the next slip road. I saw him hurtling around a corner to the left, with the police car vainly trying to keep up with him.<lb/>
On another occasion on the same road I was overtaken by a Porsche which was obviously doing well over the ton. However, the police managed to catch that one. When I caught up with them, the driver was being dealt with. There is an increasing disregard for the law on the roads. People are always jumping the traffic lights. For example, if you wait for the lights to turn green the chances are that someone in the car behind you will flash his lights or honk his horn. Drivers cross the red lights, not just as the lights are changing. They do so deliberately. It is dangerous and there are accidents.<lb/>
If you drive along the roads today you notice cars which have only one brake light or otherwise are without their full complement of lights. In my experience modern Volvos, which have their lights on all the time and therefore overuse the light bulbs, are among the worst offenders. If you are travelling along a road in the dark and you see one brake light, you are entitled to think that a motor cycle is ahead of you, but possibly when it is too late you may find that it is not.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02961"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. I feel I must speak up on behalf of the police. Last week I urged my driver to move into the bus lane outside the House because I did not want to be late for my train at Liverpool Street station. He did as he was told. However, he was caught by a policeman when he turned the corner in Parliament Square. I wonder whether I was unlucky or whether the noble Earl is especially lucky in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02962"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must tell the noble Baroness that I do not travel in the bus lane and therefore I do not need to be lucky. In my experience, her driver was unlucky. In any event, he should have pointed out to her that if he did as he was told he would be breaking the law. However, it is easy to say that when one has not been caught.<lb/>
I turn now to the deregulation of buses. As noble Lords will no doubt recall, when this matter was discussed in your Lordships' House my noble friend Lord Tordoff and myself, among others, pointed out what would happen if buses were deregulated. What we claimed would happen has in fact happened. According to a recent report there has been a 16 per cent. reduction in bus services in some areas and a 6.5 per cent. reduction in the shires. There are no timetables. People do not know where the buses start from or when they run. Moreover, buses in the city tend to operate in packs during the rush hour. They do not connect with the trains. The situation is abysmal. We said that such things would happen and they have happened. God help us&#x0021;<lb/>
I am nearing the conclusion of my speech, but I should just like to mention London taxis. When I travel by taxi I always try to talk to the drivers. I ask them about the traffic congestion in London. They always say the same thing. I shall try to paraphrase what they say. They say, "Well, guy, there is one simple answer: it is parking. If you stopped illegal parking in narrow streets, and where people should not park, the traffic would run very much easier". I believe that to be true.<lb/>
Taxi drivers have also suggested that new rules should be introduced to cover cabbies which would ensure that, when they pass the knowledge test and receive a licence, they work out in the provinces for a given period of time before being allowed to ply for hire in London. The cabbies think that is a good idea. I do not believe that it is a matter of greed because, as everyone knows, when you try to find a cab there are never quite enough of them available.<lb/>
I believe that the Government's proposals for transport are good, hut, as I said when I started, I wish that they would take off their rose-tinted glasses.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02964"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend on the Front Bench indicated, I shall speak mostly on the issue of housing. However, I cannot resist pausing for a moment in order to say something about transport, although much has been said today about that as regards both the railways and the roads. I travel down to London each week by InterCity.
<col>162</col>
However, for two or three weeks now there has been no InterCity service available from Manchester: it is not the first time that has happened. It seems that every time re-rostering is introduced, an industrial dispute takes place and the poor bloody travellers, as we call them, are left waiting on the station platform, twiddling their thumbs in an effort to get down to London.<lb/>
I do not wish to become involved in an industrial dispute as I understand that there is a possibility that the present dispute may have been settled today. However, if we want to encourage people to use the railways and keep them off the motorways, that type of nonsense must come to an end. Someone needs kicking up the backside. People are becoming sick and tired of the situation and of having to make alternative arrangements.<lb/>
I turn now to the question of housing. Some noble Lords may remember that in the debate last year I spoke on the same subject. If you are talking about the environment, I believe that housing is one of the most important parts of a person's environment&#x2014;if not the most important part&#x2014;because if people have homes they live in them. Of course, there are many who do not have homes.<lb/>
In the debate last year I indicated some of the immense problems with which we are faced as a nation. I believe that if a child has the bad luck to be housed very poorly, it usually happens in an area where education is also not too good. Therefore, children suffer from the start with deprivation in two aspects of life. It is very difficult for children, even if they are bright and intelligent, to make the best of their abilities when the first six or seven years of their life are spent in such an environment. In my opinion it scars the future of such children and leaves them with scars that cannot be totally removed.<lb/>
Last year I quoted some figures, and at the risk of being repetitive I have to say that I believe they should be quoted again. Half a million fewer houses are being built by local authorities than would have been built if the system existing in 1979 had continued. By this year there would have been nearly 600,000 more houses available for letting in the public sector.<lb/>
I quoted figures last year, not from political organisations but from charitable organisations grappling with the problem. They do not relate to homelessness, because that is still growing inexorably. It was calculated more than 12 months ago that 10,000 people were sleeping rough in the City of London. One can scale that down for other major cities, depending upon the size of the city. It was calculated that at the then rate of expansion in the numbers of people sleeping in cardboard boxes and doorways, London would be faced with a situation similar to that of New York with 30,000 people sleeping on the streets.<lb/>
That may sound daft, but during the time that I have been a Member of another place and of your Lordships' House, I have seen things happening in London that I never thought would happen. One has only to walk along the Strand and other similar areas. The problem is with us and it is worsening. Major
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0121"/>
<col>163</col>
cities such as Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Birmingham now have nearer 30,000 rather than 20,000 families on their housing waiting lists. That does not reflect the numbers of single young people who have nowhere to go. That is the present dimension of the problem.<lb/>
What is the latest information? Only this morning I received a publication from the Institute of Housing. It is one that I receive regularly as no doubt do other Members of your Lordships' House. It contains details of a report for the London Housing Associations Council which states:
<quote>"Current policies will condemn nearly half a million London households to homelessness, bed and breakfast hotels, temporary and otherwise unacceptable accommodation by 1995. The report's authors calculate that by 1995 there will be a total of 645,000 households in housing need in the capital unable to rent privately or buy. Over the same period, total lord authority and housing associations new lettings in the capital will be only 223,400, the report estimates. This leaves a shortfall of 421,600 so-called rented units".</quote>
That is the progress we are making: we are going backwards by any yardstick one chooses to use.<lb/>
That report calls for an input of &#x00A3;33 billion to deal with the problem which it says is far too big for the local authorities, housing associations (charitable or otherwise) or the private rented sector to hope to deal with. That illustrates the dimension of the problem. I hope that we will hear something from the Government shortly about how they intend to deal with the situation. The local authorities have ample funds available, but unfortunately to a great degree they are locked in. They are denied the use of them. The last figure I saw relating to receipts from the sale of council houses alone was between &#x00A3;2 billion and &#x00A3;3 billion. The maximum that the local authorities are allowed to use in any one year is 20 per cent.. I do not understand the logic of not unlocking that money and using it 10 build houses.<lb/>
Any section of the media one cares to look at&#x2014;for example, trade journals or the business section of the press &#x2014;claims that the building industry is in one hell of a mess. There is talk of 100,000 redundancies in the next 12 months. If we are to provide the structure to enable our people to live in a wholesome environment, the most potent tool is a highly skilled, large and efficient building sector. If the projection for the near future is that 100,000 people will become unemployed in the building sector in the next 12 months, the prospect is bleak.<lb/>
I want to know what the Government intend doing about the housing programme. Under the leadership of the present Prime Minister we have had almost as many&#x2014;may be more&#x2014;Ministers of Housing as we have had Foreign Secretaries and Chancellors of the Exchequers. The Minister has brought in a little extra money&#x2014;a couple of hundred million pounds. One may say that that is a great deal of money, but it is peanuts compared to what has been taken away since 1979. It is like the burglar who puts back in the till a little of the money that he had taken on a previous occasion.<lb/>
The Minister made a press statement on 23rd October. I understand that he made the original
<col>164</col>
statement at the Conservative Party conference. He announced that tenants of new town houses were to be allowed to buy on a rental basis. It is a complex statement, and I received it only today. It means that such people will be able to continue to pay rent. They will receive some price reduction but not the full discount that someone buying outright will receive. The Government of course are the Government for all sections of the community, or so they say. But the scheme is open only to people who pay the full rent. In other words, if someone receives the smallest help from the public purse towards housing himself and his family, such a person is disbarred from that scheme; and that is the scheme of a government who wanted to throw open housing to everyone. I do not know whether that scheme will have to come before another place and your Lordships' House before it is introduced. It is one which will require some study.<lb/>
I mentioned the building industry earlier. I sometimes wonder why it is always to the fore with its contributions towards the Conservative Party election fund and in keeping the Conservative Party going. I do not know whether it is on the basis that people may become ennobled or knighted. It cannot be on the basis of any economic benefit that the industry will receive from the Government. I have always been interested in building and so for many years I have been invited to the Building Employers Confederation annual dinner. Each year I have listened to a succession of Cabinet Ministers from this Government. Most of them have now gone. I have listened to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lawson; Mr. Biffin when he was Leader of the House; the present Chancellor; and the right honourable Cecil Parkinson. The same speech was used every year. It was, "How marvellously we are doing, and how well the Government are doing for the building industry". The fawning was nauseating. No reason was ever given why those Ministers should make such speeches. My noble friend and colleague Lord Stoddart, who has left the Chamber, referred to this matter as I did in a Question a few weeks ago, concerning the new money that has been made available to the Government which no other Chancellor of the Exchequer has previously had. I am talking about North Sea oil revenue and privatisation. As I understand it, it has put nearly &#x00A3;100 billion in the coffers of the Government since 1979.<lb/>
The interesting point to put to the Government is: why is housing in such a mess? On the last Local Government and Housing Bill in this House my noble friend and colleague on our Front Bench, Lord McIntosh, and I pressed the Government strongly about the situation of homeless people. The Government made it quite clear that they would be catered for by the private rented sector because the new Act would make it so attractive for private owners of property that they could not refuse to rent to people. That did not happen. It has never happened, it will not happen and it is a total failure. More people are being made homeless; there are more people without adequate accommodation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0122"/>
<col>165</col>
Lastly, I wish to turn to something mentioned today by my noble friend and colleague Lady Nicol. Public open space land which ought to be kept for the public has been taken into private ownership. I shall cite a particular case. The area in which I spent most of my life was East Manchester. A wonderful part of it started in Gorton, a strict working-class area, in Debdale Park. The area crossed the borders into Denton and was owned by the old waterworks department of Manchester City Council. There were three or four beautiful reservoirs, surrounded by adequate land, and parts of it became known as a famous walk through. It was a beautiful area. Only a few weeks ago I took my two grandsons through Debdale Park. I do not live in Manchester now but the way the park has been kept is a credit to the city. During the passage of the Bill to privatise the water industry I recall my noble friends Lord McIntosh and Lord Graham warning the Government of the consequences of privatising that industry and what the purchasers would do with the land.<lb/>
Surprise, surprise: the predators who bought that chunk of privatised land committed daylight robbery. Let me make the point once again that it was originally paid for out of public funds, mainly by the original ratepayers in Manchester&#x2014;this was started by a Tory-controlled council. The land was taken from the people without one penny in compensation. It was daylight robbery legalised by another place and this House. The people who have got hold of it now have a marvellous free development scheme which will take up all this beautiful land. "Oh, well", they say, "we will compensate and give you somewhere else. You will have to go where we shift you".<lb/>
I have to tell the Minister that if this scheme proceeds and comes to the Secretary of State for final adjudication, if there is a possible compulsory purchase with a public inquiry, the people of the area and further afield who find it the only recreation area within reach will be absolutely outraged. The Government cannot say that they were not warned. The predators in the water industry do just this sort of thing. This is the first example. I hope that when the matter comes to the Government they will say no as quickly as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02966"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that the gracious Speech contained no mention of local government finance. As your Lordships will know, local government finance is now composed of the poll tax, the uniform business rate and the revenue support grant, a new financial map designed to increase local accountability.<lb/>
The poll tax has turned out to be divisive, regressive, expensive and, with its transitional arrangements and safety nets, opaque. Even those who gain by it think it unfair. However, we cannot today hope to change the present Government's views on this. As my noble friend Lord McIntosh rightly said, it awaits a change of government. However, there is one aspect that we may ask the Government to review, even now.<lb/>
<col>166</col>
At the core of the poll tax is the insistence that every voter must pay at least 20 per cent. In an authority like mine, 25 per cent. of the population&#x2014;students, the young unemployed, women carers, the elderly and infirm and single parents&#x2014;are required to pay that 20 per cent. Collecting it from the quarter of the population accounts for well over one-third of our soaring poll tax costs, to provide just 5 per cent. of poll tax income.<lb/>
To put it another way, if we take the figure of &#x00A3;1.15 built into income support and note that some people need to pay weekly or fortnightly, from that &#x00A3;1.15, 43p will go on the giro payment and 30p on back-up administration, leaving 40p for services; that is, if the young mobile do not move. However, as the Audit Commission shows, up to 50 per cent. will move in a year. As the housing market improves, the number will increase. The six compulsory letters that it takes to register a change of address&#x2014;all required by the Government&#x2014;at &#x00A3;2 or &#x00A3;3 per time wipe out that 40p.<lb/>
If the tenant does not tell us, as is likely, and we have to re-canvass, we get into losses. If we have to chase arrears on a couple of payments, as is highly likely, those losses mount. That is to say nothing of second moves, court hearings and liability orders. The Audit Commission estimates that there will be 3 to 4 million court hearings next year, and rising. In other words, the more dutiful local authorities are in pursuing the 20 per cent. payers, the more money they are likely to lose. The burden therefore falls on other poll tax payers. I ask noble Lords, is this sensible?<lb/>
Every local authority treasurer I know wishes to abolish the 20 per cent. minimum payment, removing at a stroke one-third or more of our paperwork. It would reduce harassment, probably be financially neutral and make a modest and much needed gesture towards equity. Can we hope that the Government will reflect on this?<lb/>
The second element in local authority finance is the uniform business rate. For next year the Government have raised the poundage by 10.9 per cent. in line with inflation, but the yield will be up by 20 per cent.&#x2014;from &#x00A3;10.4 billion to &#x00A3;12.4 billion&#x2014;at a time of penal interest rates and growing recession. That is a burden that no local authority sensitive to its business community would have dreamt of imposing. The UBR is paid in on a national poundage and out on a population basis. The North rightly gains, but what about elsewhere? If we separate UBR from aggregate Exchequer finance, we find that the inner London boroughs pay in more than they did under local business rates and get out far less.<lb/>
Who are the gainers?&#x2014;the prosperous rural districts of Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Hampshire, Essex and Cambridgeshire, not the most obvious recipients of regional aid. Behind that, however, is a deeper problem presented by UBR. In the past, Labour cities like my own worked in close partnership with local business. On its behalf, we invested in a local regional airport, in starter units, in training schemes for young people and in key worker accommodation, not just for the jobs but for the long-term wealth, rateable values and revenues that would flow to our city over time.<lb/>

That has gone. Whether or not we aid our business community now makes no difference to the UBR we receive. Why, then, should local authorities bother? Why should we ask local poll tax payers to fund aid to industry when the net result is not a benefit to the local authority but an increase in poll tax? I should have expected this Government above all to have sought to bind local authorities to their local economic communities, to strengthen that partnership. UBR has severed it. Is that sensible?<lb/>
I turn, thirdly, to central government grant and capping. In 1981&#x2013;1982 central government contributed 59 per cent. to relevant local expenditure. By 1989&#x2013;90, the last year of rates, that had fallen to 43 per cent. I remind your Lordships that had that contribution kept its value local rates would have risen by less than inflation in the 1980s. Rates rose to compensate for the withdrawal of government grant and local authorities then found themselves "fingered" when they sought to make good that shortfall. For next year the equivalent figure is lower still, 35 per cent., equivalent to another &#x00A3;84 on the average poll tax bill.<lb/>
With the latest poll tax capping statement of a week or so ago I suggest that local accountability has vanished. Any authority that spends more than its standard spending assessment and 9 per cent. over last year's budget may be capped. However, 84 per cent. of all local authorities, including nearly three-quarters of all Conservative authorities, last year spent more than their standard spending assessment. The increase this year in SSAs for districts is less than the increase last year in their SSA spending. The 9 per cent. is less than inflation. The Government's capping criteria assume 100 per cent. collection&#x2014;although, according to the Audit Commission, the poll tax figures so far suggest that it will be less than 90 per cent. or another &#x00A3;20 on poll tax bills. Local authorities have had new duties imposed on them concerning food, litter and dogs and face additional costs such as the teachers' pay settlement and the increased cost of housing benefit. The criteria for capping under-estimate inflation, over-estimate collection and ignore new duties and new costs. It is clear, therefore, that local authorities up and down this land face universal capping. They are not volunteering for it but they face it.<lb/>
Does educating and training a youngster, employing the construction workers referred to so eloquently by my noble friend Lord Dean, or mending a road really damage our national health, wealth and wellbeing? As Dr. David King, a recent economic adviser to the Government, has pointed out, central government justifies their cuts and their cappings by alleging that tax-raising powers threaten national economic prosperity. However, as Dr. King points out, the OECD figures for 1985 suggest precisely the opposite. They show that the eight most prosperous countries by GNP give local government considerable tax-raising powers while the eight poorest, from Turkey to the UK, give very little. We might ponder on that, my Lords.<lb/>
More damaging still, however, universal capping gives the Secretary of State the majority vote in every
<col>168</col>
council in this country. The only choice the local authority has is to do what the Government want and to have what the Government choose. So why have local government? As my noble friend Lord McIntosh said in his opening remarks, we have it because local communities, as your Lordships well know, have different needs, different problems and different aspirations. Local government is about that local difference. Capping denies its very essence.<lb/>
This summer I was privileged to work in Bulgaria with MPs and presidential advisers as they invented local government in that country. Bulgaria is a country where, in the absence of voluntary organisations and local government, the sense of citizenship is somewhat fragile, represented by tacit membership of the CP. Bulgaria is rebuilding itself and doing so, in part, by inventing local government. It is recognised that the sense of active citizenship it confers, the moral adulthood it presumes, the local diversity it recognises and the local accountability it cherishes are all essential to healthy democracy. What Bulgaria is learning we seem to be throwing away.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02968"><member>Lord Mountevans</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we were told in the gracious Speech that Her Majesty's Government would promote improved efficiency and safety in public transport. We were also given a legislative programme. Since that speech there has been the Autumn Statement. That gives those of us who are speaking in this debate a great advantage because it announced record levels of investment in road and rail. In addition, we have heard my noble friend's speech this afternoon amplifying Her Majesty's Government's plans. It will come as no surprise to noble Lords who have heard me declare my interest over the years if I concentrate on the public transport elements of today's debate.<lb/>
In the course of my station judging itinerary I looked not only at stations but also at trains in order to develop a yardstick for measuring how British Rail was performing in the autumn of 1990. In terms of the targets that the Secretary of State set, one first of all looks at reliability: does the train run? Of the 90 or so trains that I used every train ran. One also considers punctuality. Of those trains, 85 were on time or within two minutes of the scheduled time. Some were early, only three were badly late, and the worst delay that I suffered was on a Highland Omnibuses bus. They were also clean, in spite of the great British public's ability to leave litter behind.<lb/>
I also set other objectives, which the Secretary of State probably feels are not of such importance. I looked to see whether the advertised catering was available. It was always provided. I considered the use of public address systems, which is particularly important to blind passengers who cannot read station names or posters. Where a public address system was provided it was regularly used. That is a great improvement.<lb/>
Lastly, I looked at the question of revenue protection. If, as British Rail says, it is losing &#x00A3;50 million per annum from fare dodging it is of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0124"/>
<col>169</col>
paramount importance that tickets are checked regularly, particularly on trains. With the exception of two-mile or three-mile journeys in metropolitan areas, I am happy to say that tickets were checked very regularly. British Rail staff appear to be concentrating on that: the message has got through. It is good that that message has got through because if a fare dodger gets away with it, it is we as fare payers, taxpayers or poll tax payers who end up paying the difference.<lb/>
Lastly, there was scarcely a journey that I made or a station that I judged which did not show evidence of recent investment or investment in progress. I cannot say that stations showed evidence of investment that was to come because I might be shooting myself in the foot. There is a vast amount of investment in the railways. That is good. The investment planned, which my noble friend reminded us is running at record levels, seems to me to be about right.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, <i>en passant</i> asked for higher levels of investment. However, we should be very careful before we go down that track. Sir Robert Reid, the former Chairman of British Rail, said in the spring that British Rail could not supervise higher levels of investment, a statement which so far as I know has not been denied publicly by his successor.<lb/>
There is the question of safety and the implications of the Clapham and King's Cross reports and the calls for additional spending on safety. Safety was regarded as paramount by both the Sir Roberts. It is regarded as paramount by almost everybody in public transport. The noble Lord, Lord King, has said that safety is paramount; Michael Bishop has said that safety is paramount. We must make sure when we invest in safety that we go forward with a degree of knowledge behind us, almost prudence, so that we achieve that utter safety that we all wish to see on rail.<lb/>
We need especially to take account of the human factor. What brings this to mind is that after each recent accident the unions have been quick to persuade, and the media have been quick to be persuaded, that we need more expenditure, greatly increased expenditure, on safety. But Purley was a human factor accident. Bellgrove was a human factor accident. Stafford was a human factor accident. Reading was a human factor accident. They were all, I believe, cases of drivers, for whatever reason, running through red lights.<lb/>
I am aware that British Rail is, with the unions, looking hard at this. I have a great friend who is what might be called British Rail's divisional surgeon for the Southampton area, and he is spending a lot of his time looking into this to try to get to the bottom of why it happens. He is having to establish why people run red lights&#x2014;and after all motorists run red lights far more than trains run red lights. A red traffic light in this country nowadays, despite what the Highway Code says, is regarded almost as advisory rather than mandatory. You have only to stand at the crossroads at the end of Bridge Street to see just how frequently that happens.<lb/>
<col>170</col>
We must get to the root of the problem and then find out what mechanical or technical means we can adapt and practise to protect drivers and to protect passengers. When we have sorted that out, we must welcome the fact that Her Majesty's Government have given both British Rail and London Regional Transport all the spending authority they need for safety investment. But I hope that that investment is not committed until we have got to the root of the problem.<lb/>
The third reason why we should be prudent in our investment strategy with regard to British Rail, London Transport and the many light railways that I welcome in our provincial cities is the fact that British Rail, London Transport and the light railway undertakings are only commissioners of investment work. We must make sure that the supplier side of the equation, which will be largely produced by the private sector, is in place.<lb/>
Those of us who remember the 1955 and subsequent year investment plan will also know that many of the suppliers, for example, of rolling stock are no longer trading. Let us look at the North British Railway Company at Springburn in Glasgow and also at St. Rollox; the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in Birmingham; BTH and English Electric, who flanked me when I was at school at Rugby. English Electric is still trading but those two other manufacturing points have closed down. Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon is no longer in the supply of rolling stock. It is only in the repair business. Metropolitan Vickers has also gone. Before we call for more investment we must remember the supply constraint. This is not only in terms of the rolling stock but also in terms of civil engineering ability, and not least&#x2014;and I come back to safety&#x2014;in terms of signalling.<lb/>
We must also look at the quality of life, because if we look forward five or six years under present plans, and subject to private legislation to come before your Lordships' House, we would in inner London have Crossrail, which I utterly welcome; the east-west link from Paddington to Liverpool Street. Either that or the Channel Tunnel rail link could be the 20th century version of the Forth Bridge&#x2014;a really major railway achievement.<lb/>
I hope that we shall have King's Cross International. We have the Jubilee Line extension going on. We have London Regional Transport's station reconstructions at Victoria, at Angel, at London Bridge, at Holborn and at Oxford Circus, together&#x2014;and let us not forget this&#x2014;with all the roadworks that go on and are mentioned elsewhere in the Queen's Speech.<lb/>
Should we really be asking for more investment, higher investment levels, or should we, as I believe, make sure that investment levels take account of the industry's ability to supply, of our own day-to-day requirements in life and of, dare I say it, proper planning? I understand that the British Rail and LRT investment programmes will no longer be year to year but will become more a 10-year view, like the building of warships. I think that this is highly welcome.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0125"/>
<col>171</col>
The gracious Speech lists four transport Bills of nationwide importance. There is no Lord Parry in his seat so I can ignore the Severn Bridge. One is to encourage privately financed roads, which is to be utterly welcomed provided that the terms and conditions encourage such projects. I hope that we have all learnt from the shambles, for want of a better word, of the attempt to build a private rail link from the Channel Tunnel to London. Not only the authorisation framework must be right but the rates of return must be reasonable and attractive too. They do not have to be reckless, hut they must be reasonably attractive.<lb/>
I think we shall all benefit from the street works Bill. The trust ports Bill&#x2014;a reform Bill, if I can call it that &#x2014;I find very welcome. From time to time, because I flirt with transport in your Lordships' House, I get briefings, unsolicited mail and assorted other things from ports praying for this. I am reminded in a way of the series of marriage enablement Acts that we used to have in the early 1980s, when certain people, if they wished to marry within the bounds of consanguinity, had to get a Bill through both Houses of Parliament. It seems to me that an umbrella Bill giving the trust ports the right to do this, rather than a whole succession of Private Bills, is a welcome step.<lb/>
It is additionally welcome since the new powers the trust ports will get, particularly in terms of their ability to raise funds, could tie in with the toll roads Bill. They could invest in infrastructure so that, for example, my friends in Dover who are always complaining about the access road could, if they so wished, get into bed with a civil engineering contractor and build the road that they have always sought, and charge tolls on it. Why not?<lb/>
As for the road traffic Bill, first I have to echo&#x2014;I think we all do&#x2014;what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, said. It is no good legislating without enforcement. It really is not. I have mentioned the street corner out here where traffic offences are committed at the rate of one a minute. When you come into this Palace you feel utterly secure. There are plenty of police. But there are no police watching that crossroads so far as I can see. The television cameras that hang from the Treasury building which could be used to spot offenders are so far as I know not used. I have to ask why not?<lb/>
We must address the problem that every month the death toll on our roads, although not widely publicised, matches 12 or 13 Clapham Junction disasters. Therefore, if I can go back to what I was saying a few minutes earlier, we need the greater enforcement of mandatory versus advisory. We need greater enforcement, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said, and we need to change the attitudes of many motorists.<lb/>
Those of us who are interested in transport will be busy this Session not only on the legislative programme but also on the great tranche of Private Bills that are still to come before us. Our thoughts must be influenced by the investment regime, and that is one on which I congratulate the Government. We
<col>172</col>
must also obviously be influenced by legislative proposals as yet unread. We have not seen the Bills. But may I ask that one of these, the road traffic Bill, takes account of bridge bashing?<lb/>
This is a subject close to my heart, as those who were here on 17th January will remember. An over-high vehicle hits a railway bridge. You get, as we did in our local paper in the New Forest last Saturday, the report of an incident where the driver says, after he has hit the bridge and closed the railway for two hours, that he did not know how low the bridge was. Yet at the road junction there was a sign to warn him of the bridge and its height. Before he gets to the bridge there is a second sign. When he gets to the bridge the height is actually mounted on the bridge. It was not a matter of him not knowing the height of the bridge. It was&#x2014;and I find this frightening&#x2014;that he did not know how high his vehicle was.<lb/>
As I say, the result is a bashed bridge, a distorted track and a potentially fatal accident. We had one up in Aberdeen around 1975, but it has probably long since been forgotten. The Government are aware of the problem. British Rail and the Railways Inspectorate are aware of the problem. I was delighted to be told by the noble Viscount, Lord Davidson, in answer to my Unstarred Question last January that the Government had totally taken on board the recommendations of the working party.<lb/>
I should like to ask my noble friend who is to reply when we shall see action upon those recommendations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02969">6.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02970"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as usual I am made aware of the fact that it is my turn to speak because the television cameras have gone off and the lights have gone down. That always occurs in relation to a transport debate.<lb/>
Before winding up on this debate I should like to draw attention to the fact that this is the last occasion on which the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, will be speaking from the Labour Party Front Bench as its transport spokesman. Those of us who have taken part in many transport debates over the years would, I am sure, not wish this moment to pass without offering our thanks to the noble Lord for the enormous help that he has given to your Lordships' House in those many long hours of discussion. He is always better informed than anybody else. He always prepares meticulously everything that he is going to say. He reaches parts of Bills that less assiduous people never reach and, consequently, reveals flaws that other people never find. He is unfailingly calm, courteous and constructive in his criticism. I salute him for the job that he has done.<lb/>
In winding up, it is not easy to cover the wide range of subjects included in today's debate. I have some sympathy with the complaint of my noble friend Lord Mackie of Benshie concerning the structure of this kind of debate. The truth is that we could easily take a fortnight to debate the gracious Speech, dealing with each subject separately. However, compromises must be made.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0126"/>
<col>173</col>
I am pleased that the subjects of environment and transport have been taken together because they impact very strongly upon each other. In transport debates we do not always consider the impact of transport on the wider environmental picture. Indeed, I wish that the Government would take a more comprehensive view of the matter, because there is a need to study transport in relation to land use planning as well as the ecological impact of various means of transport, both public and private.<lb/>
There is a massive range of issues on the agenda today. However, the worrying aspect is not the items contained in the gracious Speech but those that have been omitted from it. There may be very good political reasons for that fact, but I believe that it demonstrates the Government's refusal to tackle the fundamental and basic problems in the areas of environment and transport, and none more so than in the field of housing, about which the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, went into some detail. I agree with what he stated. Homelessness is increasing, but where is the sign that the Government see the need to relax the restriction on local authority use of capital resources to build accommodation for rent? Where is there some recognition that private rented accommodation is not &#x2014;and I believe will not&#x2014;solving the housing problem? Where is there some retreat from the dogmatic proposition that the trickle-down system will assist the poor: that if one puts plenty of money into the top of society, it will trickle down and the people at the bottom will benefit? That theory was exploded a hundred years ago. It is not surprising that it is failing to work today.<lb/>
We understand that the Government have come up with a method of solving homelessness. It relates very much to the way in which the Government have solved the problem of unemployment. In other words, they are going to redefine homelessness and tinker with the statistics. I hope that that rumour is not true, but I fear that it may be. That method will not put a single extra roof over a single homeless head.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, stated, the London Housing Association Council has produced a report showing that an extra 422,000 affordable homes will be required in the next five years. That is a horrendous figure. Where in the gracious Speech are the radical proposals for tackling that terrible problem? There are none that I can see. It may be that the light is dawning and that is why the Government have not produced a solution this year. It may be that they realise that their dogmatism is wearing a little thin and that free operation of market forces does not produce answers in every case. If that is the reason for the gaps in the gracious Speech, we must be grateful, but we fear that that is not the case.<lb/>
Despite the excellent exposition by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, the transport proposals show an equal lack of coherence. At the moment our roads are overwhelmed by private vehicles and our public passenger transport system is in steep decline. There is no discernible strategy. When I put a question to a member of the Government Front Bench last year I
<col>174</col>
was told that of course the Government have a strategy for roads and that British Rail has a strategy for rail. It is that discontinuity which makes me feel that the Government have not understood the problem. The difficulty is contained in the opening words of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon. He stated that it is important that ordinary people should have choice, and that that was the basis of the Government's policy-making. He also stated that the Government are not complacent about the vast increase in the use of private cars. Those statements do not hang together. If there is to be uncontrolled, unfettered choice of transport, then people will tend to use the private car if there is no restriction upon its use. The private car is very attractive. You can get into your car, if you have one, at your front door and go to your destination in one bound. It is much more difficult to do so with public transport. However, the environmental and social costs of doing so are something that society can no longer afford, and that is why the interface must be better managed.<lb/>
One broadly welcomes the gracious Speech. I am sure that the noble Lord on the Labour Front Bench will be only too pleased to welcome the Horne Report, although it will take him some time to look through its many pages. I regret that it has been coupled with the Bill on private roads, which will undoubtedly be contentious. I am somewhat agnostic on the subject of private roads but I shall read the Bill very carefully to see what safeguards are built into it. There are clear dangers from an environmental point of view that private road builders may find themselves in a privileged position in relation to environmental problems and planning consents. There are other dangers such as one finds in France. The motorways there are delightful and one can go miles and miles without seeing a car. They are toll roads. They do not contribute much to the reduction of congestion in places like Lyons and the major centres of population in France, bearing in mind that France is a much bigger country than ours and has some very good secondary roads.<lb/>
I do not take a position on the privatisation of trust ports. We do not have a dogmatic view but should like to study the matter.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Brougham and Vaux and Lord Stoddart of Swindon, stated that the road safety provisions would have wide support across the House, but the important point is that there should be enforcement of the regulations in relation to traffic safety, speeding and the laws which are widely broken at the moment.<lb/>
The second Severn crossing is to be welcomed. I have no doubt that the noble Lord, the leader of the Labour Bench will be only too pleased to welcome extra transport going into South Wales, but I wonder whether it is the best investment and whether the electrification of the railway line to South Wales might not be a higher priority, as might the electrification of the line to the South West of England.<lb/>
I refer to a somewhat parochial problem, and I am not ashamed to do so. There will be no freight terminals in the West Country beyond Bristol. Rather
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0127"/>
<col>175</col>
than building new freight terminals in Plymouth, which are needed to try to bolster industry in Devon and Cornwall, there is a movement away from supporting freight traffic in the South West.<lb/>
Noble Lords may be aware that British Rail is intending to scrap its Speedlink system into the South West. I received a letter by Mr. Tanner, chief executive of the Somerset County Council, from the South West Regional Planning Conference. It states:
<quote>"In view of our geography, communications through the length of the South West are of paramount economic importance. The availability of rail services is critical to the success of directing a structured distribution of future growth if a high quality environment is to be sustained. If Speedlink is withdrawn, many more heavy goods vehicles will help congest our major roads and use unsuitable minor roads".</quote>
I give an illustration. Taunton Cider at present uses Speedlink. It would be willing to pay more than it does at present if that would keep the link in existence. However, it has not been consulted on the subject. If Speedlink is taken away from that body it would put, in an average year, another 2,000 38-tonne vehicles on the roads around Somerset, in particular around Norton Fitzwarren which is congested already. That cannot be in the interests of the community as a whole.<lb/>
I do not blame British Rail because its remit is to produce a return on investment. I blame the Government for not being able to take a broader view so that a decision is taken not just on the simple question of a return by British Rail but on the total cost benefit to the whole community. I use that as an illustration of the fact that there seems to be a discontinuity in the way that the Government approach such problems. There is no sign of electrification for the South West or of freight terminals further into the West Country,<lb/>
What is absent from the gracious Speech is a greater concern for the environment. It is such absence, rather than the content of the Speech, to which I take exception. Much technical tinkering is no doubt necessary and welcome. However, there is no sign of policies to tackle fundamental problems of housing, local government, agriculture, transport and the environment or any understanding that there is an interaction between all those aspects. It is a non-programme from a Government that has merrily sailed up a creek from which they see no way out. Perhaps, the real explanation for the gaps in the Queen's Speech is that the crew are mutinying, and that the passengers have a total contempt for the captain and are anxious to get off before we all run aground.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02971">6.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02972"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, for his kind remarks about my position. I have been spokesman on transport from this Dispatch Box for the past 10 years. My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis will be taking on these responsibilities. However, I am pleased to say that so important is the question of transport for the economic life of the country and for the environment of people that I shall be acting as deputy to my noble friend on transport matters.<lb/>
<col>176</col>
It is not my intention to deal with the question of public transport or general transport issues. Over the past 18 months we have had a number of major debates on various transport issues. It will be generally agreed by those who sat through those debates that there is widespread dissatisfaction with Britain's transport. Our debates showed that there was a general concern about transport infrastructure, inadequate levels of investment, and serious traffic congestion in many parts of the country, in particular in the London area.<lb/>
The gracious Speech made it clear that there will be four transport Bills this Session. However, I share the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, that the one thing that is missing from the four transport Bills is specific proposals to deal with the co-ordination of transport development and integration of transport policies. Matters are being dealt with on a piecemeal basis. There is no worked out plan. The question may be asked: What does your party propose? I refer noble Lords to a 25-page printed document which has been widely circulated. It sets out the Labour Party's policy on transport matters.<lb/>
In October the press carried reports from British Rail sources that BR had been forced to shelve some &#x00A3;1.5 billion of investments aimed at greatly improving two of the busiest rail lines. Since the Autumn Statement it has been said that the investment was less than that requested by BR and because of the serious uncertainty BR will not publish its annual corporate plan. Perhaps the noble Baroness who is to reply will indicate whether that is the position, and give the Government's comment about it.<lb/>
On 8th November&#x2014;the day after the gracious Speech&#x2014;the Secretary of State commented that BR's investment, together with operating losses, will be financed from borrowings, grant and property sales. That would appear to confirm that the Government are creating the impression that they wholly fund that investment. But for the most part it is internally generated. A great deal is generated from fare levels above the inflation rate. It appears that it has been government policy to minimise the public service obligation subsidy to ensure that the transport users &#x2014;as the main beneficial investors in public transport &#x2014;should pay through higher fares. We understand that the PSO grant to BR is to be reduced from about &#x00A3;500 million to &#x00A3;345 million over the next three-year period; and that it remains the Government's intention completely to phase out its PSO grant to Network SouthEast by 1993. That surely will present severe problems for the provincial rail services, in particular those covering rural areas and to commuters in Network SouthEast.<lb/>
Before proceeding further, perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness who will reply to check one point. I raise the matter now; if she does not have the information perhaps she can obtain it. On 5th November the <i>Guardian</i> carried a report that the Government are considering selling off some local authority-owned airports, including Manchester, East Midlands and Birmingham. The report stated that the Department of Transport has confirmed that a
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0128"/>
<col>177</col>
decision will be taken after a study by Ministers into the development of the 15 largest airports since they became local authority-controlled companies as a result of the 1986 legislation. I am sure that the House, and those outside the House, would like to know whether that is the position and what the Government propose to do.<lb/>
In the very interesting speech of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, if I heard correctly, he implied that there will be adequate funding, investments, or external financing, for BR to do all it wishes in connection with the fast rail link and the rail network generally in connection with the tunnel. Unless the Government have changed their view&#x2014;which I hope they have&#x2014;I gather that no public money will be available in connection with Channel developments or the fast link. We shall be interested to know whether the Government have changed their view; they too may be gratified.<lb/>
It has also been reported that London Underground expects a loss of &#x00A3;120 million during the current financial year. It has been stated that all managers have been sent a list of emergency cuts which London Underground's managing director has admitted may lead to station closures and train cancellations. We understand that London Regional Transport has commented that next year's &#x00A3;650 million external finance limit is less than was requested. Is that correct and what effect will it have, despite the statements made by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, in his opening speech?<lb/>
We also understand that during the past few days a report has been published by the Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association, the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities and the planning and advisory committee in London. It states that, if we are to solve the problems in London, there must be far greater investment in London Underground and British Rail than is proposed by the Government. There must be a heavy expenditure every year for the next 10 years. The Government may have received the report only recently but I wish to know whether we shall have a statement on the Government's response to it.<lb/>
Furthermore, can the Minister say what finance is planned for expenditure on our road system? What effect will that have on the Government's proposed road programme? Will the proposal for new roads in the Bill that is to come before us have an effect on that road programme? Will those roads be additional to the programme or will they substitute for some of the proposals in the programme?<lb/>
The environment White Paper also states:
<quote>"The Government will, where appropriate, encourage the provision and use of public transport".</quote>
We have not yet heard how the Government propose to implement that statement. What are their proposals?<lb/>
I wish to refer to a report of a study carried out by the National Consumer Council. It states that the standard of deregulated bus services has deteriorated
<col>178</col>
sharply since deregulation began four years ago. That confirms that bus journeys have decreased by 16 per cent. in the areas of passenger transport executives and by 6 per cent. in the shire counties. It is not good enough for the Minister to refer to increased bus mileage; it is the number of passengers carried by buses which is important.<lb/>
The NCC spokesman said that the report paints a sad picture. The report comments that schedules are being changed without notice, half the bus stops do not display a timetable and bus operators fail to co-operate with each other on timings and frequencies of journeys. Have the Government considered the report and, if so, what do they propose to do? I am doing my best to travel by public transport. However, I find that difficult, particularly when going home on the London Underground. Not only are three trains one after another going to the wrong place but they are so crowded that my doctor would not be impressed by my travelling on them. In addition I try to travel to my underground station by bus but I am always worried that the half hour service will be changed to an hourly service because a bus has been taken out of service. Those buses have been tendered out to another company by London Regional Transport.<lb/>
We on this side of the House welcome the proposals in the Horne Report to replace the outdated Public Utilities Street Works Act 1950. As was said by the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, this is a big Bill and we received it only the other day. There are 156 clauses and 9 schedules and it is to receive its Second Reading shortly. I sympathise with the view that it is unfortunate that the Bill covers not only street works, on which there is a general consensus of opinion, but also new road projects with private sector finance&#x2014;something about which there is bound to be a considerable amount of controversy.<lb/>
Considerable consensus on street works legislation has been reached by the public utilities through their public utilities group and by the local highway authorities through their national association. The public utilities and highway authorities have worked closely to prepare for this legislation. They set up the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee, which, with six sub-committees, has agreed a package of measures including codes of practice. It is interesting to note that the public utilities and local authority briefings emphasise the consensus achieved: somehow we should maintain the balance during consideration of the Bill.<lb/>
I note that a number of clauses deal with the charges that are to be made on utilities for the occupation of road space. The local authorities have said that they would like confirmation that the provision will be an enabling power to be used only if other provisions in the package appear not to be working. It would be helpful to have the Government's views on that matter before the Second Reading debate. It will also be helpful if the Government will say that they are prepared to insert
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0129"/>
<col>179</col>
in the Bill provisions for highway authority direct labour organisations to tender for utility work. That was the position as regards the 1950 street works Act.<lb/>
Parts I and II of the Bill relate to new roads to be provided through private sector finance. My party is not opposed to joint projects using public and private sector finance. For instance, we welcome collaboration on rapid transport systems. We also support the arrangements for the new Dartford bridge. However, provisions in the Bill will need the most careful consideration. The involvement of highway and planning authorities, and the public transport authorities where they exist, must be safeguarded. There must be a good degree of accountability to democratic bodies.<lb/>
Is it not possible to comment firmly on the proposed Bill on road traffic and parking? We await details of the provisions but the intentions appear to be welcome. I am pleased that the Bill is to deal further with drinking and driving. The fact sheet issued recently by the department setting out the serious nature of the matter will be extremely helpful. I understand that the Bill will contain no provision for random breath testing. Although the idea of random breath testing was dismissed by the Association of Chief Police Officers, a survey shows that the public overwhelmingly support it. I hope that the matter will be further considered, with the provision that, if we proceed with random testing, the results will be properly recorded and monitored.<lb/>
We debated in detail the North Report when discussing road users and the law in April last year. Many noble Lords made the point which was emphasised today by my noble friend Lord Stoddart that there is little value in having good laws if they are not properly enforced. We must consider that. I am not suggesting that we abolish the laws but we must do something about further enforcement of the good laws that we pass.<lb/>
I understand that the Bill will include provisions for parking controls and traffic management in London. If that is so, why cannot such provision be available in other parts of the country? The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, referred to the position of a London traffic director who is to have particular responsibility for the red route network. We have not yet seen the Bill but it appears from reports that have been issued that the director will be a non-accountable individual who will work without any reference to consultation with elected authorities. Perhaps the noble Baroness will comment on that when she replies.<lb/>
It is also stated that the Bill will give further parking responsibility to traffic wardens, including their deployment on red routes. What steps will be taken to ensure that that responsibility will not deplete the resources available for dealing with illegal parking on yellow lines elsewhere, outside the red routes?<lb/>
It is also understood that the Bill proposes to transfer responsibility for permitted parking at meters or residents' bays to the boroughs in London. There is anxiety that that could lead to appointed council officers and traffic wardens both dealing with parking
<col>180</col>
enforcement in the same area or even in the same street. Why should not all parking enforcement be passed to the boroughs where they wish to take on that responsibility? Also, why should not similar powers be given in other parts of the country?<lb/>
My very last point is on the question of trust ports. At this stage we have not yet seen the Bill, but in a debate in the other place the Minister explained that trust ports are not owned or run by a company, local authority or nationalised industry. He added that there are no shareholders. If that is the position, who will receive the proceeds of any sale? Are we to have a situation similar to that which existed with the TSB flotation?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-02974"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by echoing the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, when he expressed his sadness that we were listening for the last time to the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, in his capacity as spokesman for transport on the Opposition Front Benches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02975"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not say that because I do not believe it. I believe that my noble friend will be back.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02976"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome that statement. I was referring to the noble Lord's official position. I am sure that we shall hear more from him.<lb/>
I begin by saying how pleased I am by the welcome extended by a number of noble Lords to so much of our work on transport and the environment. In particular, I mention the welcome for many of our White Paper initiatives by the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, and the welcome throughout the House for the transport Bills in the gracious Speech. I am grateful also for the welcome as regards the high level of transport investment. On coming to the Dispatch Box it is very pleasing to receive plaudits as well as brickbats. That is a welcome tradition in this House. Of course I shall address many of the brickbats in my speech.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Brabazon began the debate by describing the Government's action on transport and the way in which we are working to mitigate its environmental impact. I had intended to wind up this debate in similar terms. Alas, as the noble Lords, Lord Mackie of Benshie and Lord Tordoff, found, the subject of the debate has been much broader. However, I consider the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, to be appropriate. We could discuss the gracious Speech for many weeks and still not cover all topics.<lb/>
First, I should like to say a few words about our Planning and Compensation Bill. I hope to reassure those who feel that we are not legislating sufficiently on environmental concerns. Although the planning system is well established, aspects of it require improvement. We need to ensure that it operates quickly and efficiently. Development proposals must be properly considered without causing unnecessary delay.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0130"/>
<col>181</col>
The Planning and Compensation Bill announced in the gracious Speech will address the main problems which have arisen in the operation of the planning system. It will simplify the provisions relating to the making and adoption of structure and local plans. It will provide for all district council areas to be covered by local plans, which will help to provide greater certainty as to what development is acceptable in particular areas.<lb/>
The Bill will also strengthen the enforcement powers of local planning authorities and simplify enforcement procedures. That will help to ensure that unacceptable development is not permitted by default. The Bill will also introduce a number of changes designed to make the development and control of provisions operate more efficiently and fairly. Many of the changes have been foreshadowed in consultation papers issued by my department.<lb/>
Finally, the Bill will make significant improvements to the provisions relating to compulsory purchase and compensation where, after proper consideration of all issues, private property must be taken for transport or other public development. The people involved must be properly recompensed.<lb/>
I turn now to the individual points raised during the course of the debate. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, compared our White Paper to a wet firework, albeit an attractive one. The White Paper has laid solid foundations for a better environment in this country. It is the first comprehensive statement of environmental policy by any government; for example, it has received general recognition from environmental groups on the quality of the policies. It is important not to underestimate the value of that. The Government will be rightly held to those commitments and above all to making the best instruments both in terms of regulation and the market. There are criticisms that the White Paper lacks firm action, but legislation is already flowing from it; for example, the planning legislation this Session. There will be more in European and international fora. The Environmental Protection Act gives us the power to enforce new standards. The Autumn Statement has given proof of the Government's commitment and has made available more funds for the heritage and countryside bodies for environmental work in agriculture and research in renewable energy. I was disappointed that there was not a single mention of heritage during the course of the debate.<lb/>
The White Paper is the culmination of a year of positive action which saw new commitments on water quality and sea dumping, on which we have firm policies on the global climate and on the new Environmental Protection Act. The White Paper provides a firm framework for future action by government, by business and by individuals. The Government have shown their intention in setting up a new Cabinet committee and with the appointment of environmental ministers in every department.<lb/>
I noted the cynical comments about the senior positions of those environmental ministers. Would noble Lords have been equally critical if the
<col>182</col>
Secretaries of State had not been represented or had those posts gone to very junior ministers of the Government?<lb/>
We are committed to encouraging everyone to play their part. The White Paper is the first step and we are looking forward to taking forward measures with the close involvement of environmental groups. The importance of the White Paper is that consideration of the environmental impact of any activity should become second nature, not just for corporations, business, commerce and bureaucracies but for everybody, individuals included.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, mentioned his anxiety about the effect of transport on the environment and that there were no firm commitments on that in the White Paper. Again, the White Paper shows that we take it very seriously. My noble friend Lord Brabazon confirmed all of that in his opening speech. I have also read the Labour Party's strategy, <i>An Earthly Chance,</i> very closely and I believe that it is equally vague on many of those aspects.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and many other noble Lords were disappointed that there would be little further environmental protection legislation this Session. I should like to make three points. First, integrated pollution control is a major undertaking. It bears repeating that it is innovative legislation which will provide a model for action in the European Community. It will mean a significant cost for industry, but we are committed to a firm timetable for its implementation. It is quite clear that there were those who were very critical and scoffed almost at the minimal costs on industry. However, the kind of re-tooling and re-equipping which industry must undertake to conform with those regulations will be considerable.<lb/>
Secondly, the Environmental Protection Act gives us the power to implement standards, including those from the European Community. In a number of areas we are supporting the development of EC directives which will be applicable in UK law. Those include directives on emissions from vehicles, on tropospheric ozone and on waste incineration. We are also taking the lead in international agreements to address other areas of anxiety. Those include our banding commitments under the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use and manufacture of ozone depleting substances. We have all the legislation we need to tackle the major environmental issues.<lb/>
Thirdly, we should not forget that the environment is more than anxieties about pollution. I have already said that we are introducing significant legislation to improve the operation of the planning system. The planning system is a major feature in the way our environment is shaped. A more effective planning system means better use of land and a better natural and built environment.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hatch, was concerned about catalytic converters or lower fuel consumption. There will soon be jointly agreed European directives making catalytic converters compulsory by the end of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0131"/>
<col>183</col>
1992. The Road Traffic Bill will help fuel efficiency through better enforcement of speed limits, and other legislation will help to free-up traffic movement.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to his paper, <i>An Earthly Chance.</i> I was somewhat puzzled by his attempt to compare the White Paper unfavourably with his own party's pamphlet. I looked very hard indeed for more positive comment on action and was disappointed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to his desire for an environmental protection agency. Again, we have talked for many hours in this Chamber about that particular issue. To introduce an agency now, having only just put the Environmental Protection Bill on the statute book, would be precipitate. Those who read the White Paper will appreciate that we have not ruled out the possibility of one day moving and evolving towards the need for an environmental protection agency.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and a number of other noble Lords were concerned about global warming. We are clearly committed to a freeze by the year 2005 as part of the international efforts. There is no fixed consensus in Europe on the year 2000. It is important, first, to obtain a freeze worldwide, as we began at the recent second world climate conference where we were in the vanguard. Reference was made to the Germans and the Dutch. Their targets are still aspirational; there is no sign of full measures yet.<lb/>
I was surprised by a comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch. He referred to specific targets which were rather better than the UK targets. He admitted that whether they will achieve them is another matter, they are targets. The United Kingdom is not in the business of providing purely aspirational targets. We want targets that are achievable and that will be delivered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02977"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Baroness will forgive me. Can she say why at the Geneva conference last week the British Government refused to agree with the rest of the EC members to make the year 2000 the objective for freezing, and to promise that there would be cuts&#x2014;not just freezing &#x2014;by the year 2005? Would it not be part of the Government's attempt to put their rhetoric into practice if they agreed on those target dates with the rest of the European Community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02978"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I specifically addressed that point. I would only add that it is not rhetoric. This Government made a firm target and will deliver that target. We are comparing a real target that is achievable with aspirational targets which have no backing.<lb/>
Another point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, is the extra &#x00A3;4 million mentioned in the Autumn Statement for research on renewables. The White Paper contained eight full pages on market instruments concerning the work of Professor Pearce. There is no country which actually has a carbon tax. We believe that 2005 is the soundest target for our circumstances. Major dislocation and the costs to
<col>184</col>
industry must not be underestimated. I believe they were seriously underestimated by a number of noble Lords in the course of the debate.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, mentioned the European Community and the environment. Again, there is strong support in the White Paper, and we fully support a new European environmental agency. The noble Baroness, Lady Robson, said that we need to hand on a better environment to our young people, and was also concerned about the phasing out of CFCs. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness that we need to ensure that we bequeath a quality environment to future generations. That is the keystone of the White Paper. I hope that during the coming year the noble Baroness will be surprised by the amount achieved using existing powers to address the various points she raised, including achievement of CFC controls.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, was concerned with preserving the countryside. I was pleased by the welcome that the noble Baroness gave to many of the White Paper policies. I hope that she will be pleased to see the increase in environmental schemes proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food included in the Autumn Statement; an extra &#x00A3;26 million on improving hill livestock compensation; the extension of the beef and sheep extensification scheme to a national scheme; around &#x00A3;6 million to be spent over the next three years, and a new pilot scheme to encourage the switch to organic farming.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Hatch and Lord Mackie of Benshie, were concerned about overseas aid. There is a programme of &#x00A3;50 million on energy efficiency in industry and forestry; &#x00A3;160 million to be spent on 150 schemes world-wide to deal with population growth; &#x00A3;17.3 million to be spent on planned parenthood and, in July 1990, there was the international agreement on debt-for-nature swaps. A considerable amount is taking place, although there will be noble Lords who will disagree regarding the degree to which it is occurring.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord McIntosh and Lord Hatch, and others mentioned energy efficiency and the labelling scheme. Both referred to the Government's opposition to energy labelling in the European Community. I suspect that that was based on an article in yesterday's <i>Observer.</i> The article was misleading. The United Kingdom will continue to press&#x2014;I emphasise "will continue"&#x2014;and is pressing for an agreed labelling scheme. There are no Commission proposals; and it is because there are no Commission proposals that we intend and suggested that what we do is at least to award labelling to those appliances which meet the set standards. That is hardly a backward step. We are on record as a Government as saying that if an eco-labelling scheme is not agreed, then the Government will press for a UK scheme.<lb/>
The Energy Efficiency Office's funding for core activities increased. In addition to the transfer of funding for insulation schemes, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, referred, a total of &#x00A3;42 million has been provided in the budget for next year.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0132"/>
<col>185</col>
My noble friend Lord Nugent made a very important point regarding traffic management. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, I am aware of the Cambridge county scheme. I understand the enthusiasm of my noble friend for any scheme that furthers the interest of traffic management. However, the noble Baroness illustrated perfectly in this Chamber the difficulties faced by local authorities, or indeed those at any level of government, who are grappling with very real problems. We must watch Cambridge with interest, and I shall be doing so very closely indeed.<lb/>
My noble friend also expressed concern and disappointment regarding the closure of engineering courses, in particular at Birmingham University. We are sorry that such a course should close. But I am also able to say that the Department of Transport is actively recruiting civil engineer graduates. Last year it reinstituted an in-house training scheme so that recruits could reach chartered status.<lb/>
Concern was also expressed regarding fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is not a matter for this debate, nor for this Chamber. It is very much a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and for Budget time. However, there has been a switch of policy from vehicle excise duty to petrol, which will have the effect of inducing people to think carefully about the journeys that they make.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Brabazon mentioned many other measures; for example, extending the MoT test to cover emissions and measures to enforce speed limits.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, is concerned about the extra fares collected on the Underground following the introduction of automatic ticket barriers. A recent survey by London Underground shows that the introduction of automatic ticket barriers in central London has reduced fraud losses from 6 per cent. to 4 per cent. and saved the Underground an amazing &#x00A3;11 million in one full year.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, were concerned about enforcement, particularly in regard to speeding. Again, I have to emphasise that my noble friend Lord Brabazon referred to the introduction of technology as well as manpower. The important point is that measures need to be introduced to increase and to reinforce the enforcement of the law. It may not be the most popular thing to say, but we also intend to enhance the powers available to traffic wardens, who will be able to authorise wheel clamping and the removal of vehicles. They will also be able to impose endorsable fixed penalties on stationary vehicles. I am not sure that all noble Lords will welcome that.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, raised a number of matters &#x2014;rural public transport, public transport and the disabled, road pricing and car sharing. As regards the development of a thriving and competitive bus industry, organised to meet customers' needs, we believe that bus deregulation has led to an increase in bus mileage of about 18 per cent.
<col>186</col>
across the country. That in itself has increased choice. Eighty-four per cent. of the vehicles are run by operators on a commercial basis. For example, the introduction in many rural areas of minibuses&#x2014;which represent 11 per cent. of all public service vehicles&#x2014;is also helping to provide fast and efficient services where bigger buses are often not able to travel.<lb/>
New public service vehicles designed with the disabled in mind are improving as new stock is replaced. Again, there is the difficulty of existing rolling stock not being converted, but it is an important point of which we have taken notice.<lb/>
It may be necessary eventually to consider road pricing but it has not been tried in any major cities. We have just mentioned one brave and courageous scheme which may or may not get off the ground. We shall have to watch this space.<lb/>
The Government welcome car-sharing schemes. In the early 1980s we took action to remove legal obstacles to such schemes. My noble friend mentioned the American experience. I have to say, somewhat cynically, that I found during my only visit to America that the traffic in Washington at peak hours was unbelievable. However, America has the luxury of space and is able to afford whole lanes that are devoted to full-occupancy car travelling. It is a marvellous idea but I suspect that space is a particular problem in this country.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, is concerned about low-cost housing for rural areas. She referred to the urgent need for such housing, and the Government recognise that need. For example, last year we issued planning guidance which encourages release for low-cost housing of small sites which would not ordinarily be released for housing. That initiative was widely welcomed. The message will shortly be consolidated and extended in a new policy planning guidance note which will go out to local authorities. The Government are also making resources available for an increased rural housing programme. Last week's Autumn Statement indicated that the Housing Corporation provision for gross capital expenditure will rise to over &#x00A3;22 billion in 1993&#x2013;94. That represents an increase of &#x00A3;250 million on the previous figure for 1992&#x2013;93 and a doubling of expenditure compared with last year.<lb/>
There will also be a new rural allocation of &#x00A3;50 million in 1991&#x2013;92 to enable local authorities to support housing association schemes for low-cost housing in rural areas. That is on top of existing commitments. There will be further negotiations with the Housing Corporation over the target level of provision to be achieved by this programme in terms of numbers of houses. I believe that shows that the Government take very seriously indeed the subject of low-cost housing in rural areas.<lb/>
Finally, in her very interesting speech the noble Baroness referred to local authority general powers. It is a general presumption of English law that when Parliament sets up a public authority it also determines the extent of the authority's powers. The presumption also applies to local authorities, which
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0133"/>
<col>187</col>
are therefore limited to discharging the functions Parliament has given them. Where appropriate, those functions are given in very wide terms. For example, the Local Government and Housing Act of last year gave local authorities power to take such steps as they consider desirable to promote their local economy, subject only to certain limitations set out in regulations. There seems to be no need to recast the powers of local authorities in a form that is alien to the English system by giving them some general, unlimited power.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to the planning Bill and the tendency to centralise. His claim that the Bill is a centralising measure is not supported by the examples that he gave. The Bill will strengthen the powers of local authorities in important respects. For example, we shall be honouring our White Paper commitment to allow county councils to adopt their own structure plans instead of having to submit them for the Secretary of State's approval. That is the opposite of a centralising measure. I agree with the noble Lord that we should await publication of the Bill before we discuss the proposals in detail.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, certainly put me on notice that the question of common land would be raised. I knew in almost the dying phrases of the gracious Speech that the matter would be debated today. Comprehensive legislation on common land has been delayed while extensive efforts have been made to reach agreement on the central issues of the management of, and access to, common land. We are disappointed that it has not been possible to achieve that but we believe that it would not be sensible to legislate without some further resolution of these issues. The Government are committed to improving public access to the countryside, but for common land that can only be achieved in the context of better management arrangements which take full account of the proper interests of owners and commoners, and also other important factors.<lb/>
We are satisfied that the policy set out in the statement which we issued in July will meet the legitimate interests of all concerned. We are reviewing the posit ion in the light of reaction received and will be consulting widely in seeking a resolution. However, I can say that the aim of our policy is to safeguard the status of common land and to strengthen the ways in which we protect and use it.<lb/>
I welcome the support from my noble friend Lord Brougham and Vaux for the measures proposed in the transport Bills. I hope he will take part in our debates. I welcome the comments of my noble friend Lord Lyell. I got quite excited because I thought we were going to talk about trains again. My noble friend was very supportive and what he said underlined the achievements of the Government's policies towards the railways and in encouraging greater efficiency.<lb/>
I believe I have covered most of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, in regard to housing. I put two rhetorical questions to him. Is he saying that he is against the rents for mortgages scheme; or, as I picked up during the debate, is he arguing that the scheme needs even further extension?<lb/>
<col>188</col>
The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, surprised me beyond measure in saying that no local government would increase the yield from business beyond the rate of inflation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02979"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02980"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness referred to the Government having levied the rate of inflation of 10.9 per cent. on the business community. I believe she said that would yield an extra &#x00A3;2 billion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02981"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Baroness will allow me to explain. I said that the percentage increase in poundage was 10.9 per cent. but that that would generate a 20 per cent. increase in yield from &#x00A3;10.4 billion to &#x00A3;12.4 billion in one year. That is a burden about which local industry and commerce is complaining and which no local authority sensitive to its business community at these times of high interest rates would seek to raise&#x2014;that is, a 20 per cent. increase in yield.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02982"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the figures given by the noble Baroness are wrong. There has been no further revaluation of business and therefore the poundage will yield the same amount. The only element of difference will be the number of new businesses, which will be netted off by any businesses that go out of the system. The record books are positively littered with local authorities, including the local authority of the noble Baroness, that have taken very much more from businesses than the level of inflation. The best example that I can bring to mind immediately is that of my own local authority. In one year it levied a 33 per cent. rate increase on local business which took the business yield from &#x00A3;40 million to &#x00A3;60 million overnight. Under the present arrangements that the Government have put on the statute book that can never happen.<lb/>
I now turn to the average increases on spending assessments this year for the classes of authorities. For shire districts, the SSAs have increased on average by 28.2 per cent.; shire counties by 18.3 per cent.; metropolitan areas by 18.4 per cent.; and London by 19.7 per cent. The noble Baroness was arguing about the way in which local authorities spent over their SSAs last year and asked us to take that into account. Budgets were taken into account. Those are increases which by anyone's standards are very generous.<lb/>
The issue that virtually all should contribute something to their local authority finances was also raised by the noble Baroness. That is a philosophical difference between the noble Baroness and the Government. The Government believe that everybody should pay. The poorest in the land are given the wherewithal to meet the 20 per cent. contribution. The uniform business rate and revaluation will give a yield of &#x00A3;870 million a year. That will shift the burden from the South to the North, but it has not increased the burden overall in real terms. As I said earlier, next year's poundage has risen with the rate of inflation. Defending against excess spending, with the introduction of capping and all the safety nets and interregnum arrangements in place, is the right of government.<lb/>
I now turn to the comments made by my noble friend Lord Mountevans. I welcome what he said
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0134"/>
<col>189</col>
about the measures to come before the House later this year. Knocking British Rail is an easy sport and it is very often an armchair one. Nothing is perfect and we all know that there is more to do. There is a discernible improvement in what British Rail is doing. The investment is colossal. It is the greatest ever. During the next three years over &#x00A3;4 billion will be spent. That is the highest expenditure on British Rail for 30 years. Rolling stock is being replaced. There is a discernible improvement at many of our stations.<lb/>
I had not heard of bridge bashing until today's debate. Ministers are deeply concerned about it. I understand that a working party has already produced a series of recommendations. The implementation of those measures is already in hand. They include simple measures such as putting a note of a lorry's height in the driver's cab.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, was concerned about the cancellation of SpeedLink. I understand the anxiety about the possible environmental and economic implications of a reduction in railfreight services. It is worth noting that SpeedLink accounts for only 0.1 per cent. of UK freight tonnage. In general, the environmental effects of any changes that British Rail proposes should be very limited, especially if it can retain much of the traffic. One hopes that people will consider converting to the trainload or the inter-modal operation.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, was also concerned about the interaction between land use planning and transport. The Government recognise the close relationship between land use patterns and travel demands. The White Paper has made it clear that we shall be carrying out a study to establish how travel demand might be reduced through planning policies. The intention would be to produce general guidance which will inform individual planning decisions and local and strategic plans.<lb/>
I lost count of the number of specific questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill. I hope he will forgive me if I say that there is to be a Second Reading speech very soon. My noble friend will then deal with many of the questions that he posed. If we both miss some out we shall certainly write to him.<lb/>
The expenditure on toll roads will be additional expenditure to the roads programme. The noble Lord also referred to airports. The recent press reports are speculative.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dean, was concerned about the water authorities' land. The Water Act includes provisions under which the Secretary of State's consent is required for the disposal of land which is surplus to operational requirements. I obviously cannot comment on any specific piece of land. We have noted the noble Lord's comments. The Secretary of State will have to consider the matter when it comes before him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02983"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my point was not disposing of the land but bringing redevelopment to what is now very attractive land used as a public amenity. That was the point I was making.</membercontribution></p>
<col>190</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02984"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe the matter has to come before the Secretary of State. He will consider it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dean, drew attention to two related problems about homelessness, including the problems of those living rough on our streets. It was a pity that, rather than drawing on one selected press notice in the name of my colleague, the Minister of State for Housing, the noble Lord failed to give credit for the large sums added to public expenditure for the next three years to meet some of the problems that he mentioned. In addition, he did not have the advantage of knowing about today's statement made by the Minister of more housing and estate action. The general message is that resources are to be better targeted on the needy. I believe that I gave many of the specific statistics to the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman.<lb/>
The Government fully recognise the importance of a good environment and good transport. We are committed to both. In transport we want to encourage high quality and efficiency which will provide an attractive alternative to the use of the car. Investment in public transport is already at a very high level. It is now set to go substantially higher. We wish to relieve traffic congestion because stop-start traffic is highly polluting as well as economically wasteful. The Government are tackling this through building bypasses, improving traffic management systems, including our plans for red routes, and through our proposals for the reform of utility streetworks. We are reducing vehicle emissions through both regulatory and fiscal means. We are seeking to encourage economy in the use of fuel, for which there is considerable potential.<lb/>
With the environment we are at the close of a year of immense activity and achievement. That included the carrying through of the Water Act, the setting up of the NRA, &#x00A3;28 billion of investment to clean our waters, worldwide action on the ozone layer and global warming, the innovative Environmental Protection Act, introducing IPC and giving a lead to Europe. The environment White Paper has been the clearest ever commitment by any government to environmental action. In both environment and transport our record is stronger than that of any other government. I very much look forward to detailed and continuing debate on these issues. We shall welcome all these Bills in this Session of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Sunday Trading</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02994"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02995">How many summonses for alleged breaches of the law on Sunday trading have been dismissed by magistrates or on appeal in the last six months on the grounds that English law on the subject conflicts with the law of the European Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02996"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that information in the form which is requested by my noble friend is not held centrally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02997"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that most interesting Answer. Is he aware that the information is available to, and in the hands of, those who look for it? It shows that during the period dismissals amounted to nine. Five cases were withdrawn and 59 cases were adjourned <i>sine die.</i> What is the cost to public funds of such fruitless proceedings and when will Her Majesty's Government summon up the courage to deal with the matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02998"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the information of which I was not in possession. I am unable to tell him of the cost. My noble friend asks when the Government will summon up sufficient courage. I remind him of a fact that may have temporarily escaped his notice. In 1986 we summoned up enough courage to produce a Bill. It was passed by your Lordships but thrown out by another place. Quite frankly, until another place is prepared to accept proposals it is unlikely that the government of the day will produce them. Perhaps I may suggest to my noble friend that rather than having a go at the Government his efforts would be better directed towards persuading his friends in another place to reach agreement so that when a Bill is introduced they pass it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-02999"><member>Lord Murray of Epping Forest</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when will the Government summon up the courage to give effect to the clear ruling given by Mr. Justice Hoffmann that the law is being properly carried out and that all that is lacking is will on the part of the Government to enforce it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03000"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not for the Government to enforce the law but the courts. As far as I know, the courts do their best to enforce the law as it stands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03001"><member>Viscount Caldecote</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that during 1990 there were more than 250 successful prosecutions for illegal Sunday trading?</membercontribution></p>
<col>194</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03002"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is an interesting statistic but I am not sure what one draws from it. However, I am now aware of the fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03003"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that I am overcome with flattery by his answer and the suggestion that I have more influence over those in another place than Her Majesty's Government? However agreeable I may find that proposition, it is not true.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03004"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is surprising how, with a little persistence, people's characters change during their lives. Perhaps the noble Lord will find his character changing and will discover that he has more power over those in another place than at present he suspects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03005"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if with tongue in cheek a local authority were to prosecute a cathedral bookshop for selling a bible on a Sunday, what would the magistrates be expected to do?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03006"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the magistrates' job would be to carry out the law as it stands. As the noble Lord asked a hypothetical question I do not propose to give an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03007"><member>Lord Richard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, is based on the premise that the English law on the subject conflicts with the law of the Community. I have a letter in front of me signed by the Attorney-General which states that a recent decision given by Mr. Justice Hoffmann has made it clear that the Shops Act provisions applying to Sunday trading are entirely consistent with this country's obligations under EC law. Are they consistent or are they not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03008"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is for the courts to interpret the law as it stands. It is a matter for the European Court to decide its judgment. Whatever the law, its enforcement is a matter for local authorities. It is for them to decide how best to discharge their duties under Section 71 of the Shops Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03009"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, under Article 177 of the Treaty of Rome, is it not possible for the courts to ask the opinion of the Luxembourg court about whether our law is consistent with the treaty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03010"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is true. Under Article 177 any court can seek further clarification from the European Court in interpreting the Treaty of Rome. Of course, the courts did so and, to paraphrase, the European Court stated that the United Kingdom law is not necessarily in breach of the Treaty of Rome. It depends on particular circumstances whether there is a socio-economic justification for a law which would reasonably permit a reduction in imports in consequence. The European Court states that it is for the local courts to determine in each case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03011"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it help my noble friend to form a view on the legality of the question to know that a recent High Court decision by Mr. Justice Hoffmann has made it clear that the Shops Act provisions applying to Sunday trading are entirely
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0137"/>
<col>195</col>
consistent with this country's obligations under EC law and that this has been endorsed by his right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03012"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend asked whether the information would be of help. I can tell him that anything would be of help. I am grateful to him for having produced that fact.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Air Services, UK-Mexico</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03013">2.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03014"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03015">Why there is no scheduled direct air service between the United Kingdom and Mexico, and when this will be established.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03016"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Air Services Agreement between the United Kingdom and Mexico signed in November 1988 established rights for an airline from each country to provide scheduled services on specified routes between our two countries. The decision whether to take advantage of these rights is a matter of commercial judgment for the airlines concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03017"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that interesting piece of information. Is he aware that the flag carriers of France, Spain, Holland and Germany all have direct flights to Mexico? Furthermore, is he aware that Britain is now the second largest investor in Mexico after the USA but that the lack of any direct flights is an impediment to the development of trade in an economy which is showing a remarkable state of rapid recovery? Therefore, will he do his utmost and use his best offices to lean on the airlines in question and inform them that direct flights would be of great benefit to this country and, indeed, to Mexico?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03018"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes and no. I appreciate the importance of trade with Mexico. Therefore, through the Air Services Agreement, the Government have set up the mechanism for establishing direct services. On the other hand, I am not prepared to lean on the judgment of commercial airlines on the question of whether or not they should mount such a service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03019"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that such services would be of great benefit to the airlines concerned? Indeed, if he were to approach them he would do them a great favour because this issue does not merely include improving cultural, economic and business relationships; it is also an idea which would do the airlines the world of good. Will he approach the airlines and point out that that service would be an advantage for them and also an advantage for the other reasons that I have mentioned?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03020"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. The airlines are perfectly capable of forming their own judgment with a view to what the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, said. It is entirely a matter for them as to whether or not they wish to mount such a service.</membercontribution></p>
<col>196</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03021"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the light of the Minister's reply, can he say whether any United Kingdom airline has considered applying for a direct link with Mexico? If so, what has been the result of that request? Is it a question of having a suitable airport slot in this country in respect of which the airlines could fly from and to?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03022"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think so. I understand that British Airways has applied for a route licence with a view to resuming services to Mexico City in 1992. The question of a slot in this country would be considered through the normal mechanism. However, I am not aware that that would be any problem as regards mounting such a service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03023"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister said that British Airways had made an application in 1982. Can he say why that request was refused?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03024"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has not been refused.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03025"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if British Airways is showing reluctance on this issue, is the Minister prepared to encourage regional airlines in the United Kingdom to fly from different airports because there are a very large number of efficient airports all over the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03026"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>; My Lords, there is nothing to prevent any airline from applying for a licence. Provided that the normal requirements for an issue are fulfilled, I can see no reason that such an application would be refused.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03027"><member>Lord Marsh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that British Airways seems to have done much better since it ceased to have a steady stream of government advice?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03028"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is rather the impression that I have been trying to create in answering this Question.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BT Charge Card</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03029">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03030"><member>Lord Parry</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03031">Whether they know of any reason why the British Telecommunication charge card cannot be used for calls from Canada to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03032"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Hesketh)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that, although there has been some disruption to the operation of the charge card service in Canada, it is possible to use the service to make calls to the UK via the UK-direct service. This will connect customers directly to a UK operator free of charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03033"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that Answer, delivered at characteristic machine-gun speed. Will he accept that since such a situation has existed for three months, card holders planning to go to Canada may like to know that they will have difficulty in meeting the charges which they must incur when telephoning home?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03034"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that will not be the case if they use the UK-direct service. However, I shall draw the noble Lord's Question to the attention of British Telecom.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Gulf</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03036">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03037"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03038">Whether, if a military attack is launched by United Nations forces on Kuwait, the object of the exercise will be to reinstate the regime ejected by Iraq whether it is expected that this will be accomplished by killing or disabling Iraqi soldiers who resist; and whether any estimates have been made of probable casualties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03039"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (The Earl of Arran)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the United Nations has called for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces and the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait. The Government hope that Iraq will comply and leave Kuwait, but, as my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made clear, we shall have to take the military option if they do not. The number of casualties which might result from any military action could vary considerably, depending on a wide range of factors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03040"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for that informative Answer. Will he address himself to the Question and particularly that aspect of it which asks for an estimate to be made? He said that it depends upon the circumstances, but is it not possible for him to answer more fully than that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03041"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not possible. We do not care to speculate on the number of casualties. All I can say is that if we must go to war, we hope that the casualties will be as few as possible and we are determined that that should be so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03042"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not remarkable, in view of the solicitude expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, for Iraqi casualties, both those killed and those disabled, that nothing is said regarding British casualties or those of their allies? Presumably they will be working either under Chapter 7 of the Charter of the United Nations or under Article 51.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03043"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble and learned friend is correct. I was under the impression that I was answering on behalf of British casualties, if any should occur.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03044"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Earl will answer the middle part of the Question, to which he has not yet addressed himself. Is it the objective of Her Majesty's Government, through the United Nations, to restore the particular regime that was in Kuwait at the time of the Iraqi invasion? Alternatively, are there any moves to make a more democratic regime acceptable, and for that regime to be reinstated after the withdrawal of the Iraqi forces?</membercontribution></p>
<col>198</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03045"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must make it clear that it is the purpose of the United Nations to restore Kuwait to its rightful owners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03046"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Earl bring us up to date regarding possible future discussions that may take place in the Security Council on military action in the Gulf? Are such discussions envisaged in the near future? Can he explain the attitude of Her Majesty's Government regarding the seeking of Chapter 7 clearance for military action rather than relying on Article 51?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03047"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those are currently hypothetical questions. If the events envisaged by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, transpire, they will be dealt with at that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03048"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not strange that we are discussing this topic now when there are 41 people wishing to contribute to this very subject in a few minutes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03049"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is your Lordships' wish. I understand what the noble Lord says.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03050"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, was not the noble Earl somewhat ambiguous in his reply to my question? Who does he consider to be the rightful owners of Kuwait?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03051"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer is the legitimate government.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03054">Debate resumed on the Motion moved on Wednesday last by Lord Kimball&#x2014;namely, That a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03055">"Most Gracious Sovereign&#x2014;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament".</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03056">2.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03057"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before commencing the debate this afternoon I should like to offer a particularly warm welcome to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, on his appointment to the Front Bench. I look forward to discussing European Community matters with him, and shall pay particular attention to his closing address today. We wish him the very best congratulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03058"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03059"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, last year we were able, in the debate on the Address, to celebrate the beginnings of democracy in Eastern Europe and the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the year since we have experienced nine months of increasing joy followed by three months of increasing soberness. The watershed was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. I should therefore like to begin with the Gulf crisis, but will then move on to consider more hopeful developments in Europe, South Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia.<lb/>
The present crisis in the Gulf is the result of naked Iraqi aggression. Saddam Hussein's invasion of a neighbouring country and, let us not forget, a fellow member of the United Nations, was unprovoked and unjustifiable. His aim is to snuff out a sovereign, independent state. He cannot be allowed to succeed. This Government's objectives are clear and unwavering. They are shared by the international community and have been spelled out in the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.<lb/>
We seek complete and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait; the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait; and the release of all foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait. The means to achieve those objectives include Iraq's diplomatic isolation; the imposition of full and effective sanctions against Iraq; and the possibility of military actions. It must be made clear to Saddam Hussein that, if sanctions do not work, the military option exists and can be used against him.<lb/>
Iraq's diplomatic isolation is almost complete. Sanctions continue to be broadly effective. There is evidence they are hitting Saddam where it hurts. Industrial production is slowing down, and vital imports are not getting through. Iraq is earning no foreign exchange. Economic agony is beginning to pile up. It is essential that the international community remains united in condemnation of Iraq, and steadily
<col>200</col>
tightens the pressure of sanctions. It is vital that we all remain firm. Even so, it would be hard to argue that sanctions alone are likely to be decisive in reversing Iraqi policy in the near future.<lb/>
We are doing our level best to make diplomatic and economic pressure work. But we must face the possibility that Saddam Hussein will resist all the peaceful pressures. That is why it is essential to build up the military option and to show that it is not a bluff. The threat of military action can focus an aggressor's mind powerfully. Saddam Hussein must be receiving regular reports of the build-up of the international military force which opposes him. He must know that their deployment does not suggest a bluff. Forces are in fact moving into a position from which they can expel him from Kuwait. That must be gnawing at his mind. We have to be serious in our threat of force. We hope Saddam will conclude that he must change his mind and pull back his army into Iraq&#x2014;even at the eleventh hour. That is the peaceful outcome for which we are all working.<lb/>
The solidarity of the international coalition opposing Iraq is essential to the success of this work. The allies consult regularly. On 9th November Secretary of State Baker came to London for that purpose. The United States, like the UK, remains committed to trying to resolve this conflict by peaceful means if possible; by force if necessary.<lb/>
Throughout the crisis the United Nations have shown unprecedented and heartening unity of purpose. We must work to maintain this united front. Some will look for compromises, for face-saving formulas. We must resist that. The route, the only possible route, to a peaceful solution is clear&#x2014;full Iraqi compliance with the Security Council's resolution. We must not sell ourselves or the people of Kuwait short.<lb/>
In the last few days horrific reports have been reaching us in Europe about the Iraqi army's rape of Kuwait. It is clear that, far from behaving in a disciplined fashion, Iraq's occupation forces have behaved brutally and without mercy. Eye witnesses report the murder of children, boys in their teens, in front of their mothers and sisters. Torture and imprisonment without trial are routine. This is part of a deliberate campaign of terror against the Kuwaiti people aimed at the systematic obliteration of Kuwait as a nation.<lb/>
Iraq's conduct has been sickening. The taking of British and other Western hostages is a cynical and wicked action. Around 60 Britons are at strategic installations in Kuwait; 300 at installations in Iraq. This so-called "human shield" is an inhuman manipulation. There are also over 400 British citizens who are being prevented from leaving Iraq and another 500 in hiding in Kuwait, sometimes under appalling conditions. They are showing remarkable courage and resilience. Their plight is one of our first concerns. Our embassy in Kuwait&#x2014;staffed now only by our ambassador, Michael Weston, and the consul, Larry Banks&#x2014;continues to maintain contact with as

many of them as it can. I am sure that the whole House will wish to join me in thanking the embassy staff for their work in such difficult circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03060"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03061"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we take every opportunity to make clear to the Iraqis that their continued illegal detention is unacceptable. All foreign nationals must be allowed to go. We are urging the UN and other international organisations to continue their efforts to help foreign nationals. So far the representations of the UN Secretary General have been repeatedly spurned. In a British initiative, we agreed yesterday with our European partners that a wide selection of countries should be pressed to urge Iraq to receive the Secretary General's special representative.<lb/>
We have taken a number of practical steps to help those held at strategic sites and those prevented from leaving Iraq. Our consular emergency unit and embassy in Baghdad are manned 24 hours a day to assist with enquiries from their families. There is a new PO box to speed up the delivery of mail. With our encouragement British Telecom has cut the cost of telephone calls to Iraq and the BBC has extended its Gulf link programme. The embassy in Baghdad is sending, comfort parcels to British detainees and provides financial assistance to distressed Britons where necessary.<lb/>
In all this activity, the sufferings of the relatives back home are very much at the front of our minds. I should like to pay tribute to the fortitude of the families of those affected. On the whole, in spite of their acute anxiety, these families have resisted the temptation to ask us to weaken our policies. We are committed to doing everything possible to bring our hostages home; but we cannot negotiate with hostage takers, whether terrorists or governments. Throughout our discussions and in our thoughts we must rot forget that Iraq, and Iraq alone, is responsible for the present situation. We would be in a far more dangerous world if we submitted to blackmail.<lb/>
The Gulf crisis has absorbed much of our attention in foreign affairs in the last three months, but no one can have failed to notice the debate raging over the European Community. There is indeed argument. There is always in any normal family, whether in our home life or a family of nationals. The Community does not stand still and honest open debate is a prerequisite for sensible decisions on the next step forward. Discussions never stop, but occasionally the debate is focused in a formal conference. Two such conferences will be convened next month in Rome.<lb/>
One will deal with economic and monetary union. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will represent the UK. There is much common ground between the UK and our EC partners. We all agree on the need for further economic integration, price stability, curbing budget deficits and moves beyond stage one of EMU to create a new monetary institution. The debate is over the way to achieve these goals. This Government believe a
<col>202</col>
European monetary fund and a hard ecu are the best way forward. In time, if consumers, markets and governments so chose, the common currency of a hard ecu could evolve towards a single currency. The people's choice, not the Eurocrats' imposition, is the key. In our deliberations we should examine this and decide substance before deciding timing.<lb/>
The second intergovernmental conference will aim to improve the working of the Community institutions. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary will be the UK's representative. The UK's approach is guided by five principles: maintaining balance within the Community, both between Brussels and member states and between the institutions in Brussels; strengthened foreign policy co-ordination; better efficiency and more value for money; improved democratic accountability; and openness to new applicants qualified for Community membership.<lb/>
The Community is taking notice of UK pressure for member states to respect, implement and enforce Community laws. Our proposals for improving financial accountability have been welcomed. The taxpayer deserves better scrutiny of budget and the Community should provide it.<lb/>
We believe that subsidiarity must be a major element of IGC reform. This will ensure a clear division of responsibilities, leaving to national governments everything that does not need to be done in common. We recognise that national parliaments must play a greater role. The Parliamentary Conference of the European Community meets on 27th to 30th November. It can make a direct input. Westminster will be fully represented by eight noble Lords and 18 members of another place.<lb/>
In both the intergovernmental conferences our aim is to help Members of the Community reach agreement to work more closely together. We will play a constructive part so that the Community can move forward as twelve. Despite all the rhetoric, all our partners realise that reform should be pragmatic and gradual.<lb/>
The Community is advancing but there are some things it cannot and should not take on. We do not seek the EC taking on a defence role, but we want to see the European defence pillar strengthened and made more coherent within NATO. The NATO summit in London last July set the agenda. It is essential to preserve the fundamentals: an integrated military structure; the continued presence of the US in Europe; and a sensible mix of nuclear and conventional weapons to counter-balance continued Soviet power. But at the summit we recognised that NATO had to change in order to survive. The NATO review is now looking at the alliance's political role, its strategy and force structures. We expect the outcome next spring. We do not want to pre-empt the conclusions of the review, but it is clear to us that a stronger European voice is needed to match Europe's increasing responsibility for its own defence. The Western European Union may have a useful role both politically and militarily.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0141"/>
<col>203</col>
The review will also doubtless take into account the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, due to be signed in Paris on the 19th of this month. This treaty is the visible expression of the post-cold war European security relationship, based on mutal confidence, openness and lower levels of armaments. It sets limits for major conventional weapons systems held by NATO and the Warsaw Pact between the Atlantic and the Urals and sets a sufficiency rule; that is, a limit on the numbers of each system that any one state can hold. This means a hugh quantity of Soviet military hardware&#x2014;almost 100,000 pieces of equipment&#x2014;will be removed from the European theatre. As a result, the risk of conflict will be greatly reduced.<lb/>
The CFE Treaty will be signed in the margins of the conference on security co-operation in Europe summit. The CSCE has helped provide a framework for the democratic changes in the east of our Continent. The summit will celebrate that achievement but also relaunch the process. We expect the summit to agree to give CSCE a permament small secretariat for the first time and to set up a timetable for regular meetings at head of government, ministerial and official level to improve political consultation among the 34 signatory states.<lb/>
Meanwhile, we must help the newly democratic countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Britain has contributed to the development of those democracies through the know-how funds. The know-how funds have been a substantial success. There are now over 130 projects. My right honourable friend the Minister for Overseas Development arrived in Budapest this morning at the start of a tour which will also take her to Poland and Czechoslovakia. In the next seven days she will have discussions with Ministers who are involved in managing the transition to a free market economy. Despite the rigour of the public expenditure round, in the next financial year we shall double our know-how fund assistance from &#x00A3;15 million to &#x00A3;30 million.<lb/>
Chances for the better are not confined to Europe. The United Nations has seen not only good work in building and keeping together the international coalition opposing Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, but also valuable work over Cambodia. The five permament members of the Security Council proposed a framework for a settlement which all Cambodian parties have now accepted in its entirety. The UN General Assembly has unanimously endorsed that framework. Negotiations will continue in the coming weeks. We hope the Paris international conference on Cambodia will reconvene before the end of 1990 to sign a settlement agreement; but this will not be possible without co-operation among Cambodian parties. I am sure all noble Lords join the Government in calling on all Cambodian parties to stop fighting and settle their differences so that they can co-operate fully in working out the details of a comprehensive political settlement.<lb/>
Negotiations also began to bear fruit this year in South Africa. Our aim has long been clear: to help a pluralist, non-racial and democratic South Africa
<col>204</col>
achieve stability and prosperity and take its place in the international community. For this, apartheid has to be replaced, through negotiation, by a system of government acceptable to the majority of South Africans. President de Klerk opened the door this year. Last month the South African Parliament repealed the Separate Amenities Act, one of the pillars of apartheid. In the next parliamentary session, President de Klerk is committed to repealing the Land Act, which prevents blacks from owning land in reserved areas, and the Group Areas Act, which delineates areas where blacks can live. Progress so far has been very significant. We hope all parties will now begin full constitutional negotiations as soon as possible.<lb/>
I turn next to Hong Kong&#x2014;an area for which I have special responsibility. Before doing so, however, I welcome both maiden speakers in our debate today. The noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest, brings an enormous amount of experience from his work at the UN. I know your Lordships will understand my wish to give a special welcome to the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, who continues to do so much for Hong Kong. We all look forward to hearing their contributions to this important debate.<lb/>
When I visited Hong Kong in September, I made it clear that the British Government were determined to do all in their power to secure a stable and prosperous future for Hong Kong. We remain determined to fulfil our responsibilities, building on the Sino-British Joint Declaration. To this end we are seeking to establish a better working relationship with China, not only because it is right and desirable in itself, but because it is a key to reassuring the people of Hong Kong. The visit of my honourable friend Mr. Maude to China in July was an important step in that process. Following the recent agreement in Luxembourg where we took a leading role in urging fellow members of the Community to restore more normal and improved relations with China, it is hoped that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and then I will visit next year.<lb/>
In addition, we and the Hong Kong Government are planning actively for Hong Kong's future. The Hong Kong Government, with our full backing, are pressing ahead with plans for a new international airport and port extension. It is the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in Hong Kong. The airport is essential if Hong Kong is to remain a major international financial and trading centre. Tai Tak airport is already crowded and will be saturated by the mid-1990s. The new airport will be a valuable asset for the new SAR Government of Hong Kong.<lb/>
The passage of the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act has had a steadying effect on confidence. The implementation of the scheme will begin on 1st December and the first passports will be issued next spring. Emigration from the territory is still a matter of serious concern. But we hope our nationality package, coupled with measures being taken by other countries, including the United States, Singapore and our Community partners, will succeed in anchoring key people.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0142"/>
<col>205</col>
The number of Vietnamese boat people and their dependants continues to be a matter of grave concern. There are still nearly 54,000 in Hong Kong of whom about 13,000 so far have been assessed, after appeal, using international criteria, as not being refugees. Sadly, only a small percentage have volunteered to return to Vietnam, a statistic which underlines the need for rapid progress in returning non-volunteers. An agreement on 21st September between the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, Vietnam and the United Nations' High Commission for Refugees in Hanoi set up procedures for speeding up the return of volunteers and a new programme for returning non-volunteers who do not object (the so-called grey area) under UNHCR supervision. It remains to be seen how, indeed whether, this plan will work. Our objective remains the repatriation of all non-refugee Vietnamese boat people before the end of 1992.<lb/>
Foreign affairs debates inevitably tend to develop into Cook's tours of the globe. Before I finish I should like to complete my world tour in Latin America. Democracy has broken out the length and breadth of the continent. The place of posturing generals has been taken by democratically-elected presidents. In February this year we resumed diplomatic relations with Argentina. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has met his Argentine opposite number on two occasions since then. My honourable friend the Minister of State paid a successful visit to Argentina and Chile in October. Trade is increasing rapidly. We welcome the Argentine trade mission at the end of this month when we hope to sign an investment promotion and protection agreement. The message across our relations with Latin American countries is not so much business as usual but rather business is booming. We are one of the largest foreign investors, with investments now in excess of &#x00A3;10 billion. We aim to build on that position.<lb/>
I hope that your Lordships will agree that much of the international scene is encouraging. The events in Eastern Europe last winter have made us look again at the world. The cold war is over. Ideological antagonisms which used to play themselves out in the third world have resolved themselves: communism is in full retreat. The third world is now freer to pursue the policies of good government, no longer distracted by the false hopes of Marxist doctrine.<lb/>
In so much of the world the news is hopeful. Peaceful change continues in Eastern Europe. We are more hopeful than ever that Western Europe, through its democratic institutions, the European Community, NATO and the CSCE, will respond constructively and imaginatively. But this year we face a new challenge from the Gulf to the whole world order. We are confident that we are pursuing the right policies to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait. We are determined to reverse this aggression. We are clear that, if our peaceful policies show no success, the military option exists and we will not be afraid to useit.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03062">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03063"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, for his wide-ranging introduction to the debate. As he said, one of the difficulties about debates on foreign affairs and defence is the impossibility of doing justice to every facet of so very large a subject. I shall try to concentrate on two or three of the immediate problems facing us at this time.<lb/>
Like the noble Earl, I would very much like to welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn. We look forward to hearing her maiden speech. We know of her outstanding work in Hong Kong and of the leadership that she has provided during this difficult transitional period. I hope that it will be possible for us to have a full debate on Hong Kong very soon. We also look forward to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest.<lb/>
Since the last debate on the Address 12 months ago the world has seen great changes and new challenges. A year ago the Berlin Wall, symbol of a divided world and menacing confrontation between East and West, crumbled. A new hope was born and the suspicion and hatred of decades seemed to fade away. How do things look today? Is that hope still alive? These are two of the central questions that we must ask in this debate; I shall return to them in a moment.<lb/>
We have known for years that the Middle East is the flashpoint where war could be triggered off. Iraq and Iran fought a cruel and unnecessary war throughout the 1980s. On 2nd August the leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, ordered his forces to invade and occupy the small, independent country of Kuwait, although he had informed the President of Egypt that he had no such intention. This House returned to debate the crisis and its implications on 6th September. With my colleagues in another place I made it plain that we on this side of the House supported the actions of the Government and of the United Nations.<lb/>
In the two months since that debate several events have taken place. But, notwithstanding the unprecedented unity of the United Nations in its condemnation of that criminal invasion, the Iraqi army remains in Kuwait. The United Nations resolutions are treated with contempt. Since Iraq occupied Kuwait the United Nations has passed 10 resolutions. The main object has been to bring pressure to bear on Iraq to withdraw peacefully. Economic sanctions are the spearhead of the resolutions. They are supported by a naval and air blockade.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to sanctions. He spoke of them with some confidence although Saddam Hussein gives the appearance of being as obdurate as ever. I hope that the noble Earl who is to wind up for the Government will give us the latest estimates on the efficacy of the economic sanctions. The United States' State Department, in its first report on the effect of sanctions, states that 97 per cent. of Iraq's oil exports have been choked off and that imports to Iraq of machinery, industrial goods, semi-finished goods and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0143"/>
<col>207</col>
raw materials have declined by 90 per cent. Furthermore, the report says that food prices have increased eightfold in Iraq.<lb/>
Experts like Mr. Omar Hassan of the Gulf Centre for Strategic Studies are saying that there is considerable ground for optimism that sanctions will work. Others are more sceptical. Mr. Leo Drollas, of the Centre for Global Energy, has said:
<quote>"Saddam just sits there and waits for others to lose heart".</quote>
It will be helpful to have the Government's latest reaction, especially as remarks made recently have tended to create an atmosphere of uncertainty. The announcement that a further 100,000 American troops are to be sent to Saudi Arabia and a report that additional British forces may well be going there reinforces the belief that war is imminent or at least inevitable.<lb/>
I make no comment at this stage save to say that I hope that the Minister, the noble Earl, Lord Arran, can give us some clarification and tell us whether the Government still believe that sanctions can lead to a peaceful solution. Some take the view that sanctions should be given six months to work. At one stage this was said to be the State Department's opinion and one that was shared by Her Majesty's Government. I note that Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Daniel Moynihan argued strongly in Congress yesterday that sanctions should be given time to work.<lb/>
This leads me to another key question. Under what circumstances and under precisely what authority would military action be taken? The point was raised during Question Time a few minutes ago. Of course we understand that if Saddam Hussein takes further aggressive military action then there would be a military response by the United Nations forces. We assume that the objective would be to drive the Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. But military action in response to Saddam Hussein's continuing refusal to recognise United Nations resolutions demanding his withdrawal raises other considerations.<lb/>
The Prime Minister said outside No. 10 Downing Street on Friday last, when she stood there with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker:
<quote>"We have the legal authority to take military action".</quote>
Is Mrs. Thatcher saying that the United Nations forces in Saudi Arabia and in the Gulf can and may launch an attack without further recourse to the Security Council? In short, are the Government now saying that they contemplate military action under Article 51 of Chapter 27 of the Charter, or do they think that a resolution under Article 42, which provides for the use of force, should be sought in the Security Council? This seems to me to be the crux of the matter, and, as the House will appreciate, there are deep waters here. I think that we must do all we can to preserve a united front in the United Nations. I was glad therefore to read Mr. Douglas Hurd's remarks in the <i>Independent</i> on 5th November. They were:
<quote>"There is much to be said for keeping the maximum support of the international coalition. So long as there is
<col>208</col>
confidence that a further resolution will not be put 'at the mercy of a minority who have the capacity to delay', there is an argument for one to reinforce solidarity".</quote>
It is important that all parties in Parliament should be united at this critical time. The Foreign Secretary's remarks help to that end.<lb/>
We should also be grateful to the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury and to his Eminence Cardinal Hume for the lead they have given. I note the Cardinal's remarks in his letter to <i>The Times</i> on Friday that the United Nations has become an effective vehicle for formulating the international response and that obtaining its authority for military action is of great importance.<lb/>
In his opening speech, the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, referred to the hostages in Iraq and Kuwait. We all have very deep sympathy for them and their families. I join him in paying tribute to all those who have worked to help the hostages. There is no defence whatsoever for the way the Iraqi leadership has treated them. They have been manipulated as pawns in a sinister game, when every rule of law between nations lays down that they should be allowed to return unconditionally to their own countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03064"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03065"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I also join the noble Earl in condemning and deploring the conduct of Iraqi forces in Kuwait. One of the pretexts for the invasion was that Kuwait was part of Iraq and that its people were Moslem brothers and sisters desiring to return to the family. But all the evidence shows that Kuwaitis and others resident there have been treated with extreme brutality. One report from Amnesty International, after interviews with scores of people who have fled Kuwait, reads as follows:
<quote>"their testimony builds up a horrifying picture of widespread arrests, torture under interrogation, summary executions and mass extra-judicial killings &#x2026; scores of hangings have also been reported on the grounds of Kuwait University of people suspected of opposing Iraq's annexation of Kuwait".</quote>
It appears that Kuwait and its people are being systematically and deliberately destroyed and that the case for reparations is unanswerable. We must consider whether there is anything to be said for Saddam Hussein. Has he any defence for his actions? He has said that Kuwait belongs to Iraq but, even if that were true, which is strongly denied, it does not justify his criminal acts. He has claimed that he acts and speaks for Islam especially in the context of Israel. That is refuted by his Arab neighbours. He has tried to link the Gulf crisis with the Arab-Israel problem. It is an astute and unscrupulous argument because its object is to deflect world and Arab attention away from the main issue: namely, forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait without conditions.<lb/>
A negotiated peace is desirable, if it is a just peace, and many believe that this can still be achieved. I hope they are right, although I believe that negotiation is only meaningful if it is carried out by or through the United Nations. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has made one attempt, as the House knows. We must always bear in mind that British forces are in the Middle East at the behest and under the authority of the United Nations.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0144"/>
<col>209</col>
They are there with the forces of other nations, and 54 nations, a third of the United Nations' membership, are now making a military or economic contribution to the great effort being made to resolve the problem. Let us hope&#x2014;and I fear that it has to be a faint hope&#x2014;that Saddam Hussein, or other Iraqi leaders, see sense and withdraw from Kuwait. The United Nations cannot reverse its resolutions, nor can it be humiliated; that could really plunge the world into chaos. That is something we cannot contemplate, and Britain, of all countries, must stand by and be loyal to the United Nations.<lb/>
The second great issue which faces us at the present time is that of economic and monetary union. The Rome Summit in December will be of great importance and we must hope that the Government will have constructive policies to put forward. Incidentally, one lesson to be learnt is that the way a case is put is almost as important as the case itself. The key issues are the balance between national parliaments and the European Parliament; the question of subsidiarity, referred to by the noble Earl; and the need for real accountability, for it seems obvious that we could not contemplate a central bank reaching major decisions about national economies unless those countries had the opportunity to intervene beforehand. This is why economic union must be considered in parallel with political union.<lb/>
The crucial point is that we must not be isolated in these discussions. We could and should play a leading role, not least because our experience of democratic government and the role of a civil service is not inconsiderable. I do not, however, intend to discuss this issue fully or further at this time because we shall have the opportunity in a few days' time for a full debate on economic and political union. That is the subject of a report by a Select Committee of this House chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington. I understand that the document, which I have not yet read, is a comprehensive one and can form the basis for a debate of the first importance.<lb/>
Finally, I return to my first point; namely, the revolution in Eastern Europe, the collapse of communism and the gradual emergence of free societies from the ashes of oppression. The pace of progress over the past 12 months has varied from country to country but one thing is clear: acute economic and environmental problems remain to be overcome. Whatever may have been our doubts&#x2014;there were apprehensions in this House and in the country&#x2014;we wish the new reunited Germany success in raising the standards of the East up to the level of the West. The new Germany will be a great European and world power and the countries of central Europe in particular will be influenced by her policies. It is essential that the new Germany should remain within the European Community and in the new and reformed NATO.<lb/>
This debate is concerned with defence as well as with foreign affairs, and my noble friend Lord Richard&#x2014;I am grateful to the noble Earl for his kind references to my noble friend&#x2014;will deal more fully with them when he winds up for us. However, I should
<col>210</col>
just like to say this: the new and improved relations between East and West are leading to progress in all areas of disarmament. We urge the Government to take full advantage of the situation.<lb/>
This debate gives me the opportunity to congratulate President Gorbachev on the award to him of the Nobel Peace Prize. In my view, he thoroughly deserves it. Without his initiative, the changes in Eastern Europe would not have taken place at this time. Let us then consider his achievement.<lb/>
President Gorbachev did not demur when the countries of Central and Eastern Europe recovered their freedom. He gave his blessing to the reunification of Germany; he withdrew Soviet troops from Afghanistan; and he supported the moves for peace in southern Africa and South-East Asia. <i>Glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> have created difficulties for him in his own country, difficulties which threaten his position and make him unpopular at home. However, be that as it may, the world is a very different place today from the way it looked five years ago. The man responsible for that deserves more than one Nobel Peace Prize&#x0021; We do not intervene in the internal affairs of other countries, but we hope that he and Mr. Yeltsin, and others, will unite to resolve their problems very soon.<lb/>
How has the West reacted to these historic changes? Of course, the great majority welcome them. For the first time in modern history there is a real prospect of permanent peace in Europe. Western Europe, America and Japan must surely wish to sustain the new democracies and to do everything possible to help President Gorbachev through his difficulties. Help along the lines of the Marshall Plan has been proposed: that would certainly be an investment in the future. I warmly welcome the announcement made by the noble Earl about the increase in the know-how fund which, as I know from the talks that I have had with representatives of Eastern European governments, is much appreciated. However, we in the West generally must think in more extensive terms than &#x00A3;15 million or &#x00A3;30 million.<lb/>
When we look around the world there are times when we feel like weeping, primarily because of man's inhumanity to man. But there are other signs which give great cause for hope of a better future for mankind: the prospect of a lasting peace in Europe; the gradual change towards justice and equality in Africa; and, even in days of crisis, the emergence of the United Nations as a world force for peace. That is the vision which should strengthen and direct the Government in this historic hour.</membercontribution></p>

I should like to join with the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, in welcoming the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn. I greatly look forward to hearing the noble Baroness not only on this but on many subsequent occasions. I also extend that welcome to the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest.<lb/>

<col>211</col>
I share with the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, the problem which this kind of debate presents, especially when so many noble Lords wish to speak. I shall therefore not follow the noble Earl in his <i>tour d'horizon.</i> It would be a waste of time and we would be here until very late tonight. In connection with events to which the noble Lord referred when making a tribute to Lord Gorbachev, I merely repeat&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03069"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we would welcome him in this House.<lb/>
As I was saying, I shall merely repeat the words used by the noble Lord, Lord Dacre, in a recent debate. He said that the extraordinary thing about the present situation is that we have now achieved exactly what we wanted to achieve in 1949; that is, a united democratic Germany allied to the West, the collapse of communism and a free Eastern and Central Europe. Therefore, we have a second opportunity to rebuild Europe. It is an opportunity which we dare not fail to seize.<lb/>
Huge issues are before the House. There is the Gulf crisis, about which my noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham will be speaking later; there are the developments in the European Community and the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to which my noble friend Lord Jenkins of Hillhead will probably be turning his attention tomorrow; and there are the developments in Hong Kong about which all of us must be concerned. However, I do not propose to speak on any of those major subjects. I shall concentrate on events in Central and Eastern Europe.<lb/>
I returned recently from an Anglo-Polish conference, the first to take place since a free government was installed in Warsaw. Much depends on the success of the revolution in which the hopes of so many millions of people are concentrated and invested and which is so important to Poland. In my view, we in this country have a special obligation to Poland. However, that is not to say that Central Europe, which I distinguish sharply from Eastern Europe&#x2014;by Central Europe I mean Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Austria&#x2014;can be considered in isolation. Indeed, it has been drastically affected by events in the Gulf, by the unification of Germany and by the chaos in the USSR.<lb/>
When the present Polish Government took office they found raging, rampant inflation of the South American variety, a geriatric agricultural and industrial base and a country burdened with foreign debt of no less than 40 billion dollars. Their response was characteristically bold and courageous. They could reform the system and then stabilise the economy; or, they could try to stabilise the economy and then reform the system. They chose to do neither. They chose to stabilise and transform the economy simultaneously. That was to take an enormous and very substantial risk. But the results are remarkable. They abolished subsidies; they unified market and

official exchange rates; they liberalised foreign trade; and they embarked upon a programme of privatisation.<lb/>
In August, inflation in Poland was 2 per cent.; it rose to 4 per cent. in September, owing to the Gulf crisis. The cost of living was put up 30 per cent. in January, but there have been no riots. Mr. Gomulka, Mr. Gierek and the last general secretary were all overturned because they moved subsidies by 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. It is a most remarkable tribute to what a government can achieve with the confidence of the people, if they have the courage and initiative to do so.<lb/>
Unemployment, which was nil, now stands at one million&#x2014;not very much, it may be said, out of a working population of 17 million. However, if you are used to having no unemployment and if, owing to your economy, the unemployment pay which can be offered is very small, then that is a pretty savage increase. And it will go further.<lb/>
Having achieved this remarkable result, having balanced their budget&#x2014;in fact, they have a budget surplus&#x2014;and having a surplus on foreign trade, the people of Poland have been ambushed, if I may put it that way, by three events. First. the Gulf has drastically raised the cost of oil and severely reduced remittances and debt repayments from Iraq, while Russian oil is in short supply and its price has increased. Secondly, they have been hit by German unification which has removed a hitherto safe and secure market for their exports. Thirdly, the chaos in Russia, especially as regards the Russian states on Poland's borders, has led to very serious economic losses.<lb/>
Above all there is the Polish debt of 40 billion dollars. Rescheduling does not solve the problem; it merely postpones it. The existence of that debt is very serious in terms of the expectations of the Polish people. It is a very serious disincentive for foreign investors and for the transferability of profits which foreign investors may receive from Poland. As 75 per cent. of the debt is not to banks but to governments, it is a problem that we&#x2014;who hope that the revolution in Central Europe will be a success&#x2014;must take on board and must take seriously. We have to give the Polish people a chance to reform their society politically and economically. To reform it economically, that huge debt burden must be reduced. That is a very high priority.<lb/>
I should like to speak briefly of the political situation in which the Polish people find themselves. It is typical of Central Europe. There are 40 million Poles. Poland is about the same size as Spain. It is in a central, crucial area lying between Russia in chaos and Germany reunited. Poland is searching for stability; that is what it needs. In addition, in order to provide that stability it needs to rebuild, to reinforce, and to institutionalise its relations with the West. It has to do so without neglecting its historical connections with the East, with its neighbours Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and also with the Ukraine and with the Baltic republics. A delicate balancing operation has to be achieved. But let no one
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0146"/>
<col>213</col>
have any reservation that the Poles see themselves as part of western Christendom. That is where they see their home.<lb/>
However, at the moment they see an asymmetry within Europe. On the one side they see Western Europe integrated politically and economically. That integration which they welcome is becoming stronger and closer day by day. In the East they see the disappearance, the redundancy, the decay of the Warsaw Treaty organisation, which exists only in name, and of COMECON which also exists only in name.<lb/>
It is a moving and disturbing message that I bring home. The Poles see themselves isolated in a vacuum belonging to no defence or economic organisation but sitting between two giant neighbours. That is the problem we have to recognise. To deal with it, Poland urgently needs a pan-European security structure to which it can belong. It needs recognised limitation in conventional arms in Central Europe. It needs means for dealing with conflict which, in that part of Europe, with the rise of nationalism all over the place, is an urgent, dangerous and pressing problem of which they are acutely aware.<lb/>
I was sorry that the noble Earl did not mention the Council of Europe in his <i>tour d'horizon.</i> The Council of Europe has an extraordinarily important role to play in all these matters. Above all Poland needs to strengthen its links with Western Europe through the Council of Europe, through OECD and ultimately through joining the European Community. Hence there is the importance of the association agreement and the importance for Poland of fixing a date, no matter the qualifications surrounding it, for making its dream of joining the European Community a reality. Poland knows that that means drastic reform of its economy. It knows that it cannot be achieved within the next decade. But if we had as an aim that it should join by the year 2000 in some shape or form, I believe that it would be a major step forward.<lb/>
Finally the Poles are deeply concerned with their two neighbours, and with the consequences of the disintegration, as they see it, of the USSR in the Ukraine, in Byelorussia and in the Baltic republics. They say, "Let us suppose that there is famine in the Ukraine or an outbreak of some revolutionary movement." They may be invaded by floods of refugees. Who will deal with that, and how will they deal with it? Have we considered the consequences of that problem? What are we prepared to do to help them?<lb/>
That is one fear. The other fear is of course economic domination by Germany. The Poles welcome Germany within the European Community. They welcome Germany within NATO. They welcome the new border agreement. But they are inevitably &#x2014;and who would not be with their history? &#x2014;alarmed, apprehensive and conscious of this giant economic and political force on their border. That is why our connection with Poland is so immensely important to it. That is why we have a real obligation to help ii to find a new security to help fill the vacuum
<col>214</col>
in which it considers that it is living in Central Europe. That is important not only for the Poles but for the future of democracy in Central Europe.<lb/>
I believe that there are four matters that we should bear in mind. The first is very simple. Having abolished visas for Czechoslovakia and Hungary, it is truly insulting that we should insist on visas for Poland. Each year 60,000 Poles come here; 1,400,000 go to Germany. The Germans have announced that they are abolishing visas for the Poles. We stick to visas. I know that that is not the fault of the Foreign Office; it is the obsession of our dear old Home Office with immigration control. The visa regulations that we operate against Poland do more damage to our relations with that country than words can possibly express. Secondly, we ought to deal with the massive debt so that Poland can see light on the horizon. Thirdly, we can press forward with a pan-European security structure to which it can belong. Lastly, we can give the Poles a date at which they can aim to join the European Community.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03071"><member>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps it is not inappropriate for me as a fairly new Member of this House to say how impressive I found the first two speeches in the debate, with their note of solemn responsibility in the face of the present crisis and near unanimity. I thank the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos.<lb/>
It may seem odd for a bishop to be speaking in the debate. However, bishops are fairly close to the people &#x2014;almost more so than other Members of this House, and indeed Members of another place, dare I say? &#x2014;because we go to our dioceses and are among our people. We talk about defence and armaments. Their costs affect the people, wherever they are.<lb/>
In speaking about the broad content of the gracious Speech, in particular on defence and foreign affairs, we must of course keep up our guard. The Question on the Order Paper yesterday from the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, was important. I suppose that if two people were departing from a duel they would do so still keeping their eyes on each other. Yet in the face of the brave and quite remarkable initiatives by Mr. Gorbachev, who has coined the important words <i>"perestroika"</i> and <i>"glasnost",</i> is there no way in which we can constantly be ready to show an equal response and equal generosity?<lb/>
Of course the disbandment of the Russian forces must be demanded and negotiated, but we must surely realise that this cannot take place overnight for social and economic reasons. I believe that we must all seek to dismantle the arsenals which we built up in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The building up of them has pauperised Russia and very nearly brought America low, for the national debt of America is into trillions.<lb/>
As has already been said in this debate, 1989&#x2013;90 was an <i>annus mirabilis.</i> I myself was in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia, this summer. The sheer exhilaration of having cast off the dominance of Marxist communism was remarkable to see and wonderful to experience. The new initiatives in South Africa, the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0147"/>
<col>215</col>
release of Nelson Mandela and the lulling of the wars in central America, have all been good news. We were on the edge of a decade of peacemaking. I was in the UNICEF building about a month ago before the summit for children. There was a special appeal to the world's religions for the world's children. As I sat there seeing helicopters taking off from the pad across the East River, I realised that for the first time in my lifetime we could make the world a better place for all its inhabitants. We have the technology, the resources and the know-how.<lb/>
However, all has been blighted by the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. Perhaps I may say that the Standing Conference of European Churches has taken on a new and important role. Much is being done by the Churches&#x2014;not, I hope, to replace a Mediterranean and medieval dominance but to stand alongside those who are trying to grapple with the issues which the new freedom has brought. There is much optimism and hope there. Nevertheless, it shows that however optimistic Europe may be, we cannot have peace by ourselves unless we are prepared to make peace for the one world in which we live and to take on board the frustrations and the angers of other nations, other races and other religions.<lb/>
The bishops have been blamed recently for being silent on the question of the Gulf. That is a new approach because we are usually told to shut up. The reason is this. In the face of a situation which is deeply complex, where reticence and restraint are of the essence, it does not necessarily help for bishops from Worcester, Hereford or all over England to raise yet another strident voice. The fact is that we are emphatically for a peaceful solution. However, we do not want at the same time to give comfort to Saddam Hussein by anything we may say.<lb/>
We cannot legitimise international piracy merely because we are too timid to take action. We cannot bow before insolent aggression merely because we fear that the cost of resistance would be too painful. Rightly, we have deployed our forces, together with those of America and many other nations, within the United Nations Organisation. We must constantly think of them. Indeed, I believe that in every church in the land last Sunday prayers were said for those who are in the Gulf on our behalf and for those who have critical decisions to make and the burden of awesome responsibility. We should at least be thankful that the end of the cold war has made this unanimity possible in the United Nations. Long may it be kept so. We dare not lose that; it is our trump card.<lb/>
Yet we must desire, we must pray for, we must work for a peaceful solution. It is the number one requirement, if a war is to be just, that every possible avenue for peace has first been explored. Is it true that the American ambassador in Iraq gave it as her opinion that a move by Iraq into Kuwait would be regarded as an Arab matter? If this is so and if Saddam Hussein has misread the signals, is there no way by which we can find a ladder down which he can climb? I know that this is not easy, but it should not
<col>216</col>
be beyond our capacity. If it is the nature of Arab people to bargain, is it totally impossible for us to talk in some way, even if by secret diplomacy?<lb/>
In so far as Saddam Hussein is an Arab soldier and a Moslem, will hurling threats at him have any effect but to generate in him a total defiance? Is there no way in which Her Majesty's Government can find methods other than the solution of war? Again, in the traditional doctrine of the just war, it is not right to go to war unless one can be confident of improving the situation. I took great interest in the remark made already in this debate that it would be absolutely fatal if the United Nations were humiliated. We have to be able to know that we can improve the situation by taking up arms.<lb/>
Furthermore, it is part of the doctrine of the just war that action must be targeted, contained and economical of casualties. I fear that it is unlikely that any military action in the Gulf could take place without horrendous casualties, widespread damage both to oil installations and to the environment and the prodigious costs involved. It may be that tragically this cannot be avoided, but at least let us not be bland or jingoistic.<lb/>
I do not believe that it is quite fair to make a comparison between today and 1939 because the weapons of modern-day warfare are so devastating that it would be hard to contain any conflagration that broke out. In the present situation, as opposed to 1939, there is the racial element. There is also the North-South divide and the question of religion. If there were to be a necessary war, decades of avowed revenge in the name of religion could well ensue.<lb/>
I dare to finish with an <i>apologia pro vita nostra</i> for those on these Benches. It is sometimes said that we would be more respected in the country if we took a more combative stance. I hope that in everything I have said I have shown that the word "appeasement" should not be addressed in this direction. However, would anyone respect leaders in the Christian Church who did not speak out about the horrors of modern warfare? Do your Lordships really want a Bench of Bishops who have nothing to say on their own account but only place a sacramental coping-stone on the edifice of present-day society, and that recognised by perhaps only part of our society? I believe and hope that if by any chance we ever had a Labour government we should stand in solidarity with the government in any event&#x2014;but in critical solidarity. Would noble Lords not agree with Rabbi Sachs, who recently said in an interview that he felt that it was the duty of religion to provoke questions and stimulate thought? I say that because sometimes an apologia is necessary. If I were a pacifist I should not be standing here annoying some noble Lords on my right.<lb/>
I end by saying that if we know ourselves at all we know the feelings of aggression, of pugnacity and warlikeness which well up in us at the provocation of a ruthless man like Saddam Hussein. I believe that those are bad counsellors. Patience and strength are better&#x2014;the patience and strength which will wait until sanctions bite and new talks can begin. I submit that as a contribution to this debate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03072">4.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03073"><member>Lord Fitt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is almost with reluctance that I intervene in this debate. It is the first debate on the Queen's Speech in which I have spoken since I entered this House. I am reluctant because Northern Ireland and the problems of Ireland do not fit readily into any of the five categories of debate on the Queen's Speech. It does not fit into home affairs or into foreign affairs.<lb/>
I have listened with interest to the intense interest, understanding and compassion already expressed by the four previous speakers regarding the affairs of Eastern Europe and the international problems that have arisen over the past year. However, the greatest problem that this House and the other place have had to consider over the past few years has been that of Northern Ireland. No soldiers have yet been killed in the Gulf, and I hope that no soldiers will be killed in a Gulf war. I attended the remembrance service on Sunday: I fervently hope that by this time next year there will not be more names added to the list of people killed in war. However, 429 young British soldiers have given their lives in Northern Ireland. Hundreds more, if not thousands, have been brutally maimed and injured. Yet this House does not seem to be able to come to any conclusion about how to deal with the problem.<lb/>
I listened to my noble friend Lord Cledwyn this afternoon. He said that with the coming down of the Berlin wall the suspicion and hatred of decades seemed to have faded away. The Berlin wall came down last year, but three more were erected in Belfast this year. There are three more barriers to keep the communities apart. Nothing seems to have changed. As an Irishman who lives in these islands, I am as concerned about those world problems, but my more immediate concern is with what is happening in the country in which I have spent most of my life.<lb/>
Five years ago, on 15th November, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed. I have the <i>Hansard</i> of the debates which took place in this House on Tuesday, 26th November 1985. A great deal of optimism was expressed then about what the Anglo-Irish Agreement would achieve, how it would bring about reconcilia-tion between the communities, end the alienation of the Catholic population in Northern Ireland, bring together the forces for peace, improve relations between this country and the Irish republic and allow the Irish republic to enter into extradition cases where necessary. I defy any Member of your Lordships' House to say that any of the objectives mentioned in <i>Hansard</i> for 26th November 1985 has been achieved. Not one of them has been achieved. In the meantime 300 more people have been killed in Northern Ireland. So Northern Ireland is a problem which is just as serious as any in other parts of the globe.<lb/>
Not only has the Anglo-Irish Agreement failed to achieve any of its objectives and to bring about better conditions, it has led to far greater alienation and isolation of the communities in Northern Ireland than existed before the signing of the agreement. I believe that this House should show the same concern and compassion as has been shown here today in relation
<col>218</col>
to world problems and I intend to listen to other speakers in this debate and see whether we cannot do something to end the terrible divisions which exist in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
In the five years of its existence, the Anglo-Irish Agreement has failed to grapple with the problem. However, the problem goes back much further. Is there anyone in this House who would deny that however the situation in the Middle East may develop, however long it may continue, however long a possible war may last and whatever the number of casualties that that war may bring about, at the end of that war we shall still have the problem of Northern Ireland? As Churchill said at the end of the First World War, after cataclysmic changes had taken place throughout the world the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and South Tyrone rose again. Therefore, I believe that this House should take a greater interest in discovering whether anything can be done in relation to the Irish problem.<lb/>
The Anglo-Irish Agreement has not achieved any success. It must be looked at again. If any Act of Parliament which was designed to achieve a particular aim in relation to Ireland is seen to have been an abject failure let us recognise that fact. In the field of extradition, which was one of the objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, what has been achieved? There has been the Father Ryan affair. Week after week and month after month Irish courts say that they cannot extradite people who have been found guilty of the most horrendous crimes and release them on the grounds that the offences were political offences and it is a constitutional imperative to comply with Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution. Those people are freely roaming the streets of the Republic of Ireland, much to the anger and distress not only of the Unionist Protestant population but of people like myself who are opposed to murder. That is one reason why the Anglo-Irish Agreement has not been a success.<lb/>
We were also told that the agreement would bring about devolved government and create political structures in which the Protestant and Catholic communities could get together in some form of executive. We have now been told&#x2014;no later than last week&#x2014;that that is no longer attainable. The SDLP and the Irish Government have said that they do not want a devolved government. They want to create some other structure which will involve the Unionist Party. So there are two objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which are not attainable.<lb/>
Last week I was considering whether to take part in this debate and I wondered what the justification would be for doing so. Then I heard on the radio that four men had been murdered in a very brutal way when they were on a duck hunting expedition. That is my justification for taking part in this debate&#x2014;that and all the other murders that have taken place. The IRA has sunk to depths of depravity that I as a Catholic and an Irishman cannot begin fully to understand or imagine. How can anyone take an innocent man, strap or tie him into a car, load it with explosive and tell him to drive into an army post and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0149"/>
<col>219</col>
kill five young British soldiers? Yet those are people who are supposed to have been born into the same community as I was.<lb/>
Again, I watched the funeral of the late Cardinal O'Fiaich. I saw Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, two representatives of Sinn Fein, taking communion. They were taking communion at that funeral. It made me sick to the heart to see it because those people proclaim that they are of the same faith as I am. I should find it very difficult to kneel down at the same altar, even in a symbolic way to associate with people who have been so instrumental in supporting and condoning the terrible acts of murder which have taken place in Ireland.<lb/>
Noble Lords were told that the Anglo-Irish Agreement would lead to better co-operation between the Government of the Republic and the Government in Britain. Last week the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that in this Parliament he would promulgate emergency provisions to take account of happenings in Northern Ireland. His co-chairman, Mr. Gerry Collins, immediately went on radio and television in the Republic of Ireland to say that he would not accept any further emergency legislation. That can do nothing but give support and succour to the people who are committing acts of violence.<lb/>
Yet the Anglo-Irish Agreement was alleged to mean that the British and the Irish governments would have meetings in silence and that they would not use megaphone diplomacy. That is exactly what is happening at the moment.<lb/>
A ray of hope came from Ireland last week in the appointment of Bishop Cahal Daly to be Primate of All Ireland. I believe that that is the best Catholic ecclesiastical appointment that I have seen in my lifetime. I regard Cahal Daly as one of the great ecclesiastical figures of this century. My only regret is that he was not made Primate of All Ireland 15 or 20 years ago. I believe that he is a man of great intellect and compassion. He is a man opposed to every action of the IRA and has made himself very unpopular in some circles by saying so.<lb/>
I am no expert in ecclesiastical matters, much less in canon law, but the other morning on radio I heard Bishop Cahal Daly speak on the question of his appointment. He said that there was only a small number of people in Ireland&#x2014;Catholics&#x2014;supporting the IRA. I am not too sure that he is correct. I should like to know just how many people of the Catholic faith and community support the horrendous murder campaign that the IRA has been commissioning over the past 20 years. But if there is only a small number &#x2014;I sincerely hope that it is a small number&#x2014;as a humble Catholic I urge the Primate of All Ireland to consider excommunication.<lb/>
Many people have said&#x2014;they may be right&#x2014;that it would not change anything. I believe that it would change the situation. I believe that if the Catholic Church under its new Primate were to take the view that those people have committed acts which are not
<col>220</col>
only anti-Catholic but anti-Christian and anti-human and have therefore debarred themselves from any solace that the Catholic Church can give, and excommunicated them if they are a small number, then when the next murders take place (and we can be assured that murders will take place) the Catholic Church can say that they are not its members. It can say that they cannot attend and are not welcome at any of its services.<lb/>
As at present constituted, the IRA is a disgrace to the island of Ireland, a disgrace to Christianity and to humanity. The Catholic Church under its new Primate should have absolutely no hesitation in saying so.<lb/>
I am glad, although not in any personal sense, that there is such a large audience in your Lordships' House to hear me speak today. Normally when the affairs of Ireland are discussed it is late in the evening in a very small House. That is unfair to the problems and the people of Ireland.<lb/>
Last week, as has already been commented upon, there was the election of a woman, Mary Robinson, as President of Ireland. I was delighted to see that big breakaway from the civil war attitudes that have existed in Ireland for so many years. I know Mary Robinson. She is a woman of great intellect. She will be concerned. I have no hesitation in predicting that there will be a new type of presidency in the island of Ireland. She was a member of the Labour Party. A few days after the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed she resigned from the Labour Party with the very same objections that I had; namely, on the grounds that the agreement was too one-sided, gave too much to the SDLP, to Nationalists and the Irish Government and was absolutely nothing but betrayal to the majority community in Northern Ireland. She resigned on that issue.<lb/>
Mr. Gow, the MP, also resigned on the same issue. So it is not only a concern for Unionists, Right-wingers, Left-wingers or Protestants. People who understand Ireland objected to the conditions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I hope that, limited as the new presidential powers in Ireland may be, Mary Robinson, who has such an understanding of the Northern Ireland problem, will find it easier to talk to the Unionist population and that the Unionist population will find it easier to talk to a President of Ireland who understands its problems.<lb/>
The malaise has existed in Ireland for the past 20 years. The present Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brooke, began an initiative earlier this year, in January. He was well intentioned and sincere. He thought that he could bring the warring communities together to create some form of political structure which would be in the interests of all the people in Northern Ireland. He has been unsuccessful. I do not blame him for being unsuccessful. I am aware of the 700 years of frustration and suspicion which have led to the attitudes in Northern Ireland today. But I make an appeal to him: do not try to maintain the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the hope that it will bring success five years or 10 years in the future.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0150"/>
<col>221</col>
I know that there are five former Secretaries of State now in your Lordships' House. Anyone who speaks to them privately will hear them concede that the present political arrangements under the Anglo-Irish Agreement will not bring peace to Northern Ireland. I know that many people will meet me in the corridor and say, "What would you do?" That is a question which does not have an easy answer. I think that I would tell the Irish Government that they must deliver on extradition. They must ensure that murderers who are identified in the Republic of Ireland are handed over when they have committed such atrocious crimes. In itself, that would do a lot to relieve the tensions and suspicions that exist within the community in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
We have direct rule at the moment. It is not the best way to govern Northern Ireland but to me it is the only acceptable way. The Unionists in Northern Ireland and the minority community will accept direct rule, with all its imperfections, rather than try to get together in a way that would begin to take the first tentative steps towards reconciling the communities.<lb/>
I end on the note on which I began. There are many problems in Europe that certainly seek the attention of this House and every other democratic forum, but in the process of looking into those problems of Europe let us not forget that long problem <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the relations between this country and Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03075"><member>Baroness Dunn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great privilege for me to become a Member of your Lordships' House and to speak today. My subject will of course be my home town, Hong Kong, to which reference was made in the gracious Speech and by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, in his opening statement. First of all I should like to say how much I have appreciated the courtesy and attention I have received from Members of your Lordships' House on the many visits on behalf of Hong Kong that I have paid over many years. I hope that I myself and Hong Kong can count on your continuing attention over the coming years.<lb/>
We are now nearly half way between the initialling of the Joint Declaration in 1984 and the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997. Viewed against the long span of history, I am sure that the century and a half of British administration of Hong Kong will come to be seen as a brief interlude between a Chinese past and a Chinese future. The humiliation visited upon China by those who took Hong Kong in 1841 as a safe haven for the opium and tea trades still loomed large in the minds of China's leaders when negotiations began in 1982 about Hong Kong's future. But whatever one's view of the circumstances in which the link with Britain was forged, Britain can be proud of the legacy it will leave behind.<lb/>
Colonialism is an outdated concept, but the quality, discipline, and decency of those who devoted their lives to administering British dependent territories deserve recognition, and I am glad of the opportunity to give it today. Hong Kong has been particularly well served by successive governors, notably the noble Lord, Lord MacLehose. I know how closely the
<col>222</col>
present governor, Sir David Wilson, keeps the Government informed and how strongly he represents Hong Kong interests.<lb/>
The years of British administration have given Hong Kong a firm respect for the rule of law; for a system of justice under which all are equal before an independent judiciary; for freedoms of speech, of association, of travel and of ideas. It has created a society that combines opportunities for individual wealth creation with compassion and concern for those who cannot fend for themselves, and which welcomes all who can contribute, regardless of race, colour or creed.<lb/>
The fusion of these values with the energy, enterprise, determination and work ethic of the people of Hong Kong has produced a unique community of which I speak with pride. It is now up to us, the people of Hong Kong, to demonstrate that we are capable of generating from within our own community the same measure of discipline and accountability of the administration that Britain has exercised on our behalf for so long. We shall be taking a major step in this direction next year with the first direct elections to the Legislative Council. The timetable for building up our representative institutions to the point where they can take Hong Kong seamlessly through 1997, as provided in the Basic Law, is formidably tight, but succeed we must.<lb/>
The greatest task ahead is developing a relationship of mutual respect and trust with China. Hong Kong's future is inextricably linked with China. For Hong Kong, a working relationship with China is not, and cannot be, a matter for diplomatic fine tuning; it is the only way to bring to reality the bold concept of "one country, two systems". Hong Kong people do not lack courage or self-confidence; their achievements in the last 40 years prove that. Nor do they lack faith in their own ability to meet the challenges of 1997. But they are required to take part in a constitutional, political and social experiment that is without precedent.<lb/>
The agreement that brought this experiment about was negotiated by Britain and China and approved by this Parliament, without the formal representation of the people of Hong Kong when their fate was determined. They are asked to believe that because of the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law the expected course of their lives will not be subject to fundamental change, despite the essentially different political philosophy that prevails in China. That is bound to cause apprehensions&#x2014;and they will not be dispelled by exhortations that people must have faith and be confident of their future. Indeed for Hong Kong people it is not easy to be tolerant of such exhortations when they come from those who share none of the personal risks.<lb/>
My Lords, I make these points because if there are signs of anxiety and vulnerability in the last years of British rule, I hope that Her Majesty's Government will show understanding. The transition to Chinese rule will inevitably be difficult at times, perhaps even turbulent, and will require wisdom and sensitivity not
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0151"/>
<col>223</col>
just in Hong Kong but also in London and Beijing. I am convinced that parliamentary interest can help during these years.<lb/>
There is a tendency for Parliament to become involved only when there is a crisis in Hong Kong, and meanwhile to hope that we shall make it to the finishing line without causing too much bother. I know that Parliament has spent more time on Hong Kong in these last years than ever before, and we are grateful for your efforts, for instance, over the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Bill. But in these years of transition it is in all our interests for Parliament to devote time and attention to Hong Kong to ensure that the influence that Parliament is capable of exercising has its effect.<lb/>
A little time and attention spent by this House on Hong Kong and by Britain's opinion formers can do much to bring about a successful transition. Is Parliament satisfied with the progress of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group? Is enough being done to help Hong Kong establish a healthy relationship with China? Parliament's interest in such matters would alleviate suspicions in Hong Kong that British commitment is diminishing as we approach 1997, and that Hong Kong's needs take second place to Sino-British relations.<lb/>
Looking further ahead, Britain's industrial leaders should look on the years beyond 1997 as years of opportunity for trade with Hong Kong and with China. The vision of American and Japanese investors and businessmen is not distorted by thoughts of the end of Empire. Their judgment of Hong Kong's trading prospects is measured on the basis of economic strength and relative advantage, regardless of the change of flag.<lb/>
The most obvious symbols of Hong Kong's success are the gleaming skyscrapers, the expensive cars and the designer shops. But for me there are more telling, more enduring and more worthy symbols of that success. For every Hong Kong multi-millionaire, there are tens of thousands of ordinary people who started with nothing, but who have created prosperity for themselves and their families and provided employment for many more. For every spectacular story of overnight success, there are thousands of people who have had to pick themselves up from the floor and start all over again when bad luck or over-enthusiasm laid them low.<lb/>
The same qualities of pragmatism, resilience and sense of life's purpose are bound to keep Hong Kong in the fore as one of the most dynamic economies in the world. Britain has cause to be proud, not just of the legacy it leaves behind, but also of the opportunities that Hong Kong will provide for China, for Asia and for Britain, too, long after 1997 has come and gone.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03077"><member>Viscount Eccles</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, will have been aware how many of your Lordships were eagerly looking forward to her speech. I am very fortunate that it falls to me to tell her on
<col>224</col>
behalf, I think, of the whole House that her speech was something that we shall never forget. It was an example of courage from a small country against a very big shadow. That is the kind of example that we all need, because there are shadows everywhere. But let us just think what bravery is needed in Hong Kong to stand up to the great power of China next door. We hope very much that we shall hear her many times in the future.<lb/>
The 12 members of the European Community are about to begin very difficult negotiations and I cannot help wondering whether they will pay enough attention to the end of the cold war. That was what the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, was talking about. Power is being redistributed right across Europe and beyond at a startling rate.<lb/>
When the Delors plan was put upon the table there was nobody in Europe, not one person, who foresaw the collapse of communism, the reunification of Germany and all those countries in Eastern Europe wanting to have an association with the Community. I thought: surely that enormous revolution demands a pause in the negotiations. But not at all. We are told that we must hurry up and get on with stages two and three.<lb/>
What is the reason for the hurry? It is that there is no time to lose to lock Germany into some kind of federated Europe. That excuse is ominous. It means that we should take a very careful look at the new factors which are affecting the relations not only between the members of the Community, but also between the Community and all these other countries which are now in line for membership or association. The door to the single market must be seen to be open and not on conditions which require anything so comprehensive as the Delors plan.<lb/>
Therefore, in very broad terms it seems to me that the choice before us lies between centralisation in some kind of super-state, confined, of course, to the 12, and association and co-operation between a greater number of nations who are as much part of Europe as we are ourselves.<lb/>
The British are bound to take a somewhat isolated position. We are an island. By sailing the seas we have acquired a sense of the world as a whole. The end of the cold war is a form of world liberation. It frees many countries to act differently, perhaps more aggressively, in their foreign relations than they could have done previously.<lb/>
When a crisis arises it is no longer axiomatic that the United States will be on one side and the USSR will be on the other side. An illustration of the problem under the new conditions is, of course, the crisis in the Gulf. It looks very much as though the major problems ahead of us will be global and not continental. We have to rely more on, and put more hopes into, the United Nations.<lb/>
There is a very good reason why we should hesitate to hand our foreign policy to a European government. We have to remember that all governments are selfish and understandably so. They do not, and they will not, put the interests of another country in front of the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0152"/>
<col>225</col>
interests of their own electors. Therefore one asks: is it reasonable to count on the disappearance of this ingrained selfishness? Yet a super-state in Europe would be unworkable if it could not rely on a common standard of good international behaviour. That standard does not exist today. In time, could it be developed?<lb/>
There was something like it in the Middle Ages when the Catholic Church laid down the rules for all Christendom. The Reformation put an end to that. There followed the rise of the nation states held together not by religion but by patriotism. Since then patriotism has been the lifeblood of every great nation in Europe. France and Germany have made attempts to unite Europe by force of arms. Ironically a Frenchman is today trying to do by diplomacy exactly what Napoleon failed to achieve by war.<lb/>
Who stopped those Imperial advances? We did, my Lords. And why did we stop them? It was because we saw very clearly that our own independence was doomed if one nation dominated the continent.<lb/>
It is difficult but important to be clear about the origin and strength of the instinct that life is better in a country in control of its economic and social affairs. This conviction&#x2014;or perhaps the opposite&#x2014;is not the sum of individual opinions canvassed on a particular issue such as whether there should be a common currency in the place of sterling. The conviction resides in a collective consciousness which has grown up like a plant out of the successes and failures of our history.<lb/>
I know well that distinguished noble Lords such as those who sit on the Select Committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Aldington&#x2014;I have not yet read its report&#x2014;can make a rational argument for the subordination of our economic and financial policies to European institutions. Even I could do that. However, the best intellectual plan will not work if it conflicts with the deepest instincts of the people. Therefore, one must ask how strong those instincts are in 1990. My pro-Brussels friends tell me that the young feel hardly a twinge of the old-fashioned patriotism. They say that the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Britain meant little or nothing to the young. I wonder whether that really is a sign that they have lost their patriotism.<lb/>
Then consider this: no other member of the Community can celebrate a victory comparable to the Battle of Britain. On the contrary, their experience during the last war may have persuaded them to fall for a vision of a superstate. They would not be the first to rush into marriage without contemplating the dangers and difficulties of a joint account. Britain's relations with Europe are not precipitate like that. We should expect that when the wedding is over our partners in Europe will continue to put the interests of their people before the interests of the Community. Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand said that the votes of their farmers were more important than the expansion of world trade. They will continue to talk like that.<lb/>
<col>226</col>
What about the judgments of the European Court? They are often disregarded especially when they conflict with the interests of a Latin member of the Community. What about ourselves? Is the Prime Minister right or wrong to tell us that Parliament would refuse to hand over key domestic issues to a majority-voting council in Europe? The Prime Minister knows a good deal more about another place than do some of us in this House. I am not saying that a superstate could not manage our monetary affairs better than Her Majesty's Treasury&#x2014;I expect that it could. I merely ask whether the British people, especially the working people, will give it the power to do so.<lb/>
We all want the prosperity of Europe from the Urals to the Atlantic. General de Gaulle had that vision and recommended that we should try to achieve it through an association of nation states. The success of NATO shows that that is not impossible. People say that perhaps NATO worked only because of the fear of Soviet aggression. That threat has gone but in its place there is the fear of German economic power.<lb/>
However great that power may become, will not your Lordships agree that we are likely to be able to live more comfortably with it as a reliable ally than as a treaty-bound satellite? I use the word "satellite" with care because satellite we should be if Europe adopted a single currency. The quantity of that currency would have to be controlled by a single central hank. That central bank, however the board were appointed, would have to be managed by the Germans or they would not support it. That is the crux that is coming.<lb/>
Some of my noble friends say that a German-controlled currency and bank are not only inevitable but alluring. I can see that if the overriding object in life is material wealth a merger of our economy with those of Europe makes sense. But suppose life has other objects such as the integrity of the country of our ancestors, loyalty to the place from which we come, and a guarantee of the freedom to govern ourselves? If that should be so, surely we must strive for a compromise in Europe based on the single market &#x2014;we all want that&#x2014;but not going as far as to corrupt or destroy the best instincts of a great people.<lb/>
I wish that the major political parties could agree on the main objectives to be pursued in the forthcoming negotiations. Our negotiators, whoever they are, will not obtain the best deal for Britain unless they are supported by a manifest consensus at home. This is a great issue; it is much greater than party politics.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03079"><member>Lord Ardwick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise for the fact that domestic responsibilities which I am finding difficult to devolve may make it impossible for me to stay until the end of the debate. I shall certainly stay as late as I can. I wish to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, on her most eloquent and moving speech. Last week the Commonwealth Press Union, an organisation on whose committee I serve, held a conference in Hong Kong. Its members went there with the idea that the press throughout the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0153"/>
<col>227</col>
Commonwealth should have a better idea of the anxieties and hopes of Hong Kong. I am sure that they returned home fortified by what they learnt.<lb/>
I have found this to be the most moving debate that I have heard for 20 years. I have heard the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, talk about the plight of the Poles, the right reverend Prelate talk about the problems of the just war and the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, describe the terrible situation in Ireland. Their comments will give me great cause for thought and feeling during the next few days.<lb/>
I was not so moved by the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and I shall not attempt to reply to him. My recollection, which may be faulty, is that when 40 years ago he and I attended the first meeting of the Council of Europe he was a stronger European than he is today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03080"><member>Viscount Eccles</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to intervene. In those days, I thought that we could run the show. I do not believe that we can do that now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03081"><member>Lord Ardwick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is exactly the insular prejudice which distressed me in the noble Viscount's speech this evening.<lb/>
For a few weeks within the past year or so, we seemed to be living, like Candide's tutor, in the best of all possible worlds. In the Eastern bloc, nation after nation was turning out its cruel communist government and proclaiming its freedom while Mr. Gorbachev looked on benevolently and continued his historic transformation of the Soviet Union into something resembling a democracy. I was rather surprised that, when my noble friend mentioned the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, there was not a single cheer or murmur from the other side of the House, especially in view of the generosity which Mrs. Thatcher has shown to Mr. Gorbachev.<lb/>
The right wings of the parties throughout Europe and the right-wingers in the parties yet to be formed were as naive about the consequences of abandoning communism as were left-wingers about its advent 70 years before. Let the East European countries convert themselves into free enterprise capitalist economies, they thought, and political freedom and commerce would soon flourish, as in the United States and Western Germany. Our own Prime Minister seems to have regarded herself, and indeed to have been regarded by some people in those countries, as a major inspirer of the unexpected miracle.<lb/>
Now we see that the transitional period will be slow, painful and dangerous. Even those of us who were pessimistic about the state of communist countries&#x2014;and I am thinking particularly of the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont&#x2014;did not appreciate to what depths the political corruption had sunk, to what extent the economies had decayed and to what extent the environment had been polluted. Some parts were less terrible than others but everywhere in central Europe and the East matters were becoming worse and not better.<lb/>
I do not believe that any of us realised how complex
<col>228</col>
is our own system and how difficult it is to introduce it when there is no professional corps available to procure the materials, to bring the finished goods to market and when there are no experienced people to create the market itself.<lb/>
Eastern Germany is more prosperous and sophisticated than its neighbours. However, even in union with affluent and efficient Western Germany, it is embarking upon a long and arduous path. I read a report the other day of a committee of West German businessmen. In advising which enterprises were ready for privatisation, one of their basic difficulties was to assess the potential value of a company which, under a command economy, has not kept a conventional record of its costs and sales.<lb/>
However, it is not only the economics which give cause for anxiety. Among many of the liberated peoples, there is a moral vacuum. They have nothing to replace the conditioned social morality which was part of the discredited communist system and which has perished with it. There seems to be a reluctance even to help the police&#x2014;once the dangerous henchmen of an oppressive regime&#x2014;to discourage and detect crime.<lb/>
Even more dangerous is the manifestation of ethnic and religious hatreds which the old authorities suppressed along with all other discontents. The anti-Semites raise their heads and voices again, and next they may raise their weapons. Every day we tremble for Mr. Gorbachev struggling with his economic reforms against those who are crying for full speed ahead and those who are telling him to hang back.<lb/>
What is to be feared is not so much a return to the bad old days as a solidly destructive, simplistic neo-liberalism. Looming over that is the danger of the Soviet Union being fragmented by the demands for total independence of some of its constituent states. There is better news today of the new effort by Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin to work out a new agreement.<lb/>
Our burden in the West has changed completely from the one we have carried so long and so well of physically and morally containing communism. We must help the central and eastern part of our continent to live at peace with itself, to preserve its new-found internal and external freedoms while it patiently builds decent economies and provides good social welfare. It must learn from all of us in the Community that not everything publicly owned is bad&#x2014;for example, there is a place for publicly owned utilities&#x2014;and not every collective is dangerous&#x2014;for example, there is a place in good democracies for a trade union movement.<lb/>
Now, as the Foreign Secretary and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, have reminded us in the speeches on the Address, we must take a fresh look at our institutions in Europe and see what changes are needed. It seems to me that the necessary adaptations needed are almost revolutionary and can be found only by patient examination, by experiment and by
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0154"/>
<col>229</col>
evolution. There are no blueprints available. There are great problems which we must approach humbly but with courage.<lb/>
It is to be hoped that we shall start that process with the meting in a few days' time at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe&#x2014;the CSCE as it is usually called. That summit, which is to be attended by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, will take place in the hopeful light of the signing of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, a treaty which will procure the removal of an enormous quantity of Soviet heavy weapons and which provides for the exchange of information and for inspection.<lb/>
However, the CSCE will go on to strengthen the basic principles of Helsinki&#x2014;the Helsinki Final Act; that is, the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law through a charter of rights and the creation of a centre for the prevention of conflict and possibly a voluntary conciliation mechanism throughout Europe. I believe that that is a suggestion from the British Government.<lb/>
As the noble Earl said, the CSCE is at last to have its own permanent secretariat. The presence there of the old Warsaw Pact nations alongside the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada has led many of us to have high hopes that the CSCE can become a great and vital institution for European security. However, we still do not know how that will develop.<lb/>
The new Europe which must be created on the basis of a larger Germany and a weakened and possibly fragmented Soviet Union will be led largely by the Western Europe of the European Community. We should thank God that the revolution in Central and Eastern Europe happened after the European Community had shed its sclerosis and now that it has found a new dynamism. It is to the Community that the Central and Eastern European countries are now looking. Of course, the time that they will have the developed economies and steady democracies which will qualify them for full membership is fairly distant. However, we should promise them closer and closer association and also bring them under the wider umbrella of the Council of Europe. Any other plans for opening wide the Community and it going back to a free trade area would be of very little use in the present situation and nobody would listen to that.<lb/>
In the Community we must reach a deeper stage of integration impelled by the Single European Act. The Community's institutional structure also may need strengthening if it is to bear the weight of resolving issues created by the development of the great single market. The Prime Minister may be right in her apprehension that the Community may regulate where nations have deregulated. But that regulation is inevitable. The social dimension of the Community will be pushed ahead. That is one reason&#x2014;though only one&#x2014;why some of my friends have at last come on board the European train.<lb/>
In the face of great historical developments this is no time for turning our backs on economic and monetary union. We must press on with it. The loss of sovereignty is largely nominal. There have been many
<col>230</col>
exaggerations of the degree of federalism that it will entail. That is all rhetoric and propaganda. The resistance is based less on reason than on pride and prejudice. It is a complex problem and needs much technical exploration and explanation. I hope we shall obtain some of that from our own committee when we debate the subject shortly.<lb/>
There remains one other great institution with an uncertain future; that is NATO. The North Atlantic Assembly of parliamentarians is to hold its six monthly plenary in London this month. That is still too soon for anyone to see clearly where NATO is going and where it should be going. We must beware of the military and industrial lobbyists who want to keep their salaries and their profits. We must still keep in the forefront of our mind the Harmel objectives: sufficient military strength to prevent war, and a willingness to explore political solutions.<lb/>
All our hopes for the future are being explored as we deal with the remote conflict in the Gulf. That belongs to another world. Yet the two worlds could collide and cause more turmoil. I shall not go into the problems of the Gulf, except to suggest that the Harmel principles now have an out-of-area validity.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03083"><member>Lord Haden-Guest</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I proceed further perhaps I may express my appreciation for the friendly and courteous reception I received as a new Member of your Lordships' House and for the kind remarks made by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and other noble Lords during the present debate.<lb/>
If I presume to speak on foreign affairs&#x2014;as I do with some trepidation&#x2014;it is because I grew up in and absorbed the atmosphere of a family deeply concerned with international and domestic politics. My father, a Fabian in the company of H.G. Wells and Bernard Shaw at the beginning of the century, entered politics in the 'twenties in another place. As more than a few noble Lords will recall, some 40 years ago he continued his career of public service in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
My own experience of the international scene includes 26 years with the secretariat of the United Nations in New York. Perhaps it was rather like seeing the world stage from a <i>fauteuil de luxe,</i> but it had its points. It is difficult, as your Lordships know, to deal with such a wide expanse as foreign affairs, especially when so many matters have already been covered in the debate by most able and respected figures, as has been the case today. But there is nevertheless an advantage to be found from that. It forcedly sets decent limits to the length of the debate. Having said that, there are some points I should like to make, but I should like first, if I may, to put the events with which we are now dealing into perspective.<lb/>
In the winter of last year your Lordships were concerned with the vast changes which had already occurred and were still occurring in the Soviet Union and certain countries of the Warsaw Pact and also the expected emergence of a single Germany. How long ago that seems today. As the months went by it became clear to all that these changes, far from
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0155"/>
<col>231</col>
slowing down, were continuing at a quite extraordin-ary pace. Governments, jolted by events, were prompted with unaccustomed speed to rethink their policies and commitments and, as necessary, make readjustments of all kinds to these new facts of life.<lb/>
As the year ends there is much to consider. Though the cold war, at least in its old form, appears to have run its course, the possibility of sudden spasms of the sort associated with rigor mortis cannot be ruled out. In place of the two super powers of cold war days we find instead two great countries now somewhat reduced, each still immensely powerful in a military sense, but for different reasons with diminishing authority in relative terms in a world of newly emerging power blocs.<lb/>
Her Majesty's Government are confronting those vital questions which face all governments in this state of flux and are, as indicated in the gracious Speech, now dealing with some of them. In particular they have announced their policy of adapting NATO strategy to reflect the welcome changes in Europe.<lb/>
As regards the European Community, the Government have announced steps to work with our Community partners on various matters. That must be welcomed. Of course the fuller picture is not likely to emerge until a policy evolves in the course of the probably long and no doubt protracted debate. However, it is reassuring to see that, despite the new emphasis on ties with Europe&#x2014;which must come&#x2014; the Government, in the words of the gracious Speech,
<quote>"will continue to play a full part in the Commonwealth".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7/11/90; col. 3.]</quote>
Regarding the larger world scene, Her Majesty's Government will continue to uphold the purposes and principles of the charter. In connection with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq they have undertaken to work for the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is of particular importance in that troubled part of the world that Her Majesty's Government have also undertaken to continue to work for long-term peace in the Middle East, including a settlement of the Palestinian problem. That was an undertaking not given in last year's gracious Speech and is one to be warmly supported now.<lb/>
As noble Lords will be aware, the United Nations has not always received the unequivocal support of its member states. Indeed, for much of its existence the cold war and other related factors served to inhibit its effectiveness. More recently, as the thaw in relations between East and West continues, the organisation has achieved much.<lb/>
In the present confrontation between the newly formed Alliance and Iraq, there is no doubt that the Security Council plays the principal role&#x2014;one of patience, caution and supple strength. In the first of its resolutions on the question, adopted on 2nd August, the Security Council in operative paragraph 3 called upon Iraq and Kuwait to begin immediately intensive negotiations for the resolution of their differences. It supported all efforts in that regard and especially those of the League of Arab states. That paragraph
<col>232</col>
was subsequently continued in force by other, later resolutions which themselves imposed sanctions that are exceptionally tough.<lb/>
It is important to stress now, in the face of mounting pressure from many quarters for a military solution, that this paragraph, together with the rest of those resolutions, is in force today. Representing, as it does, the agreed policy and the will and wisdom of all the permanent members of the Security Council, it remains the single hope both for the avoidance of a grisly war, with consequences which no one can foresee, and the achievement of a peaceful settlement in the Gulf. Does it not continue to deserve the world's support?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03085"><member>Lord Pym</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel fortunate that the privilege of being the first to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest, on his maiden speech falls to me. It was an authoritative speech, based on a lifetime of experience in international affairs. I am certain that I speak for everyone in the House when I say how much we look forward to his future contributions. Following the admirable maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, the House has today enjoyed two maiden speeches of exceptional quality.<lb/>
I should like to say also how much I appreciated the way in which this debate was opened by my noble friend Lord Caithness and the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn. I thought that the latter made a most valuable contribution to the unity of our Parliament and the unity of our nation in handling the difficult matter of events in the Gulf, which I shall come to later.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest, said, we are holding this debate at a time when really huge changes are taking place in the world; so much so that in my view it is no exaggeration to say that the world is at a turning point&#x2014;a rare event in history. At a fundamental level, the accelerating development of technology has so shrunk the world that many of the issues confronting mankind today are no longer capable of resolution by one nation or even a group of nations. They can be tackled only on a global basis.<lb/>
This is a new environment, a new fact of life, with implications for the sovereignty of every nation and with implications for our international institutions. All our existing international institutions have served us, and still serve us, very well. They have done so since they were set up after World War II, but I believe that they are inadequate now for the tasks that they face. The rapid acceleration of international business of all kinds means that the existing institutions are required to carry a load which is far heavier than that for which they were designed. I should like to see a lot more thought given to that.<lb/>
We know from our own history how important are our institutions. The same applies to the world's present needs. These generalisations are relevant to the two absolutely major world events we have witnessed since our debate a year ago, about which I wish to speak&#x2014;the revolutions in Europe and the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0156"/>
<col>233</col>
Iraqi aggression in the Gulf. Both will have far-reaching effects. On the first event, the point is that, in the end, even the Iron Curtain and all that went with it could not stem the tide of interdependence. It is inexorable. The Soviet empire was bound to collapse at some time&#x2014;only the timing was in question. Thanks to Mr. Gorbachev, it happened a year ago &#x2014;one of the most courageous political decisions of this century and worthy of the Nobel peace prize twice over. As a result, we have the opportunity now to rebuild Europe once again.<lb/>
Already the peace treaty that should have been signed in 1946, but was not, has been signed in Moscow. The foundation stone for rebuilding is in place, but what a colossal task faces the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, spoke of Poland. The same could be said, in different terms, of all those countries. On the political side, the kind of democratic institutions and practices that we in Western Europe take for granted are foreign to them. They leapt free from communism into a vacuum. It will take those countries a great deal of time, skill and patience to fashion their own democratic systems from scratch.<lb/>
To add to their difficulties, they have deep-seated ethnic problems, already clearly revealed in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. They are long-standing problems, now exacerbated by the fact that after being held in a straitjacket for 50 years it is very natural for a strong sense of nationalism to sway people's emotions. Somehow we have to support their fragile democracies and help them to bring their conflicting interests into some degree of harmony. At present, the machinery for that does not exist.<lb/>
On the economic side, those countries must revise their economies from scratch and fit them into the real world. They have little or no knowledge or experience of the market economy. They have no capitalists and they are burdened with immense debts. However bright their long-term prospects may seem, their near-term prospect is bleak indeed. All that presents the Western world with a major challenge and in my view Western leaders have come nowhere near to matching up to it yet. I say that notwithstanding what my noble friend on the Front Bench said in opening the debate. To quote the image taken by Sir Julian Bullard in an address he gave to the Atlantic Treaty Association last week:
<quote>"There are more carts stuck in the mud in Central and Eastern Europe than there are tractors in the West to pull them out".</quote>
If those peoples are not to become too down-hearted or unstable, and if they are to be pulled out of the mud, a great deal of help and support is required.<lb/>
The whole financial, industrial and business world needs to be involved and governments need to provide the leadership. The West Germans are doing a great deal, not only in East Germany but also in Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and elsewhere. The collapse of the Berlin Wall has meant that Germany is now closer to the East and sees rich opportunities in that sub-continent.<lb/>
<col>234</col>
There is a real danger that Europe could again become unbalanced. That can be prevented in two ways: first, by creating more co-ordination and integration in Western Europe, including all countries inside and outside the European Community, leading to a pattern that encompasses the whole of Europe. What matters is the European context into which a united Germany fits, and that can ensure that a balance is maintained. Secondly, the rest of us must invest more in Eastern Europe and not leave most of it to the Germans, which is what is now happening.<lb/>
A strong international structure is needed which will watch developments, nurture the emerging democracies, assess the needs of these countries and collectively organise investment, management training and whatever they need. I believe that the CSCE can provide that structure and I was delighted to hear what my noble friend Lord Caithness said on this matter&#x2014;that a permanent headquarters is to be set up and that there is to be a programme of work and regular meetings. I believe that that is the right way ahead. In my view, failure to appreciate fully and to react to the magnitude of the problems facing the eastern half of our continent would be a major strategic mistake.<lb/>
Turning to the Gulf, the whole world will be affected by this event and its consequences. For a start, there is the potential conflict between the Christian West and the Moslem East, the smoulderings of which are already evident. Whatever else happens, the last thing we want is a re-run of the Crusades. Within the Arab world, divisions are more acute than ever and it is difficult to see how the situation will improve. Israel could become involved in various ways, and that would be a very complicating factor.<lb/>
However, underlying the whole situation is the opportunity to start a new chapter in world affairs, made possible by the revolutions in Europe. Those revolutions have closed the intellectual divide and suddenly virtually all of us find ourselves on the same side. It is the Gulf crisis, hideous though it is, that has revealed this truth in such a bright light. It is revealed by the extraordinarily wide degree of international agreement on action to undo Saddam Hussein's aggression. The extent of that agreement is new and obviously very significant. Virtually the whole world is saying that military aggression cannot and will not be allowed to succeed. The challenge to statesmanship today is to build on this wholly new accord for the benefit of all mankind. With our allies we have been striving for 45 years to create just such an opportunity and, thanks to the resolution of NATO, we have finally achieved it. So we are at a turning point.<lb/>
In weighing up the various ways of dealing with Saddam Hussein in the coming months, in my view the most important factor is the maintenance of the international accord already achieved. In this connection we should pay tribute to the work of Mr. James Baker. Kuwait is going to be regained in the end one way or the other. The key to achieving that by peaceful means is the solidarity of the international community. There are those who think that this
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0157"/>
<col>235</col>
solidarity is more vulnerable if military action is delayed. But I believe the opposite. Hostilities will put it under extreme strain. There are those who seem, or sound, enthusiastic for war, or at any rate regard it as so likely that they give the impression of favouring it. I am not one of them. War in the Gulf is the last resort. It may have to happen. Aggressors do not usually volunteer to retreat. But there is a very widespread desire held to end this conflict without war, including notably by our principal Arab allies, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria.<lb/>
In our September debate I stressed the need for the strict and rigid application of sanctions and for patience while those sanctions and diplomatic pressures take effect. I believe that that is still the right approach today. I wish that individuals representing nobody but themselves would stop going to Baghdad. I do not know, and I suspect that none of your Lordships knows, the military appreciation except possibly those who were earlier chiefs of the defence staff. Reports in the press are confused on this matter, sometimes saying that the military would prefer early action and sometimes the opposite. Obviously the military appreciation is a crucial factor, but in the particular and peculiar circumstances in the Gulf today other considerations are no less weighty. We must do everything possible to prevent conflagration, with all its horrendous consequences. If in the end it has to be faced, then of course we shall face it.<lb/>
In conclusion, I believe that the world is at the beginning of a very profound change in its thinking. For four centuries since the Renaissance we have had a particular attitude towards our planet. Its secrets were discoverable and capable of being harnessed by mankind for its own benefit. Our century has seen the apotheosis of that approach at Ypres, Hiroshima, Auschwitz and in the rain forests of the Amazon. In addition, but in a less major way although still horrendous, today we have in Kuwait the brutality to the Kuwaitis and the cruelty to hostages and refugees.<lb/>
These and many other equally awful events contributed to the turning of the tide. There is a change now. At last we have been driven to realise that we are not quite as clever as we thought. The earth's resources are finite and there is a limit to growth. We are going to have to learn new methods and take new attitudes. We are at a turning point. In my view it is the new level of accord achieved by the United Nations which points the way ahead clearly. If we adhere to that and build on it, we can be much more optimistic for a better world order and for peace in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03087"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that the House will remember for some time the two remarkable maiden speeches that we have been pleased to listen to today. Both the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest, and the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, lived up to their reputations, as reflected in their speeches. For some time I have been interested in Hong Kong in the other place as well as in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
<col>236</col>
A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of being in Hong Kong. I met the Governor and the council. We had very interesting talks. They charged me with a responsibility which I am now going to fulfil. It is to convey to Lydia their very best wishes. They even knew that the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, was going to make her maiden speech today. I say to her that her good friends in Hong Kong are proud of what she has achieved and, like me, know that it was well worth creating her a Peer of the Realm to sit in this House.<lb/>
I hope that the House will take full cognisance of the speech we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. It was very moving and realistic. We should be absolutely uncouth if we ignored it. It is about time that our Government and Opposition told those in America who supply large sums of money to the IRA that they are killers and murderers. Is that not so? That is what we must have the courage to say. Such people should not shield behind religion and say that they are good Roman Catholics. They send money to the IRA to butcher Protestants. That is an appalling attitude of mind. I also believe that the Church of England, the Methodists and the Baptists have not said this loudly enough. Perhaps they are a little scared. I do not know. But it is about time that they and the politicians began to make this clear.<lb/>
When I served in the other place the proposition was put that all parties in Ireland should have 30 to 40 years to get together to form a new country under a new form of democracy. They had to do away with killing. I believe that was a reasonable proposition. I hope that Her Majesty's Opposition and the Government will continue with it with the co-operation of the sensible and reasonable people who exist in what is called Northern Ireland and Eire.<lb/>
I have very recently visited Australia. There I was privileged to have talks with the Prime Minister, Mr. Bob Hawke, and with Mr. Gareth Evans, the Foreign Secretary. I was deeply and emotionally moved by their expressions of absolute loyalty to our country over the situation in the Gulf. The Australians had a brilliant history in the First World War and also a magnificent one in the second. They are in no way losing the spark of their idealism in being faithful and loyal to the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Some time ago I was privileged to open a debate in this House on Cambodia. Speeches were made by people who had lived in Cambodia and who realised that since 1941 there had been no peace in that part of the world. We had tremendous speeches, primarily from the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, and the noble Lords, Lord Fanshawe of Richmond and Lord Rea. There was also a very good speech from ray noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs. Those speeches, with the tiny contribution that I made, outlined what was necessary in order to relieve the appalling suffering in Cambodia and described what had happened to the people of that country under the Khmer Rouge and probably the world's greatest and most poisonous villain, Pol Pot. When are the Churches going to begin shouting about it? When are other politicians going to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0158"/>
<col>237</col>
begin shouting about it? The noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, and the noble Lord, Lord Fanshawe, were speaking from their personal experiences in Cambodia.<lb/>
The speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, at the end of the debate was highly commendable. That debate, particularly the speeches made by those with personal experience of Cambodia, showed what a powerful influence this House can be on world affairs if it is listened to as respectfully as it should be. The situation in Cambodia has now changed for the better but there is still a lot to do. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, has written to me on the position in Cambodia and I thank him for doing so. I am sure that the letter is a mark of respect for the speeches made by the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, and all those who participated in that debate.<lb/>
Although the position in Cambodia has improved, there is still a grave threat. Many people in Cambodia, in this country, in the United States and in Australia are still very anxious as to whether members of the Khmer Rouge, with the blessing of the United Nations and of the Government, are still in authority. That is an extremely serious thing to say. It is what I said to the Australians and it is what I said to people in Hong Kong. The people in Hong Kong were worried about what had happened in Tiananmen Square, but being Hong Kong people they got over it. They too are worried about the position in Cambodia. Therefore I hope that we shall have a further opportunity to discuss the matter. Horrible though the Holocaust was, one must realise that tens of thousands of human beings were deliberately put to death in Cambodia so that their bodies could be interred to raise forests. There is no real anger in the rest of the rich Western world about it. There ought to be.<lb/>
I want to turn briefly to an issue of vital importance which rarely gets a mention. We have spoken about the Gulf and Saddam Hussein. What really worries me is that Saddam Hussein, with the largest army in the Middle East, might withdraw and stay just a few inches over the border. What will we do then? He will have committed no crime. He will have responded to the United Nations but kept his huge army on the borders of Saudi Arabia, his own country and Kuwait. We have to give this matter careful thought. I wonder, for example, having been on a number of occasions in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whether sometimes the ordinary people and ordinary soldiers do not quite understand precisely what is happening. Why do we not use a little initiative and distribute leaflet propaganda among the soldiers of Saddam Hussein?<lb/>
I am reliably informed by people who have escaped from Kuwait that in the first few days there was among Iraqi soldiers an elated feeling of victory. Then they realised that they were punishing, harming and killing fellow Arabs. This has sown a tiny amount of dissent in the Iraqi army. We ought to take full advantage of that. I hope that the Government will consider this point with our United States allies. There are soldiers in Kuwait who are becoming somewhat
<col>238</col>
perturbed. Let us encourage that feeling. Whether we do it through leaflets or in some other way, such action ought to be taken.<lb/>
I turn now to a subject very near to my own feelings and one which is seldom mentioned. Whenever there is a threat of a war, whether it be in Kuwait or in the Middle East, there is great consternation and debate. But on every single day of the year 10,000 children die in Africa and India. The war which we should be permanently fighting is the war against poverty, ignorance and disease. Is it realised, for example, that since this debate started about 20,000 children have died of starvation? That should be food, paradoxically, for thought in this great Christian nation. Forty thousand people die every day and tens of millions every year.<lb/>
Perhaps I may give some statistics to put matters into perspective. The average person requires 2,400 calories a day. The world produces enough for nearly 4,000 calories a day for every person. We do not know how to share that wherewithal with those who are starving in India, in China, in the Sudan and in other parts of Africa. Since the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, made his speech, and since my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition made his admirable response, about 20,000 people have died from diseases which could have been cured, but primarily from starvation.<lb/>
It is right and proper that when discussing foreign affairs we give priority to the position in the Gulf. I hope that the Government realise that if Saddam Hussein leaves Kuwait and stays on the border or if there is a war it will undoubtedly be most horrendous. Saddam Hussein has a massive army. For that reason alone he should be resisted or others will think that all they have to do is to build a huge army, defy humanity, as represented by the United Nations, and take whatever they like. He has to be resisted. I hope that thought will be given to the points I have made.<lb/>
When the crisis is over&#x2014;and one day it will be&#x2014;I hope that the Government will continue the good work they are doing in the third world with various international organisations. It is the war that goes on and on: the war against poverty, ignorance and disease. I hope that my country will continue to give a lead in bringing an end to suffering and in bringing relief to millions of people in other parts of the world&#x2014;what I would call the cruel part of the world. If any nation can do it, it is my nation.<lb/>
That was the feeling and attitude last Sunday of my comrades in the Royal British Legion. I am privileged to be the president of the metropolitan area, the largest area. They have the highest regard for those who fought in the First World War, for the gallant few in 1940, for the Desert Rats and for all those who helped to produce things in this country. They are also mindful of the fact that we have the capacity to beat dictators and to fight, if necessary alone, to save democracy for the world. It is this nation above all others which can give a lead in the fight against poverty, ignorance and disease and in helping suffering humanity in other parts of the world.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03089"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, whatever our views, we must surely now all admit that war with Iraq in the comparatively near future is now, unfortunately, a distinct possibility. Failing some climbdown on the part of the present allies&#x2014;which would in fact be a victory for Saddam Hussein&#x2014;no peaceful or diplomatic solution of the crisis is possible, unless Iraq conforms to the various resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations, chief of which is that demanding the immediate and unconditional evacuation of Kuwait. The Iraqis have now flatly rejected this, maintaining that Kuwait no longer exists or, as they say, that it is part of Iraq for ever.<lb/>
That being so, it is difficult to imagine that the allies, and notably the Americans&#x2014;though it is arguable that they should do so&#x2014;will keep large armies in the desert for another year or more until sanctions may oblige the Iraqis, if they do, to take the action required of them. If sanctions have not worked after several months, force is therefore surely on the cards. It may be&#x2014;and as we must certainly still hope&#x2014;that when war is actually imminent Saddam Hussein may disappear, but no one should count on this happening. Therefore, we must, however reluctantly, be prepared for hostilities, the nature and length of which no one can with certainty predict.<lb/>
As I understand it, this prospect is accepted in principle by Her Majesty's Government and, to a large extent, by the Official Opposition. But it must be admitted that there is a strong body of opinion in all our countries, but more especially in the United States, which, while admitting that continuous pressure should be put on Iraq, recoils from the actual use of force on the grounds that a war would inevitably spread and quite possibly in the long run have the reverse effect of that intended. It is also alleged that we should not in any case go to war to restore a sheikdom that could hardly be said to be democratic, and that our oil interests do not necessarily demand the continued presence of enormous forces in the Persian Gulf.<lb/>
I see why this attitude appeals to many whom I respect, but I cannot accept it. Ultimate military action against a recalcitrant aggressor is clearly laid down in Article 42 of the United Nations Charter, to which we have all subscribed and which we have all underwritten. If the charter is not applied in this case of open aggression, what hope is there of preserving eventual peace of the world? Just when, with the end of the cold war, the possibility of some effective world authority is emerging, it would surely be a tragedy if we were to revert to,
<quote>"the ancient plan that he will take who has the power and he will keep who can".</quote>
How, therefore, can military action be both legally authorised and duly enforced? It can be done only by a suitably drafted resolution by the Security Council of the United Nations based on Article 42 of the charter, providing, in effect, for action whenever the United States (which must evidently take the lead) judges this to be necessary after due consultation with its allies. Is such a resolution obtainable?<lb/>
<col>240</col>
To be valid, such a resolution requires the approval of nine out of the 15 members of the council, including that of the five permanent members. Any one of the latter can, if it so desires, apply a veto, in which case the whole resolution fails. But equally a permanent member can abstain. Both the Soviet Union and China have apparently now said that they would not oppose military action&#x2014;presumably at what is in their view the appropriate time&#x2014;which must mean either that they would eventually vote for it or at the least not vote at all. Even if they both abstained, the resolution would still have the full force of law provided that the three permanent members&#x2014;namely, the United States, the United Kingdom and France&#x2014;voted for it, together with six non-permanent members.<lb/>
Therefore, even in the unlikely event of the abstention of two permanent members, would the consent of at least six non-permanent members be forthcoming? There seems good reason to think that it would be. Cuba and Yemen would doubtless vote against. Columbia and Malaysia might be doubtful. But the remainder, judging from their attitude up until now, would seemingly approve, while France, I should have thought, could hardly fail to vote for the resolution in the event. It need hardly be added that the prospects of getting it approved would be greatly enhanced if President Bush felt able to announce his support for a conference to deal with the Palestine issue once the Kuwaiti crisis is over.<lb/>
If, therefore, the Americans after, say, another month or two feel that they can wait no longer, everything points to their seeking the authority of the United Nations for military action&#x2014;for only so can that moral sanction for war be obtained which is so essential if the objections to it on the part of many are to be overcome and for which Cardinal Hume has so eloquently pleaded in his recent letter to <i>The Times.</i><lb/>
The alternative is action by the Americans and some of the allies under Article 51 of the charter, presumably on the invitation of the exiled government of Kuwait. Whether this would be legally justified&#x2014;I am among those who doubt it &#x2014;the fact remains that the invocation of Article 51 only would be likely to divide the present alliance and reinforce the already strong peace movement in the United States. Rather than action under this article, it may indeed be better to have some patience in the hope that sanctions will after all have the desired effect or that action under Article 42 will still be possible.<lb/>
I should like to say a word in conclusion on the possible conduct of the war should it come to pass. In the first place, the American generals could hardly recommend war with Iraq unless they were confident of their ability to eliminate the Iraqi air force after a short engagement. That should not result in many civilian casualties&#x2014;Iraqi aircraft could hardly take refuge in urban centres. If the Iraqis were so misguided as to employ their few and highly inaccurate missiles, the launchers should likewise be destroyed. They can do little damage, even in Israel, unless chemical or biological weapons are employed, in which case all-out war would doubtless result.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0160"/>
<col>241</col>
After complete mastery of the air had been obtained, Iraqi tanks could then be gradually accounted for by, among other things, cluster bombs dropped from aircraft, with the reoccupation of Kuwait being perhaps undertaken largely by Arab troops. There seems little reason to suppose that this whole operation, though it might well take some time, should result in enormous casualties. In any case, Iraq's threat of turning the whole Gulf into a lake of fire is an obvious absurdity. This generally optimistic scenario is, however, based on the assumption that early elimination of the Iraqi air force is possible and that the Iraqis could not put to good use the latest United States anti-aircraft weapons which they are said to have captured in Kuwait. The main conclusion, in any case, lies in the ancient saying, <i>si vis pacem Para bellum;</i> or, if you want peace, prepare for a war which you are confident of winning with the full backing of the law.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03091"><member>Lord Greenhill of Harrow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, I should like to join in the many tributes being paid throughout the country to the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd. The majority of noble Lords consider that he is serving the country very well with great energy and distinction.<lb/>
There are two foreign affairs issues which demand immediate attention: Europe and the Gulf crisis. The House will have an opportunity to debate European policy fully when the report of the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, comes before it on 22nd November. But whatever the significance of the intergovernmental conferences in December and afterwards, there can be no doubt that the Middle East crisis is of more immediate importance. That crisis carries with it risk of a horrible war in a nightmare setting. It is already bringing economic disaster to several innocent and undeserving countries and hardship and financial ruin to numberless families and individuals.<lb/>
However, it is hard to contribute usefully to the debate while we are unaware of the contents discussed in the shuttle diplomacy conducted by prime ministers, ex-ministers and every kind of limelight seeker from East and West. How it must entertain Saddam Hussein to spread doubt and confusion by telling each of them a slightly different story and handing them, like Santa Claus, a small present of hostages as they leave.<lb/>
We are told by reliable personalities that the alliance is solid; I very much hope that it is. However, one cannot ignore a statement by M. Cheysson, adviser to President Mitterrand, who recently observed that the Middle East crisis was of little importance to the European Community.<lb/>
When I spoke in the debate on 6th September, I raised two points. I should like to make them again in slightly more detail. They could show the way&#x2014;admittedly, over a long period&#x2014;towards a peaceful settlement of the dangerous situation in which we now find ourselves. The points are, first, the priority objectives of the Security Council and the majority of UN members; and, secondly, the quite different
<col>242</col>
priority objectives of many Arab countries and, I suggest, the majority of Moslem people. Can those two conflicting objectives be peacefully reconciled?<lb/>
The priority objective of the UN powers is the establishment at last of an effective system of worldwide collective security for which the United Nations was founded. With the revolution in the relations of the super powers, the chances of achieving that objective are better now than they have been for half a century. The opportunity on no account should be lost. However, the priorities of some Middle East governments, and perhaps the majority of Arab and Moslem peoples, are quite different. I enumerated them on 6th September. They include the settlement of the Palestine problem, the equitable division of oil wealth and the modernisation of out-dated means of government in the area.<lb/>
It is manifestly difficult, and perhaps impossible, to reconcile fully those apparently conflicting objectives. However, we should try by attempting two steps. First, it is entirely right to insist on Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The threat of the use of force and the pressure of sanctions may yet succeed. The second step is just as difficult but should be pursued with some persistence. I suggest that it should be on the following lines. The UN security powers, with the support of as many others as possible, should give an assurance that they would be prepared to back fair settlements made by Middle East countries between themselves. Those would have to include a UN guarantee of the frontiers agreed, and the mutual disarmament of the confronting countries and destruction of weapons of mass destruction.<lb/>
Such a settlement would require a tremendous diplomatic effort. In the past two years seemingly impossible revolutions of policy have been achieved in Europe by negotiation, and stubborn minds have been changed. I should like to ask one question of the Minister. Would it not be sensible and indeed normal for a senior member of the alliance to make direct contact with Saddam Hussein? Perhaps such contact already exists and is held very secretly. It is normal in a dangerous confrontation to have direct contact, and it could possibly help. In addition it would be evidence that all reasonable steps have been taken to avert hostilities.<lb/>
Noble Lords may well ask what is to be done if Saddam Hussein does not withdraw in spite of all pressures. There is now firm agreement apparently that an allied attack then seems the only course. What would be the right time has still to be judged. An unattractive but seductive alternative might be to try to set in train some of the diplomatic steps that I have outlined without insisting on prior Iraqi withdrawal, as Saddam Hussein now appears to suggest. That would concede a partial victory to him. It would ensure the demise of Kuwait and probably the break up of the present alliance in the UN. Above all it would fatally weaken the authority of the UN. To some, however, it would have the overriding advantage of avoiding a war. It is something that I
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0161"/>
<col>243</col>
believe we should not contemplate; but in the event of the failure of the alliance and a lack of cohesion in the UN it may be forced upon us.<lb/>
The overriding priority is to try to achieve the establishment of an effective system of worldwide security based on strengthening the United Nations. The balance of power in the world is changing very fast. The problems are not just Europe and the Middle East. They are global problems&#x2014;political, economic and scientific&#x2014;which can be managed only through the influence of a world organisation. I believe that even a partial concession to Saddam Hussein would fatally delay the establishment of such an organisation.<lb/>
Lastly, as a former member of the diplomatic service, I should like to say that we watch with pride the performance of our staffs in Baghdad and Kuwait.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03092"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03093"><member>Lord Greenhill of Harrow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are also filled with admiration and sympathy for the hostages still held there and the patience of their families in this country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03095"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I start by joining in the congratulations offered to the two distinguished maiden speakers, the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, and the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest. I had met Lydia Dunn, as she then was, in Hong Kong on a number of occasions in various capacities when I was a Minister in the Government here and later when I was a commissioner of the European Community. She brings great experience and knowledge to your Lordships' House, together with a considerable measure of wisdom, which leavens it. I am sure that we shall have much to learn from her.<lb/>
It is impossible for me to participate in a debate on foreign affairs without paying tribute to my right honourable and learned friend Sir Geoffrey Howe. His resignation was a great loss to the Government, but it was an even greater loss to the country. He was one of the most distinguished and successful Chancellors of the Exchequer. I was both honoured and happy to serve with him as a Minister of State at the Treasury. Indeed, it was in that capacity that I first sat on the Front Bench in your Lordships' House. As Foreign Secretary, his diplomatic skills, his invariable courtesy and clear convictions on important issues of policy served this country extraordinarily well in the international field and particularly in regard to our relations with our fellow members of the European Community. Not only was his style and mode right; so too was his stand on matters of substance and of principle.<lb/>
I have, if I may say so, a less agreeable comment to make regarding the attitude taken in some quarters in this country&#x2014;I am glad to say not in your Lordships' House&#x2014;towards Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission. At times remarks have been made which verged on personal abuse. Jacques Delors is a distinguished statesman of international stature. He was recognised not least in this country as a most
<col>244</col>
successful finance minister. He was the unanimous choice of the 12 member states. Without his constant support I should never have succeeded in launching the single market programme and driving it through to success. I may say also that it was Jacques Delors, not the United Kingdom, who was responsible for the total liberalisation of capital movements throughout the Community. I know this because I sat with him when, by sheer willpower and determination, he pressed these proposals through that most reluctant body, the Council of Finance Ministers.<lb/>
It was Jacques Delors who secured what reforms have been made in the common agricultural policy. The part played by the ministers of agriculture&#x2014;including, I regret to say, from time to time our own&#x2014;was to water down, never to strengthen the Commission's proposals. Despite what from time to time has been barely concealed hostility on our part, he has always been helpful to this country. The only criticism that can be made of him is that when we have too patently displayed a national tendency to wander off on our own he has striven very hard to keep his wayward flock together.<lb/>
I do not propose to say very much about economic and monetary union and political union. The report of your Lordships' Select Committee was published on Friday and we will have what I hope will be an extended debate on that subject next week. I simply have one comment to make at this stage because it goes to the heart of our relations with the European Community. The claim constantly made that an attempt is being made to impose&#x2014;and "impose" is the word which is being used&#x2014;a single currency on the United Kingdom is complete nonsense. No one wants to impose a single currency on us; no one has tried to impose a single currency on us and no one legally has any power to impose a single currency on us.<lb/>
Monetary union could be embodied in Community legislation in one of two ways: either by amendment of the Treaty of Rome under Article 236 (but that requires unanimity); or, following precedent, a separate treaty could be negotiated. Clearly no one could compel the United Kingdom to sign such a treaty if we did not wish to do so. Thus whatever route is chosen, nothing can be imposed upon the United Kingdom.<lb/>
The real issue, I suspect, is precisely the opposite. Eleven member states have decided to go ahead with a single currency. What we are trying to do is stop them. In other words, it is not a question of 11 imposing their views on one; it is one endeavouring to impose its views on the other 11. Perhaps I may say quite categorically that there is no way in which we can do so. We can of course block action under Article 236, but the major developments in the Community in the past have always taken the form of a separate treaty. Indeed, the report of the Delors Committee refers repeatedly to a new treaty. That treaty can be signed by all 12, or, if we stand out, by 11 only. We simply cannot stop them. All we can do is knot the rope around our own neck. I sincerely hope that we will not do so.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0162"/>
<col>245</col>
I have made this point in some detail because it illustrates the fundamental problem that we, or at least some members of our Government, have with the European Community. They simply do not understand it. They do not know its history. They do not understand its philosophy; or, if they did, they would disagree with it. They do not understand its policies and most certainly they do not understand its law.<lb/>
This is a situation which I had to face in the years during which I was at the Commission, and I see no change since I left. These attitudes are rooted in nostalgia for the past, in the hope of reviving once again what were described as the Victorian values, in a regret for the passing of the era in which we were the most powerful industrial nation in the world, in which we had the largest navy in the world and in which we were a political power of the first order. This is an honourable dream but it is a dream of an era which has long since passed. There is no way in which we can revive it.<lb/>
What we have to do is live in the present and live in relation to the facts of the present, because the onus on our shoulders is not only to act correctly in the light of present circumstances but also to ensure that the heritage we hand down to the next generation is a sound inheritance. One fact we must accept&#x2014;and I know it is regrettable&#x2014;is that we now have one of the weakest economies in the Western world. Some time ago, when I was clearing out my personal papers, I found a copy of <i>Hansard</i> for 1955. It included a table showing the income per head in the major countries in Europe. We in the United Kingdom stood at the head of that table. Today we are poorer than any of the original members of the European Community; we are poorer than any of the members of the EFTA group; we are poorer than the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan; and so one could go on. It is all very regrettable and very tragic.<lb/>
It means that the future of this country can no longer be built on our own domestic market. That future can only be found in Europe&#x2014;in the European Community whose population will, by 1992, be 325 million people, and in the greater Europe where the developing policy of the Community is to create a free trade area. We have broken away from the old type of trading co-operation agreements. The policy now is to establish a free trade area extending from the Atlantic to the Russian border and comprising a population of 500 million people. That is where the future of the British economy and the British people must lie.<lb/>
It would be wrong, and indeed foolish, to pretend that there are not important divisions of opinion in this country on these matters. Those divisions exist not just in one party, they appear in most parties. They appear in Parliament, in the media and in the country as a whole. It requires a great effort of statesmanship to resolve those problems. As we look forward to the years ahead we have to hope that that effort and that degree of statesmanship will be forthcoming. Unless it is, we shall find ourselves in a position of genteel poverty. I know that there are some people who would regard a position of genteel poverty as preferable to
<col>246</col>
losing some of the trappings of sovereignty which have long since disappeared. That is not the view of trade and industry in this country.<lb/>
Although I do not myself belong to the younger generation, I believe that the younger generation does not take that view either. We ought to remember that when the next general election is held the people who vote in that election for the first time will have been born after we joined the European Community. They will have lived all their lives in a period in which we were members of the Community. That, more than anything else, will shape their attitudes both to the Community and to the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03097"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it gives me pleasure to take part in a debate which has included two such excellent maiden speeches on subjects of very great interest. I reiterate the congratulations that have already been given.<lb/>
I choose to speak on an aspect of British foreign policy which has not been touched upon often today, namely, overseas aid. I feel some regret, having heard Sir Geoffrey Howe put his position on the European Community in unequivocal terms, and following the very strong speech of the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, on the same subject, that I have not elected to follow up that central plank of British foreign policy&#x2014;Britain's position in the European Community. However, the Government made a very strong commitment in the gracious Speech to overseas aid. They said that they would maintain a substantial programme aimed at promoting sustainable economic and social progress and good government in developing countries. It would be useful to examine that commitment to see whether government action is fulfilling those objectives.<lb/>
Can the Government's aid programme be described as substantial? Many would question the assertion. In 1989 British aid amounted to 0.31 per cent. of GNP, which was not only lower than that of most of our European partners but also well below the UN target for official development assistance, which is set at 0.7 per cent. of GNP. Another reason why the amount gives cause for alarm is the growing demands placed upon it. For example, extra funds are now needed to allow for the environmental standards applied to development aid. Extra funds are needed for the debt relief being given to the Gulf front line states, such as Egypt and Turkey. Additional funds are also required for the emergency relief which is constantly required for catastrophes in Africa.<lb/>
In addition, there are funds for the know-how fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I was happy to hear the Minister, the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, say that funds for the know-how fund were to be doubled. However, there is always concern that those funds will not be treated as additional sums. I have met those anxieties in Africa, and in particular in the Sudan. I shall be very happy if the Minister can give an assurance today that overseas development aid for developing countries is separate from contributions to the know-how fund
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0163"/>
<col>247</col>
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I should also like to hear of any plans the Government have to increase the percentage of GNP allocated to overseas development aid.<lb/>
I recognise that aid should not only be measured by quantity but also by quality. Is British aid really aimed at promoting sustainable economic and social progress in developing countries. I am sure that we are all agreed that that is the right objective. I believe, however, that the Government have mixed motives when allocating their aid budget. The ODA's 1989 anniversary review asserted:
<quote>"We concentrate British aid on poor countries, poor people and on their basic needs".</quote>
Yet the all-party Foreign Affairs Committee disagreed. It reported:
<quote>"The purpose of bilateral aid programmes in the UK, as in most other countries, has rarely been viewed as the purely selfless promotion of other countries' and peoples' welfare. It has always been understood that such programmes should be carried out with British commercial and industrial interests and political interests in mind".</quote>
It is a fact that aid largely consists of funding from western governments for services, machines, technical exports and consultants to be supplied by companies in rich countries, frequently their own. Therefore it is true to say that most aid money is spent in the rich world. That is directly contrary to the charitable instincts of most people in this country. When they are asked to provide funds for an emergency in a developing country they are most generous and dig deeply into their pockets. There is a sharp division between what people expect from overseas aid&#x2014;that it should go to the poorest countries&#x2014;and the way in which the ODA ties aid to the commercial and industrial interests of this country.<lb/>
In its recent report on overseas aid the Select Committee on Science and Technology recommended that where there is a conflict in our aid programme between the needs of the recipient and the potential benefits to the UK the needs of the recipient must be paramount. That is a very clear message. When one looks back to the 1970s one sees that much greater effort was made to focus aid on the poorest. In Britain the Labour Party set out policies which indeed helped the poorest people in the poorest countries. Agencies such as the International Labour Organisation established a basic needs approach to development and in 1977 the International Fund for Agricultural Development was established with a strong mandate to reduce malnutrition and alleviate rural poverty specifically in ways such as supporting small farmers, the landless and others of the rural poor. As we know, that movement was brought to an end by the pressures of a debt crisis, followed by the overriding obsession of aid policy-makers with adjustment programmes and all the terrible social and environmental consequences which that brought on so many people of the developing countries.<lb/>
However, now we feel that there may be a movement back to more altruistic aid. I hope that that is the direction in which the Government are moving. One test that their intentions are changing for the
<col>248</col>
better will be if aid is switched away from large-scale infrastructure projects, such as power plants, high-level city services and telephone systems, which did not help the poorest people in the country and towards agriculture, community forestry and fishing, cottage industries and social programmes in health and education.<lb/>
It is also a key priority that women should be at the centre of a development process, which has not been the case until recently. After all, in Africa women are the farmers, yet there are few projects directly aimed at helping to grow more food and allowing them to profit from new technology, training and credit schemes. When all is said and done, if aid-givers want economic and social progress to be sustainable they must ensure that in those countries there are men and women who are equipped and able to sustain the aid that they are given. If they do not, there will be no way of sustaining it.<lb/>
The year 1990 is International Literacy Year. UNESCO is making literacy for women a great priority. When one considers the proportion of women who are literate in the developing countries, it is clearly an important priority. Will the Minister say what funds Her Majesty's Government are allocating to International Literacy Year and whether they are reconsidering their withdrawal from UNESCO, which does so much in that field?<lb/>
Her Majesty's Government were a signatory to the Convention on Rights of the Child. There is no doubt that social progress must increase the emphasis which is placed on children's welfare. Her Majesty's Government have not ratified the convention. Does the Minister have any news on the matter?<lb/>
The Prime Minister attended the World Summit for Children where it was agreed by no fewer than 71 world leaders that aid programmes should be adjusted to take into account the welfare of women and children in the poorer countries. That means that the ODA must make some adjustment in its aid programmes in the direction of women and children to accommodate that commitment.<lb/>
Finally, the gracious Speech states that our aid programme aims to promote good government in developing countries. There are many ways to do that: one area in which governments in some of the poorest countries could be strengthened and helped to rule more wisely is education and training. However, it seems that that is not happening.<lb/>
There is a worrying trend. In 1979 education received as much as 17 per cent. of all aid from western industrialised countries. By 1987 that figure had gone down to a mere 10 per cent. Again, overseas student numbers in this country show a worrying trend. It is the numbers of students from the USA and the European Community countries which are up and those from the poorest developing countries which have decreased. To give only one example: in 1980 there were 5,200 Nigerian students in Britain; in 1988 there were only 1,300. On the other hand, the numbers from the USA rose from 2,900 in 1980 to 15,000 in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0164"/>
<col>249</col>
1988. Our overseas student numbers are thus more or less maintaining the same level but the change in balance is very pronounced.<lb/>
If we wish to give support to governments in developing countries it is surely best to invest in training and education programmes rather than give an ultimatum about withdrawal of aid if those governments do not move swiftly enough towards the democratic process that we require. We see that happening in Kenya. We are withdrawing certain aid from Kenya because of what is happening there. It can only make the poorest people of that country suffer if their government are impoverished in that way.<lb/>
I repeat that Her Majesty's Government should increase their aid budget. There are more demands put upon it but it is well below the level of many of our European partners. Secondly, the primary motive in allocating aid must be to help the poorest rather than to tie it to British commercial and industrial interests. Lastly, well directed aid can give support to weak governments through the ways that I have suggested.<lb/>
I hope very much that those kinds of change can be made. In that way the commitment made in the gracious Speech about Britain's overseas aid programme will be truly substantiated.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03099"><member>Lord Carver</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I last spoke on this general subject in the House when we debated the defence White Paper on 17th July. Since then two important events have occurred which are relevant to both that debate and the one in which we are engaged today. The first event was the Government's announcement on 25th July of the decisions that they had reached as a result of the study called <i>Options for Change</i> about future reductions in the armed forces. The second was the Gulf crisis. In my opinion both reinforced the views that I expressed in the former debate.<lb/>
Perhaps I may briefly remind your Lordships of what I said. I concentrated on the question of a future security organisation for Europe, noting that the future of our own armed forces would to a large degree depend on how that evolved. I stressed that the principle must be observed that the military organisation should be designed to suit the political one, and not vice versa. I accepted that it would depend on how Europe developed politically and that that depended on developments within the Soviet Union which could not be forecast now and which were unlikely to become clear for some time. Therefore, I said, it was right for the Government and NATO to be cautious at that stage, to rely on existing structures and institutions and not to make major changes in the structure of our own armed forces. The Government followed that path and I commend them for it.<lb/>
However, I went on to say that we must look further ahead, on the assumption that events in Europe would develop in such a way that the threat which NATO was established to meet would disappear. Almost everybody now seems to accept that it has already disappeared. The co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union over
<col>250</col>
the Gulf crisis has reinforced that view. If and when we are confident that we have reached that state of affairs and that it will endure, I suggest that Europe will need something very different from NATO.<lb/>
But there will still be threats to the security of Europe, on which the security of our own island depends. Whatever happens in the Soviet Union, its constituent parts&#x2014;especially Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine&#x2014;by their very size, resources and geographical position will pose a potential threat to their neighbours, as they have done for many centuries. The age-old rivalries and animosities that exist between the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, aggravated perhaps by the combination of raised hopes and economic difficulties, are even now a potential threat to stability.<lb/>
But there will still be threats to the security of Europe, on which the security of our own island depends. Whatever happens in the Soviet Union, its constituent parts&#x2014;especially Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine&#x2014;by their very size, resources and geographical position will pose a potential threat to their neighbours, as they have done for many centuries. The age-old rivalries and animosities that exist between the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, aggravated perhaps by the combination of raised hopes and economic difficulties, are even now a potential threat to stability. Finally there are, and will remain, fears about how an 80-million strong Germany will behave. These are the internal threats to the security of Europe, to counter and contain which a European security organisation will have to be created.<lb/>
But the ill wind in the Gulf has brought with it one benefit &#x2014;proof that Europe, as my noble and gallant friend Lord Bramall emphasised in the same debate, must also look to its security against threats to its interests from other parts of the world. Some people say that those events have shown that NATO must continue to exist in something like its present form, and that the hesitant and divided attitude taken by other European members of NATO, whose dependence on Middle Eastern oil is greater than ours, shows that it would be fatal to rely on a more European organisation to defend our interests.<lb/>
I take the opposite view, as did the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, in his speech in the debate in this House on the Gulf crisis on 6th September. He said at col. 1827 of <i>Hansard:</i>
<quote>"For those of us who believe, as I do, that, if the Community is to have any influence in world affairs and that after 1992 there must inevitably be a closer political element to match the economic integration, there are urgent lessons to be learnt from the past month.</quote>
<quote>In the future, the Community must concern itself with its own security and &#x2026; there are, it seems to me, ways in which that could be done in association with an evolution of NATO in a rather different form from what it is now".</quote>
I support that view. I consider that NATO should eventually develop into a treaty relationship between, on the one hand, the United States and Canada, and, on the other, a European defence community linked to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0165"/>
<col>251</col>
or integrated with the European economic community which is developing into, and I hope will develop further into, a European political community.<lb/>
However, it is too early to see what the pattern should be of a European security organisation to meet the needs of a Europe that is no longer menaced by the overwhelming threat of a massive attack by the Soviet Union. But it seems to me that, whatever form it takes, it should not resemble NATO as it is today and as we have known it for the last 40 years; that is to say, a tightly integrated military command and training organisation dominated by the United States and dedicated to the production of detailed military plans to counter a Soviet attack on Europe with both conventional and nuclear weapons.<lb/>
The first question to be faced is that of membership of such an organisation. Should it include the superpowers? Should it be built up from existing organisations, or should it move directly to some sort of pan-European membership based on CSCE or the Council of Europe? The authorities of NATO themselves envisage an expansion and transformation of NATO for the purpose. They say that this is welcomed by members of the Warsaw Pact, including the Soviet Union, as it would ensure the continued involvement of the United States in the maintenance of stability in Europe, providing a counterweight both to a strong Germany, which could dominate a purely European organisation, and to the Soviet Union in whatever form it develops, and also to the danger of too close an association between those two.<lb/>
I do not favour that solution. I believe that it would retain too great an American dominance in European affairs, complicating them with the nuclear weapon issue. In my opinion we should bring to an end, a situation in which Europe's security needs are determined in bilateral meetings between Washington and Moscow. It would perpetuate the trend for European nations to seek to influence the United States separately instead of getting their act together, and, as a community, dealing with the United States and with the Soviet Union.<lb/>
It would not be practicable now to move to a much looser and wider organisation based on CSCE or the Council of Europe; and it would be imprudent to try to do so until we can see more clearly how things develop within the Soviet Union. But CSCE should be the forum in which these matters are discussed. Meanwhile, I believe that we should begin to build up a European defence community at the same time as we loosen and gradually dismantle NATO's military command organisation. The forces which European members of NATO now contribute to the alliance&#x2014;and they are bound to be greatly reduced&#x2014;should be transformed into forces of the European defence community. That should either be linked to or integrated with the European Community, absorbing Western union as it did so. In my opinion, some simplification of European institutions would seem to be desirable in any case.<lb/>
I have hardly mentioned nuclear weapons. They greatly complicate the issue, which is one of the
<col>252</col>
reasons why I believe that we must see how things develop within the Soviet Union before we can decide on the form of a security organisation. If the Soviet Union remains in something like its present form, I hope that we can get rid of nuclear weapons in Europe, at least outside the borders of the Soviet Union and at least land-based and air-delivered ones. We could then leave it to the United States and the Soviet Union to negotiate between them reductions to a very much lower level, designed just to maintain the existential threat.<lb/>
I have said little about the Gulf crisis. Speculation by retired senior officers about what might or might not, should or should not, happen when active operations may be pending is almost always unhelpful. If they are wrong, they are misleading. If they are right, they may help the enemy. I wish to emphasise one thing only: the need for clarity of the aim. The political aim must be clear if the military are to be given a clear strategic or operational aim. That must be something that will achieve the political aim, and is itself attainable with the resources made available. History abounds with examples of failure when these principles have not been observed. They are seldom easy to achieve, but without them lives will almost certainly be sacrificed in vain.<lb/>
I should like strongly to reinforce the plea of the noble Lord, Lord Pym, for patience. Patience is needed now in order to ensure that we do not get pushed into some political or military action just for the sake of satisfying people's impatience fuelled by the media. Patience will be needed later on when the Iraqi forces have been removed from the territory of Kuwait, whether they have been removed by political action or by military action. That will not solve all the problems by any means, and a great deal of patience will be needed then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03100">6.37 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03101"><member>Lord Holderness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all noble Lords who have so far addressed themselves to the crisis in the Gulf in this debate have, not surprisingly, concurred about its gravity. Some but by no means all have agreed with the conclusions which were expressed clearly and forcibly by both my noble friend Lord Caithness and the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, at the beginning of the debate. But there has been general agreement&#x2014;this was a point stressed particularly by my noble friend Lord Pym&#x2014;that on no occasion in the 45 years since San Francisco has United Nations' opinion been nearly so unanimous as in its sanctions policy of the present day.<lb/>
For most of the nations who have agreed to impose sanctions on Iraq, the policy, costly as it is, makes no very painful demands. While they could continue it without disaster for many more months, it all too evidently places a state such as Jordan, which is a good and reliable friend of Britain and on whose stability much depends, in a position of great danger. Allied to this danger is the question which was cogently asked on Wednesday by my noble friend Lord Kimball &#x2014; will the policy of sanctions work? I suspect, as has
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0166"/>
<col>253</col>
been echoed in one or two speeches this afternoon, that past experience fills very few of us with a great deal of optimism.<lb/>
It has at least become evident over the last few months that the leaders of the nations are now acutely aware that it may become necessary to repel aggressors by the use of force. As a very young man I was able to observe at close quarters the weight of responsibility thrust upon a former Foreign Secretary in the late summer of 1939. Now, as then, there can be no doubt of the grave consequences should hostilities begin both immediately for those still held hostage and ultimately in their effect upon a large part of the world well beyond the borders of Iraq.<lb/>
Everything that I have learnt in my life and all that I observe now convinces me that such a decision therefore cannot be lightly taken. Nonetheless signs are increasing that the time of decision may be drawing near and many&#x2014;certainly I include myself&#x2014;are haunted by the unwelcome conclusion that reliance for too long on the hoped-for success of the sanctions policy could result in a disastrous failure to redress this wrong, with incalculable consequences for the whole world. This is one of the lessons of the past that I suggested last year had been faithfully learnt.<lb/>
Like many others, I regard the attempt to link the present dispute with the hostile atmosphere that has persisted and still divides Israel from the Arab world as a cynical exercise designed to divert attention from an inexcusable act of aggression. But I go along I think completely with the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, when he suggests that once this dispute is resolved there can be no more worthy objective for the diplomatic skill of the whole world than the seating and creation of a true and comprehensive stability throughout the Middle East.<lb/>
In honesty and justice, one more theme must be added. Israel will not disappear and Israel must be afforded the right and the means to defend herself. But accompanying that right must go an obligation on Israel to respect the property, the interests and indeed the lives of individuals who live within or near its assumed borders.<lb/>
It seems to me, and probably to most of us, that the collective suffering of few peoples in the long history of the world can begin to be compared with that of the Jews, and Israel's power today is founded largely on the persecutions of the past. But in my admiration for their achievements and in my gratitude for all that the Jews have given to the world, I find myself sometimes looking sadly and in vain for the expression of justice and mercy in Israel which one, perhaps wrongly, imagines might be the natural inheritance of those who have themselves suffered and escaped from the vicious anti-semitic brutalities of this century.<lb/>
International law may not be perfect or complete, but there should be no more right for nations than for individuals to live outside or beyond the law, which the state of Israel, too often in my observation and opinion, attempts to do. If therefore a worldwide effort to achieve this kind of stability could follow the resolution of this present dispute, any sacrifices that
<col>254</col>
the nations have made and any sacrifices that they must make in the future may be seen in the years ahead to have been well worth while.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03102">6.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03103"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper last week, there was a letter signed by 17 Labour Members of Parliament. Not all of them were known left-wingers, though I had better say at the beginning that the names of Tony Benn and Ken Livingstone were among them. But so were those of Andrew Faulds, who I think would not object to being described as rather on the right of the parliamentary Labour Party, and of Tam Dalyell who, as I think everybody knows, is nobody's man but his own.<lb/>
That letter drew attention to what it described as,
<quote>"the growing world demand for a peaceful negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Gulf."</quote>
The signatories saw a changing tide of public perception in the United States and across Europe, shown, they said, in one opinion poll after another, and drew attention to protest demonstrations against the drift to war in 15 cities in both continents.<lb/>
The letter went on to say that calls for negotiation were being heard in government circles in France, as well as in the Soviet Union, and that one-third of the membership of the American Congress had written to President Bush opposing a major war in the Middle East. On the other hand, they said, the British Government, in the voice of the Prime Minister, was rigidly in favour of confrontation. They called for a change.<lb/>
This was followed in the same paper by a rather futile letter from a Durham academic, in which he argued in favour of a just war provided that not many were killed. The trouble with war is that it often starts with good intentions and finishes by killing thousands, if not millions, quite apart from the fact that it sometimes reaches quite different ends from the one aimed at at the beginning. This is particularly true of modern war, but even Napoleon Bonaparte was one man's tyrant and another's liberator.<lb/>
In the present case we should be in grave danger at the end of a war in the Middle East of finishing with the Western world on one side and many Arabs on the other; and, whatever happens, it is unlikely to be a case of a small war in the Middle East with not many killed.<lb/>
So I want to make it clear that there are voices who believe, with those from another place who signed the letter which I have just quoted, that, as Winston Churchill put it,
<quote>"Jaw, jaw is better than war, war."</quote>
I call upon our Government to recognise that the glow of rectitude which comes from a refusal to negotiate does not last and may cost many lives and worse.<lb/>
The decision to send troops to the Gulf may have preceded consideration of what they are likely to face if and when an attack is launched. Saddam is unlikely to attempt to defend the whole country and will probably concentrate on Kuwait City and the oil installations. I am quite sure that that is the advice his
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0167"/>
<col>255</col>
commanders will give him, and I think he will take it. This is just where the majority of non-Kuwaitis is greatest and aerial bombardment of those areas would be likely to kill a large number of people, but very few Iraqis.<lb/>
The inhabitants of those areas not only are not Iraqis; they are not even Kuwaitis. Most of them are nationals of other countries or nationals of no countries, including a large number from the European area, as well as an even larger number from Asia and a few from Africa. So a surgical strike in such circumstances is a figment of the imagination of a non-military person.<lb/>
Therefore we might finish up with a hand-to-hand conflict in the streets of Kuwait City and around the oil installations, which is just the point at which the overwhelming superiority of the United Nations forces would be least effective. The environmental consequences are most alarming. It is to be hoped that the all-party Inter-Parliamentary Union group, mentioned by the noble Earl when introducing the debate, which is visiting Libya may be able to initiate a breakthrough towards a negotiated settlement, especially as Saddam is now making conciliatory indications.<lb/>
If we turn our minds away from the imminent dangers in the Middle East we may find that the second paragraph of the gracious Speech is curiously out of date, as suggested by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver. However, before doing so we might reflect that the number of NATO-made weapons pointed against us in the Gulf emphasises once again the inadequacy of present methods of arms control. Surely that is a lesson that we must at long last begin to learn. The gracious Speech stated:
<quote>"My Government attach the highest priority to national security and to the preservation of international peace with freedom and justice. They will give full support to NATO as the basis for collective Western defence, and will maintain adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces. They will play a full part in adapting NATO strategy and will take forward work on reconstructing our forces to reflect the welcome changes in Europe and threats to peace in other parts of the world".</quote>
The statement is rather like the curate's egg; it makes gestures towards change but retreats to the verbiage which would have been appropriate a few years ago. However, I suggest that it is not relevant to the situation in which we now find ourselves.<lb/>
Quite by accident I recently came across a perspicacious article in the <i>Christian Science Monitor.</i> It was written by Daniel Plesch and a colleague who are respectively director and associate director of the British American Security Information Council. He stated:
<quote>"In the area of international security, the effective disintegration of the Warsaw Pact leaves just one military alliance in place. If the West continues to view NATO as the central mechanism for guaranteeing European security, it will perpetuate a confrontation with the Soviet Union that has lost its ideological basis".</quote>
There is a lot to be said for that point of view.<lb/>
Mr. Plesch and his colleague go on to point out that NATO is not constructed to fulfil the role of
<col>256</col>
integrating Eastern Europe into the decision-making process of the Continent. They suggest that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, known as CSCE or the Helsinki process and mentioned by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver, is more fitted for the job. They point out that the recent CSCE meeting in New York, which was attended by our Foreign Secretary, was held precisely for the purpose of creating an infrastructure to give the CSCE permanence and authority.<lb/>
The noble Earl mentioned that in opening the debate. I suggest that it would be better than inviting Eastern European nations to join NATO. Among many others, Mr. Havel, the president of Czechoslovakia, sees a strengthening of the CSCE rather than the enlargement of NATO as being the way forward. It would be interesting to have the Government's views on the subject. As the noble Earl said, a meeting of heads of government is to take place next week in Paris. It is hoped that decisions on these matters will be approached or perhaps even made. If there is time, it would be helpful to the House to know a little more about the matter.<lb/>
There is an argument against creating further international bureaucracy. It has been suggested that a small staff of less than a dozen would be sufficient at the beginning. I am no friend of bureaucracy in Europe but the case against it comes ill from NATO, with its 5,000 employees in Brussels alone. The Helsinki process would not be able to replace NATO overnight, as the noble and gallant Lord correctly pointed out. However, as regards the future it has the makings of a permanent security arrangement for the whole of Europe, whereas, in my view, NATO is obsolescent if not yet redundant.<lb/>
I return to the subject of the Gulf. I suggest that it would be a mistake to regard the Iraqi forces in Kuwait as a pushover. That mistake was made in Vietnam with disastrous results. However, at least the lesson about the necessity for strict international controls on arms exports can be learnt. Western arms firms flocked to the Baghdad arms fair all too recently. There is also the danger of the nature of the war changing once it has begun. The US Government have seen that and appear to be seeking specific United Nations endorsement for military action. It would be better for this country to be seen as an advocate of strict sanctions and a little more time rather than as one eager for a war as soon as possible. Such a situation would be for the worse rather than for the better. If there is one lesson to be learnt from modern warfare, it is that it has a momentum of its own. Once unleashed the dogs of war are out of control.<lb/>
I was horrified to learn that we are to test yet another nuclear warhead underground in Nevada. We shall do so just prior to the holding of a conference in New York which is designed to bring to an end nuclear testing. The Government's claim to support the non-proliferation treaty rings hollow in the ears of non-nuclear states as Britain refuses to take the medicine it prescribes for others. Government spokesmen who quote the treaty ignore Article 6 which obliges nuclear states to pursue negotiations
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0168"/>
<col>257</col>
relating to nuclear disarmament. The Government's concern that others shall not acquire nuclear weapons while we ignore the obligation upon nuclear states to become non-nuclear is regarded by the non-nuclear states as a supreme example of British hypocrisy&#x2014;and they are right. It is time the Government realised that, in order to rid the world of nuclear weapons, one must start at home. It would be a good idea if Her Majesty's loyal Opposition reiterated constantly its understanding of this essential fact of life at the end of the 20th century.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03105"><member>Lord Alport</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the gracious Speech makes only perfunctory reference to the Commonwealth&#x2014;included seemingly as an afterthought. My noble friend Lord Caithness did not mention it in his speech. That is evidence of how during the past 20 years the attitude of this country has changed towards a worldwide association which represents perhaps the greatest achievement of our history and in which everyone in these islands shares. In many ways it is a sign of the declining standards of values and vitality of Britain that our attitude to the Commonwealth should be increasingly characterised nowadays by neglect, petty resentment and even open hostility.<lb/>
No doubt there are many reasons for the changes which have taken place. Those include a consciousness that we are no longer the imperial superpower which we were in the lifetime of many of your Lordships and that we have become just one of the 12 members of a newfangled Europe. The debilitating consequences of two world wars, in spite of the fact that we were victorious in both, have had a profound effect on our human and economic resources. Our relationship with our fellow members of the Commonwealth has changed radically so that leaders of even the smallest countries bring to the conference table criticism of Britain's policies and even abuse beyond the normal standards of diplomatic usage.<lb/>
For many people in this country, some aspects of our relationships with dependent peoples in the colonial era have left a sense of guilt. For others, the belief that our natural self interest lies within Europe and in association with the United States has greatly reduced the importance placed on Commonwealth relations. We tend to forget that, despite all those changes, the historic association of a quarter of the world with our institutions and our political values and our common economic interests, language and culture give Great Britain an inheritance of unique value.<lb/>
I believe that there is some significance in the fact that when the current Gulf crisis arose, the first countries to respond with support were Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Of course they did that as independent members of the United Nations.<lb/>
We should not forget that a year ago Pakistan applied, and was accepted, to rejoin the Commonwealth. We should consider the significance of the application this year of Namibia, which never previously had any direct association with the Commonwealth. We should remember that, whereas
<col>258</col>
our trade balance with Europe in 1989 was &#x00A3;16 billion in the red, there was a favourable &#x00A3;1 billion balance with the Commonwealth. Nor should we forget the thousands of students from every country in the Commonwealth who come to Britain for their education and professional qualifications and in so many of whom their years here have left a lasting sense of affection for this country.<lb/>
If my argument that the creation of the Commonwealth is a major part of the heritage of this country, what should we do to preserve this great legacy? First, our representatives at Commonwealth conferences should realise that the principles governing our diplomatic relations with Commonwealth countries are not the same as those which apply to our diplomatic contacts with foreign countries. Her Majesty will open the conference in Zimbabwe next year. For her, her role as head of the Commonwealth remains of the greatest significance.<lb/>
Secondly, we should understand the susceptibilities which their past relationships with Great Britain have created in each Commonwealth country. Since the demise of the Commonwealth Relations Office, the Foreign Office has tended to treat Commonwealth countries on exactly the same basis as it treats foreign countries. The confrontation between Britain and its European partners is parallelled by the confrontation between Britain and other Commonwealth countries on the question of South African sanctions. Although Germany and France may understand and laugh off the abrasive diplomacy of the last Rome conference and may even welcome it as evidence of Britain's vulnerability and decline, for many Commonwealth countries which, despite the legacy of years of dependence, look to Britain for a conciliatory and balanced judgment it produces a sense of disillusionment and almost of shock.<lb/>
While I think that the blame for the neglect of our Commonwealth heritage rests mainly with the political leadership of Britain during the past 20 years, some of it also belongs to the Foreign Office. In the belief that nations which have become independent within the Commonwealth should be treated in exactly the same way as any other foreign country, the special relationship of Britain with other Commonwealth countries has been gradually eroded.<lb/>
Perhaps I may take the Department for Overseas Development as an example. The ODA was created during the premiership of the late Lord Stockton to administer aid to the Commonwealth and its dependent territories on the basis of their needs and without any political strings. I know that because, as Minister at that time and influenced by the Canadian example, I persuaded Lord Duncan-Sandys, the Secretary of State, to present the idea to the Prime Minister, and it was accepted. It was to be outward, practical evidence of Britain's anxiety for the Commonwealth and particularly for those members belonging to the third world. At the Foreign Office, overseas aid, although under the direction of an able Minister, has become an instrument designed simply to reinforce British interests in any part of the world. The criterion for the grant of aid, as the Foreign
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0169"/>
<col>259</col>
Secretary outlined in his speech to the Overseas Development Institute on 6th June, is best described as "getting Britain value for money". Thus, a contribution to the maintenance of our relations with the Commonwealth becomes an instrument of contemporary British foreign policy. Aid will now go not to help needy Commonwealth countries, but to serve our policy interests in Eastern Europe.<lb/>
What should be done? I believe that, as a start, the Secretary of State's deputy at the Foreign Office should be designated Minister for Commonwealth Relations and should have responsibility for all matters involving our relations with the Commonwealth&#x2014;political, economic and cultural. In particular, he or she should have the resources needed to promote a better understanding of the Commonwealth among the younger generation in Britain and to give evidence overseas of Britain's continuing special relationship with Commonwealth countries. He or she should be able to advise the Prime Minister, through the Secretary of State, of the implications for various Commonwealth countries of developments in British foreign policy. I believe that a dedicated and able Minister, with the support of the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, would be able to begin to repair some of the ravages of our neglect of relations with the Commonwealth during the past 20 years.<lb/>
I am sure that evidence of the importance which Britain attaches to the special relationship which we have inherited with those countries, great and small, throughout the world, would be widely welcomed by them. Today Britain needs friends perhaps more than at any time in her history and our best friends remain in the Commonwealth.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03107"><member>Lord Selsdon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of the great privileges of being a Member of your Lordships' House is the relatively free ability which one has to go on learning. Today I have learnt more in a few short hours than I have for many a month, not least from our two maiden speeches.<lb/>
I am not sure that I can teach your Lordships anything. Therefore, I must rely upon history. In my intervention, which will be on Europe and the Middle East, I wish to take us back to 1974, for the same period of confusion seemed to exist then as exists now. There was some form of turmoil or doubt over our membership of the EC and the Middle East was in disarray, at that time because of rising oil prices.<lb/>
Today we find that my own party appears to be somewhat in disarray over EC issues. I recall well that in 1974, when I was joint treasurer of the Conservative Group for Europe, having desperately to go out and raise money to support our delegation for the European Parliament because members of the Labour Party had flatly refused to go or to participate. I should hesitate to call them renegades or turncoats but I would defend to the last the right of everybody on European issues to hold their own views and to seek to impose them on other people.<lb/>
<col>260</col>
In those days we had a relatively small European Community. It began as the European Coal and Steel Community. It then became the European Economic Community and then the European Community&#x2014;the EC. All of a sudden the "C" has been dropped and we are back to where we all came in many years ago; namely, Europe.<lb/>
The question is: where does Europe begin and end? Is that a political or a geographical lesson? To me, Europe runs to the Bosporus and the Urals. However, I find already that I have a limited knowledge of history and can no longer name the countries which made up Europe in the days when Europe was united before the first and second worlds were created. Presumably, the second world now disappears and we struggle desperately to create the wealth of the first world across Europe.<lb/>
With that change come other problems which relate not least to defence, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver, pointed out. NATO must find a new role. The end of the cold war does not necessarily bring stability, as many commentators pointed out; it creates an opportunity for instability outside Europe. We have had and still have an unstable situation in the Middle East. Perhaps it was only in 1974 when the oil prices rose in the way that they did that people realised the importance of the area, although it has been of importance to Europe throughout the generations.<lb/>
I remind your Lordships that my only contribution in that area is that for six years I was chairman of the Government's Committee for Middle East Trade, CMET. I have the privilege of having met most of the Ministers out there and of seeing people I used to call friends appear on television in uniform. The Iraqi people are intelligent. Most of the Middle East has a strange intelligentsia which many of us fail to understand.<lb/>
At the back of it all lies oil. Seventy per cent. of the proven oil reserves of the world are in the Middle East: 65 per cent. are in the Gulf and 25 per cent. are in Saudi Arabia; another 9 per cent. are in Iraq, Kuwait, Iran and so on. That is fairly significant as long as the world, and Europe in particular, is dependent upon imported oil.<lb/>
One can also see that after the price rise of 1974, which suddenly enhanced the economies of that region, those who found that they had overspent, such as the Iraqi people, longed for a rise in oil prices. The arguments began to take place in OPEC and OAPEC. It is probably true to say that if many of the governments of the Arab world had been as wise as they always claimed to be they would have seen what was coming long ago. This crisis could then have been averted.<lb/>
We are now forced to play a role, though not necessarily a reluctant role. The strength that the United Nations has given us all is encouraging for world stability. From an economic point of view we recognise that our pattern of trade has shifted inexorably towards the European Community or to Europe, where in many cases it used to be. But we should not forget the significance of our trade with the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0170"/>
<col>261</col>
Middle East, which runs at around &#x00A3;6 billion a year and gives us a &#x00A3;3.5 billion surplus. It is mainly in manufactures, where exports are hard to come by. We should also not forget that whatever may happen at this time there will always be trading opportunities there. Trade is always followed by finance, and finance should never leave trade.<lb/>
What is the solution? What can happen now in the Middle East? I am not able to assess the outcome. But the old pearl divers I used to see&#x2014;they once provided the main economy of that part of the world&#x2014;would tell us to look back to the empires and try to understand the ambition for territorial, political and economic gain that has always rested with many of these nations. There has been coup after coup over time. The desires of Iraq, having fought a bloody and costly war, to extend its empire and increase and boost its economy are understandable. But it should never have been allowed to get away with it. One of the rules I learnt a long time ago is that one cannot negotiate out there except from a position of strength: the stronger one's position, the easier one's negotiation.<lb/>
We must also say today that a position of strength is one in which one can isolate completely the man who is probably now the sole enemy of the world. He has isolated his own people from any knowledge or news externally. We cannot know how the people in the middle of Iraq think today. But we can be sure of one thing. They know nothing other than what is fed to them. They may believe that they have been invaded by a hostile, aggressive force which seeks to destroy them. The truth is that we cannot get through unless we negotiate from strength.<lb/>
If we look back over time we must ask what the point of war is. I know not. There are many quotations. I shall pick one which I enjoy and which was given to me in the Middle East:
<quote>"The aim of war is to live unhurt in peace".</quote>
That was said by one of the old colonialists or imperialists, Cicero.<lb/>
If one follows the Arab world, the history of Babylon and the developments over time of the Darian empires, one sees that people have behaved in roughly the same way. Those who, like me, were not very good at construing Latin or Greek, will remember at the end of the chapters on the Punic, Gallic or other wars the phrase, "and they exchanged hostages". Even today there is confusion over the word "hostage". Perhaps to some extent in using the word "guest" the Iraqis are correct. I believe it descends from <i>hostis,</i> an enemy, and <i>hoste</i> meaning guest. They are not hostages. They were people taken in exchange for good behaviour. The people out there at the moment are prisoners or internees. If the word used is 'hostage", how do we equate that with the hostage held in Buckingham Palace when Her Majesty opens this House? I believe one of the Whips is held there as a hostage to ensure her safe return.<lb/>
What a scenario. When trying to negotiate from strength we fail to recognise that, like some strange and peculiar game of chess, the opponents will seek forever to entice one's pawn into their net. Great
<col>262</col>
pieces will move out there in the belief that they are trying to save or help a few. One must admire those who struggle to bring back their family and friends by whatever means at their disposal. But they play into the hands of someone else. Before I came here tonight I looked up in your Lordships' House the definition of a pawn:
<quote>"The pawns are the humblest pieces on the board and their promotion is rare".</quote>
We must stop pawns going out there; they have no role to play.<lb/>
When we come to what happens next, there will undoubtedly need to be a position where either Iraq stands off or there is war. That war may be limited in some stages or it may not. Another quotation comes to mind. It was given to me by one of my chief petty officers in the Navy when I was being rather slow. He used to say, "Don't worry. The strategy should always be <i>diu apparandum est bellum ut vincas celerius".</i> That translates to mean, to win a war quickly takes long preparation.<lb/>
We already have control of the sea. I am told it is only a matter of 10 daylight hours before we have total control of the air, and gradually the isolation of Iraq will be complete. As noble Lords pointed out, Iraq must have a way out; it will probably be a last minute retirement or nothing.<lb/>
Who are we? We are backing the United Nations, providing the strength for the Arab world to conduct its own negotiations. It will not be our role after any aggression or withdrawal to negotiate; it must be for the governments of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf to do that. As I sit down I recall another great empire, that of Alexander the Great. As your Lordships will know, he died in Babylon of malaria. But it was his father, Philip of Macedon, who said,
<quote>"No fortress is impregnable if a donkey laden with gold can be driven up to its gate".</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03109"><member>Lord Soper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I add my congratulations and admiration for the two maiden speeches to which we listened. I believe that there will be general agreement in your Lordships' House that of all the issues touched on&#x2014;some more profoundly than others&#x2014;the issue of war is by far the most ominous. It is not necessary for me to go as far as some of those who regard the present situation as potentially terminal, though there is no argument for the final immortality of this planet.<lb/>
I find that there is considerable apprehension today among those who claim to be scientifically minded that the fact of human self-consumption is a dreadful prospect. Whereas within the world as we know it a swarm of locusts is inclined to eat almost anything other than another swarm of locusts, it is the human species which seems to be bent on its own self-destruction. I do not necessarily believe that to be true. However, I find on my travels that many more people than hitherto are returning to the concept that this is a passing phase in our pilgrimage. I shall refer to that a little later. I believe that at this moment what
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0171"/>
<col>263</col>
is pertinent to your Lordships' concern is this: what is the moral nature that can be attached to war? Is it permissible? Is it inevitable?<lb/>
I deal with the three options which historically the Church has professed in relation to war. First, there is the attitude of complete neutrality on the basis of the supposition that this is a lost world anyway, that the various rules that belong, shall we say, to war have nothing to do with the Ten Commandments, and to keep those two issues apart is the essence of sobriety and common sense. Unless one should think that that is not by any means the general view, I assure myself that it is a much more current opinion now among those young people who find the ministrations of the Church more or less concentrated on the prospects of eternity rather than the concept of immediate practical attitudes to evil as they find them.<lb/>
The second of the options is that war can only be conducted in certain ways and with certain reservations if it can be equated with the Christian faith and Christian procedure. However, there is a third option and I make no apology for mentioning it as it has not yet been put forward. The pacifist position is, I believe, as academically acceptable and as respectable as any of the other two options. In fact, I believe that it is the only option that remains for the contemplation of those who look with confidence to the future. I believe that on the ground that when the just war is examined it falls into tatters.<lb/>
In the first place, it is a corruption of language. The various arguments propounded for a just war turn out to be, on examination, a mixture of inaccuracy and indeed, in some cases, of sheer superstition. I put it this way. What is the difference between throwing a baby on the fire and throwing fire on the baby? The answer is 6,000 feet. If the airman, whether he be English, German or American, who drops his bombs on, shall we say, Hamburg, Warsaw or Dresden, were to go down with the implement of destruction rather than see some delightful little glow in the sky over the city and a white patch where the bomb apparently has landed, would he still do it? It is this corruption of words in which we associate things which are themselves far beyond our capacity to put into rational form but nevertheless belong to the higher nature of our concept that is, I believe, one of the supreme enemies of proper attachment to the proposition that a war can be just.<lb/>
In the second place, as Augustine promulgated and St. Thomas Aquinas identified in a great deal of prolix argument, the composition of a war which can be regarded as just must be an economy of the requisite amount of force to provide the desired result. What nonsense that is in a nuclear age. We are told that when the crossbow was invented an abbot used one to shoot Richard the Lionheart. I am sorry that it was an abbot, but it was. The result was that the papacy pronounced that bows and arrows were acceptable in a just war but crossbows were out. It made no difference. However, it was one part of the process in the acceleration of the power of violence. Is it not true that at the Battle of Waterloo the fire power of a
<col>264</col>
brigade of the British was not much greater than that which can be carried on the back of one saboteur today?<lb/>
However, that is not the end of the story&#x2014;it is the beginning of it. I believe that a just war which is not confined within known limits cannot be reconciled because it passes all the judgments which belong to some circumspection and idea of what will be its results. Proportionality&#x2014;a long and not very helpful word&#x2014;is another aspect of the just war: that one's attitude must be proportional in what we do by violence to assure the possibility of a result which is acceptable and for which that war was first undertaken.<lb/>
I do not believe that there is any further justification needed for the proposition that there is no such entity as a just war. The Christian Church should have the courage and intelligence to recognise that one cannot square the proposition of war today with any of the propositions that belong to the Kingdom of God and which are enunciated, shall we say, in the Sermon on the Mount.<lb/>
Having said that&#x2014;I hope not with truculence&#x2014;I understand the difficulty of pronouncing. The pronouncement of no war under any circumstances because it is the total evil immediately provokes the question: then what do you do? I shall try to approach the answer to that imperative need. It is not enough to renounce war. It is, I believe, in the interests of everyone and certainly part of the essential characteristic of Christian teaching that when once we have said something is wrong, and unless we believe that this is a chaotic and useless universe, we are all in need of, and must perforce propound, what we believe to be right.<lb/>
However, there is a precondition. I find that the general concept of the proposition that the wages of sin is death is only associated in the minds of the hearers with the fact that if you commit sin you will go to hell. That is not what it means. The wages of sin is paralysis, total inertia. That is what death is so far as we are concerned. I believe that there is a Christian doctrine&#x2014;in fact, a necessary and proper doctrine that does not necessarily derive only from the Christian faith&#x2014;that if you go on doing what is wrong for long enough you shut up the opportunities of doing what is right. Anybody who has had anything to do with an alcoholics' hostel, as I have for 20 years, will not doubt that proposition. Therefore, the itch for action, and the view that anything is better than doing nothing, is not necessarily a proposition to which we can attach any practical importance today.<lb/>
We could have prevented Hitler in 1926. We could not have prevented Hitler in 1936. I believe that we have enough time left to provide the means whereby a way to avoid a future, proximate, inevitable conflict can emerge. That is why in my remaining time I want to say something about the practical alternative. It begins with the total renunciation of that war proposition. It goes on to say that if we are to regard anything active and constructive that is still available in the time left, the first proposition in that regard is not to say that we are righteous, that our enemies are
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0172"/>
<col>265</col>
villainous, that they must primarily accept their condition of wickedness and that there is an absolute need for them to recognise that wickedness and to retire from its prosecution. I cannot believe that.<lb/>
I remember that we supported Iraq when that country invaded Iran. I go further back. I learnt long ago that, as Winston Churchill said, "Lying in wartime is an indispensable ally". What did your Lordships or I know, when it happened, of the chopping up of the Ottoman empire in the interests of the Western world and pre-eminently in the interests of oil?<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships read in this morning's newspapers of the particular characteristics of the Islamic faith in, say, Saudi Arabia compared with the much more generous attitude to the Islamic faith elsewhere in that part of the world. These created in me the requirement of a confession that we cannot assume that we are in the robe of righteousness dealing with these sinners who need, first of all, to accept our repudiation of their behaviour and, alongside that, the repudiation of their continued villainy. Of course I regard the invasion of Kuwait as a crime. Was it very different from the crime involving Nicaragua? Was it very different from the crime of the invasion of Tibet? Is it very different from the occupation of the outstanding areas alongside Israel?<lb/>
I do not for one moment deny that there is a need to reduce the evil which Saddam Hussein has begun and continues to do. However, it would be wrong to rule out the prospect of some coming together of this bunch of human sinners as part of the essential characteristic of any programme which may be constructive and helpful in the solution of this present problem, or the beginning of a solution to the problems that go with it. That is preferable to plunging into the awful catacomb of war. I believe that is the message of the Church, or it should be.<lb/>
I am a pacifist, but not because I am antagonistic to war. I am a pacifist because I believe that the conduct of war essentially contrary to the spirit and teaching of Jesus. Those who take the sword will perish by it. It is contradicted in the spirit of Pentecost. It is very difficult to account for Pentecost, which is the giving of God's spirit to the early Church, and then to recognise that it went straight towards the Roman Empire and asked to become holy on the grounds that it would be supported. I do not believe that. The evidence that the early Church was pacifist is incontrovertible.<lb/>
Having made this confession of faith, I wish to end by making a suggestion which I believe to be perfectly genuine and which at the same time is absolutely imperative. I want the Church to claim and the community to accept a total repudiation of war at least for the moment in order that there may be an opportunity, which we have to seize, to say that we should pt together not because we have righteousness on our side (although in many respects we have) but because the solution of this problem involves the recognition of penitence on the part of both sides or rather the acceptance of a sense of responsibility.<lb/>
<col>266</col>
I end on what I hope is a more joyful note. I speak of the religious situation in Russia. I have with me a copy of the journal of the Patriarchate of Moscow. It is in English, so I can read it. It is a very interesting document. Do noble Lords know, for instance, that Pimen, just before he died a few months ago, was an elected member of the Soviet? I did not know that. I wonder whether your Lordships know that the number of inter-religious groupings in the Soviet Union promoted by the Church is about 10 times that of the West. There is evidence, for those who are prepared to look at the matter impartially, concerning the existing problem of how to reconcile the violence of Islam with, I hope, the lesser violence of the Christian faith. In the Soviet Union, stepping stones have already been provided to a common front in peacemaking.<lb/>
It is a curious commentary on that old rascal, Stalin, that in the middle of the war he did not turn to piety first of all but recreated the patriarchate because it would reinstate the concept of holy Russia. It did. If one looks at the evidence today one will find that in Russian literature the Second World War was the Great Patriotic War. Part of the patriotism of the Church under Stalin was within the framework of peacemaking. I do not necessarily believe that all extraordinary events are miraculous. However, I invite your Lordships to believe that when we speak of an alternative to war we must not conclude that we have all the evidence yet. I still believe that obedience to the ultimate principles of the Prince of Peace is a better way to an understanding of the future that opens up before us than all the accoutrements of war. That is my testimony.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03110">7.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03111"><member>Lord Bridges</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, I find this a remarkably interesting debate. We had the benefit of an excellent maiden speech from my noble friend Lady Dunn, which I heard with great pleasure. A number of other noble Lords remain to speak. Therefore, I shall concentrate on what seems to me to be the most immediate and important issue before us; namely, the Gulf crisis. I shall approach it from a rather different angle from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Soper, whose views I heard with respect. I have a rather different approach to his.<lb/>
My starting point is to thank the Government for the resolute and effective way in which they have handled this question in the United Nations, particularly during our presidency of the Security Council in October. We have been right to stress the primacy of collective security. For us, that is what the United Nations is all about. The countries of Western Europe cannot forget their failure to devise and execute an effective policy of collective security in the 1930s. It was consciousness of that failure which led the victors of 1945 to create the United Nations. It is only now that the frozen lines of the ideological divide have thawed and that we are able to use the resources of the organisation for the purposes for which it was originally designed for the first time since the Korean war.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0173"/>
<col>267</col>
If we are sure that collective security is the main issue for us in this crisis&#x2014;and I am personally convinced of this&#x2014;we should not cast it lightly aside. I was therefore particularly glad to read in the press that the Government have now agreed to seek a further Security Council resolution in advance of any military steps to free Kuwait from foreign occupation. That was my interpretation of what I read in the press. It appears that the noble Lord, the Leader of the Opposition, has a slightly different view. In winding up it will be helpful if the Minister can explain the Government's attitude.<lb/>
We may be legally entitled to act on the basis of the resolutions already passed and on Article 51 of the charter. Many would feel that on the basis of the principles involved we would be justified in taking that view. I suggest that the question is a broader one. The commencement of hostilities carries unpredictable risks and uncertainties. Action on the basis of a specific resolution would be a much wiser course. Only in that way would we have a real chance of retaining broad international support. In other words, this is a matter of politics rather than of law only, and it needs to be treated as such.<lb/>
I am not qualified to speak of the military difficulties of such an operation, but I would like to draw attention to some of the political aspects which would arise. There is the war crimes and atrocity issue. We have all read of the barbarous acts committed during the occupation of Kuwait. We have also seen circumstantial accounts of the use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish population of Iraq in the recent past. Revulsion at such activities has led, not surprisingly, to calls for the President of Iraq to be tried by a war crimes tribunal for his misdeeds.<lb/>
While I share the repugnance felt at these horrible activities, I ask myself whether it would be wise to proceed down this path to the extent of making the punishment of the President of Iraq a stated objective of our common policy. My doubts arise not from any lack of moral outrage, because I feel as indignant as anyone else, but from the military consequences of that obligation. Surely, there is a vast difference in practical terms between restoring the sovereignty of Kuwait to its inhabitants and the capture, imprisonment and trial of the President of Iraq.<lb/>
That would require the conquest and occupation of Iraq on the scale of the occupation and conquest of Germany in 1945. This extension of the military objective would surely add to the difficulty of a military campaign. I believe that the liberation of Kuwait is our essential and stated task and that it would not be prudent to make any formal commitment to aim more widely than that. If Iraq agrees to the restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty or is obliged to cede it, no doubt the people of Iraq will draw their own conclusions.<lb/>
Similar arguments apply to Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction, by which is meant her access to chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. It is argued, and with some reason, that an outcome of this crisis which left such capabilities in Iraqi hands
<col>268</col>
would merely postpone the day of reckoning. That may be so, but we need to remember the long-term effect of Israel's earlier attack on Iraq's nuclear installations, which shows that destruction of such activities by military means may be effective only for a limited period. So long as the political will and the economic resources are available, such preparations for mass destruction can be started afresh, as has indeed happened in the case of Iraq.<lb/>
Iraq is not the only state in the region to harbour the ambition of developing such weapons. I submit that we shall not remove the danger of armed conflict in the Middle East, involving such arsenals of mass destruction, without a wider and more general pacification. We may hope that Iraq would conclude, after two disastrous and expensive campaigns, that military adventure does not pay and will adapt her policies accordingly. We can encourage such conclusions if we, and above all the United States, pursue initiatives which permit all states in the region to devote fewer resources to armaments, which many of them can ill afford. This cannot be done effectively in relation to one country alone.<lb/>
I should like to offer your Lordships a further broad reflection on this crisis. I do not myself believe that our objective&#x2014;collective security&#x2014;is widely recognised as such by many of the Middle Eastern states. I suspect that to most Arabs it is the security of oil supplies and the price of oil which are seen as the real motive underlying Western determination and military commitment. We also need to realise, here in Britain, that our alignment in this crisis with the traditional societies of southern Arabia and the Gulf will be clearly perceived by other states in the region. Except in the case of Egypt and of Syria, of which I shall say more in a moment, this observation by others is entirely correct. We are indeed aligned with the traditional rulers, our friends of many years, and against the more secular attitudes of the Iraqi Ba'ath. This is an important factor because there are many in the Arab world who are jealous of the riches disposed of in the past two decades by the rulers of southern Arabia. Should armed conflict be a prelude to a widespread social convulsion in the Middle East&#x2014;and this might be one of the consequences &#x2014;we need to be aware that we should be lined up with the old social order against the new.<lb/>
If this identification does not worry us&#x2014;and I think it should&#x2014;we need to look carefully at the effect of conflict on the most fundamental of all issues in the Middle East, the divide between Israel and the Arabs. Fear and distrust of Israel is the highest common factor among the Arabs. The Arab leader who can most effectively champion the struggle against Israel will emerge as the hero of the Arab world. There must be an ultimate temptation here for Saddam Hussein. He might conceivably, <i>in extremis,</i> seek to bring Israel into this conflict, aiming to polarise the struggle between the just cause of the Arabs&#x2014;and the rest. Such a decision would surely be as fatal for him as it was for Samson. But it would also be damaging to others, particularly the United States and the European Community. For the European
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0174"/>
<col>269</col>
Community to be allied with Israel and the United States in armed conflict with the leader posing as champion of the Arabs is not a prospect any of us would care to contemplate. That is not the way that we would interpret the situation; but, regrettably, that is how it would appear to some others.<lb/>
This subject is labelled, rather erroneously I think, as linkage. We are right to deny any direct connection between the occupation of Kuwait and the dispute between Israel and her Arab neighbours. But we should not be surprised if others see it in that light, after the persistent but ineffective struggles of <i>intifada</i> and the lack of any real effort in recent years to get on with the issue of Palestine. Of course there are Arabs using this crisis in an effort to get us more involved in a matter of great complexity and difficulty. But we have reasons of our own, the protection of our interests, for seeking to remove in the longer term causes of tension, strife and injustice. Conversely we expose ourselves unduly by any apparent passivity or partiality. Such exposure may be markedly increased by the outcome of the Gulf crisis. For that reason, like my noble friend Lord Haden-Guest in his maiden speech, I greatly welcome the passage in the gracious Speech which seems to herald some further visible endeavour to bring about a more general pacification in the Middle East. I hope that this may be followed up with some vigour; I believe that we cannot afford to do otherwise.<lb/>
I should like to add a word about our relations with Syria, a subject not so far mentioned. We have no formal relations with Syria but we find ourselves unexpectedly in alliance with that state. We might do well to contemplate the situation for a moment. We all know the reasons for our past difficulties with Syria. To judge from certain press reports, the Government have at tempted to resume relations with Syria in the recent past, but without success. I feel sure that the Government were right to make the attempt and I regret that it has not succeeded. I hope that it will be possible to persist with such efforts. Of course we cannot condone the earlier Syrian activities; equally, we can hardly expect an explicit and public admission of error on its part. We should bear in mind that the existence of formal diplomatic relations with a state does not imply any moral approval or disapproval. It merely recognises a fact. There are ways in which Syria could give undertakings about the future which should give us sufficient satisfaction. I make these comments because I believe that we need to end the present state of affairs which is not only anomalous but deprives us of contact with a state of considerable importance in the Middle East.<lb/>
In drawing these reflections together, I invite the Government to continue their policy of proceeding by means of Security Council resolution. This policy has been effective and deserves our thanks. It would be the only sure foundation for the military action now in prospect. Such a policy is right, not only because of its application in the present crisis but also to promote the broader cause of collective security which is going to be so significant for members of the United Nations in years to come. At the same time, we need to pay
<col>270</col>
attention to the perceptions of other states in the region which see the crisis from different points of view. If our motives are to be correctly judged on their merits&#x2014;they are not ignoble motives&#x2014;we should join others who are searching for a broader framework to enable the societies and nations in the region to concentrate their resources and efforts on peaceful development. That is what their peoples aspire to, and it has been for so long denied to them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03113"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I ventured to address your Lordships' House in the debate for which we were recalled early in September, I put forward the suggestion that we must, above all, be careful not to delude ourselves as to the realities of the situation which was developing and with which we were confronted. Her Majesty's Government had by then set out a policy and that policy has, in essentials, been repeated in the interim period. The words which one might use to describe it are, "steady and collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression". Those are not in fact the words of the present Foreign Secretary; they are the words used by Sir Samuel Hoare at the United Nations Assembly on 11th September 1935. Sanctions were adopted in a spate of enthusiasm and we know what happened to sanctions and to Ethiopia.<lb/>
It may be, as other noble Lords suggested, that Iraq is perhaps vulnerable to sanctions. I do not question the validity of an attempt to use them. However, what I regard at present as a more important form of delusion is the belief that collective security has somehow been fortified and made manifest by the ability of the United Nations to pass no fewer than 10 resolutions, none of which, I observe, have had any impact on the course of events in the countries concerned.<lb/>
When we look at this alliance, whether it is the alliance as regards voting in the Security Council or that in respect of the forces arranged against Iraq in the Gulf, we have an extraordinary collection of countries which would normally, and still perhaps do, find it very difficult to regard their national interests in this conflict, and indeed in many others, as being substantially the same.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, referred to Syria. It is indeed curious to find ourselves the allies of Syria which, certainly only a year or two ago, was regarded in this country and widely in the West with the same opprobrium as Iraq; that is, as a nest for terrorists. We must necessarily depend upon Saudi Arabia. But that is a country where for the first time British troops on Remembrance Day were unable to have religious ceremonies performed. That is also a curious phenomenon, for both the United States and ourselves to have to witness. One could continue in that respect. In other words, we now face a much more complex situation. I wholly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, who asked us to look at how it appears from other quarters.<lb/>
We have, as has been said by several noble Lords, movements of opinion in our country, and perhaps
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0175"/>
<col>271</col>
even more so in the United States, which look towards some kind of negotiated settlement without anyone so far, either in your Lordships' House or in the wider world, having been able to produce even the skeleton of a negotiated settlement which might be acceptable to the ruler of Iraq.<lb/>
Looking back over the events of several weeks, it seemed at one time as though the Soviet Union, which had long connections with Iraq, would, through Mr. Gorbachev's envoy, bring about some move towards a settlement. However, it now appears that the Russians have abandoned their hopes in that respect and that the baton has now been taken up by China. I shall not refer, because I think it would be pointless, to the procession which has been referred to as the "three Gs"&#x2014;namely, the great, the good and the gullible&#x2014;starting with Mr. Edward Heath and finishing up as a final flourish of absurdity with Mr. Tony Benn who has announced that he will negotiate peace, although on whose behalf is something which has yet to be revealed.<lb/>
Therefore, there are many aspects which must be taken into account. One of them&#x2014;the only one I wish to talk about &#x2014;was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Holderness and Lord Bridges. I refer to the implication, which I believe to be correct, that the Arab-Israeli dispute will be much affected by the course of events in the Gulf over the next few months or perhaps over a longer period of time.<lb/>
As some noble Lords will be aware, I have constantly urged my friends in Israel, a country that I have close and intimate connections with, to embark upon a policy of negotiation out of pure self-interest on the grounds that their own society would be wrecked if they remained for ever in occupation of territories wholly populated by people hostile to that rule. I also attempted to assure my friends &#x2014;this is where the Gulf Crisis comes into the issue &#x2014;that simply to say, "Well, the United States will always bale us out and, therefore, we do not need to rethink our policies", was placing upon their relationship with the United States a burden which it may not tolerate in the long run. It is obvious, and has been shown to be so in the resolutions of the United Nations, that the United States is inevitably moving towards the view that that conflict must be settled.<lb/>
On the other hand, I am sure that neither of the noble Lords who raised the subject would expect or wish the conflict to be settled by the further application of violence involving the invasion by Iraq or by Syria of those territories, though, no doubt, it would seem to their inhabitants to be liberation. In my view, it remains essential, even if the present government in Israel is impenetrable, that a government should be formed at some stage in Israel which would take an initiative in suggesting the lines upon which negotiation could proceed. I see no reason why any interlocutors who have something to offer should be excluded from such negotiation.<lb/>
However, for that to come about&#x2014;this is the main point I wish to make&#x2014;the people of Israel must have a degree of confidence in their new government and
<col>272</col>
the desire to seek peace by negotiation. There must be confidence that, if they abandoned territories which they regard at present as being essential to their defence, there would be a substitute for them. For that reason I was delighted to understand from the noble Lord, Lord Holderness, that he thought some kind of international guarantee of the agreed frontiers of such a settlement would be essential. That confidence must be given.<lb/>
It is very hard to inject confidence into the Israelis. Not only have they the memories of the holocaust &#x2014;a large proportion of the population are either survivors or the descendants of survivors&#x2014;but they also have the patent evidence all around them of what Arabs do to other Arabs. When Israelis read about the rape, looting and murder in Kuwait of fellow Arabs, as they were described by the ruler of Iraq; when they read of the appalling atrocities committed by the Syrian Government against their own people (more Syrians have perished at the hands of the Syrian Government than in any international conflict); and when they read of what has gone on in the Lebanon, even quite recently, and of the fate of some of the Christians of Beirut, is it surprising that they say, "If the Arabs do this to other Arabs, what can we Jews expect if we allow them a position from which they can inflict their will upon us?" To inject such confidence is therefore an enormous task. I believe that it should be faced because the end is worth it. We shall have to see a general settlement.<lb/>
The mere solution of the Kuwait crisis is not in itself enough. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. We then have a major task of reassurance. I hope that that can be achieved. I am sure that it should be embarked upon as part of the diplomacy which the noble Lords, Lord Bridges and Lord Holderness, recommended to Her Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03114">8.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03115"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as someone with a developing country&#x2014;Commonwealth and Caribbean&#x2014;background, I thought that I should take advantage of the debate to highlight the economic impact of some recent major world developments on developing countries, including those in the Commonwealth.<lb/>
I believe that Her Majesty's Government have an important duty to ensure that the problems facing those countries less fortunate than ourselves are not overlooked and that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by the changes in the world. I therefore welcome the commitment in the gracious Speech to,
<quote>"maintain a substantial aid programme aimed at promoting sustainable economic and social progress and good government in developing countries".</quote>
The recent events in the Gulf following the brutal annexation of Kuwait by Iraq have created great uncertainties, not least in the future outlook for the price of oil. The oil price rose sharply initially to about 40 dollars a barrel. Since then the price has remained highly volatile. Needless to say, the oil exporting developing countries have made windfall gains. For some severely indebted Commonwealth countries
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0176"/>
<col>273</col>
such as Nigeria or my wife's native country of Trinidad and Tobago, the gains make their current adjustment efforts partially easier. For others, such as those in the Gulf, higher oil revenues help to pay for enlarged defence bills. But the main losers are the oil importing developing countries which form the majority of countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.<lb/>
In addition, a number of countries&#x2014;among them all the South Asian Commonwealth member countries &#x2014;are likely to lose between 4 and 5 billion dollars annually from workers' remittances. All in all, the deterioration in the current account of the oil importing developing countries could be 14 billion dollars this year and close to 30 billion dollars in 1991. If war breaks out, causing great disruption in the supply of oil, the deterioration will be far worse.<lb/>
I am pleased to note that the international community has mounted a major effort to aid some of the countries which are hardest hit. Through the Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group, about 13 billion dollars has been raised in emergency aid to help mainly Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. But for the majority of developing countries there is little available except further adjustment.<lb/>
Adjustment is certainly necessary. Countries must face the realities of international life. However, for many countries which have been adjusting for almost a decade, a serious question must now be asked: can the fragile fabrics of their impoverished societies withstand further upheaval? For example, income per capita in the sub-Saharan African region fell on average by about 2.2 per cent. per annum during the 1980s. In 1989 the income of an average citizen in sub-Saharan Africa was almost a fifth lower than in 1980. The industrial community must therefore offer oil importing developing countries assistance to enable them to undertake orderly adjustment.<lb/>
Some help may be forthcoming from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But that is not an adequate response to a crisis of such magnitude as that now facing oil importing developing countries. Even before the oil crisis broke, fears were being expressed in many developing countries about the effect that political and economic liberalisation in Eastern Europe could have on them.<lb/>
I do not wish to be misunderstood. It is certainly right to provide East European countries with financial and technical help to assist them in implementing their reforms and in nurturing their new and fledgling democracies. Their financial needs will be immense if they are to reform and modernise their economies, raise living standards and tackle environmental problems. However, we must ensure that the assistance that we provide to East European countries is not given at the expense of developing countries. Poverty has at least as great a claim as liberation from communism.<lb/>
Our Overseas Development Administration has given an assurance that aid will not be adversely affected. That is to be welcomed. However, such an assurance can be consistent with mere maintenance of
<col>274</col>
aid in real terms, while incremental aid is diverted to East European countries. That would mean that our aid in relation to our gross national product, which is already below the average of all donors, would fall further. It would thus move us even further away from the target of 0.7 per cent. which was collectively set by the international community some 30 years ago. Real growth in aid is all the more important at present because we are entering a decade when there is likely to be immense competition for private capital. It is also a fact that, for many developing countries, the 1980s were a lost decade.<lb/>
We must come to grips with this problem, and I wish to suggest some of the actions that can be taken. First, I believe we can assist in the solution of the debt problem. I congratulate the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, on his proposals at the meeting of the Commonwealth finance ministers in Port of Spain, Trinidad, to make a large leap in the debt relief provided to the low income countries which are distressed with debt.<lb/>
The United Kingdom has been in the forefront on this question of debt relief for very poor countries. It was Mr. Lawson who first outlined the debt relief proposals for low income countries which culminated in the agreement which is now known as the Toronto Terms. We must therefore engage all our skills to persuade other creditor countries to adopt the Trinidad and Tobago terms outlined by John Major.<lb/>
However, it is not only the poorest who need debt relief. The lower and middle income countries like Jamaica owe a significant proportion of their debt to official creditors. Earlier this afternoon, the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, reminded us of similar problems confronting Poland. These countries&#x2014;less poor than the poorest but nevertheless poor&#x2014;are also severely weighed down by debt. In fact, we have the peculiar situation now where the large debtors like Mexico and the very poor get some relief but those in between&#x2014;often small countries&#x2014;get virtually no relief. We must find a way of helping them.<lb/>
My second suggestion concerns private capital. I urge Her Majesty's Government to ensure that those developing countries which wish to attract private capital are encouraged to do so through credit and investment guarantees and financial and technical assistance similar to that being offered to East European countries. I suggest also that they be helped to develop capital and stock markets and in the promotion of country funds in international capital markets. This could provide an important route for attracting portfolio investments. Such investment has a tremendous long-term potential for developing countries. In this respect I welcome the launching in September this year of the Commonwealth equity fund, an idea conceived and developed by the Commonwealth Secretariat. My congratulations go to the Secretariat for this forward-looking and innovative approach.<lb/>
My third suggestion concerns increased opportunity for enhancing aid flows arising from the prospect of the peace dividend. The reduction in East-West tensions has given us an immense opportunity to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0177"/>
<col>275</col>
reduce defence expenditure and to reap a peace dividend; a dividend which, if properly used, could provide benefits to our citizens as well as those of developing countries.<lb/>
I feel I ought to remind noble Lords that absolute poverty afflicts 1 billion people in the third world. That is a quarter of the total population of those countries and nearly one-fifth of the population of the world. If the present understanding and commitments being reached between the superpowers are translated into cold statistics, annual reductions in military spending of between 2 per cent. and 4 per cent. are quite possible in the 1990s. This could give potential savings of 1.5 million to 2 trillion dollars during the course of the 1990s. These sums could be used to meet the social needs of the countries involved and also to help the countries that are less fortunate.<lb/>
I believe that a major dialogue should now be encouraged here as well as in other countries on the potential size of such a peace dividend and the beneficial uses to which it could be put. A commitment to reach the target of 0.7 per cent. of gross national product as official aid by the year 2000 could easily be one of the outcomes of this exercise. I wish tonight to invite Her Majesty's Government to make that commitment. Enlightened leadership can certainly make this possible.<lb/>
I had intended to say something about the problems that will confront developing countries after 1992 but I have spoken for long enough. I conclude by saying that I read in the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> an article by Neal Ascherson. He wrote that an iron curtain had developed in Europe between rich and poor. It is not just in Europe; that iron curtain between rich and poor exists the world over. I implore Her Majesty's Government to play their full part in trying to remove it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03116">8.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03117"><member>Lord Holme of Cheltenham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this has been a most informative and engrossing debate, not least the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead. It has also already been a rather long debate which has led me to a personal embarrassment for which I apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Arran. I may not be able to stay until the end of the debate this evening. I have a long-standing engagement to fulfil, for which I apologise.<lb/>
I wish to make three substantive points about the situation in the Gulf and precede them by one short observation about the attitudes with which we approach the problems there. I urge your Lordships that in our approach to the Gulf we do not adopt an over-self-righteous and over-pious approach. I imagine that it is common ground from the tenor of the debate in this House that we are united against the international brigand that Saddam Hussein has proved to be and that we are determined to see that Kuwait is restored to its proper government and liberated. But at the same time we should remember
<col>276</col>
that we and other Western countries have our share of the responsibility for the situation in the Middle East today.<lb/>
It is we who drew lines on the sand and called them national boundaries. It is we who for 40 years have left unsolved the Palestinian question. It is we who have poured profitable arms sales into the Middle East. Is it not a bitter paradox that we read in the newspapers that, as the Desert Rats left for the Middle East, they had not been able to obtain the proper kit or uniform? Why?&#x2014;because those desert uniforms had been sold. To whom had they been sold? Two years ago they were sold to the Government of Iraq. Therefore, we should not approach these Middle East questions in a holier than thou spirit but in a spirit of realism. If we have a resolute approach let it not be a pious one.<lb/>
There are three matters that I should like to share with your Lordships. First, I urge that we do not talk ourselves into a war psychosis and create an unstoppable momentum towards war. My noble friend Lord Gladwyn talked about the virtues of preparing for war. Of course we should prepare for war. We should, as the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, said, negotiate from a position of strength. On these Benches we support the action of the Government in sending forces to the Middle East and we support the increase in the level of forces undertaken by the Americans. However, we support them in the spirit of preparing for war, not as a prediction of war.<lb/>
I do not know whether I am alone in this House in finding it curious that the right honourable lady the Prime Minister has twice in the past week used the word "soon", first in the debate in another place on the gracious Speech and then in the Guildhall last night. I cannot believe that that is militarily or politically well advised. If we are not careful we shall create a momentum that will take over. We should remember the events that led to the First World War. There was the sense of an unstoppable momentum carrying us forward which nobody could escape. To use the word "soon" does not help. Even in the most practical terms it removes the element of uncertainty which is essential when dealing with someone like Saddam Hussein.<lb/>
The second point that I should like to make, which is a point that was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, is that we have not heard enough about how economic sanctions are working. When we sent our forces to the Gulf it was on the basis of a twin-track strategy, of protecting Saudi Arabia and enforcing economic sanctions through a blockade so that they would effect a stranglehold on Iraq. We have not been told in this House, or generally by Her Majesty's Government, how well those sanctions are working. Are we to assume from the fact that we hear very little about them that their significance is being diminished in order to prepare us for a military option? That is wrong. We must know and understand fully how far the declared strategy of the allies in the Gulf is working.<lb/>
My third point is that if the strategy of economic sanctions and blockade ultimately proves to have failed we may have to face the prospect of the use of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0178"/>
<col>277</col>
force. As the right reverend Prelate said, having exhausted all other possibilities and peaceful avenues we may have to face the prospect of the use of force in the Gulf. It should be the last resort, not an easy next step.<lb/>
I am sure that I do not need to remind those of your Lordships who have seen active service that the consequences of war are almost always unknown to politicians and predictions are almost always wrong. In August 1914, when the troops went off to France, people talked about them being home by Christmas. They did not come home four and a half months later; they came home four and a half years later&#x2014;those of them who came home&#x2014;after suffering massive casualties. Therefore, if we are faced, as we are, with the unknown when considering the prospect of the use of force there must be no facile optimism about the duration of any war, about the casualties likely to be incurred or about the political consequences for the Middle East as a whole.<lb/>
Another point about the potential use of force which has been mentioned by a number of noble Lords is that it is essential to hold the international community together. It has been said by my noble friend Lord Gladwyn&#x2014;and we on these Benches agree with him&#x2014;that a special Security Council resolution would be appropriate. My noble friend explained why that is so legally and I should like to say why it is also desirable politically. It is the outward and visible sign of the new world order about which the noble Lord, Lord Pym, spoke earlier in the debate. That would be expressed by a Security Council resolution. A Security Council resolution would represent the unity of the Soviet Union, the European allies, the moderate Arabs and the rest of the world community together.<lb/>
In these deplorable events, the real prize that is at stake is a new international order. Let us make sure that we secure the real prize and do not grasp the fool's gold of hasty action for its own sake.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03118">8.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03119"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham. I should like to try to respond to the eloquent appeal of the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. I want to refer to our closest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, and later to mention the Soviet Union.<lb/>
Last year at this time I spoke about Article 2 of the 1937 constitution of Ireland. It states:
<quote>"The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial sea".</quote>
Article 3 merely limits the effect of Irish laws pending reintegration of the national territory.<lb/>
As long ago as 1967 a committee of the Irish Parliament proposed amending Article 2 to make it clear that that was only an aspiration. That amending action was never taken. Some well-intentioned persons then maintained that the article in question should be understood as an aspiration. However, since the Supreme Court's ruling in this year's <i>McGimpsey</i> case such an interpretation is no longer possible. The learned judges ruled:
<col>278</col>
<quote>"The reintegration of the national territory is a constitutional imperative".</quote>
That dictum has an unfortunate, if not perverse, bearing on the application of the Extradition Act 1965 and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1977. It means that terrorist offenders are less likely to be brought to justice in one jurisdiction or another, despite the welcome Irish ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.<lb/>
The greatest damage caused by Article 2 and the Supreme Court ruling lies in the political sphere. I suggest that it constitutes a major obstacle to political agreement within Northern Ireland and to the necessary reformulation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The article provokes deep-seated and historic fears within most northern Unionists while at the same time causing the Social Democratic and Labour Party to be less forthcoming and more Dublin oriented than it might otherwise be.<lb/>
In 1985, ambiguity had to be used by those framing the Anglo-Irish Agreement. That ambiguity now needs to be removed. We are in the era of the Vienna and Helsinki agreements and I believe that it is wrong for a friendly neighbouring state to claim the territory of another. That is the view that I tried to express in a letter to <i>The Times</i> of 8th August 1990.<lb/>
Perhaps I may illustrate the harm of Article 2 by referring to the honourable Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The honourable gentleman is a Unionist, but by no means an extremist. In August he spoke at a summer school in Donegal in the Republic of Ireland to a largely Irish audience. He said that he had advocated responsibility sharing within Northern Ireland and had recognised the need for North-South liaison. He concluded that such developments would not be possible until some reasonable basis for trust had been established both within Northern Ireland and on the whole island. He felt openly threatened by the aggressive attitude of the Republic of Ireland toward Northern Ireland.<lb/>
That is why we need the removal or substantial modification of Articles 2 and 3. However, I am glad to say that this issue is being actively discussed and addressed within the Republic. Mrs. Robinson, the newly elected President of Ireland, whom I am sure we all welcome most warmly, was asked during her campaign whether Articles 2 and 3 should be amended. She replied:
<quote>"We do need to modify them &#x2026; It is not a question of denying the aspiration to national unity &#x2026; It is a question of modifying in accordance with what is already guaranteed internationally in the Anglo-Irish Agreement".</quote>
She went on:
<quote>"I felt the Anglo-Irish Agreement process was not complete. It did not involve Unionists and it did not involve constitutional change here"&#x2014;</quote>
and that means in the Republic.<lb/>
A little later, on 27th September, Mr. John Bruton, the deputy leader of Fine Gael, addressed the conference on security and co-operation in Europe at Strasbourg. He called for amendment of Articles 2 and 3 to align the Republic's constitution with the Helsinki Final Act, which states that borders can only
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0179"/>
<col>279</col>
be changed by peaceful means and by agreement. On 17th October Mr. Michael McDowell, chairman of the Progressive Democrats who form part of the governing coalition, spoke to law students in Dublin. He called for the removal of those articles and not just for them to become the subject of negotiations.<lb/>
I have deliberately quoted leading personalities coming from three Irish political groups. I am sure that many members of the other main party, Fianna Fail, would agree that partition is a political reality which cannot and should not be overridden by constitutional imperatives however venerable. Change concerning Northern Ireland can only come about by consent and agreement. That is a very long way off, and repeated opinion polls taken in the Republic have shown that the majority there do not expect it to happen within their lifetime, if indeed ever.<lb/>
The gracious Speech said that Her Majesty's Government would,
<quote>"maintain positive relations with the Republic of Ireland".</quote>
Such relationships need to be based on clarity and not on ambiguity. I believe that the Government can help the process of constitutional change in the Republic by making clear now what is the status of Northern Ireland. It should be something that is known, definite and not conditional, unlike what is stated in a recent press release from the Northern Ireland Office dated 8th November concerning security policy. It is necessary to remove the conditional status that has applied since 1948. If any review is later thought to be necessary, it should be at some remote date, perhaps 2050 AD.<lb/>
I believe that Her Majesty's Government are in agreement with me when they turn their minds to such matters. For instance, in February a long-serving Minister in the Northern Ireland Office stated that existing boundaries were the fundamental first principle on which agreement had to be underwritten by the international community if greater ethnic strife were to be avoided. He was speaking in a context that included both Eastern Europe and Northern Ireland. I heartily concur with him. Will Her Majesty's Government join with others in establishing a service to help monitor and conciliate the grievances and legitimate political aspirations of minorities throughout Europe within existing state boundaries? That, I think, is something at which the noble Lord, Lord Pym, was probably hinting in the course of his speech.<lb/>
With that transition via Eastern Europe, I come now to the Soviet Union. I was briefly in Moscow in January. Since then it has become clearer that that vast empire is changing character and structure. The component republics are gaining in both importance and autonomy. Despite that, our country is only represented in Moscow. Will Her Majesty's Government move rapidly to set up consulates in such places as Kiev, Riga, St. Petersburg, Tiflis, Vladivostock and even perhaps in western Siberia? There is regional business to be done and it is important that our competitors should not arrive first on the scene.<lb/>

A month or two ago a small group from the Catholic organisation Pax Christi visited Siberia. It received a request from a district authority in the Republic of Yakutsk to help with the care of orphans and the transformation of their existing schools into all-purpose grammar schools. In Novosibirsk the same group had appeals from the university and a children's hospital. I mention those examples to point out how the official Soviet bodies recognise their need for help even from religious sources. They also show that the needs of remote places are likely to be discovered only by personal visits. I trust that this will be a stimulus both to your Lordships and to the Government. Our know-how in this country has never been in such demand as it is now.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03121"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am just, but only just, old enough to recognise for myself, without having them pointed out to me, the very close parallels that can be drawn between the present dictator of Iraq in 1989&#x2013;90 and the dictator of Germany in 1939&#x2013;40, just 50 years before. Each sought to exterminate a minority population using poison gas, each used the truth as a malleable substance to be manipulated to his own advantage and each seized neighbouring territory by force of arms and thus overthrew international law. But there the parallels should end.<lb/>
Hitler was able to persuade himself that the warnings issued by the free world were without substance and we demonstrated to him, above all at Munich, that we were prepared to compromise. Saddam Hussein should not be under any such illusion, since his invasion has produced such startling unanimity across the world. It may in fact be a valuable by-product of the present tragic circumstances. That is not simply because he threatened the energy supply of the developed world possibly for the next decade but because he overturned the legal independence of a small sovereign state whose claim to an independent identity was exactly the same as that of countless other states throughout the world. All alike were threatened. As my noble friend Lord Caithness said in his opening speech, world order itself was threatened. All alike recognise the threat and, for the first time in human history, all have acted in concert.<lb/>
Those circumstances did not exist in 1939. They have never been achieved before and, given skill, courage and steadfastness of purpose, that may yet prove to be the most important consequence of the invasion of Kuwait. If it does, I agree with my noble friend Lord Pym, the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, and other noble Lords that one day it will become clear that we are living at the beginning of a new and more hopeful age.<lb/>
But, without that skill, courage and steadfastness of purpose, the consequences will be quite other. We are being borne along on the river of history at an ever-increasing pace with ever more dangerous rocks on either side of us. Failure now to uphold the rule of international law would not be just to let our immediate affairs slide into chaos; it would be to let go, perhaps for another 50 years, a chance at least to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0180"/>
<col>281</col>
begin to establish a worldwide consensus on the basis of that law and the proper means of upholding it in the future. That rock lies on one side of our narrow course. If, on the other hand, we fail to exercise the force at our disposal with wisdom, efficiency and both due vigour and due restraint, we shall be faced not with a short, victorious war but with a long and bloody struggle that will claim countless promising young lives. That rock lies on the other side of our course.<lb/>
Those are dramatically obvious circumstances, and I draw a starkly simple conclusion from them, so simple indeed that it seems to have escaped the notice of some of my friends entirely. It is that, at supremely critical times such as the present, to precipitate a leadership struggle in this country seems to those of us not involved in it to be about as sensible as starting a fight over the paddle in a canoe at the head of the rapids.<lb/>
It is not for us to offer Members of another place advice on how to conduct their affairs&#x2014;any such advice would be counterproductive&#x2014;but right now everybody&#x2014;even Members of your Lordships' House &#x2014;has a right to say that sometimes whoever is at the helm must be given the authority and the peace to exercise a calm, clear judgment on behalf of the nation. At such times too much of our future and too many of our children's lives are at stake for it to be otherwise. I believe that this is such a time.<lb/>
It was very good indeed that we were able to act swiftly and effectively in response to an unexpected threat in the Gulf, and that we could do so, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver, explained, because we had for long been prepared to meet a familiar threat in Europe, and that that threat had appeared to recede. We had already, I understand, counted some of the savings that could be expected from the receding of that threat, and they appear already to have been costed into the defence estimates.<lb/>
If so, let us have a care. I do not doubt that, as in the now distant days of the Korean war, it has been necessary to concentrate on formations that face the immediate possibility of battle, supplies and resources that would normally have been spread more thinly over a larger number of troops in a lesser state of readiness. To what extent this may have been necessary I do not know, and it may have been minimal. I only ask as a taxpayer that it is noted by those planning the shape and size of our forces in future years and taken as a yardstick of efficiency.<lb/>
We have surely learned over the last 45 years that only those who are prepared to go to war have any prospect of preserving peace. To the extent that contingent threats cannot be met from a reserve and it is necessary to rob troops already deployed in one area to supply those deployed in another, the troops that are robbed are not in practice available and not therefore effective in the preservation of peace. Is it not, therefore, open to question whether the deployment of those troops was not in some sense beyond our financial capability?<lb/>
<col>282</col>
I only ask this to make the point that the size&#x2014;any size &#x2014;of the defence estimates must bear an actual and not just a theoretical relationship to the commitment our forces are meant to meet. Our forces must surely be trained and equipped to a standard that will enable them to meet that commitment readily, and paid at rates to enable them to recruit up to the necessary strength for the purpose. If they are not, we must either reduce the commitment or increase the estimates. If the commitment is inescapable, so is the expense. A peace dividend that resulted in forces that were either undertrained or underequipped, or under-recruited to meet their commitment would not be a peace dividend at all because it would not increase but reduce our ability to keep the peace and to maintain the rule of international law.<lb/>
The subject of training brings me, telescoping my speech, briefly from the general to a much more particular matter. That is Salisbury Plain, on which a great deal of training is done. As Minister for the heritage, I was for a year and a half closely interested in the effects that military activity had had and was having on the training area on Salisbury Plain and particularly on the archaeology there. The area is astonishingly rich in archaeology because it is, paradoxically, the ploughshare and not the sword that does the real damage to archaeological remains, and the sword has held sway on Salisbury Plain for a long time.<lb/>
Where else could you go to find the undisturbed foundations of an entire Romano-British village and its associated field system as just one of 12 major aggregations of archaeological sites among over 100 smaller ones? But first trenching tools and then armoured vehicles changed the almost wholly beneficial influence of army training on the plain. While it was clear that the army's training needs must prevail, it was also clear that with care they could be met in ways that are consistent with preserving the archaeological heritage.<lb/>
A policy was worked out between the defence and environment departments when my noble friend Lord Trefgarne and I were responsible as the respective Ministers of State there. My noble friend who is to reply to this debate is aware of my concern to see that this policy is fully and effectively implemented, and I ask him today only to confirm that this is the Government's clear intention.<lb/>
The debate on the gracious Speech is the occasion on which your Lordships are expected to put down markers as to their intentions regarding legislation foreshadowed in it. I am advised by the usual channels that I should use this opportunity to refer very briefly indeed&#x2014;and it will not take more than three and a half minutes&#x2014;to two matters raised in an earlier debate. I do this because I was for three years Minister at the Home office responsible for prisons, and during that time I was impressed, as I am sure are all your Lordships who know the fact, by the quite unacceptable effects of prison overcrowding.<lb/>
I shall not list the numerous steps that we then put in motion to try to reduce this&#x2014;a task made no easier, may I say, by the conduct of the Prison Officers
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0181"/>
<col>283</col>
Association, which was very ably illustrated by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, on the first day. In two respects I feel that the Government can substantially assist the courts in doing more to reduce prison overcrowding. One of these consists in providing the courts with disposals other than imprisonment for a number of offenders for whom imprisonment is at present the only suitable sentence.<lb/>
The probation service has a wealth of relevant experience for this, and many suitable staff. I welcome the steps that Her Majesty's Government have already taken to explore ways to use these resources, and particularly of adding to their scope and effectiveness by involving the private and the independent&#x2014;and more particularly the independent&#x2014;sectors. I particularly draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary the extensive practical experience of successful work of this sort that has been acquired by the voluntary sector in the juvenile field right up to the age of 16.<lb/>
One effect of the present distinction in law between juveniles and young adults has been that the former are dealt with by the Department of Health and social workers, while the latter are dealt with by the Home Office and the probation service. I have been fortunate enough to have been a Minister in both departments and to see the excellent work done by both services, and I can assure my right honourable friend of two things. The first is that people do not suddenly and magically change their nature on their seventeenth birthday. Everyone matures at his or her own rate. But there are very few young adults who are not susceptible to some of the good effects of both the preventive and the curative regimes that go generally under the name of intermediate treatment.<lb/>
This is something that has been developed in the voluntary sector under the aegis first of the DHSS and now of the DH. That sector has wide experience and a large number of local projects already operational up and down the country. Suitably supported by his own department, this could be an invaluable resource in the initiative which he is now contemplating, and I commend it to him.<lb/>
Finally, I return to a matter I raised on the last Criminal Justice Bill and which I intend to raise in the next. I hope that I shall have the sympathetic ear of your Lordships and that you will return to debate it. A major contributory factor to the congestion of our prisons is the congestion in our courts. A great many of those who have to wait for their cases to be heard do so in the remand wings of local prisons where overcrowding is at its insanitary and corrupting worst.<lb/>
If you are remanded into prison you have to wait for the court to be ready before your case can be heard, and it will not be ready until the cases ahead of yours have been dealt with, even though the accused in those numerous cases are all bailed and not remanded, waiting comfortably at home rather than in a cell, living with the family and not with a swarm of recidivists, and going to work or to outdoor leisure for eight to 12 hours rather than 60 minutes a day.<lb/>
<col>284</col>
Most of the prisoners in these wings are queuing for the Crown Court, and the Crown Court is full. Need it be so full at such a very great price? I understand that recently 10 per cent. of Crown Court time and 8 per cent. of Crown Court business in the London area has consisted of cases of handling goods worth less than &#x00A3;100. Most of them involved trivial sums. I shall be asking your Lordships to consider again whether these lesser offences should be imprisonable and triable by jury at all. Surely there must be some way in which we can reduce the enormous price that must be paid in the degradation of other accused persons waiting in our prisons while this elaborate machinery is engaged on such trivial matters.<lb/>
It is a controversial issue; it deserves your Lordships' attention. I do not expect my noble friend to reply to it; merely to pass it on to his right honourable friend at the Home Office. I thank your Lordships for your patience. If you will think kindly only of that proposal I shall weary you no longer.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03123"><member>Lord Blease</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Elton, will understand if I do not follow him in the very pertinent and interesting topics which he raised in his speech. There are three reasons why I shall try to keep my contribution short: the hour is late, I have a husky throat and, in his very challenging and emotional speech, my noble friend Lord Fitt ably dealt with a number of points that I had listed.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Fitt was right when he suggested that we ought to read the report of the debate in this House on the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 26th November 1985. The noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw, who was then the Leader of the House, presented the agreement on behalf of the Government. My noble friend Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, Leader of the Opposition, spoke with strong reservations about the possible difficulties arising from a unique international agreement.<lb/>
I concluded my remarks in that debate&#x2014;my noble friend Lord Fitt expressed similar sentiments today &#x2014;with the hope that,
<quote>"the agreement is a flickering light in a very black situation. I appeal to everyone genuinely to try to keep that light alive by building trust with hope and compassion". [<i>Official Report,</i> 26/11/85; col. 829.]</quote>
That is the approach all must take when we are dealing with Northern Ireland affairs. It must be a constructive approach.<lb/>
In the complexity of Irish affairs, we should seek to approach every genuine effort with reasoned hope and positive action. The troubles in Ireland did not arise from the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The people in the Province have been subjected to political chaos, relentless terrorism, crippling conditions for essential social and economic developments and a vile sub-culture of despotic sectarianism, which ensnares many of our children and young people. Some sadly end up spending the best and most productive years of their lives in prison&#x2014;yes, my Lords, in prison&#x2014;while the mafioso godfathers go free.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0182"/>
<col>285</col>
I agree with my noble friend Lord Fitt. Just when it appeared that our tortured Province had endured every imaginable horror, the terrorists resorted to an even more sinister device for murder by using innocent civilians as human bombs.<lb/>
The public highway, the workplace, the homes of citizens, shops, hospitals and even places of worship are places of risk in Northern Ireland. There is no place safe or sacred from the cruel deeds of the gunmen and the bombers. It appears that the terrorists have become hardened to human suffering in their ruthless determination to inflict death and terrible suffering on families and the whole community. What an insane, inhuman, inexplainable way to seek to promote support for the establishment of a political regime &#x2014;a new state&#x2014;and the election of a parliamentary democracy, with the essential international recognition to function in the modern world.<lb/>
Here in England and in Europe these dastardly terrorist acts have sullied the "pride of being Irish". Such acts have not helped any legitimate political or community cause. They have made great difficulties for the personal and social lives of many thousands of honest, peaceable Irish people from the North and from the Republic, who have homes, families and employment here in Britain. As Bishop Cahal Daly said last Sunday,
<quote>"They bring shame and disgrace on the community from which they came".</quote>
Thank goodness, there is hope in Northern Ireland. There are some rays of light appearing on the Irish political scene. There are new feelings of hope that changes for betterment are slowly beginning to take shape. I refer briefly to some of these perceptible rays which shine, more or less, from the different political and community vantage points.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Fitt mentioned the election of Mrs. Mary Robinson as the first woman president of the Republic of Ireland. She is a lady with great personal political experience and proven ability. She is knowledgeable and interested in the practical affairs affecting the lives of the people of Ireland. She is limited in her political capacity to change affairs in Northern Ireland, but I believe that her election epitomises the qualities that make for political change in Ireland, qualities worthy of emulation.<lb/>
The announcement of the election of Bishop Cahal Daly as Roman Catholic Primate of Ireland was received with generous and widespread welcome not only in Ireland but throughout these islands. He is justly recognised as an outstanding figure of courage, vision, lucidity, high intellect and deep spirituality&#x2014;a man of the people. He is highly respected across the communities and has shown through his work a realistic approach to the day to day problems facing people of all creeds, especially the disadvantaged. I am confident that the standards of personal conduct that Dr. Daly upholds and the high value that he places on corporate action for community well-being will have a potent influence for good on future political attitudes and events in both parts of Ireland.<lb/>
There are a number of noble Lords in this House, including the noble Lord, Lord Elton, who has just
<col>286</col>
spoken, and the noble Lord the Leader on the Government Benches who have held high ministerial office in Northern Ireland. We know only too well the disappointments, the privation, the dangers and the sacrifice of the comforts of home and family life that those noble Lords experienced during their ministerial duties in the Province. Not only they; their families also suffered. Such an experience means that they have developed a very high degree of sensitivity, sympathy and appreciation for our police and our armed service personnel, which is always warmly expressed and demonstrated.<lb/>
As one who lives in Northern Ireland, I can say that there is much genuine respect for the Secretary of State, Peter Brooke, and for the fair, courteous, sincere, patient and skilful way in which he has conducted the present political initiative to find a way forward to new political structures for the good government of Northern Ireland and for peace, prosperity and justice.<lb/>
There is much more that I could say, but it has been a tradition in this House that we take a bipartisan approach to general affairs in Northern Ireland in the hope that the consensus may enable us to build peace and to encourage those who are seeking the proper constitutional and political way forward.<lb/>
In conclusion, and in an attempt to be constructive, there have been failings in the way that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been operated, rather than in the textual or legal explanations. More could have been done to deal effectively with the promotion of cross-border co-operation and there is a whole list of matters such as agriculture, environment, terrorism, transport, shipping and so on which require attention. Many of these matters could have been dealt with in a much more forthright and public way.<lb/>
Without going into detail about the important and useful speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, there is a considerable amount of movement in Northern Ireland and in the Republic towards the need for change in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution. In any changes which might be forthcoming a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland should have been discussed.<lb/>
There are hopeful signs amid the terrible ongoing murderous campaign of terrorism. It is not always helpful to say that in the presence of those who have suffered in Northern Ireland during the past years. However, let us build upon mutual understanding towards constitutional politics, community wellbeing and prosperity. There is no magic wand or formula for the resolution of the problems in Northern Ireland. It must be built on real, sensible and peaceful methods.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03125"><member>Lord St. John of Bletso</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to address my remarks this evening to the Government's commitment to,
<quote>"their policy of encouragement to all sides in South Africa to enter negotiations to create through peaceful means a democratic non-racial society".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0183"/>
<col>287</col>
In this regard we all welcome the dramatic reforms and courage of President de Klerk. In addressing that goal it is important to consider not only the political climate but also the social and economic environment.<lb/>
Of late, world attention has focused on the continuing tragic violence and deaths in the black townships of South Africa. Many commentators are of the opinion that if Nelson Mandela and Chief Buthelezi were to meet they would be able to achieve an instant solution to those violent acts and would pour oil on the troubled waters. The root causes of the violence are however not so simple and such a meeting would not necessarily result in defusing such conflicts. That is not to say that the root causes of the violence cannot be overcome: they can be overcome. To do so requires that they are identified and understood as the consequences of social, economic and political developments in the country.<lb/>
In my opinion the major contributors to the conflicts are, first, that the various political groupings are now jockeying to establish their support bases. In many instances that tends to reflect traditional or tribal allegiances, more specifically pitched battles between Xhosa and Zulu supporters. Secondly, there is much evidence that physical intimidation is one of the tactics used to secure this support. At the same time there is evidence of a total lack of control of lower ranking activists.<lb/>
Thirdly, there is undoubtedly an element of apolitical opportunistic criminal behaviour which highlights the problems of maintaining an effective anti-crime programme including weapons control under these conditions. Fourthly, the social problems created by the accommodation in hostels of more than 500,000 single migrant workers has provided a ready flashpoint for many of the pent-up frustrations which have accumulated in the poverty stricken townships in South Africa. Finally, there is a distinct lack of trust for the impartiality and accountability of the police force. In my opinion, only when those factors have been comprehensively addressed as part of the normalisation process will any meeting between Nelson Mandela and Chief Buthelezi produce a workable long-lasting result.<lb/>
In opening today's debate the Minister referred to the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act followed by the Group Areas Act and at a later stage the Land Act. In addition to those measures repealing the last vestiges of apartheid, the South African Government have recently agreed to the release of political prisoners in the country. It is also noteworthy that the Nationalist Party has opened its membership to all South Africans. Indeed, last week for the first time ever all the main Churches and denominations in the country met to discuss their moral solidarity for a future South Africa. Most significant at the gathering was the public rejection by the main Church of the Afrikaners, the Dutch Reform Church, of its previous justifications in support of apartheid. This is a profound psychological step indicating the depth of
<col>288</col>
willingness and acceptance by the spiritual leaders of the Afrikaners of the necessity for fundamental reforms.<lb/>
In focusing on the social and economic challenges facing the new South Africa one must consider the country's demographic peculiarities. It has a population of which more than 60 per cent. is under the age of 23. The current population growth rate among the black people is more than 3 per cent. With that rate of growth, 1 million people will be added to the population each year. There is more than 50 per cent. unemployment with a prognosis for the forthcoming year of negative economic growth. Even with negative growth in the economy, an estimated 1 million people a year migrate from the rural areas into the towns and cities. That places an increasing strain on the social and physical infrastructure of those areas.<lb/>
Clearly, now is the time for the international community to show its recognition and acknowledgement of the dramatic reforms that the South African Government have achieved by easing sanctions, thus allowing economic growth and increasing job opportunities.<lb/>
The decision of the South African Government to enter into the negotiating process was taken in the knowledge that the future was unpredictable. Many commentators tried to predict an outcome by applying experience from other African countries which had undergone a decolonialisation process. The fact is that South Africa is not a country which is being decolonised. Thus, that model has limited if any ability to predict the outcome of negotiations in the country.<lb/>
The prospects of revolution or abdication of power, as spectres which have haunted the negotiation process, are rapidly receding. All the major participants in the debate have recently demonstrated their committed support to negotiating a solution which will transform the state and in which its benefits will be shared by all. Only yesterday I attended a conference on economic opportunities in post-apartheid South Africa at which a Minister of the South African Government, a member of the ANC executive committee, a leading South African trade unionist and leaders of the South African business community shared the same platform and expressed remarkably similar views for future developments of the economy.<lb/>
From that significant experience and other personal contacts, I believe that while the final outcome cannot yet be determined the basically Liberal Democrat ideals espoused preclude some of the more extreme outcomes which may have been postulated at the beginning of that journey into the unknown. There are still many gates which need to be opened. However, the stage is in the process of being set so that those can be tackled in a systematic manner in an environment of mutual trust.<lb/>
In conclusion, there is no doubt that the road ahead in South Africa is complex. However, I am confident that with the joint resolve of all political groupings,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0184"/>
<col>289</col>
the strong existing infrastructure and, it is hoped, the support of the international community a non-racial, democratic South Africa can soon be achieved. To that end, I wholeheartedly support the approach taken by Her Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03127"><member>Lord Belhaven and Stenton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, will forgive me if I do not follow him on South Africa. Over the past hour or so no noble Lord seems to have followed another on anything at all. I intend to confine my remarks this evening to a brief account of my impressions of the situation in Poland, a country with which I am connected by marriage and for which I have always had the greatest admiration and affection.<lb/>
Before I say anything further, I must congratulate my noble friend Lady Cox. She is not present this evening but I told her that I would be saying this. She has been awarded the Commander Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. She has richly deserved that honour, which I gather is the highest Polish honour given to foreigners. I believe that the whole House should be very proud of her. My noble friend has told your Lordships on many occasions of the very serious economic, social and environmental problems which Poland has inherited from the foreign-imposed communist regime. I underline and agree with everything that she has said. However, this evening I shall give your Lordships a quick look on the brighter side&#x2014;and there is a brighter side.<lb/>
I spent the whole of August 1989 in Poland and was there on the great day when Mr. Mazowiecki became Prime Minister, ending 50 years of foreign rule and foreign-imposed government. The occasion was not marked, as in most former communist countries, by mass disorders and demonstrations. Indeed, to all outward appearances, nothing much had happened. It was a year later, last August, when after a year's absence I was able to observe the quite remarkable consequences of that day.<lb/>
At this late hour I shall give your Lordships only a few instances of the markers of change from oppression to liberty. Many problems remain but the air of liberty in Poland today is like champagne. The country has been denied that for a long time but has never forgotten it.<lb/>
What are the signs of change? The food queues have vanished, but on the other hand, food is very expensive, and prohibitively so for some. However, it means that people have more time for constructive activities instead of standing in queues for half a day at a time. New businesses and shops are opening everywhere and even the decrepit old state shops must work for a living as otherwise they will close down, and many of them already have. They will certainly not be lamented.<lb/>
Old attitudes have died, such as the saying which used to be addressed to the communist authorities: "You pretend to pay us and we pretend to work for you". Some of the more obnoxious activities of the Nova Huta steel complex near Krakow, where I spent
<col>290</col>
most of my time this year, have been closed down. In Krakow one can now see the sky in that beautiful city and breathe the air. Scaffolding round buildings which has been in place for more years than many people can remember now has workmen on it and the task of restoring the city to its former glory has started. The building of houses is going on everywhere, in both the city and the country areas. The airport building is being greatly enlarged, which is certainly needed.<lb/>
I wish to make the point that Poland is now a country worth investing in. Private enterprise is already moving in from the West to reinforce the enterprise of the Polish people. To my mind that is far more important than government handouts and aid, which are so often misapplied.<lb/>
If aid is given I make one suggestion. The telephone system in Poland continues to be quite awful. Speedy modernisation is vital and cannot be done quickly enough. The need is pressing. Businesses in this country and elsewhere cannot communicate with their opposite numbers and colleagues in Poland by telephone unless they are prepared to take half a day over it. In short, I would make telecommunications the number one priority in the present situation.<lb/>
I should like once more to raise a point which I raised with Her Majesty's Government on previous occasions and which was also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter. He made today a quite outstanding speech on Poland. I should like briefly from these Benches to say that I agree with every word. Perhaps Her Majesty's Government will appreciate that agreement does not come simply from the Liberal Democrat Benches; it also comes from me.<lb/>
The Iron Curtain has gone. It is easy for us to travel to Poland, and Poles are given passports and allowed to leave if they wish. The question now arises where they can go. The queues may have disappeared from the shops but my information is that they have not disappeared from the British Consulate or from the other West European consulates. East Germans can now come to Britain at will as EC citizens. Visas have been abolished in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but I find difficulty even in arranging for my wife's relatives to visit Britain due to the present unacceptable visa situation.<lb/>
I understand that at a meeting between Chancellor Kohl and Mr. Mazowiecki last week it was agreed to abolish visas between Germany and Poland by Christmas. That is a wonderful advance for two countries whose histories have hardly been marked by mutual affection. If they can do it, surely we can. In concluding that point I underline what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter. Nothing does more damage to our relations with Poland than the present policy of Her Majesty's Government on visas. That is certainly my experience, and I spend much time with Polish people.<lb/>
I have not mentioned the crisis in the Persian Gulf. I am sure that Her Majesty's Government are aware of the cost of sanctions to Poland and to the other newly liberated countries in East and Central Europe. It is all very well to say that it is better to go on with
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0185"/>
<col>291</col>
these embargoes and sanctions than to make war. No one can foresee how all this will end, but an indefinite continuation of the present phoney war situation may in the end produce more suffering than war itself.<lb/>
That is all I feel I should say about the matter. I trust that Her Majesty's Government will be aware of the cost to those countries like Poland which have loyally supported the policy of the United Nations, and that all possible help and understanding will be given to them while the situation lasts.</membercontribution></p>

It was due to a long-standing appointment at the Home Office. I was fortunate enough to hear the two maiden speeches, and I add my congratulations and felicitations to both speakers.<lb/>
Last year during the debate on the gracious Speech I drew attention to the appalling situation in the Sudan, particularly as it affected the substantial and heavily persecuted Christian minority in that country. I wish that I could now tell the House that it has improved; unfortunately it is as bad as ever. Crop failure, famine and starvation are rife, at the same time as reports are received that Al-Bashir is sending food to other countries including Iraq. We receive continuing reports of child slavery, and the situation is a disgrace. Christian-led rebels in the south continue to fight against the imposition of Islamic rule by Al-Bashir, who is one of the few remaining supporters of Saddam Hussein.<lb/>
Last year I regretted the absence of contributions from the Bishops' Bench over the plight of the Sudanese Christians. It is true that after the debate one right reverend Prelate wrote to me sharing my concern and offering to take part in any future debate on the subject. Again this year I have to report that there has been a negative return from the right reverend Prelates on the subject of the Sudanese Christians. I am sure that it would give heart to their Christian brothers and sisters in the Sudan if the Bishops' Bench made a concerted effort to ventilate and publicise the appalling human tragedy unfolding in that country.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester said that he hoped people did not regard remarks from that Bench as an apologia. He added some Latin tag which I could not even begin to try to understand. Speaking for myself I certainly welcome contributions from the Bishops' Bench on all aspects of persecuted minorities abroad.<lb/>
It is not only the Sudan in this part of Africa that is concerned; the whole Horn of East Africa is in turmoil, with fighting in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. The whole ghastly scene is overlaid by the continued failure of the rains and the consequent spectre of suffering and famine on an almost inconceivable scale. These dreadful affairs should be the concern of each and every one of us, doing what we can to focus attention on the problems and urging
<col>292</col>
those in authority to do what they can to expedite solutions and provide relief to the suffering through the established agencies.<lb/>
The gracious Speech refers to continued efforts to secure the release of all Britons held hostage or detained in the Middle East. While fully recognising the plight of these innocent people and the anguish suffered by their relatives and friends, surely we should be louder in our condemnation of the groups who use this diabolical way of drawing attention to themselves. What sort of people are they, we must ask, who are prepared to subject so many innocent people to this form of mental torture for their own ends.<lb/>
The gracious Speech naturally makes reference to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The newspapers and television have been full of the preparations which the forces sent to the Gulf have made in case chemical warfare should be used against them, including the difficulties of wearing protective equipment in the intense heat and carrying out practice drills while it is worn. It is estimated that the protective clothing can reduce the efficiency of infantrymen by between 30 per cent. and 80 per cent.<lb/>
These are not overelaborate or unnecessary precautions. Unfortunately, the threat of chemical warfare is only too real. With their new research and development centre 25 miles outside Baghdad and a new manufacturing plant in Samarra, the Iraqis have the capacity to produce possibly as many as 3,000 tonnes of chemical warfare agents each year. It is not a hypothetical threat. Chemical weaponry has been used by Iraq against its own Kurdish people with appalling effects, as has already been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. An estimated 5,000 Kurds were killed and another 10,000 injured when Iraq attacked with nerve and mustard gas. The horror of Halabja has been well documented. It was by no means an isolated incident but part of a systematic and ruthless attack on the Kurdish people. The forces in the Gulf are right, therefore, to be wary of a similar attack by Iraq on themselves in the event of an outbreak of hostilities.<lb/>
We are all concerned about possible chemical warfare in the Gulf, particularly the service men and women who are there and those near and dear to them. Let us consider for a moment how much greater the worries and anxieties would be if our forces faced the threat of nuclear warfare with Iraq. If that were so it would be easy to imagine a real doomsday situation with almost unimaginable consequences.<lb/>
Why are the forces in the Gulf not faced with this nuclear threat? It is because on 7th June 1981 the Israeli air force attacked Iraq's nuclear facility at Osirak to pre-empt the development of a nuclear weapons capability. When people are reminded of that they say, "Thank goodness the Israelis had the foresight to remove the threat all those years ago, or at least set back its development".<lb/>
Yet how did the international community react at the time? No words were too strong to condemn Israel for its action. On 19th June 1981 the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 487, which, among
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0186"/>
<col>293</col>
other things, strongly condemned the military attack by Israel and called for appropriate redress to Iraq for the destruction it had suffered. Moreover, on 13th November the General Assembly passed a similar resolution, Resolution 36/27, by 109 votes to two with 34 abstentions. That resolution also condemned Israeli threats to repeat such attacks on nuclear installations if and when it was deemed necessary.<lb/>
When one looks at the continuing build-up of military might in the Gulf which is considered necessary for possible conflict with Iraq and then considers that Iraq is only one of several countries which have threatened Israel's continued existence, it is very understandable that Israel has to take a robust attitude in looking after itself.<lb/>
Last year during the gracious Speech debate I remarked on the enormous concentration on the affairs of Israel, mentioning that Israel, a country the size of Wales, with a population of 5 million, attracts a quite inordinate amount of attention. I should like briefly to return to the theme again this year. When children first come across telescopes they soon discover that, while they magnify objects, if they are reversed things correspondingly diminish in size. I sometimes think that the world looks at Israel through a telescope and then turns it round to look at the rest of the world. Let me give an example. It must have been obvious to the Iraqis that the best way to ease the pressure on themselves would be for some well-publicised event to occur in Israel. Hence I believe that the allegations made by the Israelis about the Temple Mount trouble being plotted and planned are true. Certainly in terms of the world publicity that this incident received the plot was highly successful.<lb/>
While all loss of life is to be deplored, let us contrast the Temple Mount publicity with current events in India. I shall weary your Lordships for a moment with a quotation from the <i>Observer.</i> Last Sunday week Peter Hillmore wrote a long article from Delhi about the problems there under the headlines:
<quote>"India's 'hour of peril' ends in days of slaughter".</quote>
A week later, last Sunday, he wrote another article from Delhi. I wish briefly to quote a paragraph towards the end:
<quote>"Over the past three days, as it happens, there have been fewer violent deaths than usual in India. A mere 20 people died in communal violence between Muslims and Hindus. Only a dozen were killed in fights in Kashmir between troops and separatists, and 25 in similar clashes in the Punjab.</quote>
<quote>Just seven people were killed in Amritsar when armed men opened fire on a coach, and only a few members of the Assam Liberation Front died in a shoot-out".</quote>
He goes on to say:
<quote>"Only four students set themselves on fire &#x2026; In Ranchi, arrests of rioters remained static at 779.</quote>
<quote>All in all, a relatively peaceful time in a troubled country".</quote>
Can your Lordships imagine what would happen if the deaths described there had taken place in Israel? There would have been hostile Early Day Motions put down in another place collecting signatures. There would have been calls for a special meeting of the Security Council; and the various delegations would have been
<col>294</col>
lobbied as to whether they would support further heavy expressions against Israel. We have to consider very seriously how to get this matter into proportion.<lb/>
People are suffering all over the world. We have mentioned the problems of India, the Kurds and the Sudanese. We need to have a much greater awareness and effort in solving all these problems. In particular, the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, said that at the moment there is some cynicism that our great concern about the Gulf and Kuwait is oil. Only by showing a great concern for all the peoples of the world who are suffering in various ways can we counter that in the minds of other people in the world. If we do that we can actually begin to move towards the new world order of which the noble Lord, Lord Pym, gave us a glimpse in his most interesting speech.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03130">9.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03131"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too wish to congratulate my two noble friends on their quite outstanding maiden speeches. Although he is not in his place, I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, on a superb speech on Northern Ireland. I shall return to that shortly.<lb/>
When speaking about the current Middle East problems, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester wondered, if I interpreted him correctly, if there was any way in which a lifeline could be thrown to Saddam Hussein to allow him to pull out of Kuwait without totally losing face, in order to avoid the terrible casualties among both Western and Arab powers that war in the Gulf would entail.<lb/>
Every civilized person must surely agree that a brutal burglar who breaks into a house, shoots the householder and one or more of his sons, rapes his wife and one or more of his daughters, steals every single item in the house, not only the furniture, carpets, silver and pictures, but also the fixtures and fittings, and then smashes up the house having meanwhile taken passers-by hostage, should not be allowed to keep even one tenth of 1 per cent. of his loot. Furthermore, he must be made to pay restitution in full. But, having said that, the West in general and the United States in particular has a very exposed Achilles heel so far as concerns morality in a Middle Eastern context.<lb/>
The existing situation in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and other occupied territories cannot be tolerated indefinitely. I am not simply talking about the shooting of large numbers of demonstrators and stone throwers, many of them young people. These incidents are appalling but they are, sad to say, rather less than par for the course in a Near Eastern context. We must remember that the Syrians can get away with shooting 10 or 20 times as many people with virtually no response from the Western media or the public. As I understand it, following the Syrian incursion into East Beirut last month, somewhere between 100 and 200 Christian prisoners of war were murdered in cold blood without any Western response to speak of. One can imagine how the balloon would go up in the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0187"/>
<col>295</col>
unlikely event of the Israelis shooting 150 or so Moslem prisoners of war in cold blood. One would never hear the end of it.<lb/>
No, my Lords, it is the fact of the occupation itself of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and other occupied territories, more than 23 years after the end of the Six Day War, that must be rectified for the sake of the Near East, the Middle East and not least, as the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, pointed out, for the sake of the Israelis themselves.<lb/>
The question of East Jerusalem is the hardest nut to crack. But surely even here some compromise could be found. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Moslem holy places and, if need be, the Christian holy places could come under United Nations protection and possibly even United Nations jurisdiction. I do not know about East Jerusalem&#x2014;attitudes here may be different&#x2014;but happily it appears from a news report in the <i>Financial Times</i> on Saturday that no less than 63 per cent. of the Israeli population also feel that they must get out of the Occupied Territories for the sake of peace. That being the case, the United States really must use its financial muscle to put pressure on the more intransigent people of Israel to follow the desires of their more moderate fellow countrymen in this regard while paying all due attention to Israeli security.<lb/>
There is no need or even desirability to wait for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait. If some movement on the Palestinian question were initiated as soon as possible, it would then be possible for Saddam Hussein to pull totally out of Kuwait and pay massive compensation while being able to boast that his invasion was the catalyst for the solution of this long-running sore. It would certainly be extremely irritating but it would be a price worth paying if it avoided tens of thousands of casualties on all sides and solved the Palestine problem into the bargain.<lb/>
I turn briefly to what those who presumably failed their geography 0-levels call Europe and what the rest of us call the EEC, or the EC if one absolutely must, although one notices that the French still officially refer to the CEE. We shall debate one important aspect of this subject next week and so in view of the hour I shall cut short what I proposed to say on this subject.<lb/>
I should like to refute the disgraceful slurs being made on the Government in general and on the Prime Minister in particular, to wit that her position is extreme and that the Continental countries in contrast are taking what might be described as the middle way. That is the precise opposite of the truth. It is Britain which is promoting free trade by scrupulously lowering all barriers against foreign and, in particular, EC competition, while at the same time resisting Utopian extremism. All Utopianism is by definition extreme, in that it takes no account of human nature, history or traditions. In contrast, there are all too many on the Continent who veer to one or other extreme position; that is, either cynicism and grasping materialism &#x2014;avoiding or ignoring entirely directives designed to ensure freedom of trade&#x2014;on the one hand
<col>296</col>
or quasi-religious mystic idealism on the other. I should like to develop this theme more fully next week. Therefore, I shall leave the matter there for the time being.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to touch upon the election of Mrs. Mary Robinson as President of the Irish Republic. This was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, in his splendid speech. Mrs. Robinson tends to be described in the British media as that very rare bird in the island of Ireland&#x2014;a genuine Liberal&#x2014;and as an advocate of women's rights. Indeed, she is both. But, as the noble Lord pointed out, she is also noteworthy for having resigned from the Irish Labour Party in protest against support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which she opposed, and still opposes, as being heavily biased against the unionists in the North. I emphasise the fact that I use the word "unionists" with a lower case letter "u". In her opposition she shows a much more acute intelligence and a much greater sense of fairness than the vast majority of Irish and British politicians. It is not only a question of morality or fairness; it is also a question of common sense.<lb/>
There is a school of thought which suspects that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was a Machiavellian plot by those members of the British establishment, who are both numerous and to be found in all parties and not merely in those on the Left, whose instinctive loyalties are not to the United Kingdom as a whole within its present boundaries, but only to part of the United Kingdom. According to that interpretation, the alienation of the majority community in Ulster was actually an intended by-product of the agreement in the expectation that the more the unionists came to distrust and despise Westminster and Whitehall the more ready they would be to fall into the arms of Dublin as the lesser of two evils, thereby ridding mainland Britain of a long-standing problem.<lb/>
There is another school of thought which believes that such Machiavellian scheming was unlikely, maintaining instead that once again the wily, subtle, glib and silver-tongued Celts had outwitted the plodding, slow-thinking, confused and guilt-ridden Saxons. Whichever interpretation is right, the fact is that alienation of the majority community is unlikely in the extreme to result in a peaceful, happy and united Ireland. Indeed, some bid for independence is a far more likely outcome, with all the dangers and uncertainties that this would produce. Moreover, alienation of the majority provokes a sullen reaction among that majority, which in turn weakens mainland Britain's already wilting will&#x2014;a vicious circle&#x2014;all of which plays right into the hands of the IRA. The cowardly murder of Ian Gow can only be explained by his high profile opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the IRA feeling that any success on his part might weaken its position.<lb/>
The IRA is also assisted by other well-intentioned misunderstandings. Of course the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland means well. He has an enormous amount on his plate. None of us envies him or wishes to be in his shoes. Nevertheless, surely it was a terrible mistake to announce publicly on 9th November, first,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0188"/>
<col>297</col>
that Britain has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland&#x2014;a rash thing to say with the world in its present turbulent and uncertain state; secondly, that Britain fully respected the desire for a united and sovereign Ireland&#x2014;implying that the moment that 50.0001 per cent. of the population of the Province voted for unification, Britain would be out of there like a shot; and, thirdly, that Britain's role in Northern Ireland was,
<quote>"to ensure democratic debate and free democratic choice".</quote>
That is certainly one of Britain's roles; there is no doubting that fact. However, a more important role is to defend the integrity of the United Kingdom against subversion, sabotage, murder and torture. It gives me no pleasure to say this, but for the Secretary of State to talk in such terms frankly risks giving the IRA the impression that it requires only two or three major
atrocities on its part for Britain's nerve finally to fail completely.<lb/>
Let me conclude by saying, "Well done, Mrs. Robinson. Let us hope that you can advance the cause of peace in your island by persuading your compatriots to agree to delete the offending Articles 2 and 3 from your country's constitution. If that is too much to hope for, let us at least hope that your wise and perceptive views on the Anglo-Irish Agreement percolate through to minds that are currently firmly closed".</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03133"><member>Lord Ashbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was delighted to hear in the gracious Speech that Her Majesty's Government,
<quote>"will work with the utmost determination &#x2026; for the unconditional implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which require the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, and the restoration of the independence and legitimate government of Kuwait."</quote>
Is it not reassuring to note that while Her Majesty's Government have not lost their political will to repulse the armies of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq from Kuwait other members of the alliance appear to be weakening? President Saddam Hussein's best hope for avoiding a direct military confrontation with the West has been to play for time. Central to his invasion strategy lies the assumption that whatever the strength of the West's response, by the time it comes to act some governments will have lost interest or heart, or both. Certainly there has been more than enough evidence to give President Saddam Hussein every encouragement that his ruthless gamble may yet pay a dividend. With the campaign only just entering its third month, there have been frequent reports of waning morale among US troops on the ground, no doubt a reaction to the barracking that President Bush received during his mid-term election campaign from redneck Vietnam war veterans chanting, "No blood for oil."<lb/>
The French Government's decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia is now generally regarded as a classic exercise in Gallic opportunism which recently saw the French contingent vacating its front line positions to
<col>298</col>
be replaced by Moroccans. As one western official cynically observed, "They're here to sell arms, not to fight."<lb/>
The fragility of the thread by which hangs the success or failure of Operation Desert Shield was highlighted by the rulers of Saudi Arabia&#x2014;the very people for whom the 300,000-strong force now deployed around Kuwait was constructed to defend. If charges of appeasement have been levelled against the right honourable Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup for gaining the freedom of 40 elderly or infirm hostages from Baghdad, it is small wonder that comments attributed to King Fahd and his brother, Prince Sultan, the Defence Minister, prompted disbelief among the western diplomatic corps in Riyadh. Within hours of King Fahd and Prince Sultan making appeals to President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait and avert bloodshed, senior diplomats were racing to Jeddah to see King Fahd and seek clarification. It was not so much the content as the style of the comments which caused alarm.<lb/>
The tone of King Fahd's speech was decidedly conciliatory. Suddenly Saddam was King Fahd's "brother", the invasion nothing more than a blunder, and the Saudi monarch conveyed the singular impression that everything could be sorted out amicably if only Saddam would show a little more understanding.<lb/>
Over the past few weeks there has been much speculation that the Iraqis are constructing a new defensive line along the Kuwait side of the Rumeilah oilfields taking in the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah at the head of the Shatt al Arab. The invasion of Kuwait followed the failure of negotiations to resolve Iraq's claim to the territory. One possibility now mooted is that Iraq might stage a partial withdrawal to the Rumeilah line to avert confrontation. All these expressions of doubt and lack of firm resolve should be deeply worrying to the allies and the West needs to ensure that the Saudis do not become the Achilles' heel of the whole enterprise.<lb/>
Last week's visit by James Baker, the US Secretary of State, was no doubt an effort to concentrate Saudi minds on the daunting tasks ahead. That is just as well so far as the men of the 7th Armoured Brigade are concerned. The Camberley and Sandhurst manuals are, I am reliably informed by my military friends, rather vague on the question of how an army withdraws without ever having advanced.<lb/>
Finally, I have a question for the noble Earl who will reply for the Government. In view of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, do the Government still intend to proceed with the far-reaching defence cuts announced by the Secretary of State for Defence on 25th July? If the noble Earl, Lord Arran, would be so kind as to answer, I should be greatly in his debt.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03135"><member>Lord Gifford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may express my regrets that I was not here during the afternoon because of professional commitments and particularly because I missed the two maiden speeches. The year 1990 has been historic, pregnant with the possibilities
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0189"/>
<col>299</col>
for a better world. To see Nelson Mandela walk free in February this year has lifted the spirits of people of all colours in all continents. While there are still many obstacles to a non-racial democracy in South Africa, I believe the process of change initiated by President de Klerk to be an irreversible and intensely hopeful development. In Europe, new democracies have been born and the cold war is effectively over. These events were hardly dreamt of 10 years ago.<lb/>
However, all those possibilities and exciting developments are today overshadowed by the clouds of war, for if the crisis in the Gulf were to be resolved by war, the consequences would be so unspeakable for the whole world that it is the duty of every one of us to analyse with care whether such a war is necessary and morally justifiable.<lb/>
The consequences of war are clearly foreseeable, given the scale of weaponry on both sides: massive military casualties for all forces involved in the hideous conditions of desert warfare; terrible loss of life and suffering for the Iraqi people, including those many Iraqi people who are bitterly opposed to Saddam Hussein; an environmental catastrophe for the Middle East, as King Hussein has accurately predicted; a rise in oil prices so steep as seriously to injure every economy in the world, especially the economies of the third world, whose people are already facing destitution because of the debt crisis and the unequal terms of trade about which my noble friend Lord Pitt spoke so eloquently. Yet President Bush and our Prime Minister in particular are seriously preparing to unleash those consequences on the world, not in the contingency of an attack upon Saudi Arabia, which was the original and proper purpose of sending troops, but as an act of deliberate policy to restore the sovereignty of Kuwait and to remove a tyrannical ruler.<lb/>
Let us examine this. Certainly, Saddam Hussein is a ruthless dictator. A ruler who has crushed all democratic opposition over years and who has used the horror of chemical weapons on the Kurdish people deserves only the condemnation and isolation which he should have received long before the invasion of Kuwait. But the world can find and has to find ways of dealing with ruthless dictators other than by unleashing war upon them. After all, dozens of ruthless dictators have risen and fallen in recent history; they have been removed from power by a combination of internal resistance by their people and external non-violent pressures. In the past 20 years we have seen the passing in Europe of Franco, Caetano, Papadopoulos and Ceausescu; on the American continent of Somoza, Duvalier and Pinochet; in Africa of Amin and Bokassa; and in Asia of Marcos and the Shah of Iran, to name but some. All of them have gone, as Saddam Hussein will go, without being threatened with war by the major powers.<lb/>
Certainly Iraq has violated the United Nations Charter in a flagrant manner. However, even in such cases the world has been able to respond effectively without going to war, even if the alternatives to war are slower to take effect. The illegal rebellion of
<col>300</col>
Rhodesia was ended by a combination of internal resistance and external sanctions, even though in that case United Nations sanctions were massively breached. The invasion of Czechoslovakia has now been reversed, again by patient, long-suffering resistance by the Czechoslovak people. On the other side of the coin, the only modern instance of a superpower launching a major war to achieve its policies, the intervention in Vietnam, was so disastrous, causing such misery and devastation that it stands as a horrifying warning of what can happen if warmongering policies prevail.<lb/>
I believe that our people are being misled by a barrage of rhetoric and jingoism into believing that a war in the Gulf could be a glamorous, glorious, even desirable way of dealing with Saddam Hussein. A recent opinion poll in the <i>Observer</i> of 28th October revealed that, while 62 per cent. of our people would like to see military action against Iraq within a year, the overwhelming majority does not wish this to result in injuries or deaths to British troops. That means that people are living in Cloud-cuckoo-land. They believe that this war can be won as if it were a television drama. We must find alternatives before the casualties, before the bereavements, before the incalculable suffering that a war can bring.<lb/>
If a war is started on the terms now being declared by Her Majesty's Government&#x2014;war within weeks if Saddam Hussein has not capitulated&#x2014;I shall not support it. I shall oppose it with all my strength. I hope that organisations which think as I do will mobilise before it is too late, as they are doing in the United States.<lb/>
What are the alternatives? The means to achieve our stated objectives without recourse to war lie ready to hand, although they are more difficult and they all take time and patience. First, the closest attention should be paid to the views of the Arab states. They have to take the worst of the brunt of any war. They have to live with Iraq. They are concerned with all the injustices of their region, including the atrocities committed against the Palestinian people. Judging by the West's response to King Hussein's peace-making efforts, the Arab states are receiving scant attention and respect.<lb/>
Secondly, we have the unique opportunity of a common Western and Soviet effort to solve the crisis in collaboration. The patient efforts of President Gorbachev and his envoys stand in stark contrast to the sabre-rattling of President Bush. One might make the same contrast between the statesmanlike pronouncements of President Mitterrand and the bullishness of our Prime Minister. Let us give a chance for East and West to work together before the prospects of peace are swallowed up by war.<lb/>
Thirdly, we must use to the full the present unanimity of the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council has ordered sanctions and the use of force but only to enforce sanctions. It has not agreed a counter-offensive to recapture Kuwait or to topple Saddam Hussein. It may well be that it will not agree to such a counter-offensive. Without such an agreement any such counter-offensive itself would be
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0190"/>
<col>301</col>
a breach of international law. It would not be justified under Article 51. It would have nothing to do with a defence of Saudi Arabia against aggression. That objective, if it were at risk, has been successfully achieved. It is neither legal nor moral to punish one act of aggression by another more devastating act of aggression. The world must find other ways than war to remedy this wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03136">9.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03137"><member>Lord Weidenfeld</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two flying hours away from where American and British troops are stationed in the Gulf an ancient king, Croesus of Lydia, 2,500 years ago stood poised for battle and, hesitant, consulted the oracle, which told him, "If you cross the River Halys, you will destroy a mighty empire". He crossed, fought and destroyed an empire&#x2014;his own. He had hesitated too long.<lb/>
The mighty empire now at stake is not the tangible expanse of this country or the United States but the intangible realm of moral credibility and the validity of law. If Saddam Hussein were to be allowed to stay in power unscathed with even marginal rewards and in possession of his chemical, bacteriological and nuclear potential, he would emerge as victor and leader of a contagious revolt from one end to the other of the whole Arab world. No crown or sceptre, no presidential seal in moderate Moslem countries would remain safe.<lb/>
But worse still, signals would go out to adventurous regimes throughout the world to the effect that violent change, subversion and aggression, given sly timing and tactics and terrorist accompaniment, can inevitably prevail over United Nations resolutions, world public opinion and grand alliances.<lb/>
So far, President Bush has stood firm and the Prime Minister has probably come out more forcefully than anyone else with the triple objective of restoring the <i>status quo</i> in Kuwait, reparations and the punishment of war crimes. She has also more explicitly than anyone else insisted on removing the threat to the region from Iraq's unconventional armoury. But, as noble Lords have put it forcefully before, the grand alliance presents dangerous fissures and disturbing side effects.<lb/>
Syria has lunged at Lebanon and probably destroyed the political identity of the Maronite Christians. France may have sent men, ships and arms, but also confusing messages, with whiffs of compromise and appeasement. The Russians have raised hopes, so far quite unsubstantiated, of a political solution. The guild of elder statesmen has sent its emissaries to trade hostages with hints of concession. All that only destabilises those most immediately involved, the anxious Saudis, the emirates and Egypt.<lb/>
It is the aftermath of the crisis which vexes decision-makers. President Bush has rightly talked of the need to chart a regional new order of economic stability, military security, fair government and lasting peace. So has Saddam Hussein. Two nights ago the
<col>302</col>
Iraqi dictator used mellifluous words and propounded seemingly equitable solutions, but his new order in the Middle East means Iraqi domination.<lb/>
So far, Iraq has scored in the propaganda war among the Arab masses, American isolationists and European faint hearts. He caught a raw nerve among those who see the issue as the price of oil, or link Kuwait with the unresolved grievances of the Palestinians. But whereas Lebanese Christians and Kurds are only rarely mentioned for fear of Syrian groans, Iranian scowls and Turkish scorn, the Palestinian issue is on top of the agenda.<lb/>
Of course the Arab-Israeli conflict is indeed a vital central issue, but only in an ambience of good faith and compassionate comprehension can it be solved. I believe that the United Nations resolution on sending a commission to Jerusalem was lacking in evenhandedness. It failed to condemn the violence that gave rise to what the media now term as the Temple Mount massacre. If the government of Israel showed wariness on its account, you must recall the record of the United Nations and especially the General Assembly on issues involving the Jewish state. An international forum includes Cuba, whose leader we were recently told by a Soviet defector had tried to goad Kruschev into making a pre-emptive strike against the United States at the height of the missile crisis. If Israel is to be judged by China on the question of massacres in public squares, you may perhaps think more benevolently of the Jerusalem government's hesitation.<lb/>
As for Iraq, as the noble Lord, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, reminded us, we would be sitting here a good deal less comfortably had Israel not destroyed the nuclear reactor in 1981. I have just looked at the record, and while I cannot find anything said at the time in your Lordships' House I noticed an exchange in the other place between the honourable Member for Davyhulme, Mr. Winston Churchill, and the then Minister of State, now Foreign Secretary, who roundly condemned the Israeli action, and added that it was a pity that some Israelis continued to use the tragic memories of the Holocaust as justification for breaking international law. Let history judge if Israel's sense of self-defence against terrorism and crude threats to her existence have justified, or at least attenuated, some of its actions.<lb/>
What on a balanced view is clear to me is that Israel must, and will, seek the first opportunity after the crisis to resume the peace process. When that day comes there is a special role for this country and Europe. Britain was the mandatory power for that greater Palestine which now holds Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and Jordan. It is that whole area that has to be pacified and freed from fear. Fear is at the root of the whole of the Arab-Israeli conflict, much more than territory or even military security&#x2014;fear of the future, fear of their neighbours, fear of no future.<lb/>
Europe can present itself as a model of how erstwhile enemies can be turned into friendly neighbours. A master scheme that gives economic stability, military security and the prospect of peace to all the people in the greater Palestinian area should be
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0191"/>
<col>303</col>
devised and propounded by Europe and notably Britain. The Americans are talking of something resembling the Marshall Plan. Europe still lives on the ideas of Jean Monnet, who preached European association during the darkest days of the last great European war.<lb/>
This is the role for Europe in the future. By distancing itself from the notion of a free-standing Palestinian state, which would become a mini-Lebanon and proxy battleground for feuding neighbours, we should aim at the larger regional solution and encourage Palestinian leaders on the ground who are independent of the official PLO leadership, which is so clearly now in Saddam Hussein's camp, to sit down and negotiate with Israel. They can be found.<lb/>
It is a received idea that Palestinian leaders, notables, are wholly and exclusively dependent on the PLO leadership. I have visited that part of the world for 40 years and have been in many Arab houses, known many Arab families&#x2014;families of notables, professional people, businessmen&#x2014;and brave Arab
<col>304</col>
patriots who lost their dependants in wars against Israel. They would sit down and talk but not out of fear of blackmail threats or murder on the part of people who are guided by foreign leaders or leaders living abroad. It would be a very challenging task for this country and for Europe to think in these broader terms of regional solutions and it would do justice to Arabs and Jews. But, first, we must not falter in our resolve to remove the present evil and threat of future terror, turmoil and nuclear war that stems from the Iraqi aggressor.<lb/>
I began my speech by reminding your Lordships of the tragic fate of an ancient king, and perhaps I may in conclusion recall the ringing words of that venerable member of one of the most distinguished upper houses in all history, the Senate of Republican Rome, who said: "Carthage must be destroyed". It would be a very challenging task for this country and for Europe to think in these broader terms of regional solutions and it would do justice to Arabs and Jews. But first, we must not falter in our resolve to remove the present evil and threat of future terror, turmoil and nuclear war that stems from the Iraqi aggressor.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03139"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had a debate which has ranged widely over many parts of the globe&#x2014;Europe, Hong Kong, the Gulf, Northern Ireland and many different places. But at this late hour I propose to return to the very beginning of this debate and speak to your Lordships about Latin America, as I have done on many occasions in the past.<lb/>
Latin America was not mentioned in the gracious Speech; indeed it never is. It was therefore with some surprise, but with a great deal of pleasure, that I listened to my noble friend Lord Caithness and his encouraging comments on this subject. I have had many arguments with him in the past about Latin America, but I am delighted by his recent conversion. Long may it continue.<lb/>
I believe that there are good reasons why this conversion is justified. In a troubled world, about which we have heard a great deal this afternoon, Latin America can be seen as a continent of stability, growth and opportunity. We have heard from a number of speakers today about the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the emergence of democracy. All this has taken place very suddenly. By contrast, in Latin America the demise of autocratic governments, mostly military, over the last decade has been gradual &#x2014;different, of course, in each country but with the same result. Now all the republics of Latin America, except Cuba, are democracies and it is quite possible that that may change in the next few years.<lb/>
Latin America has historically&#x2014;certainly, since the end of World War Two&#x2014;been very closely linked economically and politically to the United States, but is now seeking ties with Europe. In fact, the new democratic leaders are travelling extensively to Europe to promote their cause, which is a very welcome move. I hope that we shall see more of them all the time.<lb/>
If I may turn for a moment to trade and economic matters, the past 15 years have been difficult for Latin America. Indeed a similar difficulty was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, in connection with the Caribbean and Africa, as indeed is the case for most developing countries. The oil crisis of 1973 hit Latin American countries hard. The terms of trade turned against hem. They adapted, but it was not easy.<lb/>
Added to that has been the burden of debt. I would remind your Lordships that debts were contracted by largely autocratic military governments, but with the full support, and indeed encouragement, of the West at a time of excess liquidity. The debt burden, therefore, is something which is a shared responsibility between those who provided it and those who received it. It seems to me that dialogue and understanding are needed in order to resolve the problem. Debt in Latin America has also been a factor in fuelling inflation; something which has been referred to by others and which appears to be endemic in Latin America, but which is now being tackled vigorously by the new democratic governments.<lb/>
<col>306</col>
Let me give your Lordships a few figures about Latin America and why it may seem important. First, the population of Latin America is now approaching 450 million. The gross domestic product is more than &#x00A3;430 billion. The market size in terms of import capacity is larger than south-east Asia, the Indian sub-continent and sub-Saharan Africa combined. Indeed, in economic terms Brazil is more important than what was previously described as Eastern Europe. In those circumstances it is gratifying that the UK is the second largest investor in many countries. Unfortunately, our share of the market in visible trade remains abysmally low, though that is changing gradually and during the past two years trade has begun to pick up.<lb/>
Ten years ago China was all the rage. British exporters and industrialists were encouraged to go there. I am one of the few who did not then make the visit. China turned out to be disappointing. Now the rage is Eastern Europe but the change in state control and in the systems there will be slow and difficult. That is due to the nature of their history. By contrast, Latin America is naturally entrepreneurial. Therefore, the change in economic philosophy which has accompanied the return to democracy has brought with it the opening of markets, the introduction of market forces, the privatisation of cumbersome and inefficient state industries and the dismantling of central planning. All those factors will be readily accepted because of that entrepreneurial nature. Therefore, we in the UK and Europe have much in common with Latin America and I hope that we can profit by that.<lb/>
I congratulate the Government on the appointment of Tristan Garel-Jones as Minister of State with responsibility for Latin America. He is a fluent Spanish speaker and, as far as I am aware, the first such Minister with that talent to be appointed for a long time. He understands the countries and his visits, which I hope will be frequent, will be well received by all concerned. I hope that he will continually repeat them. Sadly, few Cabinet Ministers, and no Prime Minister, have ever visited Latin America. That is surprising when one thinks that we have had the same Prime Minister for 11 years. She has travelled the globe extensively but has not gone to Latin America. Perhaps it is not too late.<lb/>
In Latin America we can see a continent that has changed direction, is developing fast and is seeking closer ties with Europe. Up to now it has been ignored by Her Majesty's Government, but I hope that the new awakening indicated by my noble friend Lord Caithness will prosper and increase in the years to come.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03141"><member>Lord Monkswell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the unenviable task of being tail-end Charlie in the debate. I had hoped that other Members of your Lordships' House would raise the topics about which I wish to speak and that, therefore, I need not speak for too long. Unfortunately, that has not proved to be the case. If I say straightaway that I shall talk about black hats,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0193"/>
<col>307</col>
white hats and blue hats it is probable that your Lordships will become confused and therefore I shall lead up to the subject gradually.<lb/>
Like my noble friend Lord Fitt, one of my problems is that I wish to speak about topics other than foreign affairs and defence because they are all related. In a debate about foreign affairs and defence it is difficult to introduce them but let me see whether I can try.<lb/>
The theme of my contribution is the partiality of this Government. Perhaps I may say as a small aside that this has been a very interesting and rewarding debate for everyone who has taken part in it. However, it becomes even more significant than we thought it would be at the beginning of the afternoon because of events in the other place and the possibility of significant change in the Government. If that should take place, one hopes that a reconstituted Conservative Government might take rather more notice of what has been said in your Lordships' House not only today but on preceding days and what is to be said tomorrow. Therefore, it is quite an interesting time at which to speak.<lb/>
The partiality of this Government and their ability to create a climate which is most unhelpful and in some cases positively anti-social is the theme that I wish to talk about this evening. I want to talk about personal relationships, community, regional and international relations. I hope that I shall not take too long in doing so.<lb/>
It may be wise at this time of night to start at the end and work back, but perhaps I may try to build my theme. One item in the Queen's Speech is the introduction of legislation to require errant parents to pay maintenance for their children. While I accept that the payment of maintenance causes a great deal of difficulty&#x2014;for example, judging how much to pay, when to pay it, when to increase it and whose responsibility maintenance is and so on&#x2014;placing emphasis on introducing legislation on the subject distorts the way in which we should look at the problems of marriage break-up, divorce and the results of those problems.<lb/>
I had hoped that the welfare of the family and children would be uppermost in all our minds and not just as regards what appears to be uppermost in the Government's mind&#x2014;namely, saving money and penalising people. That is what I have to say on personal relationships as regards my partiality theme.<lb/>
Perhaps I may now talk about community relations and look at Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has already been mentioned today. I was interested in the subject and looked at the statement of the Government's security policy in Northern Ireland. On the first page, paragraph 2(c) states:
<quote>"to defend the democratically expressed wishes of the people of Northern Ireland against those who try to promote political objectives, including a change in the status of Northern Ireland, by violence or the threat of violence".</quote>
We can agree with some of the phrases in that paragraph but unfortunately two of them seem to introduce an element of partiality into the security
<col>308</col>
policy in Northern Ireland. My understanding is that both Protestants and Catholics are murdered by people on both sides of the divide. In fact there is a law on the statute book which prevents one side of the political debate being heard on radio and television but not the other side. That introduces an unfortunate note of partiality which I do not believe helps.<lb/>
If one looks at regional relationships, there is the whole problem of the North-South divide. The other day I heard that a very senior industrialist not very far from the highest echelons in contact with the Government has forecast that the recession into which we are entering will be worse than that which we experienced in 1980 and 1981. In that recession we lost around one-third of our manufacturing industry. It decimated the Midlands, the North West, the North East of England and large parts of industrial Scotland. One of the results of that recession was rioting on the streets of Liverpool and Manchester. We need to be aware that we are heading into that kind of territory again. It stems from the partiality of this Government. They appear to be quite happy to see the further erosion of our manufacturing industry.<lb/>
Perhaps I may now touch on the international relationships and demonstrate the partiality which occurs there. I turn first to Europe, about which there has been much talk. It seems to be a favourite theme in the other place. I feel that the problem is that the Government are looking at Europe from the point of view of national advantage&#x2014;our advantage&#x2014;rather than in terms of the people of the European Continent coming together and working to benefit each other. The theme of seeking partial advantage does not help this country or its people.<lb/>
Finally, I turn to the Gulf, and here I introduce the concept of white, blue and black hats. The partiality of this Government suggests that the problem in the Gulf crisis is black and white. Saddam Hussein is black; the Americans and Brits are white; we will go in there and sort the problem out by military means. That unfortunately seems to be the only option the Prime Minister can think of.<lb/>
The other problem that exists is that we are advised that the military action will occur under the aegis of the United Nations; we shall be part of the United Nations force. But that does not appear to be the case. Effectively we have a force in Saudi Arabia under American control; our troops and land forces are subject to American military command. The ultimate political command is in the hands of the President of the United States. In an action which is purported to be the upholding of international law, one hopes impartially, for the conflict to be effectively between one state and another is not constructive.<lb/>
We seem to be very good at handing out advice to everyone but ourselves. Various people who were not members of the Republic of Ireland offered advice to the Irish Government; we heard people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause offering advice to the Israeli Government and people who are sympathetic to the Israeli Government offering advice to the Palestinians. I shall follow in the footsteps of those before me and offer some advice to the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0194"/>
<col>309</col>
American people. They should place their armed forces under the control of the United Nations. By that I mean that the political control should effectively be surrendered or given to Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations, subject to the actions, advice and orders, if I can put it that way, of the Security Council and the General Assembly.<lb/>
That suggestion has already been laughed at. It is reasonable to laugh because it is laughable to think that the President of the United States would place 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of the armed forces of the United States under the control of an international body. That is not going to happen.<lb/>
However, the fact that it is not going to happen demonstrates the partiality of what is going on. What we are seeing is a conflict not between Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world but between Iraq and the United States. When one looks at it from that perspective the situation is very unsatisfactory. That is not what the Government are explaining to us. That is why I entered this debate&#x2014;to demonstrate the partiality of this Government and to suggest that we need a little more impartiality from them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03142">10.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03143"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is hard to wind up a debate consisting of interesting and well-informed speeches on entirely disparate subjects. Today we have had speeches on Latin America, Cambodia, Poland, South Africa, the Sudan, Israel, development aid, Northern Ireland, the Commonwealth, terms of trade and, of course, Europe and the Gulf. We also had a truly memorable speech on Hong Kong. We had a speech on personal relations, social relations, community relations and international relations; and also on white hats, black hats and blue hats.<lb/>
There has been little discussion on the defence of Europe There was a time in such debates when one-third or one-half of the speeches would be on that subject. For obvious reasons that has not been the case today&#x2014;the most obvious reason being that quite quickly the threat of war in Europe has become extremely remote and the threat of war in the Gulf has become extremely acute. The only speech substantially on defence in Europe was that of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver. Once again, I should like to associate my noble friends and myself with a great deal of what he said about the future of NATO. He envisaged a treaty relationship between, on the one hand, the United States and Canada and, on the other, a European defence community. It may be that such a European defence community would be different from but parallel to the European Community and might grow out of a reformed Western European Union.<lb/>
I do not want to anticipate the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, but so far we have had no partisan attack&#x2014;indeed no attack of any kind&#x2014;on the defence policy of the Government, though there are differences and perhaps on some other occasion we may explain them and press them. In general, another reason why in this debate there has been less discussion on European defence is undoubtedly
<col>310</col>
because, by and large and for one reason and another, the big issues between the parties have become much less sharp. The issues of unilateralism, forward defence and flexible response have become much less sharp than hitherto.<lb/>
Indeed, if we look back at the long perspective of inter-party discussion on defence policy we see that the outstanding feature has been not disagreement between the parties but agreement on the fundamentals of support for NATO and containing the Soviet Union. In that sense we can all congratulate ourselves. Broadly speaking, we have all been right and have been proved spectacularly successful,
There has been a great deal of consensus today on the Gulf crisis. Certainly my noble friends and I wish to make clear, like others in all parts of the House, that we view the annexation of Kuwait as an outrage which cannot in any circumstances be allowed to continue. We welcome the dispatch of British troops and pledge our support to them. We join with noble Lords in all parts of the House in calling for a rigorous and, if necessary, a protracted use of sanctions at this time. There may come a time when sanctions begin to impose severe hardship on the Iraqi people and particularly on Iraqi women and children. However, there may also come a time when we have to remind ourselves that sanctions are a merciful alternative to war. That must be borne in mind at all times when trying to get a peaceful solution to this crisis.<lb/>
My party will also not support military action unless and until the possibilities of sanctions have been tested to the limit. We also require military action to have very wide international support and a new resolution from the Security Council. I speak frankly on this point at the cost of causing some controversy. Doubts and differences must arise. There has been extraordinarily wide and confident international support for the Security Council resolutions. Everyone has said that. There are many countries which have deployed forces in the Gulf which would no doubt take part in military action to resist further Iraqi aggression. But how many of these countries would be willing to take part in a counter-offensive to liberate Kuwait? We have to ask ourselves that question.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, referred to visits made by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Baker, to the relevant countries. But there is no evidence that he achieved successful results in trying to persuade those countries to undertake to participate in a counter-offensive. I notice that the noble Earl made no reference to the results that Mr. Baker achieved. Perhaps the noble Earl who will wind up the debate will do that.<lb/>
The situation is not satisfactory. The Chinese and the Russians have not deployed troops. They are plainly reluctant to approve the use of force. Either of them can prevent it under the auspices of the United Nations. Apart from that, it is hard to see, without Soviet acquiescence, that military action can succeed. The attitude of the French is not by any means clear. Apart from Kuwait the attitude of the Arab governments is not clear. Syria and Saudi Arabia have
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0195"/>
<col>311</col>
not said plainly that they are willing to participate in action beyond the boundaries of Saudi Arabia even though both those governments have been amply rewarded already for the dispatch of troops to the coalition.<lb/>
Yesterday President Mubarak said specifically that Egypt would not take part in military action across the Saudi frontier. He undertook only that Egypt would contribute a peacekeeping force afterwards in Kuwait. These governments have strong and particular reasons for wanting the downfall of Saddam Hussein, but all of them, including the government of Morocco, are plainly worried by reactions at home to the spectacle of their governments fighting an Arab country side by side with the United States. Incidentally, their troops are deployed between the British and American and the Iraqi troops. That is a comparatively minor matter but obviously it is an operational headache of the first order. The important point is that we must have grave misgivings about a United States and a United Kingdom commitment to engage Iraq unless there is also substantial Arab support by dispatch of troops to the coalition. The first Arab deaths through American bombing could produce what the noble Lord, Lord Pym, described very aptly as a re-run of the Crusades, and no outcome could be more disastrous than that. Yet it is a possibility.<lb/>
The Americans perceive themselves as upholding international law and the resolutions of the Security Council&#x2014;and in this instance they are right&#x2014;but their posture is seriously undermined by their disregarding of international law and Security Council resolutions in other instances. The instance about which the Arabs are most keenly sensitive is that of Palestine. On resolutions concerned with the occupied territories, under President Reagan the United States used its veto 18 times. President Bush has so far used the veto four times and undoubtedly would have used it twice more recently had he not required more support from his Arab allies in the coalition. It is small wonder that the Saudi, Egyptian and Syrian governments hold back and hesitate when asked to ally themselves with the United States against an Arab country.<lb/>
President Bush showed some awareness of this problem when he stated that after the Kuwait crisis was settled the time would come to handle the problem of Palestine. That does not seem to have had the major impact it should have had. It is not clear to me&#x2014;and here I speak entirely for myself&#x2014;why, during this difficult and perhaps long period of waiting for sanctions to take effect, a period when the United States urgently needs to build up its Arab support, President Bush's offer should not be brought forward and why the Security Council, quite independently of Iraq and entirely on its own merits, should not address itself now to the implementation of its resolutions on Palestine.<lb/>
Such a move by the Security Council would certainly be supported by all Arabs unitedly, including the Iraqi people. It would help the anti-Saddam coalition to solidify. It would strengthen it. It would further isolate Saddam Hussein. If the coalition found
<col>312</col>
later that it needed to take military action, that action would be taken with greater moral authority and with greater Arab support. I do not expect the noble Earl to commit the Government to my proposal today but I should be most grateful if in due course he could let me know what the Government's attitude to it is.<lb/>
The outlook in the Gulf is difficult and dark at the present time, but as other noble Lords have said during the debate the Gulf crisis could and should produce positive results as well&#x2014;above all, the assertion of the authority of the Security Council in other parts of the Middle East besides the Gulf; and the deployment of a powerful United Nations force in the Gulf could be a very useful precedent. Several speakers have referred to the security of Israel. Is it simply dreaming&#x2014;I do not think it is&#x2014;after the precedents set in the Gulf to think that one could have a United Nations force, with American and European troops, in the West Bank and Gaza, guaranteeing the security of Israel, protecting the Palestinians, as they deserve to be protected, from the treatment they are receiving now from the occupying forces and thus also enabling Israel to dispense with control of South Lebanon, which it believes to be necessary, and which in itself might relieve the Syrians of the need to control the rest of the country?<lb/>
Of course the realisation of such ideas is a long time away, but it seems to me that what has happened in the Gulf makes them more credible and practicable than before. In addition, as other speakers mentioned, they would make more possible the liberalisation of some of the Gulf regimes. Moreover, the redistribution of some of the vast assets of the oil-producing countries and of the oil companies would help to develop some of the poorer countries in the region.<lb/>
It has been said that after the Gulf crisis the Middle East will never be the same again. Those of us who have had a lot to do with the region in past years may believe that that would not be a bad outcome.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03145"><member>Lord Richard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall begin by dealing with two pleasant matters before I launch into the debate. I should like first to thank the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, for his kind words about me in his opening speech. I am most grateful to him for them. Secondly, I should like to congratulate the two maiden speakers, who both made extraordinary speeches today.<lb/>
I am sure that everyone who listened to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, will agree with me when I say that it was a performance which we shall remember and indeed cherish. She reminded us in forthright terms of our obligation to history. She is of course quite right; British rule is a interlude so far as concerns Hong Kong. Empires comes and empires go. In some ways they always are an interlude. However, she was gracious enough to say that in her view successive British Governments have tried to govern wisely, though not always successfully. At least she was kind enough to give us the benefit of the doubt. I should like to say that we on this side of the House wish her and the people of Hong Kong well.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0196"/>
<col>313</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest, spoke from personal experience and conviction. I agree with a great deal of what he said. His time in New York qualifies him as having a particular knowledge of the United Nations. I welcome much of his speech and look forward greatly to hearing from him again.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, said, winding up a debate of this character is an extraordinarily difficult task. The discussion has covered many countries, including Latin America, Northern Ireland, Southern Africa, Poland, Israel and Palestine. Indeed, I believe that it is impossible for anyone to do justice to the whole range of topics which have been mentioned.<lb/>
I should like to draw the Government's attention to a few matters as regards Cambodia. I hope that Her Majesty's Government will take all possible measures to ensure that the Khmer Rouge, and especially Pol Pot, have no role to play in the process which is now taking place in that country. It would be deeply offensive to those of us on this side of the House if the situaticn were other than that Pol Pot was excluded.<lb/>
Secondly, if, as part of the settlement in Cambodia, the United Nations is to be brought in to man the temporary administration, or some kind of peacekeeping force, I hope that the Government will not be niggardly when it comes to paying for such a force. There is a tendency to believe that peace is cheap. Of course it is cheaper than war, but it is a jolly sight more expensive when it comes to paying the bills.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Alport, spoke about the Commonwealth in his speech, a fair part of which I agreed with. However, I do not share the view which seemed to be implicit in much of what he said that somehow or other a policy which was positive towards Europe necessarily involved being antagonistic towards the Commonwealth. That is not a view I share.<lb/>
The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver, made what I thought was a preceptive speech. He looked forward to a post-NATO Europe. I believe that we are nearly in the position of being a post-NATO Europe. I listened to his words with interest and I look forward to pursuing that particular line of policy. I especially agreed with what he said about the Gulf. He said that there were two requirements: first, clarity in the aim &#x2014;otherwise it is unfair to the soldiers (an attitude with which, I am bound to say, I totally agree); and, secondly, he said, we need patience. We need patience for two reasons. Sanctions will take a considerable time; and it is always bad to start a war out of impatience rather than out of deliberation and policy.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, said that we had not talked much about defence in this debate. He is quite right. However, I have given the Minister who is to reply notice of two purely defence matters which, if the House will allow me, I should like to raise so that I may hear his answer. With regard to Britain's nuclear Forces, we are disturbed that the Government have announced that another two of Britain's nuclear powered hunter-killer submarines&#x2014;HMS "Warspite" and HMS "Churchill"&#x2014;are to be decommissioned in
<col>314</col>
addition to HMS "Conqueror", whose decommissioning was announced in July as part of the options for change review. As I understand it, the two submarines were undergoing expensive refits when hairline cracks were found in their reactors' primary cooling circuit.<lb/>
It is now thought&#x2014;and I welcome the Government's views on this because if it is true it is of extreme importance&#x2014;that the rest of the Valiant-Churchill class will have to be scrapped. The discovery of the cracks also raises questions about the future of the four Polaris submarines which have the same reactor system. If cracks develop in these submarines before they are replaced by the Trident II submarines, Britain's defence force will face major problems indeed.<lb/>
Can the noble Earl who is to reply to the debate give us some reassurance on that issue? He will know that an independent nuclear engineer, Mr. Large, was quoted in the <i>Observer</i> on Sunday as saying:
<quote>"Since the reactors on the Polaris submarines are exactly the same design, as well as being older than the Valiant-Churchill submarines, then the same design defect is likely to exist. It seems as though the Ministry of Defence might be stretching its luck in continuing to operate these submarines until the Tridents come into commission".</quote>
Having given the Minister notice that I should do so, I pose that question in the hope that we can receive a definitive answer from the Government.<lb/>
Secondly, I should like him to comment on the change that there has apparently been in the tour of duty in the Gulf of hundreds of men in the Royal Air Force. The tour of duty has been extended from three months to six months. The doubling of time spent in combat readiness will apparently take effect shortly. In <i>The Times</i> today there is a report about the effect on morale that that is supposed to have had. I should welcome some reassurance from the Minister on that matter.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn to the contributions in the debate. Understandably the debate was dominated by events in the Gulf. I believe that most noble Lords who took part agreed that the policy of sanctions should continue. They also agreed that the policy of sanctions will take time.<lb/>
Different trends of opinion on that issue, and upon past policy in the Gulf, now seem to be emerging even in the United States. Perhaps we may envisage a solution to the problem in the Gulf in which Iraq withdraws from Kuwait; after a decent interval there is a negotiated settlement&#x2014;primarily negotiated by the Arab states&#x2014;and a negotiated settlement of the territorial claims, perhaps relating to the islands, and perhaps some concessions on the oilfields. As the Government will know, that issue seems to be raised more and more, in particular in the United States. I gather that Senators Nunn and Moynihan may have been questioning the trend of American policy up to now. As we all know, they are very senior politicians in the United States. If that emerges as an avenue which the Arabs themselves wish to explore, as a non-indigenous foreign country, can we really say no
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0197"/>

to it? If indeed such exploration were to be successful, should we then be in a position to say no to a possible settlement along those lines?<lb/>
I venture to suggest that it would be extremely difficult, even if the United States were as firm in its position now as it appears to have been at some stage in the past, for an Anglo-Saxon alliance of that kind to deny validity to an Arab settlement. I do not expect the Government to give us any firm declaration of their views on this tonight. It is obviously not a matter for overt politicking. I merely ask the Minister to comment on the reports coming out of the United States. Its views are entitled to be treated seriously.<lb/>
I wish to press the Government on their position now on the possible use of force and their view on the need for a further Security Council resolution before embarking on a war. Perhaps I may say at the outset of this part of my speech to the House that it is not a question now of whether it is under Article 51 or Article 42. I have my own views, but perhaps it is no longer a legal issue. The question now seems to be much more a political than a legal one. Does it make sense for us to embark on war without the international stamp of approval that a Security Council resolution would give? I have to tell the Government why I think it would not make sense for us to do that. We all agree that it is essential to maintain as great a degree of international solidarity as possible. We all know that in his journey last week to various capitals, Mr Baker, the United States Secretary of State, seemed to be attempting to line up precisely that kind of international solidarity which is needed. I must therefore press the Government on this.<lb/>
According to the press, the Prime Minister last week accepted&#x2014;albeit, it is said, reluctantly&#x2014;that before force is used there will have to be further recourse to the Security Council. Is this so? Is this the position of Her Majesty's Government tonight? If it is, it is a major shift in the Government's position and it is one upon which we are entitled to a greater degree of clarity. Can the Minister give us that assurance tonight? The House and indeed the country should not have to learn of a change of policy of this gravity and magnitude through a series of inspired leaks. It may be that an enabling resolution of the Security Council would do. The Chinese Foreign Minister in Baghdad yesterday apparently said that China would not veto a United Nations resolution authorising the use of force. So there is some ground for believing that Security Council action would be attainable.<lb/>
The attitude of the Soviet Union on this issue is of course crucial in the Security Council. Can the Minister give us an indication of what the Government expect the Soviet attitude to be in the event of the matter going back to the council? Last week Mr Shevardnadze said that they did not rule out the use of force. Is this the message he is conveying to Her Majesty's Government? If so, we would like to know.<lb/>
In short, I think we need from the Government tonight some indication of their current thinking as to
<col>316</col>
the way forward. Standing pat at the moment is hardly a policy, if I may say so. It is more an excuse for the absence of one. I must press the Minister on this. We cannot just drift into war. The British people are entitled to have the issues clearly presented to them. So far, as the Government know, the Opposition have given the Government our support. We have not given them a blank cheque, but we have broadly given them our support. I think that the time has come for a little more openness on the part of the Government.<lb/>
I have listened to most of the debate today. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, will not be surprised to hear me say that I agreed with a great deal of what he had to say about the intricacies of operating within the Community context. In considering the Government's European policy, the difficulty that one feels they have is in grappling with the problems of a world in which multilateral diplomacy has overtaken the bilateral pursuit of national interests. More and more, those national interests can only be safeguarded and accommodated and can only prosper by operating in a multilateral context and through multilateral institutions. That is true whether we are talking about the EC, NATO, the United Nations, GATT, the Commonwealth or the many other international institutions in which we operate. The inexorable trend of the last two or three decades has been the inability of nations, large as well as small, to defend their national interests on a bilateral basis only. National freedom of manoeuvre has declined inevitably as international events have become more and more soluble only on a multilateral basis.<lb/>
A very distinguished former American ambassador to NATO, Mr. Harlan Cleveland, recently made a study of what American ambassadors do. He talked to American ambassadors in capital cities, analysing their day and seeing what occupied their minds. He discovered that approximately 75 per cent. of their time is spent not on relations with the host country but on multilateral issues, trying to decide how the host country will behave when an issue comes up in New York, Brussels or any other multilateral context.<lb/>
If that is so, what does it mean in practice? It means that one has to operate in an atmosphere and environment in which consensus is the goal. One has to operate in an environment in which the winner in the game is the country which can gain a consensus nearest to the direction it wishes. However, in turn, consensus also means, first, that one has to be ready to listen to the other side's argument, and, secondly, that one has to be prepared to compromise. In addition, one has to show a decent respect for the institutions within which one operates and the direction in which they are moving.<lb/>
The Government are not good at that, to put it moderately at this hour of the night. Speaking personally, I am fed up with Britain being the awkward squad, whether it is in the Community, the Commonwealth or any other international institution. Not only am I fed up with it, I believe that we achieve less that way. One tends to be marginalised more and more in the decision-making process. One tends to be less genuinely consulted and to become more isolated.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0198"/>
<col>317</col>
Decisions by the rest of the members tend to be formulated on the basis of a genuine give and take between them and are then presented to the odd man out, or the odd woman out, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. When that has resulted in the odd person out taking it, one's credibility is even further eroded. I wish it would end, not only in our own interests but in the interests of the very institutions that we are trying to influence.<lb/>
The acid test of the way in which one runs one's foreign policy is whether it is successful. Have we managed to prevent a serious move towards a single currency in the EC? I think not. Have we increased or diminished our capacity to mould a Community consensus in that direction? I think that we have lessened it. As I said, it is time we stopped being the difficult member of the Community and being so by design rather than by accident. It is indefensible on grounds of success and it is doubtful in terms of the genuineness of our commitment.<lb/>
Therefore, I conclude - I hope on not too philosophical a note - by saying to the Government, having personally tried to operate in two or three institutions which were all about consensus, that it is time the Government learnt how to operate that policy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03147"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will agree that this has been a debate on a very high level, highlighted by some notable speeches but starred by two memorable maiden speeches, those of the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, and the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest. Not only were they a valuable contribution to the debate; once again they demonstrated that your Lordships' House is a House of diverse skills and talents. I am sure that we can look forward to further performances of equal talent from both of those speakers in the near future.<lb/>
We have been discussing foreign affairs and defence at a time when we must consider profoundly different futures for areas of the world in which we have very important interests. In Europe, although the future remains uncertain, there are very hopeful signs that we may be able to look forward to the development of freedom and democracy throughout the Continent. In contrast, the Middle East is in turmoil and we have made a major commitment of forces as part of an unprecedented international operation to oppose blunt aggression by Iraq and to secure the freedom of Kuwait
I stress to the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, and to many other noble Lords, that our objectives are the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, the re-establishment of the legitimate Kuwaiti Government and the release of all foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait.<lb/>
The United Kingdom has already committed some 17,000 service personnel to the multinational force and Awe are now considering whether further deployments may be necessary. I am sure that your Lordships would wish to join me in paying tribute to the professionalism of our service personnel and their
<col>318</col>
civilian support who organised and undertook so large a deployment to such an unfamiliar environment with great efficiency and dispatch. For example, within 48 hours of the order being given to deploy forces to deter an invasion of Saudi Arabia a squadron of Tornados arrived at Dharan. Within two hours of the squadron's arrival a pair of Tornados was airborne on an operational mission.<lb/>
We do not seek war. That is a point that I want most firmly to make to the right reverend Prelate, to the noble Lords, Lord Soper and Lord Gifford, and to many other noble Lords. Very often the threat of war is more effective than military action itself, but it is quite clear that the use of naked force to overrun and pillage a neighbouring country cannot and will not be tolerated by the international community. We must acknowledge frankly that our forces may have to be deployed to compel Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait if sanctions alone cannot achieve this.<lb/>
"Can sanctions lead to a peaceful solution?" asked the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, as did my noble friend Lord Holderness. We very much hope that they can. But Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator and has already subjected his people to many years of futile sacrifice and war against Iraq.<lb/>
Like many other noble Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, also asked about legal authority for force and whether further resolutions are needed. Article 51 of the UN Charter provides the legal authority for the use of force for the Government fully recognise the need to keep together the unprecedented coalition against Iraq.<lb/>
One of the few bright spots in the dark clouds that have surrounded the invasion of Kuwait has been the performance of the United Nations. In particular, the support of the Soviet Union for effective measures against an erstwhile client has been significant and important. No longer can an aggressor count on East-West antagonism to prevent concerted UN action. These are pointers towards a hopeful future for this institution and we shall work to make it even more effective in future. But that will only be possible if we can restore the legitimate government and territorial integrity of Kuwait. Any weakening of resolve on the part of the international community will fatally undermine the prospects for the United Nations taking a prominent role in maintaining international security. That point was most ably brought out by the noble Lord, Lord Haden-Guest, in his extremely reflective maiden speech.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, asked "Why not contact Saddam Hussein?" There is nothing to negotiate. The international community has made clear its requirement that Iraq should comply with Security Council resolutions. The aggressor cannot be rewarded for his crime.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Selsdon spoke of individuals seeking the release of hostages. While we warmly welcome the release of any hostages, we are firmly of the view that such initiatives serve only to help Saddam Hussein in his attempts to divide the unanimous international condemnation of his actions.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0199"/>
<col>319</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, my noble friend Lord Beloff and the noble Lord, Lord Weidenfeld, all mentioned the problem of Palestine. We all agree that the Palestinian problem requires strenuous efforts to achieve urgent solution. Saddam Hussein is the main obstacle to progress. We will pursue this with renewed vigour once the current crisis is over and we are ready to assist in the search for solutions.<lb/>
Let me now turn to Europe, which has been the prime focus of our security planning for so many years and indeed about which so many of your Lordships have talked this evening. Europe is greatly changed from the Continent we viewed when your Lordships last debated the gracious Speech and it is almost unrecognisable compared with the Europe of two years ago. Such has been the pace of change.<lb/>
If one single dramatic event epitomised the transformation of Eastern and Central Europe it was surely the unification of Germany last month&#x2014;an event which was barely conceivable 12 months ago but which throughout this year had to be brought forward time and again as the governments of the Federal Republic and East Germany sought to keep pace with popular pressures and with events. The rebuilding of Europe, as the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, said is an event that we must not fail to seize.<lb/>
A major factor in removing the final obstacles to unification was the decision by President Gorbachev to agree that a united Germany should be free to choose to belong to NATO: a proposition for which the Federal German Government and its allies had consistently argued. That the Soviet Union was prepared to drop its opposition to German membership of NATO reflected the very welcome extent of the changes that have taken place in Soviet thinking about security and the shape of the new Europe. The new thinking on security matters in the Soviet Government has followed a fairly steady path of convergence with Western ideas during President Gorbachev's time at the helm, and we warmly welcome his being awarded the Nobel peace prize.<lb/>
Part of this is a changing perception of the role of NATO. It is hardly surprising that the clear image the Soviet Union and our public have had of the alliance is of a military organisation. Of course it still is, but it always has been, in addition, a political organisation; and as the military threat in Europe recedes we need to develop and give greater emphasis to NATO's political role.<lb/>
The London Declaration issued by NATO Heads of Government following the summit in July this year set out clearly the direction in which we intend to move. It reaffirmed the central point that NATO is a wholly defensive alliance and invited the Warsaw Pact states to join the Western nations in a joint declaration that we no longer regard each other as adversaries. We are engaged with our alliance partners in a review of NATO's military strategy and as Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe NATO will scale back the readiness of its forces. These and the other measures outlined in the London Declaration are already having the intended
<col>320</col>
effect of helping to reduce the sense of suspicion of the West and its intentions that has been such a potent force in Soviet policy making.<lb/>
We continue also to take the opportunity to build bridges with the Soviet Government and its armed forces. Manfred Woerner, NATO's Secretary General, has already visited Moscow; General Galvin, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe&#x2014;I had the opportunity of meeting both of them in Brussels only a few weeks ago&#x2014;and General Eide, the Chairman of NATO's Military Committee, are there now. General Moiseyev, the Chief of the Soviet General Staff, visited NATO last month and addressed the Military Committee, and we hope that President Gorbachev will address the North Atlantic Council in Brussels before the end of the year. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence and the Chief of Defence Staff will both address audiences in Moscow in the coming weeks. These contacts are vital if we are to break down the legacy of years of mutual distrust.<lb/>
The signing of the CFE treaty in Paris next week, to which my noble friend referred in opening the debate, will be a major event in the process of building confidence between the West and the Soviet Union as well as an important step in improving security. To some extent the CFE negotiations have already been overtaken by events: they were envisaged as essentially a bloc-to-bloc negotiation, but one of the blocs has effectively ceased to exist.<lb/>
That does not mean that CFE has no positive military advantages to offer the West. It will achieve the removal of massive amounts of military hardware from Europe, the destruction of many of the items removed and intrusive verification of those remaining. Moreover, there is an important political component of CFE in that the process of painstakingly negotiating these reductions and exchanging information about military capabilities makes yet a further contribution to increasing trust between the Soviet Union and the West&#x2014;that trust and confidence which we all regard as so vital.<lb/>
All these hopeful developments are interpreted by some as having removed the rationale for the continued existence of NATO. If there is no longer a military threat in Europe, they argue, why should we need the military and political alliance that has existed to contain the Soviet threat? But although we can be justified in being optimistic, all in the garden is not yet rosy. The Soviet Union faces immense difficulties in reforming itself and these difficulties are creating terrible strains. Such apprehension and fear of the future was very clearly outlined by my noble friend Lord Pym. They are anxieties we all share.<lb/>
We cannot predict what will be the structure of the Soviet Union in a year's time, much less five or ten years' time, nor what sort of government it will have. But we can be relatively confident, however unpalatable it may be to dwell on the fact, that Soviet military power, even after the CFE reductions have been implemented, will remain far greater than that of any other country in Europe. While we pursue further arms control agreements, and while the Soviet Union continues to wrestle with the problems of transition
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0200"/>
<col>321</col>
towards a fully democratic state in which respect for individual freedom is irreversibly embedded in the social fabric, we shall need to maintain substantial armed forces as an insurance policy against the unforeseen.<lb/>
NATO also performs a vital function by acting as the structural link by which the democracies of North America are integrated into European security planning. Our historical, cultural and political ties, as well as the vast military power that the United States can deploy, make it crucial that North America plays a central role in Europe's security planning. And the alliance continues to represent the close political co-operation of 16 sovereign, democratic nations in an area or great importance.<lb/>
That co-operation has been developed and tightened over 40 years. To abandon it now, when the future is perhaps less clear than it has ever been, and to attempt to build a new pan-European security structure from scratch would be the height of folly. This is not to belittle the contribution that we hope the conference on security and co-operation in Europe can make to improving stability and human rights. We have high hopes for a successful meeting of CSCE next week in Paris. I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, that the summit will further the principles of democracy, prosperity and stability. But we must remain realistic about what CSCE can reasonably achieve and the provision of a tried and tested collective security system embracing the whole of Europe is simply not yet an option. On that, I agree with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver.<lb/>
However, we shall not need to maintain forces at the levels we have required in recent years. We and many of our allies have announced proposed reductions in forces that go beyond what will be required by the CFE treaty. We are still working out the details of the changes, and consultations on options for change are still in progress. I cannot therefore offer your Lordships many further details about possible changes in the structure of the armed forces at this stage.<lb/>
But, as foreshadowed in the statement on options for change in July, we have reviewed our RAF basing requirements in Germany. After consultations with our allies and in particular the German Government we have decided to redeploy units from RAF Wildenrath during 1991&#x2013;92 and from RAF Gutersloh subsequently. Flying activity will reduce progressively from 1991. We are now considering, in consultation with the German authorities, the future of these bases after RAF operations cease.<lb/>
Perhaps I may now go across the world and take up some of the points which your Lordships have made, beginning in Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, and my noble friend Lord Belhaven and Stenton asked about the abolition of visas for Poland. We must consider national security and immigration requirements when looking at visa abolition. Poland continues to present immigration problems, particularly illegal working, not only for us but also for many of our EC partners. Last week Mr. Komorowski, a deputy defence minister, came to
<col>322</col>
London for talks with me. I found him to be a most warm and friendly person who showed intense interest in the West.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Eccles talked of the EC and foreign policy. Foreign policy co-operation in the EC is one of the most positive developments in recent years. It received its treaty base only in the Single European Act in 1986. Great strides have been made. We proceed on the basis of consensus. The Twelve make themselves heard better in the world when they speak with one voice.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Cockfield said that the UK was trying to impose its goodwill on the Eleven and not the other way round. That is not true. We are fighting Britain's case and fighting it hard. It puts the cart before the horse to set a date for the start of stage two before deciding what stage two will be. No one must pre-empt the work of the intergovernmental conference.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Molloy and Lord Richard, spoke of the problems of Cambodia. We thoroughly agree with their comments on the excessive Pol Pot. We have repeatedly expressed our abhorrence of Pol Pot and would be the last to object if he were brought to trial for genocide. We shall make a significant contribution to the cost of settlement but it is likely to be expensive.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Alport spoke of the Commonwealth. The Government remain fully committed to the Commonwealth. It is a unique organisation held in huge respect. Membership is still expanding and the UK continues to play an important role. The Commonwealth is moving with the times and preparing to tackle current world affairs such as the environment, drugs and human rights.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, made a deeply thoughtful maiden speech to which I have already referred. I reassure her that the Government fully recognise their responsibility for the security of the colony until 1997. The garrison will continue to play an important role in countering smuggling and illegal immigration. Our plans for the withdrawal of the garrison will ensure that our ability to carry out those roles is not impaired.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, spoke of UNESCO and asked when we shall rejoin it. We are monitoring developments carefully and there is as yet no evidence to show that the reforms are sufficiently substantial to merit rejoining. She asked when we shall ratify the UN convention on the right of the child. The United Kingdom signed the convention on 19th April 1990 and will ratify it as soon as possible. The noble Baroness also asked about aid to Eastern Europe as did the noble Lord, Lord Pitt. Aid to Eastern Europe is separate and additional to the aid programme for developing countries.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, spoke about consulates in the USSR. We have no plans at present to open a consulate outside Moscow. However, we are keeping the possibility under review.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, spoke about communal violence in South Africa. We
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0201"/>
<col>323</col>
condemn violence from whatever source. It is not our business to take sides or apportion blame. The South African Government have a duty to ensure that their security forces enforce the law impartially but all political leaders have a responsibility to restrain their followers and maintain the momentum towards negotiations.<lb/>
A major aim of options for change is to enhance the mobility and flexibility of our armed forces. While we anticipate a reduced need for forces primarily structured to fight if need be in the environment of North Europe, we shall need to maintain balanced forces capable of performing effectively within a wide range of environments to cope with whatever crises we may face. The forces we have deployed to the Middle East to counter Iraqi aggression all have NATO roles and they illustrate very well the flexibility which is so valuable and which we are determined to retain. In that context I can tell my noble friend Lord Ashbourne that the Gulf crisis will not affect our plans to reduce our armed forces under options for change.<lb/>
Members of the services demonstrate that flexibility as they carry out a very different but also very demanding role assisting the RUC in maintaining law and order in Northern Ireland. For the Army this remains its largest peacetime commitment and the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force also make a substantial contribution to operations.<lb/>
The terrorists are deeply mistaken if they believe that they can achieve their aims by butchering, coercing and intimidating the people of the Province. The IRA still clings to the mistaken belief that, having failed miserably to attract support for its cause through the ballot box in either part of Ireland, its campaign of violence can override the wishes of law-abiding people who form the vast majority of both communities of Northern Ireland. It fails to understand that we will never submit to its barbarity and that violence cannot advance its cause&#x2014;a point which I can confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Monson. The people of Northern Ireland have been subjected to more than 20 years of terrorist savagery and they are tired of paramilitary posturing.<lb/>
The job our service personnel do in Northern Ireland is demanding and dangerous. Ten regular soldiers have been murdered this year by the IRA. Members of the Ulster Defence Regiment also face the dangers involved in protecting peace in the Province and have the added strain of knowing that they and their families are under a constant threat of attack as they go about their everyday lives. Eight have been murdered this year. Despite all of this our people carry out their tasks in the Province with great courage, dedication and professionalism. Only last week the George Cross was awarded to Warrant Officer Johnson for his bravery and devotion to duty in ensuring the safe disposal of IRA mortar bombs found near a hospital and in the middle of a housing estate even though he had been severely wounded when one of the bombs exploded. I warmly congratulate him on his award, which reflects the selfless commitment to serving the community
<col>324</col>
displayed by all our service men and women in the Province. As regards the eloquent pleas of the noble Lords, Lord Fitt and Lord Blease, on Northern Ireland, for the past 20 years successive governments have given profound and continuous thought to that troubled Province.<lb/>
I make no apology for saying a few words on several defence issues which are currently topical. First, following options for change and changed training requirements for our restructured forces, the NATO summit declaration in July made plain our intention to reduce exercise activity. We are quite clear that our landholdings should be no greater than is absolutely necessary. But if we are to have effective forces it is essential to provide them with facilities where they can train properly. Consequently, while we seek to acquire additional land where there is a proven training need, we also have a comprehensive programme to dispose of land that is no longer required. I assure my noble friend Lord Elton that the recommendations of the Salisbury Plain training area working party are being implemented, notably the protection of the important Roman village at Chisenbury Warren. We hope that all our plans will be finalised by next summer.<lb/>
The smaller forces we shall have as a result of options for change must be well trained, well motivated, well accommodated and well paid, a point firmly expressed by my noble friend Lord Elton. We rely heavily on the technical skills of our service personnel, skills that require much investment to develop and are difficult and expensive to replace. It, would be a poor use of public resources to fail to give proper priority to the retention of trained personnel. Since taking office in 1979 the Government have increased service pay in line with the recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. Indeed, service pay has increased by more than 30 per cent. more than inflation during this period&#x2014;a record of which we can rightly be proud.<lb/>
We are also determined to ensure that conditions of service remain relevant and appropriate to modern circumstances. Housing is a particular area that causes difficulties. Service personnel, like other members of the community, increasingly want to own their homes. Traditionally the demands of service life and the high degree of mobility required of service personnel have made it difficult for them to take full advantage of the opportunities available to civilians to invest in the housing market, although the extent to which that is true has varied between the services. We are continuing to look positively and imaginatively at a range of schemes to help overcome those problems. They include sales of surplus married quarters at a discount to non-home owning personnel and preferential savings schemes.<lb/>
Before turning from the subject of personnel, I should mention the important contribution made to our defence by those who are prepared to devote their spare time to becoming effective members of the services. The volunteer reserves train to become as competent in their tasks as the regulars alongside whom they would serve in time of war. Their role has
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0202"/>
<col>325</col>
expanded considerably in recent years and they contribute significantly to the front line support of the regular army. Reserves of all three services undertake vital roles in defence of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I turn briefly to the two questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Richard. The first concerned "Warspite". A decision was taken in line with our intention to move to a level of 16 submarines, as announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in his statement on options for change. It is not our policy to comment on the material state of individual submarines.<lb/>
Regarding tour lengths, the RAF is satisfied that six months is an appropriate period for its personnel to serve in the Gulf in the present crisis. The decision to extend the RAF tour from three to six months was not generally applied retrospectively to those already serving in the Gulf.<lb/>
In approaching the end of this considerable debate, your Lordships will no doubt agree that this is a sombre time to be debating foreign affairs and defence. Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have embarked on a new road that looks set to lead to greater security and stability on our continent. We can rightly be proud of our contribution to this change. But the possibility of further conflict in the Middle East is disturbing and is a harsh and timely reminder that the world remains an uncertain place where, overnight, our interests and our citizens can be threatened from unexpected quarters. While seeking peaceful solutions we need to retain the capability to take effective action to prevent and redress such situations.<lb/>
<col>326</col>
The present crisis in the Middle East also underlines the importance of effective collective action to protect peace. The level of co-operation that has been achieved among the forces deployed there is an impressive testament to the strength of international solidarity. Maintaining the bonds of consultation, co-operation and obligation needed to make collective action possible is a long term process. In Europe this is one reason why NATO continues to remain important to us. The western alliance has been spectacularly successful in keeping the peace in Europe and in helping to end the cold war. Its role is not over. It also has a major part to play in maintaining stability in Europe as it passes through a difficult time of transition and in developing its political role to contribute to building new structures in Europe that can help ensure a stable peace. Our attention is now focused, naturally, more on the Middle East than on Europe. Both are important to us: both require our most serious consideration and earnest endeavours. We shall ensure that they both receive them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Economic Recession: Definition</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03153"><member>Lord Donoughue</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03154">What definition is currently used by the Treasury to identify an economic recession in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03155"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Hesketh)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no unique definition of recession nor, for any significant operational reasons, do we need one. But the US definition of two successive quarters of falling output is widely used, though even that is not without its problems.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03156"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I presume that "recession", rather like a camel, does not need a definition but you know it when you have got it. What assumptions&#x2014;and I do not say forecasts&#x2014;about unemployment for 1991 are included in the Autumn Statement forecasts as regards social security expenditure on unemployment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03157"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, asks that question because with his knowledge of the Treasury 1 am sure that he is aware that the Treasury does not forecast unemployment. However, it is fair to say that with the desire to reduce inflation, the economy has slowed. Therefore, there must be an assumption that there is a possible increase in unemployment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03158"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that the present recession is as a result of the crass incompetence of the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer in unleashing an unprecedented consumer and credit boom? Will the noble Lord tell the House whether he believes that our entry into the ERM will or will not cause a much deeper and longer recession with more unemployment than would have been the case had we not joined?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03159"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Lord's first question, it is right to remember that interest rates were universally cut in many countries after the stock market crash of 1987. It is worth remembering that the Labour Party said that those rates had not been cut sufficiently quickly. It is worth remembering also that we now have an economy which, in the third quarter of 1990, has manufacturing output at a record level.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03160"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I congratulate the Minister on his Answer. He always says that he has had no
<col>328</col>
academic education but I thought that his Answer was a very good opening sentence to a standard examination question. He did not seem to feel the need to give us the rest of the essay.<lb/>
If we are able to identify an economic recession, will the Minister tell your Lordships' House whether it is the Government's view that at present we are in a recession? Further, his right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to us being in a "moderate recession". What is the difference between a "recession" and a "moderate recession'"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03161"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Lord's first point, I am sure that your Lordships' House will be very grateful that I did not complete the essay to which he referred, particularly at Question Time.<lb/>
In response to his second point, one can define and re-define. As regards definitions, one can go from recession to downturn to upturn and boom and one could even sub-classify further. I am sure that later this afternoon there will be variations on the theme to which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03162"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord address his mind to the reality of the situation and not to all these hypothetical economic statements? With the present rate of inflation and because employment will probably fall, as he has already said, the people who will be hit hardest will be those buying their own homes. Those people have already suffered enormously at the hands of this Government. Can the noble Lord say that special consideration will be given to those people who are encouraged to buy their council houses and then find that they cannot pay the mortgage and those who are buying private houses and find themselves in difficulty? When unemployment increases, can something be done to help those people who are in that grievous situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03163"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have always maintained that those who are weakest in society are those who are poorest and on fixed incomes. They are the greatest victims of inflation. The Government's policy is to curb inflation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03164"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may ask the noble Lord to look for a moment beyond Offa's Dyke. Is he aware that the number of Welsh companies going into receivership has increased fourfold during the first nine months of this year, while at the same time the Government have cut aid to industry by 20 per cent.? Can the Minister explain that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03165"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must repeat to the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition what I said earlier. We believe that the greatest evil of all is inflation, and that must be tackled. There is a price to be paid for tackling inflation, but inflation must be conquered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03166"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I heard the Minister correctly he said&#x2014;to applause from the Benches behind&#x2014;that manufacturing output had been at a record level in the third quarter of this year. Is it not the case that manufacturing output in the third quarter was down 1 per cent. on that for the second quarter of the year?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0204"/>
<col>329</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03167"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the tables before me show that the figures for the third quarter of 1990 were 7.5 per cent. higher than those for the previous peak year, which was 1973.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03168"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the figures from the <i>Financial Times</i> show manufacturing output to have declined by 1.8 per cent.?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03169"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am answering on behalf of the Government and not the <i>Financial Times.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03170"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I meant to make this point later in the debate this afternoon, but due to ill-health I shall not be able to attend. Is it not true that a limited amount of inflation and damage to the economy can be a good thing, but that like all medicines it has limitations? Like many medicines, it is good in limited doses, but beyond a certain point it becomes damaging.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03171"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of all Members of your Lordships' House I am sorry that the noble Viscount, Lord St. Davids, will not be attending the debate this afternoon. However, I cannot agree with his proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03172"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in my supplementary question I did not ask for forecasts, knowing the Treasury; I asked for assumptions. Can the Minister helpfully explain what those assumptions are for unemployment next year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03173"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we forecast that in our battle to control inflation there will be a slow-down in the economy. That leads to the assumption that there could possibly be an increase in unemployment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03174"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord said that he was answering on behalf of the Government. May I sincerely ask him to look again at his figures and come back to the House when he has confirmed them? As I understood the position, he admitted to me that manufacturing output has fallen by over 1 per cent. in the third quarter over the second quarter of this year. I understand that those are government figures, not dependent on the <i>Financial Times.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03175"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fear that there may be disagreement over which set of tables and figures is being used. However, if the noble Lord is correct I shall write to him. We could finish up in a complicated argument regarding which set of figures is being used by whom and for what.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Dock Labour Scheme: Abolition Cost</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03176">2.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03177"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03178">What was their original estimate of the cost of abolishing the National Dock Labour Scheme and what is their latest estimate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03179"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill which became the Dock Work Act 1989 estimated that the dock workers' compensation scheme might cost &#x00A3;25 million
<col>330</col>
over three years. It also made it clear that no precise forecast could be given. To date, the actual cost to the Government has been &#x00A3;115 million. The final cost will depend on decisions still to be taken by individual harbour authorities. We expect it to be of the order of &#x00A3;135 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03180"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not the figures given by the noble Viscount demonstrate that when the House debated this Bill it was misled by the Government as to the cost? If the Government had brought forth those figures at that time the debate would have been very different. Further, is it not the case that since the abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme over 5,000 dockers&#x2014;more than half the labour force&#x2014;have been declared redundant?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03181"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government made clear when the Bill was going through the House that the number of redundancies was uncertain. The estimate was based on the available evidence and on previous experience. However, the abolition of the scheme and attendant circumstances, including the timing of the dock workers' strike in relation to the enactment of the legislation abolishing the scheme, created an unprecedented situation so that we were unable to forecast the redundancies at the time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03182"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that, whatever the cost to public funds of the initial action, the improvement in service rendered by the ports will more than compensate for it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03183"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. It is now clear that the extent of overmanning exceeded all estimates. Restrictive practices have been swept away and new business has been attracted to a number of former scheme ports. There is more flexible use of labour and industrial relations have been improved. The new climate of competition in industry has meant lower rates for cargo and has helped the whole economy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03184"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that a number of companies in this industry took the opportunity afforded by the termination of the scheme to dismiss a large number of people who had been trade union activists? Is he further aware that this has led to the longest running industrial tribunal hearing in the history of industrial tribunals? Is that not a totally unforeseen additional expense?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03185"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords I suggest that the reason for the dismissals was the dock strike which took place just after the Act was implemented.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03186"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Viscount accept that for once I find myself in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter? In my view, abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme has been amply justified by the improvement in productivity and in our industrial performance that has followed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03187"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03188"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that under the Act abolishing the Dock Labour Scheme the time for claiming compensation payments by
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0205"/>
<col>331</col>
redundant dock workers is still open? We now have the proposed privatisation of the trust ports, a number of which were scheme ports. Have the Government taken into consideration that one of the claims by those who support the privatisation of the trust ports is that there can be free development; in other words, asset stripping'? Therefore, have the Government also taken into consideration that there might be wholesale redundancies among dock workers at those trust ports?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03189"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am unable to reply to the noble Lord on that point and I shall write to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03190"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the two supplementary questions from the Opposition Front Bench, does my noble friend gather that in the event or the Labour Party ever forming a government it will want to reintroduce a national Dock Labour Scheme, as it previously existed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03191"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that is a question that I can answer; it is best put to the Opposition Front Bench. However, I suggest that the much higher cost of abolishing the Dock Labour Scheme reflects the very high level of overmanning which the scheme had perpetuated for a very long time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03192"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Viscount explain to the House what he understood was the reason for introducing the Dock Labour Scheme&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03193"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Cross-Benches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03194"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not now clear that the costs involved in abolishing the Dock Labour Scheme have been far and away completely buried by the extra value which has been generated from the use of the large quantities of land which were entirely frozen and devastated by the scheme? That has made any costs entirely irrelevant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03195"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is much in what the noble Viscount says.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03196"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I return to the first question that I put to the noble Viscount. Is it not the case, as the figures he has given to the House show, that the actual cost of the abolition of the scheme is five times the figure given to Parliament by the Government when the Bill was debated? Is that not in line with the Government's cavalier attitude towards statistics? Does not the noble Viscount now agree that Parliament was misled when the Bill abolishing the scheme was debated in this House and in another place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03197"><member>Viscount Davidson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, does not always listen to replies given from the Dispatch Box. I have already said that the significance of the timing of the dockers' strike is that it took place after the enactment of legislation abolishing the Dock Labour Scheme. We believe that some employers took the opportunity of releasing as many former registered dock workers as possible and many workers preferred to volunteer for redundancy rather than join in the strike. As a result there was a much greater reduction in the labour force than employers had previously believed possible.</membercontribution></p>

<title>School Admission Registers: Access</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03198">2.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03199"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03200">Whether they approve of political parties gaining access to school admissions registers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03201"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, school admission registers in maintained schools are not public documents and the regulations governing the compilation and use of school records provide that they may only be used for educational purposes.<lb/>
The regulations do not apply to independent schools but records held by these schools are subject to the ordinary law. They are the sole responsibility of each school and proprietors are under no obligation to divulge the information they hold to any third party.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03202"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am interested in the Answer given by the noble Lord speaking for the Government. However, does he approve of school admission registers in independent schools being used for party political purposes? That is the nature of my Question and I have not received a reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03203"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that additional question. The Government's attitude is enshrined in law and regulations. My department's responsibility must be confined to ensuring that no records are divulged to unauthorised people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03204"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am still at a loss. This is a straightforward Question in which the word "approve" appears. Are we not entitled to an answer? Does the noble Lord disapprove of this activity? There is no doubt that it took place. Will he not at least tell your Lordships that he disapproves of it? That is the important part of the Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03205"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. I am not here to talk about approval or disapproval. Our attitude is enshrined in law and regulations and I made that clear in my opening Answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03206"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a minimum, therefore, I assume the noble Lord will say that he approves of people obeying the law. Will he at least say that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03207"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, indeed I do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03208"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that there is an increasing tendency on the Government Front Bench for Questions to be avoided rather than answered? Will the noble Lord endeavour to avoid that tendency in future?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03209"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03210"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the latest advice from the Government goes right back to 1956? I refer to the Administrative Memorandum 531, <i>School Registers and Records.</i> As that memorandum was sent out so long ago perhaps the Government will consider updating the advice. At the moment if companies can get hold of these registers they can be extremely useful. Schools have to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0206"/>
<col>333</col>
raise additional income. Companies would find it useful to put out mail shots to parents. Will the Government consider updating that old regulation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03211"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that suggestion. I am not entirely clear on the present position. I believe that updating is in hand at the moment, but I shall be pleased to write to the noble Baroness in that connection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03212"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister at least agree that some parents find it distasteful for their names to be given and used for propaganda purposes on a party political basis? Surely the Minister must agree that that can upset many parents and that the practice should therefore stop in independent schools as well as maintained schools.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03213"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some parents could be upset and I believe that the law and other provisions protect them from that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03214"><member>The Earl of Halsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have spent 20 minutes on Questions and there is still one question to be taken. Are we not dragging our feet?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Housing: Completions and Starts</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03215">3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03216"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03217">What are the latest available figures for housing completions and starts both in the private and public sector.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03218"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in Great Britain during the first nine months of 1990 103,900 dwellings were started by private enterprise, 12,700 by housing associations and 7,300 by local authorities and other public sector bodies. The corresponding figures for completions in the same period were 112,000, 9,000 and 12,700, respectively.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03219"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving those detailed figures. In relation to the public sector, is she aware that the figures are probably the lowest within living memory? Is she also aware that between the early 1920s and the late 1970s local authorities, whatever their political control and under whatever government, built more than 6 million houses for people within their areas? Why are the Government persisting with a policy of seeing local authorities as enablers and not builders? It is clear that the charitable and housing associations cannot fulfil that role, and the private rented sector certainly cannot do so. Will the Government now do an about-face and allow the local authorities increased access to more than &#x00A3;2 billion that has been raised from council house sales but withheld in order to let them get on with a rapidly increased building programme to provide the houses that are badly needed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03220"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is a fundamental difference between the noble Lord and the Government on this issue. The noble Lord believes that those in local authorities should be the only
<col>334</col>
people in the business of providing housing for the community. Credit approvals for local authorities have increased by &#x00A3;102 million for 1991&#x2013;92; revenue subsidy has reached &#x00A3;3,490 million; by 1993 gross expenditure on housing corporations will have bust the ceiling of &#x00A3;2 billion, which is an 88 per cent. increase on the current year; and home ownership has increased from 50 per cent. in 1979 to 69 per cent. this year. Given the difficulties of this year, a record number of first-time buyers have entered the market. We believe in a pluralism of provision and the important issue is that people are housed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03221"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say why one sees so many blocks of council houses with windows boarded up?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03222"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot give the reason. Some local authorities manage their housing stock better than others. Where houses are boarded up we appeal to the local authority to do what it can to bring them back into use as soon possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03223"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister will understand that the construction industry is a barometer of the nation's economy. No Member on either side of the House can deny that at present the industry is in a bad state. When is there likely to be an upturn in the industry and in its output?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03224"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mellish, is right in saying that these are difficult times for the construction industry. However, I must link my reply to one given by my noble friend Lord Hesketh earlier today. The enemy is inflation and there are signs of it falling; indeed, interest rates have begun to fall. That will do more to help the construction industry to get back on track than almost anything else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03225"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister satisfied that the housing corporations have the ability to solve the housing crisis? Does she agree that the local authorities need a massive amount of money in order to solve the problem of homelessness? Ten years ago in Birmingham 2,700 people presented themselves as being homeless. Last year the figure had risen by 244 per cent. to 8,700. When the Minister speaks she must think of the dire misery of the homeless in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03226"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness posed many questions in that statement. The housing associations alone are not the answer; nor are the local authorities alone. There must be an amalgam of all the agencies that I mentioned in my Answer. As regards the homeless, the Government have recognised that there is a difficulty. During the next two years an additional &#x00A3;130 million will be made available. Of that, &#x00A3;50 million will be made available to relieve local authorities' provision of poor temporary accommodation and &#x00A3;80 million will be paid to housing associations to relieve those sleeping rough on our streets and in our cities. There is a total of &#x00A3;300 million intended specifically to aid the homeless.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03227"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that permitting local authorities to recycle the housing receipts into new housing would,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0207"/>
<col>335</col>
at a stroke, add to the plurality of provision and meet the needs of the homeless as I am sure all Members of the Hc use would wish?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03228"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Baroness. Often the best receipts are in areas which are not the poorest and where the need is greatest. Therefore, one must consider a distribution mechanism. Secondly, as I have said in two previous answers, putting the issue in the hands of the local authorities does not increase pluralism. We are increasing the amount of money given to local authorities but we believe that other agencies are equally and sometimes better able to provide accommodation for the homeless and those who wish to buy homes in the private sector.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03229"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the point of view that she put forward in her reply would be more credible if private builders were building more low-cost houses? They are not doing so because that is not as profitable as building bigger houses. Is she further aware that in hundreds of villages in the North of England private builders are buying up sites and building houses in the &#x00A3;150,000 to &#x00A3;200,000 range, which does nothing to help local people? Will the Minister persuade her friends in the private building sector to build low-cost houses even though that may reduce their profits a little?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03230"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not condemn the private sector by saying that it is not building. It is providing housing across the range from low-cost to high-cost housing. As regards low-cost housing specifically, registered housing associations already provide homes for more than 1 million people and are now the main providers of subsidised homes for rent and low-cost home ownership for those on low incomes and with the greatest housing need. In recognition of its new role the Housing Corporation's capital investment programme is planned to double between 1989 and 1993. In addition, Housing Estate Action has been given a boost of funds to deal with the refurbishment of our large estates. More money has also been made available for low-cost housing in rural areas where there are exciting and innovative schemes by local authorities and housing associations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03231"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that these intricate matters of argument on both sides are better reserved for argument in debate rather than oral Questions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03232"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister gave many complex figures but the fact is that the Government's reports show that the nation needs at least a further million houses for rent by the turn of the century. At the present rate of progress announced by the Minister there is no possibility of reaching that target by the end of the next century. When are we to make a start on eating into the present figures?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03233"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, given the fact that there is always further to go, I believe that the Government's record on tackling all housing problem; on all fronts is greater than that of any previous government, particularly that of the noble Lord's party.

<title>Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03236">Debate resumed on the Motion moved on Wednesday last by Lord Kimball&#x2014;namely, That a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03237">"Most Gracious Sovereign&#x2014;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament".</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03238">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03239"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have now reached the final day of the debate on the gracious Speech. During the previous three days the House has heard most excellent maiden speeches and today we look forward to hearing for the first time from the noble Baroness, Lady Castle.<lb/>
Last year no less a body than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded a report on the United Kingdom economy with these words:
<quote>"UK economic performance in the 1980s has been marked by an unusually sustained expansion and by distinct signs of improvement on the supply side".</quote>
Nevertheless, the Opposition have put down a highly critical amendment about the Government's general conduct of economic policy. In the light of the OECD's comments, the amendment surely cannot be referring to the past decade as a whole. So what of the more recent record?<lb/>
As your Lordships will know, 1987 and 1988 saw the fastest growth in both demand and non-oil output in any two-year period since 1945. But as demand outstripped capacity to meet it, inflationary pressures re-emerged. Once the extent of demand became apparent, interest rates were raised sharply. In saying that, I certainly recognise that the slow down in demand has been considerably more gradual than we anticipated; but I think it is fair to make the point that the resilience of the economy in the face of very tight
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0208"/>
<col>337</col>
policies, a resilience which has surprised everyone both within and outside government, is in itself testimony to the greater strength of the economy.<lb/>
With hindsight it can be argued that interest rates should have been raised earlier. But there were good reasons for not acting sooner; there were the effects of the stock market crash of October 1987, and the statistics that were available at the time simply did not paint a picture of over-rapid demand expansion. But did those who now accuse the Government of incompetence&#x2014;that is what the amendment says&#x2014;actually recommend tighter policy then? Did they interpret what was happening in 1987 and 1988 better than the Government? The answer on both counts, as noble Lords opposite are well aware, is no.<lb/>
I shall not pretend that in the short term we face anything other than a brief period in which output is likely to fall. In the economic forecast which he presented just under a week ago, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer foresaw a small fall in gross domestic product between the first and second halves of this year, but thereafter the forecast is for some recovery, with GDP growth of more than 2 per cent. from the second half of 1990 to the second half of 1991. I have heard it asserted within the past few days that the current economic situation is comparable to 1980 and 1981 and that over the decade nothing really has changed. But that is not so. I ask the House to look back over those 10 years.<lb/>
In the early 1980s output fell by a total of 5 per cent., leaving it only 6 per cent. above the level prevailing back in 1974. Now output is expected to rise by the end of next year to a level nearly a third higher than it was in 1981. The scale of the inflationary problem that we face now is also very different from a decade ago. Demand growth had risen to just over 4 per cent. in 1978; but inflation subsequently soared to a peak of nearly 22 per cent. in 1980. This time demand growth reached a remarkable 8 per cent. in 1988 but inflation looks set to peak at around its present rate of just under 11 per cent.; that is much too high but is a very different story compared with 10 years ago. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, will not be entirely surprised when I say that on this side of the House we shall be unable to agree to an amendment which regards it as "incompetent" that the inflation rate has risen to its present level, an amendment, if the noble Lord will forgive me for saying so, put down by the party opposite which 12 years ago sowed the seeds for the subsequent peak inflation of double that amount; namely, 22 per cent.<lb/>
Meanwhile, it must be very important for our country's future competitiveness&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03240"><member>Lord Callaghan of Cardiff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but he seems to be forgetting that his Government were in charge when inflation soared to that figure. When I left office, inflation was at 10.3 per cent. It rose very quickly afterwards because Sir Geoffrey Howe doubled value added tax. If we are going to have comparisons, let us have some fair ones.</membercontribution></p>
<col>338</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03241"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is always fair and I shall attempt to be fair in reply. The noble Lord is absolutely right when he says that the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right honourable and learned friend in another place, increased the rate of VAT; but there was a package which included the cutting of tax rates. What I cross swords with the noble Lord about is that he seems to have forgotten that the Government under his command faced a total collapse of incomes policy in the winter of 1978&#x2013;79 which led to the inflation rate of 10.3 per cent. when the noble Lord and his Government left office&#x2014;an inflation rate which inevitably rose higher and higher and eventually peaked at 22 per cent.<lb/>
Meanwhile, it must be very important for our country's future competitiveness that our fiscal position is stronger today than any of the Group of Seven countries with the single exception of Japan. The present financial year is expected to be the fourth year running that the Government have achieved a budget surplus, an outcome unprecedented in the past 40 years. The new planning totals for expenditure next year, announced last week in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and by my noble friend Lord Hesketh, who is to reply today, in this House, represent a tight overall public expenditure settlement which, although involving tough decisions, is affordable and prudent. Nonetheless, within those extra resources we have been able to concentrate more money in three main areas: social security; health; and support for local authorities with improvements in the key areas of education, public transport and the environment.<lb/>
One matter which is common ground on all sides of the House is that there is never enough public money to pay for all that we want for our country. But a strong, sustained rate of economic growth certainly helps, to put it mildly. It enables the country to put increased resources into its public services, without having to resort to higher and ever higher taxation or higher borrowing to finance them. And the key to economic growth is the private sector&#x2014;the wealth creating sector.<lb/>
The Government have recognised this basic truth, and in the 1980s the economy of the United Kingdom, together with that of Spain, has grown faster than any of the other major Community countries. It is the first post-war decade in which the United Kingdom economy has grown faster than the economies of France and Germany. This strong growth has brought with it prosperity and an increase in living standards which have had widespread benefits. While it is true that employment has reacted inevitably to the slow down in the economy, it needs to be remembered that our unemployment is still well below the average rate in Community countries, and that today there are very nearly 2 million more people in employment than there were 11 years ago.<lb/>
In the long term, growth and employment depend on improvements in the supply side of the economy. I think it is fair to claim that the need for such improvements is recognised throughout the industria-lised world and now, not least, by the new democracies
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0209"/>
<col>339</col>
in Eastern Europe. So it is very important that we in the United Kingdom have gone further than most in the supply side reforms which will stand us in good stead for the future.<lb/>
The most obvious example is the labour market. The proper framework of law which is now in place has transformed industrial relations. The number of stoppages is now at its lowest level for over half a century and about one third of what it was in 1979. Flying pickets are, thankfully, a thing of the past. The 3.75 million jobs created since 1983 reflect the greater opportunities in the labour market of today. Since 1979 the numbers of self-employed people have risen by 75 per cent. and there are ever increasing numbers of women joining the job market. The enterprise allowance scheme, which owes its existence to my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham who will be speaking in the debate, has encouraged over 500,000 people to start up on their own and the small firms loan guarantee scheme has helped to finance around 26,000 smaller businesses.<lb/>
The once intractable problem of long-term unemployment has also been tackled head on, as it needed to be. The numbers have fallen by 850,000 from their peak. The creation of the new employer-led training and enterprise councils should sustain this moment um and they will almost certainly be spending more next year than they are likely to spend this year.<lb/>
Elsewhere we have done everything possible to sweep away unnecessary regulations and controls. But the most dramatic restoration of the market framework has been the privatisation programme. Already half of the state owned commercial sector of 1979, some of it at that time making enormous losses, has been transferred to the private sector.<lb/>
Previously industrial policy meant trying to override the market. Decaying industries were artificially resuscitated and new industries were supported according to the views of the government of the day. By contrast, we have relied on competition policy to give new life to industry, while responding in ways which I have indicated to the particular needs that we believe have emerged.<lb/>
That policy has borne fruit. Last year business starts exceeded stops by 1,700 a week, so that there were 25 per cent. more firms in existence than in 1980. That has not been concentrated in one area at the exclusion of others. In fact, the regions which appear to be least affected by the current slowdown are the areas traditionally associated with industrial decline, such as the North East.<lb/>
One clear piece of evidence of the improvement that has come about concerns manufacturing productivity. Where the United Kingdom was at the bottom of the league table of major industrialised nations in terms of productivity in the 1960s and the 1970s, we now find that the UK actually headed the league in the 1980s, and of course the recent export performances of our manufacturers have continued to be strong.<lb/>
The principles we have followed at home, and which I have been endeavouring to outline, have also guided us in our approach to 1992. In the single
<col>340</col>
market, for example, we have helped to shape many of the most liberal directives which are creating exciting opportunities for people and businesses in the Community. With Denmark we lead the field in implementing single market measures in our national legislation and we continually argue that a single market must not lead to a fortress Europe. That is why we have been enthusiastic supporters of plans to extend the benefits of the single market to the EFTA countries and to develop the plan for association agreements with the countries of Eastern Europe.<lb/>
At the same time the Government fully support Stage 1 of the Delors Report which includes completion of the single market. I fail to see, therefore, how the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, can imply that the Government are in some way "separating" the single market from progress towards economic and monetary union. Far from it. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has put forward concrete proposals for progress beyond Stage 1.<lb/>
The practical merit of the proposals for a hard ecu and a European monetary fund is that it would allow the Community to move forward together. It would be a common currency for Europe, and it could develop into a single currency if that is what peoples and governments so choose.<lb/>
The Government's disagreement with the noble Lord's amendment is more fundamental than that. The main reason for our entry into the Community 18 years ago was to join a common market of over 300 million people close to our shores. But the Community is not even yet a true common market and each advance towards the goal of 1992, each directive which puts into effect a genuine single market within Europe has had to be argued for and worked for and in that Britain has played its part. At the same time, we have had a tremendous task in encouraging British industry and commerce to prepare for the single market.<lb/>
So I must say that the Government take issue with the implication in the noble Lord's amendment that the Government's single market credentials are questionable because of another issue which is to be the subject of an intergovernmental conference which has not yet taken place!<lb/>
Today's debate centres around the Government's economic record. There has indeed been record growth in investment and in employment and something of a revolution in production. So today the economy is better placed to meet difficulty and challenge. What is more, we have taken action on three very important fronts.<lb/>
First, we have made it possible for a great deal of restructuring of British industry to take place in advance of the single market. Secondly, our public finances are strong, our current fiscal position being stronger than that of Germany, France or Italy&#x2014;a remarkable record in anyone's book&#x0021; Thirdly, tight policies to slow demand and reduce inflationary pressures are now clearly working and a sharp fall in inflation is expected next year.<lb/>

Those are not "incompetent" actions; they are actions which faced up to doing the things that needed to be done, and which will stand our country in good stead for the years ahead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03242"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, can he explain a matter which is perplexing many people in this country? I refer to the fact that the Confederation of British Industry could hardly agree with anything that he has said this afternoon. Therefore, will he say that what the CBI has stated in the press, in its magazines, and in statements made by Mr. John Banham, should be ignored because it is incorrect?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03243"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that we should wait for the noble Lord to make his own speech in the debate. I have sketched out the way I believe that the economy is going both at home and abroad. In the meantime, I wait to hear what other noble Lords have to say.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03244">3.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03245"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member> rose to move, at the end of the Address to insert: "but regret the incompetence of Your Majesty's Government in their general conduct of economic policy".</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03246">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I should like first to join with the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal in looking forward to the contribution of a most distinguished maiden who now graces our Benches. I refer to my noble friend Lady Castle of Blackburn. I am sure that her contribution will be well worth hearing and that it will be as uncontroversial as was her long political career.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03247">I turn now to deal with my amendment which the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal accused of being&#x2014;how shall I put it? &#x2014;perhaps somewhat brutal. If that is so, I apologise for its language. However, I think that your Lordships know me well enough to know that I see no point in mincing words. So far as I am aware, a spade never suffered from being called a spade.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03248"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: A bloody shovel!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03249"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I refer the noble and learned Lord to the conventions of parliamentary language.<lb/>
Having worded the amendment in plain English, it is obviously my task, and that of my noble friends who will follow me, to substantiate the charge. Our charge is this: over the past few years there have been serious mistakes in economic management. In short, there have been blunders. Furthermore, those blunders were not provoked by external shocks, or for that matter unforeseen domestic events, but have been the direct and predictable result of Government decisions. Taken all in all, our charge is that the Government have been, and still are, incompetent in their management of economic affairs.<lb/>
I should perhaps first say a word about the amendment to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. I have a certain sympathy with
<col>342</col>
the Lord Privy Seal over that. With the greatest of respect to the noble Lord, I mean that genuinely. I rather regret the tabling of that amendment. I was hoping that this afternoon's debate could concentrate upon the domestic economy. I fully recognise that we cannot debate the domestic economy without reference to the broader European economy since the two are clearly interlinked; but we shall have the opportunity to say pretty well everything we want to say on European questions in the debate which will take place on Thursday of next week on the report of your Lordships' Select Committee on European Monetary Union and Political Union&#x2014;a report, incidentally, that I have read with the greatest interest. I congratulate the committee and its chairman the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, on its report.<lb/>
The wording of the noble Lord's amendment also strikes us as being uncharacteristically imprecise. After all, the Community properly takes a wide range of "initiatives"&#x2014;to quote the words of the amendment&#x2014;in a number of different directions. Many of them should be separated from the single market. A Community initiative, for example, on hostages in Iraq has nothing to do with the single market; nor&#x2014;if I may move from the important to the absurd&#x2014;does the latest Community initiative to define in a directive the status of a carrot, which is, I gather, to be regarded as a fruit when used to make jam and a vegetable for other purposes.<lb/>
On the other hand, I have great sympathy with the notion that the single market is not the be all and end all of the Community in the way that a number of government spokesmen would frequently have us believe. If the noble Lord had done us the courtesy of consulting us on the wording of his amendment in the way that I consulted his party on the wording of ours, we could probably have devised something which would have commanded the support of all of us on this side of the House. I am sorry that that has not happened.<lb/>
The gracious Speech tells us little about the Government's economic policies. We learn only that the Government intend,
<quote>"to reduce inflation and foster conditions necessary for sustained growth".</quote>
Those words of course have a fairly familiar ring. That is exactly what we were told in 1979, and we now find ourselves, 11&#x00BD; years later, not merely with no reduction in inflation but in a period, not of sustained growth, but of negative growth; in other words, what is known by any definition as recession.<lb/>
Why? What has happened? Why is it that after all this time, after the enormous benefit that we have received from North Sea oil, after the suffering of unemployment, homelessness and of the sick and disabled, the Government have landed us in this mess? There are two reasons. They relate, first, to short-term mistakes; and, secondly&#x2014;and perhaps more fundamentally&#x2014;to a lack of vision.<lb/>
Let me examine first the short-term problem. I believe that it is now common ground&#x2014;I think that the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal alluded to this&#x2014;that there were serious policy errors in the period
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0211"/>
<col>343</col>
1987&#x2013;88. It was a combination of the rise in house prices and de-regulation of the financial markets that allowed, and indeed encouraged, a raging boom in consumer expenditure with a consequent explosion in the monetary aggregates. Houseowners, seeing the value of their properties rise almost daily, were able, without penalty, to increase their mortgages and indeed call upon other sources of de-regulated credit to pay for the good life&#x2014;and that they did in full measure. Between 1985 and 1989 personal consumption rose by nearly 25 per cent. Nothing on that scale had ever happened before. Total indebtedness of households in that period increased by over &#x00A3;200 billion. The result was predictable and was predicted. Inflation took off. The balance of payments went into deep deficit. In turn, the consumer rampage, once started, was fed by unnecessary and unwise income tax cuts. That was not just a consumer boom: there was an accompanying upsurge in what became known as business investment.<lb/>
That term can mean anything, but the truth is that it is designed as an expression to hide the fact that that upsurge in investment when set off was directed to entirely the wrong sectors. Instead of a major increase in manufacturing investment which was, and still is, so badly needed; the big increases took place in the service sector: in office blocks, retailing and financial services. Investment in manufacturing came in the end, but it came right at the end of the queue.<lb/>
In response to that situation, the Government took the deck ion to rely upon one weapon to fight the inflation for which they themselves were responsible. It was the weapon of short-term interest rates. The immediate effect of that decision was predictable, and indeed predicted: inflation, because of the consequent rise in mortgage rates, instead of going down, went up. That in turn led to increased claims for wages and salaries, not least, may I say, from directors and senior executives of large companies who were themselves committed to high mortgages. However, the use of interest rates as the sole way of reducing demand has at least two serious disadvantages.<lb/>
In the first place, the size and timing of the impact are extremely uncertain; and, secondly, the interest-rate weapon is just as likely to cut investment as consumption. That is the last thing that we need. Nor was the policy, if I may say so directly to the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal, helped by a series of ministerial pronouncements to the effect that inflation would soon be brought under control so that the public need not worry too much about some short-term discomfort. There would be, we were told, a soft landing&#x2014;your Lordships perhaps remember that expression&#x2014;under which procedure inflation would be eliminated without undue hardship for the majority of the public, or at least for Conservative voters. That expression was repeated constantly, and Ministers, surprisingly enough, were taken at their word, to the point where no one really believed that their own personal position would be affected, other than in the very short term, and so all continued to borrow a they did before.<lb/>
<col>344</col>
At that point, in the Autumn of 1989, it was clear that the economy was in serious trouble. There was a change of Chancellor. Mr. Lawson's name was duly blackened, and, after his short detour at the Foreign Office, we were presented with Mr. Major. Here, it was said, was the real tough guy. If it did not hurt, it was not working; and, suddenly, it started to hurt. Some time in the summer of this year, the economy went into a nosedive. We now have an economy that is sharply contracting, not in a mild recession of the type described by the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal, but in a sharp recession. If ever there was a hard landing, this is it. But it is by no means finished yet. Even by the Government's Autumn Statement forecasts, real GDP is to continue falling well into next year. The CBI October industrial trends survey shows a grimmer picture, suggesting a trough around the middle of next year at GDP growth of about minus 2 per cent. The business optimism indicator is about where it was at this stage in the deep recession of 1980. The export optimism figure has collapsed. Substantial de-stocking is predicted. As a result, unemployment will certainly rise, profits will certainly fall, and investment with them.<lb/>
Instead of an inflationary mess, we now have a deflationary mess. What do we do now? What is the proper policy response? Classically it would be an easing of monetary policy at this stage of the cycle by means of a cut in interest rates. If it is true that the headline rate of inflation is to come down 5&#x00BD; per cent., as the noble Lord claimed&#x2014;it may well do so if the recession is deep enough &#x2014;then one could argue that there might be some relaxation in monetary policy.<lb/>
Is there any scope for interest rate cuts? Not really very much. This is partly because any monetary reflation at the present moment of domestic demand would soon spill over into our already horrific balance of payments deficit and partly because, now that we are in the exchange rate mechanism, we have lost control of our interest rate policy. We went in to the exchange rate mechanism, as I remind your Lordships, purely to achieve an interest rate cut in time for the beginning of a Conservative Party conference. The result was that the ERM honeymoon, as it was called, lasted about half an hour. Sterling has been bumping along as the laggard in the ERM ever since. This morning, it dropped below 2.90 deutschmarks. The market is even now fearful of the possibility that interest rates will actually have to rise again if sterling is not to slip off the edge.<lb/>
It seems to me that we have accumulated, one after another, problems for ourselves by faulty, hasty or ill thought-out decisions. We ask ourselves: who is to blame? We can immediately eliminate one possible scapegoat&#x2014;the international economy. There are no oil shocks such as we had twice in the 1970s. Growth in the major industrialised countries has tapered off but there is still growth&#x2014;in Germany and Japan, quite fast growth. The world scene is quite unlike that of the 1970s and early 1980s. The growth of world trade in manufactures, for instance, is forecast to stay in 1990 and 1991 at around the average for the 1980s.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0212"/>
<col>345</col>
Nor can anyone seriously argue that there have been any unforeseeable domestic events that have made a great impact. Of course we understand that if there were a war in the Gulf the whole world would change, but we have to follow the lines of the Autumn Statement and assume that we shall be successful in avoiding it. The introduction of the poll tax had inflationary implications. These were easily foreseeable and were foreseen. Electricity privatisation will also be inflationary, if it ever happens. But that is government policy too.<lb/>
I return to my first and central theme. The Government have nobody to blame but themselves and we have nobody to blame but the Government. Of course, it is the general rule of this Government, when they run into economic difficulties, to put all the blame on to those lucky enough to have a job. We see it happening again. It is the poor old worker who is to blame; if he tries to keep his pay packet up in line with inflation, he is doing something wrong. That is the normal stuff we get from Ministers. They have not yet blamed the financial markets, as they used to, but that will come in time.<lb/>
I am afraid that the sad fact is&#x2014;and I say this directly to the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal&#x2014;that people no longer have faith either in what Ministers say or in what they think they will do. That message comes across quite clearly in the opinion polls and the by-election results.<lb/>
Moving to the longer term, it is the longer term lack of vision that will be the most serious legacy that this Government leave behind them. As long ago as 1985 your Lordships' Select Committee pointed out that there was one key requirement to bring our economy into balance and that without it all the clever manoeuvres in the world would be of no effect. That requirement was a recovery in manufacturing industry. They were right then; they are right now and we are right to repeat their argument. The British economy has had and still has a continuing and serious structural problem. Here I come to the long term effects of government incompetence. It is a problem that the Government have not simply allowed to develop but have actively exacerbated during their period in office. Not until we recognise that fact fairly and squarely shall we be able to mount a serious attempt to do something about it.<lb/>
Perhaps I may give an example of what I mean. For all the ministerial boasting about investment in manufacturing industry, the truth is that net fixed capital formation in real terms was negative in manufacturing from 1981 to 1986, apart from 1985. Although it was positive in 1987 to 1989, the decline in capital stock has not been made up and is therefore lower than it was in 1979.<lb/>
Another example of a field in which we have fallen behind in the past decade is civil research and development. Everybody knows it, it has been said a thousand times in your Lordships' House and will be said again. Not a squeak comes from the Government.<lb/>
<col>346</col>
A third example is our balance of payments. Again, the importance of manufacturing is paramount. In 1990 it looks as though exports will have increased by 50 to 60 per cent. over 1980 but imports of manufactures will have increased by 110 to 120 per cent. No strategy is viable which does not somehow or other ensure that that adverse trend is halted and then reversed. So what do the Government do? They announce yet another cut in the industry budget in the Autumn Statement.<lb/>
None of these considerations seems to have entered the Government's thinking at all. They seem to be wrapped in a fog of complacency. But perhaps just for once they might do us the honour of listening to what we and the rest of the world are saying. The imbalances that have traditionally characterised the British economy have not in any way disappeared. Far from it; they have actually intensified in the past decade but have been masked by North Sea oil. We enter the 1990s with the most serious structural problems, which urgently need addressing. Let us for goodness' sake recognise that before it is too late.<lb/>
Finally, we can now rewrite the Conservative manifesto for the General Election of May 1979. It runs something like this: "We intend to remain in power for three parliaments. By the end of 1990 our target is to achieve, after much pain and suffering, an inflation rate similar to the one we inherit, but with an economy in recession and with a balance of payments surplus that we inherit turned into a &#x00A3;15 billion annual deficit in spite of North Sea oil. Unemployment will about double to over 2 million, in spite of our efforts to keep the total as low as possible by fiddling the figures. We expect to receive nearly &#x00A3;70 billion from North Sea oil revenues, which no government have ever had before, and a further &#x00A3;25 billion from the proceeds of selling assets to the public who already own them. We will fritter away these vast sums either in direct tax cuts or in redeeming gilt-edged stock. We do not propose to lighten the total tax burden but we will make sure that that burden is shifted away from those who can afford to pay on to those who cannot. Finally, we expect Britain to be overtaken in terms of per capita GDP not just by France, Germany, Belgium and Holland but also by Italy and possibly Spain. We should be most grateful if you would go out and vote for us".<lb/>
Of course, that was not their manifesto, but it is their record. That I call incompetence. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, at the end of the Address to insert: "but regret the incompetence of Your Majesty's Government in their general conduct of economic policy".&#x2014;(<i>Lord Williams of Elvel.</i>)</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03251"><member>Lord Jenkins of Hillhead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by saying that I do not wish the amendment in my name on the Order Paper in any way to pre-empt the debate which we shall have on monetary and political union on 22nd November. I regard it as vital that your Lordships' House should have a full and reflective debate on the most valuable report produced by the committee presided over by the noble Lord, Lord
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0213"/>
<col>347</col>
Aldington. We are greatly indebted to him and to the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, for the service they render to the House and the nation on matters of European policy. I shall therefore steer my European remarks today as far away as possible from the specific issues with which the report so authoritatively deals. At the same time I do not think it would be remotely reasonable, at the present juncture in our affairs, that this House should impose upon itself a kind of trappist vow of silence on Europe for the next eight days.<lb/>
It will not have escaped the notice of your Lordships that matters are currently moving rather fast in the evolution of this country's European argument. I also do not think that the debate on the Address should be allowed to pass without the party which I have the honour to lead in this House setting out and indeed voting upon its own clear-cut and consistent line on what is the dominant issue of the day for this Parliament and for the country.<lb/>
The Conservative Party is manifestly in a state of almost unprecedented disarray on the issue. I remember how recently it was that the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, in those familiar and well loved terms, expressed more in sorrow than in anger the fact that he had to rebuke us for having such nasty thoughts. He repudiated the idea that there was any serious difference between the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. I remember how excited one or two noble Lords became when I suggested, in connection with the Statement on the Rome Summit, that the Prime Minister's xenophobia had become a major disadvantage to the interests of this country. That view was almost precisely endorsed by Sir Geoffrey Howe in his speech yesterday.<lb/>
I can certainly think of no occasion, at least since the last days of the Balfour Government, when the Conservative Party in government was in such continuing confusion. I may add the comforting thought that it then took the Conservatives 10 years to get back to office of any kind and 17 years to get back to independent power. I should very much like to hear the views of the noble Lord, Lord Blake, on the matter to which I am about to refer. Some historians of the 19th and 20th centuries might take the view that one would have to go back still further, to 1846, to find a state of affairs with such a deep-seated capacity of reverberation. Some 28 years passed before a return to more than a snatch of power occurred.<lb/>
I wish to turn for a moment to the official Opposition in response to the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. I gathered before and I gather today that the Labour Party is not altogether happy about our amendment. One distinguished noble Lord was reported as saying that the Labour Party may not be able to vote for the amendment. That, if I may say so, is its problem. If, as may well be the case, the Labour Party will soon be in government, it is not a bad thing that it should be brought up against the fact that one cannot have all the political advantage of running with the European hare while hunting with the anti-European hounds. Otherwise the period that Labour is in government will be just another sad chapter in the bungled history
<col>348</col>
of our relations with the Continent over nearly the whole of the past 40 years; namely, fair words in opposition and foolish performance in government.<lb/>
I have a high regard for the European record of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn. He played a notable part in the referendum campaign of 1975. I believe also that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, has strong European instincts. However, it must be said that, as a political entity, the Labour Party has an appalling record of tergiversation and opportunism on the issue of Europe. I shall mention only one instance of that. The convincing nature of Mr. Kinnock's criticisms of the present isolationism of the Prime Minister are to say the least somewhat vitiated by the fact that only seven years ago he was enthusiastically advocating the complete withdrawal of Britain from the European Community.<lb/>
I become increasingly convinced that the two party politics in this country have served the vital question of our relations with Europe remarkably and almost impartially badly. The European card was played quite strongly by the Conservatives in the late 1940s and the very beginning of the 1950s, partly because the Labour Government believed&#x2014;I think they were probably mistaken in that&#x2014;that the Durham miners would not let us join the Coal and Steel Community. But in office all that led to was the disaster of Anthony Eden refusing to let us participate in the Messina Conference.<lb/>
The Labour Party under the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, behaved in a reverse fashion. In opposition he denounced the Common Market as just an arrangement for trying to sell washing machines in D&#x00FC;sseldorf. But in government, after a fairly short interval he moved towards initiating the second British application to join the Common Market in 1967. Then, in opposition in the early 1970s, he devoted more attention to party unity than to consistency. That began the disintegration of the Labour Party as a party of government, at any rate for some time.<lb/>
Meanwhile the Conservative Party became the great party of Europe. In the referendum campaign it was almost united whereas the Labour Party was deeply split. Even the noble Baroness, Lady Castle of Blackburn, whose speech I greatly look forward to but who I cannot see in the Chamber at the moment, was disunited with me on that issue. That may seem unbelievable. It seems to me in retrospect that what united the Conservative Party was the confluence of two quite different streams. Those who had a strong genuine Heath-like enthusiasm for Europe were still strongly placed and were buttressed by others without much genuine enthusiasm but who looked to Brussels in those days for protection against the threat of an insular socialism that they still took seriously.<lb/>
The Labour Party at government level was then lukewarm. Great though my respect is for the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, it must be said in honesty that it was his government who first kept us out of the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. At party level that Government's stance became increasingly hostile. Then the great
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0214"/>
<col>349</col>
reversal of position that first occurred in the mid-1980s began. The Labour Party lost its hopes of insular socialism and began to find 10 Downing Street a more intransigent foe of its aspirations than the Berlaimont. It also saw an opportunity of twitching the tail of an increasingly isolated Mrs. Thatcher. The Conservative Party as a natural corollary lost its fears of insular socialism, not because it liked it any more but because that concept became more improbable. With a shift in the internal balance of the party, some natural chauvinism reasserted itself.<lb/>
It has been a dismal tale of party prejudices and party manoeuvring which has prevented us from playing either an effective and consistent hand in Europe or developing a distinctive and inspiring national vision of what we want to achieve. That does not need to be an extreme or homogenised federal vision. My view of Europe is not very different from that expressed by Sir Geoffrey Howe yesterday. I do not want to see the analogue of the United States of America imported into a Europe which will and should retain many distinct national characteristics. I do not regard the Delors plan as written on tablets of stone. One would have to be an even more charitable person than I am to regard every pronouncement of one's successor&#x2014;even if it is one's successor but one &#x2014;as being immutable truth in all circumstances. I do not believe that the Rome Summit was conducted very considerately, although Mrs. Thatcher's manner on such occasions is not calculated to inspire or deserve consideration from others.<lb/>
However, I believe that it is essential to see European problems overall and I do not believe that one can compartmentalise them. In my view there have been few more narrow-sighted and meanly materialistic views than that one could have a Europe of the single market and nothing else, a Europe of freely moving lorries which had nothing to do with a common currency, a stronger parliament, a common foreign policy or all the wider aspirations which move the hearts and minds of men and women as opposed to merely moving packages and which make the European Community such a beacon of hope&#x2014; primarily non-materialistic&#x2014;to the emerging de-mocracies of Eastern Europe.<lb/>
Until we see things in that overall pattern and rise above the exigencies of party gain, we shall not get our relations with Europe right. In my view the trouble with Britain's relations with Europe has always stemmed much more from politicians than from the people who would always have responded to a constructive lead.<lb/>
When we vote on the amendment tonight we may be in a fairly small lobby, what with the Labour Party trying to reconcile its conscience with its sense of party tactics and the Conservative Party trying to hold together some part of the wreckage. Nevertheless, I almost guarantee&#x2014;one should never guarantee the future&#x2014;that within a few years the policy of whichever party is then the government of this country will be in line with the sentiments of my amendment

today. If only we could for once do something early and gracefully rather than late and sourly. How very welcome that would be!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03252">4.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03253"><member>Lord Harris of High Cross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, whatever our differences, we are all looking forward with the keenest anticipation to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Castle. I hope she will not steer away from the European issue, on which she has considerable experience, since some of us wish to know in which direction she may bestow her greatly valued favours.<lb/>
We are debating a humble Address to thank Her Majesty for the gracious Speech. The first amendment stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. I cannot help reflecting from the Cross-Benches that if there was any gratitude in politics he might have moved a rather different Motion: still humble thanks, but to a rather different lady. After all, the Labour leaders owe an enormous unacknowledged debt to the Prime Minister. It was she above all others who shamed them into dropping their socialist baggage and adopting at least the rhetoric of the market economy. In the process Labour is said to have become electable. We shall see, that was the idea behind their graveside conversion.<lb/>
I say that because the noble Lord, Lord Williams, talked about not mincing words. For 10 years I have watched the Labour Party, even in this House, opposing tooth and nail every market measure that the Tories brought forward. Now they appear to go in for drag, stealing Mrs. Thatcher's foundation garments with their designer labels of trade union reform, deregulation, supply side policies, low taxes and even the right to buy.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams, may have been especially thankful to the Prime Minister because in 1977 he was languishing as chairman of the Price Commission engaged, like some amiable East European apparatchik, in a daily hand-to-hand struggle against rising inflation. It proved an unequal battle even for the noble Lord's formidable talents. It was from that unhappy impersonation of King Canute that he was rescued by Mrs. Thatcher in 1979.<lb/>
The noble Lord's Motion speaks of Her Majesty's Government's,
<quote>"incompetence in &#x2026; their general conduct of economic policy".</quote>
We all regret economic or other incompetence, especially in others. However, it has to be said that there is a powerful amount of incompetence wherever there is over-extended government. Indeed, the Labour Party has a long and intimate acquaintance with economic incompetence, as seen during its 11 years in power from the glad, confident morn of 1964 to the nightmare of 1979, by which time the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, had taken refuge in Brussels.<lb/>
It cannot be denied that the present Government have recently displayed a deplorable degree of incompetence in their central battle against inflation. However, their record suggests to a well-disposed
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0215"/>
<col>351</col>
observer a number of possibly extenuating circumstances. First, their present lapse comes after a much longer period of notable economic success. In the circumstances they might be charged with inadvertent incompetence whereas Labour when in office practised incompetence as a way of life.<lb/>
Secondly, the Government's failure does not stem from their market reforms of state industries, labour supply, lower taxes and higher productivity. Most of their worst problems come from the remaining socialised sector&#x2014;education, health care and local government. All three stubbornly display the same incorrigible deficiencies everywhere associated 'with politicised control; namely, financial laxity, overman-ning, public sector unions, national wage setting, misdirected investment and insensitivity to consumer choice and convenience. That is why I believe that we need more Thatcherism and not more fudge.<lb/>
Thirdly, the Government's most surprising income-petence is the failure to keep down inflation. Again, it is not a failure of market policies but of the politicised sector, which reflects no credit on any party. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, displayed a good deal of hindsight in his criticisms. Liberal and Labour spokesmen throughout the 1980s vied with one another in scoffing at monetary policy and calling for more government spending and lower rates of interest. According to Professor Tim Congdon, it was the abandonment of monetary targets and the switch to shadowing the deutschmark that fuelled the Lawson inflation after 1987.<lb/>
The question that neither the Treasury nor the Opposition&#x2014;nor the noble Lord, Lord Williams&#x2014;seems capable of answering is the following. If the Bundesbank can deploy monetary policy to regulate the deutschmark why cannot we rediscover the success that enabled Sir Geoffrey Howe, assisted by the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, and, from a distance, Professor Alan Walters, to bring down inflation from 20 per cent. to below 5 per cent. in the early 1980s? I fear that the necessary discipline will prove no more palatable for tying sterling at an arbitrary rate to the deutschmark inside the ERM. Indeed, we may soon find that the result will be to throw a still heavier burden of adjustment on high interest rates and unemployment.<lb/>
I come now to the second amendment, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, which regrets that Her Majesty's Government,
<quote>"persist in separating the single market from other European Community initiatives, notably a single currency".</quote>
I shall try to match his moderation of language and tone and the avoidance of cricketing metaphors.<lb/>
As a strong supporter of the open single market, associated with the name of the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, I hope to avoid the self-righteous moralising of some Euro-zealots, of which I detected just a whiff in the mostly earnest waffle of my old friend Sir Geoffrey Howe yesterday. My settled view is that the intemperate campaign that we have witnessed to make M. Delors' timetable for the EMU a test of Euro virility ill serves the aim of full economic integration through the single market, which should
<col>352</col>
unite us all as our still far from accomplished priority. I shall content myself with posing some further questions which can no longer be dodged in the coming days.<lb/>
My first question is whether we can be sure that a single currency promoted by the same people who manipulate the common agricultural policy would prove as stable as the deutschmark&#x2014;which anyway has lost two-thirds of its value since 1950. The second question follows on: how can true independence of a central Eurobank be reconciled with some degree of accountability? It may be noticed that even President Pohl of the Bundesbank seems less independent of Chancellor Kohl at some times than at others.<lb/>
Thirdly, does the EC conform to the textbook requirements for an optimum currency area, or would its economic diversity aggravate political tensions and require huge continuing regional subsidies to the adversely affected regions? Fourthly, would a single currency impede entry of East European nations, to which I am becoming increasingly attached as a regular visitor to the Soviet Union? Fifthly, would a single currency be designed by the characteristic European processes of national interest bargaining and compromise beloved by Mr. Heseltine, which so easily descend into shifty prevarication and retreat in the name of some phoney consensus?<lb/>
Sixthly, is a single currency imposed in the end by political clout preferable to the evolution of a stable currency tested in practice&#x2014;like the old gold standard &#x2014;by the evolutionary discovery procedure of competition? Seventhly, with so many uncertainties, might M. Delors' pet EMU turn out to be the greatest gamble since the South Sea Bubble which, as your Lordships remember, invited support for projects that "will hereafter be promulgated"?<lb/>
For too long, those questions have been ducked by those whom I shall now christen the Euro-dodgers. My final question therefore is: when such conscien-tious doubts, widely shared by leading scholars in Europe and beyond, are, whether loftily or cynically, falsely dismissed as evidence of anti-European sentiment, is the Prime Minister not performing yet another invaluable service to our country and beyond by expressing them with all her characteristic candour? If present local difficulties provoke an open and balanced national debate of our relations with a wider Europe, I have no doubt that the Prime Minister's stand will be vindicated. Meanwhile, I suggest that there are reputable and weighty grounds for noble Lords to vote against both these unbalanced amendments.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03255"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the first time I have had the pleasure of addressing your Lordships' House since I had the privilege of sitting on the Front Bench. This is in many ways my real maiden speech, for this time the words are all mine and not those of nameless officials labouring deep into the night. If your Lordships' House has benefited from my absence for the past 16 months&#x2014;as I suspect it has &#x2014;I have to say with great sadness that I fear that the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0216"/>
<col>353</col>
noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, has not. His grasp of economic policy and his understanding of the current position has advanced little, if at all, since I stood down, but I am an optimist by nature and have great hopes for his ultimate redemption.<lb/>
This afternoon I do not wish to deal with the general thrust of government economic policy; that was ably dealt with by my noble friend not many minutes ago. But I should like to deal with two specific areas: first, Europe, and then the duopoly review which my right honourable friend in another place, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, announced yesterday. In connection with the latter, in the presence of my noble friend Lord Sharp of Grimsdyke, my predecessor, I should like to declare an interest as the executive chairman of Cable and Wireless, whose subsidiaries, Mercury and Mercury Personal Communications, operate in our domestic telecommunications industry.<lb/>
An enormous amount has been said about Europe over the past two or three weeks. The amount of paper consumed debating the points will have destroyed countless trees, if not forests. But when all was said and done, what was it that the Prime Minister was saying in Rome? I believe she was saying simply that we should get our priorities right. It may well be that one day we shall have a single currency in Europe; it may be that one day we shall have some form of political union across the whole of Europe. That day is still distant. Whether it takes one year, two years, decades, or even centuries, we will all one day find out.<lb/>
In the meantime, there is a far more urgent and pressing question; the GATT round. Here I must declare another interest because I happen to be a member of a faintly ridiculously-named group called the Eminent Persons Group on World Trade. Part of our function for the past nine months has been to draw to the attention of world leaders the real problems facing us all if the Uruguay round of GATT is not successfully concluded.<lb/>
I can say without fear of contradiction that GATT is one of the most boring subjects around. During my time in office at the DTI I had to summon all of the willpower I had just to get down to the minutiae of details that it entailed. But it is just as important as it is boring. Let none of us in this House forget the terrible decade of the 'thirties that led on to the orgy of destruction of the 'forties, which was not caused by the stock market crash of 1929 or indeed of any other year. After all, time after time we have seen how the world carries on after stock market crashes. What took the world down into that awful depression was the sound of barriers being erected in country after country, first in the United States and then elsewhere &#x2014;barriers erected as some form of protection, in the mindless thought that it would protect home industries.<lb/>
We are today very close to history repeating itself. One has only to read the protectionist speeches being made day after day in Congress to know that, if the Uruguay round were to fail or be fudged, one could see a series of bilateral deals being negotiated by the
<col>354</col>
United States of America. Only 10 days ago Senator Lloyd Bensen was here, and I am told he was arguing that if the round fails it will, in his words, reward the virtuous and penalise the bad. The definition of "good" and "bad" depends only on where one is sitting.<lb/>
One has only to read the recent press statement of M. Calvet to realise that similar protectionist views are to the fore in France. He for one&#x2014;and he represents a considerable strand of Community thinking&#x2014;would like to deem all Japanese cars built in this country which have an agreed 80 per cent. European content as Japanese until at least the turn of the century. What would that do for the average citizen of the Community? Why should we all be condemned to pay more for an inferior product?<lb/>
What has that to do with Europe? The principal complaint of the Prime Minister was that the agricultural Ministers could not agree a position with which to return to the negotiating chamber. We, the Community, were the only party out of more than 100 negotiating parties who could not agree a position to negotiate. When a great deal is said about Europe we should remind ourselves that those who were foremost in advocating a united Europe were foremost in resisting an agreement in their own national self-interest.<lb/>
But&#x2014;I fear too late&#x2014;we may have come to an agreement. I remind your Lordships' House of the position. The American attitude was that it wanted a 75 per cent. reduction in agricultural subsidies over a five-year or 10-year period. The painfully agreed position of the Community&#x2014;a 30 per cent. reduction &#x2014;is seen at first sight to be a step forward until one realises that it is calculated from 1986 levels and is probably worth at best no more than 12 per cent. or 13 per cent. I am told that fine print, negotiated in the last hectic hours of that negotiation, negates much of that saving. My information is that the Cairns group and possibly the United States are thinking seriously of walking out from the negotiating chamber.<lb/>
We have less than one month left. The consequences of a failure of the GATT round would be far greater than the failure of those talks over Europe. I can think of no better example of the battle of form over substance than the spectacle of our other 11 partners in Europe refusing even to discuss GATT in Rome but instead spending all their time and energies on setting a date for the start of new financial disciplines that have yet to be agreed.<lb/>
Not only have they yet to be agreed; they still have to be defined. Are we talking of one independent central bank or are we talking of 12? Will countries within the Community run their own deficits; or will there be independent central control over national expenditures? Shall we have a hard ecu, a parallel ecu or a single ecu? Those are questions that have not yet even been formulated let alone answered. We are surely returning to the days of debates over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin if we agree the starting date first and think of the substance later.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0217"/>
<col>355</col>
I should like also to make some comments about telecommunications policy and in particular about the duopoly review. I remind noble Lords of the interest that I declared a few moments ago. I have always been a supporter of open markets. That prescription applies to telecommunications as much as to any other industry. I championed liberalisation when I was in government. However I was always conscious that some regulation was needed to keep the telecommunications market open.<lb/>
Perhaps I may give three examples of what liberalisation has already achieved. The earliest example of liberalisation was in the equipment field. The Government announced early in 1981 that in future members of the public would be able to buy their own telephone. Many noble Lords will remember that until that time we had a choice of two: a Trimphone from BT, or nothing. Two days after that announcement, I remember seeing a notice in a shop window in Mayfair announcing that telephones were for sale. They were all totally illegal at the time. However the market responded. Today we have a tremendous choice of equipment for people to use in their own homes.<lb/>
Secondly, let us consider cellular mobile tele-phones. In about 1984 or 1985, West Germany and the United Kingdom agreed to introduce forms of cellular telephones. West Germany has 20 per cent. more population and the standard of living income was 25 per cent. higher than that in this country. However, both of us estimated that by the end of the decade we would each have about 100,000 subscribers. In Germany they licensed one operator; in this country we licensed two. The Germans achieved their target. There were 100,000 subscribers in 1980. We have I million users. The power of competition reduced the price. That ensured that this country has a better mobile telecommunications market than almost anywhere else in the world.<lb/>
My final example of the beneficial effect of competition is closer to home. I hope that noble Lords will forgive a small commercial. Last week Mercury reduced the price of a three-minute call to the United States to &#x00A3;1.20. Ten years ago, when there was only one carrier, the call cost the equivalent of &#x00A3;3.03 in today's money. How many other commodities have dropped in price by over two-thirds in real terms over that period?<lb/>
Competition has already brought better quality services, more variety and lower prices. I therefore welcome the Government's discussion document published yesterday which emphasises a further opening of the market. The proposals in that document continue the process of telecommunications deregulation of which my noble friend Lord Joseph is the father. My involvement in that process began when I had the privilege to serve as his special adviser. I should like to comment briefly from the perspective of my personal experience. Before doing so perhaps I may say that the reaction within Cable and Wireless and Mercury to the duopoly review is to welcome it with a sense of excitement at the opportunities, and confidence in the future. With more opportunities to
<col>356</col>
offer a greater variety of services to more customers, they regard the review as positive for their customers and indeed for themselves.<lb/>
Putting that interest aside, my personal reaction stems from my belief that more open markets will benefit the consumer. I do not agree with those who argue that ending the duopoly will harm the cause of BT's competitors&#x2014;quite the contrary. The more open the market the greater the opportunities that it will bring. In due course perhaps the market will evolve a second force, not one imposed by government fiat but a much stronger one imposed by market forces.<lb/>
If there is one measure in yesterday's document which I commend to your Lordships' House it is the support given to the principle of equal access. It provides the most effective way of introducing competition into long-distance communications. It dramatically lowers the barriers to entry. The United States has adopted equal access as the main means of introducing competition into long-distance com-munications. Competitors have taken 35 per cent. of the market from AT&amp;T. In one part of the United Kingdom we too have a competitive regime. It is in Hull. Over the past two years Mercury has taken more than a 50 per cent. share of the long-distance market because it has the virtue of open access.<lb/>
I very much hope that all parties in the industry will accept the proposal that equal access should be implemented. I hope that all will co-operate in its implementation and that few will obstruct it. Some critics have accused the industry of conspiring against the consumer. Early implementation of equal access by all parties in the industry will enable us to prove them wrong.<lb/>
This afternoon I have touched upon two topics: Europe and telecommunications. I believe that both are critical to our country's economic future. Neither topic is easy. In both cases I believe that the general thrust of government policy is correct. There will of course be a great debate about the details, but the policy is correct. The details will follow later.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03257"><member>Baroness Castle of Blackburn</member><membercontribution>: Fellow Peers, this is the third maiden speech that I have made in my three phases of parliamentary life. The first was in the House of Commons; then I spoke in the European Parliament; and now in this historic House. You may say, "Some maiden after 45 years of public life&#x0021;". Indeed a journalist said to me at lunch-time today that politics must be the only profession in which one can be a maiden three times.<lb/>
The House will understand if I feel more than usually irked by the conventions attaching to a maiden speech. I am also very conscious of the fact that we all have half our minds on the excitement going on in another place, with dead sheep and dead parrots leaping to life all over the place. Nonetheless, I feel that this is a good moment for me to make my maiden speech, because it is a moment at which both this House and another place are deeply exercised in their minds about what should be Britain's relationship with the European Community.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0218"/>
<col>357</col>
I have watched for 10 years in the European Parliament the British Government muddling through a love-hate relationship with the European Community: willing to wound and afraid to leave. It has been very interesting to observe that the European Parliament and indeed the members of the Commission had a greater respect&#x2014;I might almost say affection&#x2014;for those of us who had been overtly against Britain's membership in the first place and remained highly critical. They felt that at least there was there a sincerity and a curious kind of comradeship, whereas the British Government continued to patronise them. The Prime Minister, even when she was conducting a very legitimate battle to reduce Britain's contribution to European funds, outraged the Parliament by talking about "our money" when she among others had voted for Britain's entry into the Community on terms which meant that we clearly earmarked part of our money to be their own resources.<lb/>
All along, they felt there was something deeply insincere about the British Government's attitude, although they talked about being good Europeans and of course the Prime Minister, at Stuttgart and other summits, signed the communiqu&#x00E9; pledging herself along with the rest to proceed rapidly towards European union. And ever since she has complained that the others did not know what they meant by it. Of course she enthusiastically endorsed the internal market. We were one of the prime instigators in that. Now she complains about the threat to national sovereignty. What is the internal market but a threat to national sovereignty? It is far more than just a wider commercial market: it is the introduction of a situation in which any Community firm, Community worker or Community professional will have equal rights with their British counterpart in our country.<lb/>
Finally, she takes us into the Exchange Rate Mechanism simply as a political sop to her own restive party conference. Do not think this goes unobserved over there in Europe. They are not fools: they have got us all sized up. She took us in on the worst of all possible terms. Madrid was forgotten. She has taken us in on an over-valued currency at a time of record inflation and at a time of the worst balance of payments situation in Europe, with one of the lowest growths in Europe and in a situation in which we are least well equipped to deal with the disciplines involved.<lb/>
It is no wonder the Chancellor of the Exchequer admits at last&#x2014;it is dragged out of him&#x2014;that in this country we are heading for a recession. He says it is moderate, but that is not what the CBI says or what its survey reveals. So it is a question of recession and it is going to get worse in 1991. He admits that growth will fall to 0.5 per cent. Unemployment will rise, perhaps by 1 million&#x2014;certainly to well over 2 million &#x2014;and already, under the constraints of this recession, made worse by the terms of our membership of the ERM and the way we went into it, firms in this country are cutting back on the investment of which we are already so dangerously short. Take some small
<col>358</col>
businesses of the kind that have been referred to earlier by other speakers. I was in my local butcher's shop only the other day: a nice prosperous little local butcher's shop. The owner said to me, "Mrs. Castle, if this goes on I will be shut in six months' time." That is happening all over this country, and the way in which we have tied ourselves to a new form of the gold standard can only make that matter worse.<lb/>
So, as a country, we are now faced&#x2014;all because the economists tell us that this is only the start and it will lead us irresistibly on to a single currency and a European central bank&#x2014;with a dreadful choice. If the economists who are enlightening us on all these complex matters in column after column of the business sections of our great national newspapers are correct, we shall at last belatedly have to face the choice into which we have drifted as a result of this Government's policies. Either we must go forward into greater monetary union, which will wreak havoc on our weakened economy, or we shall be left out.<lb/>
I do not like either of those choices and I do not think the majority of the Members of this House like them either. So what are we to do? We have left it very late: perhaps too late. But one always has to work constructively and hope for a third way. I believe there is just an outside chance of a third way, a way in which we could at last regain the ear of the European Community which is now closed to us by the Prime Minister's style, and not only by her style but also by her philosophy.<lb/>
I think the way is this. I know from my experience in the European Parliament, where I had so many good friends with whom I could argue constructively and effectively, that their desire for union is very strong and very deep. I remember talking to a couple of young Belgian socialists who said, "You know, Barbara, we were born into the Community: we do not like a lot of it any more than you do but we have never known anything else." That is a scenario which will not be altered by lecturing, hectoring and bullying. You have to understand it, and they do want closer integration.<lb/>
However, what has happened because of so much confusion of thought in Europe is that the financiers, the big boys, the bankers, the City boys have jumped in and turned that desire for greater integration into their form of monetary and economic union, with all the consequences that we all know for the weaker economies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself said the other day to Peter Jay on the BBC's "Money Programme" that to go for a single currency with so many unequal economies in Europe would lead to massive unemployment and massive movements of population from the weaker areas to the more prosperous ones. My heavens&#x0021; he must have been reading my speeches.<lb/>
He is right of course, but what has he offered as an alternative? There is an alternative for which the European Community itself is crying out. That alternative is a planned Community policy to create the convergence between the stronger and weaker economies which at present does not exist. We know &#x2014;do we not?&#x2014;that we fall into the category of weaker
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0219"/>
<col>359</col>
economies. Herr Pail told us this during his recent visit to London. He said that weaker economies should not join the monetary union because they could riot stand the pace and they had better stay out and wait a bit. He meant us.<lb/>
I tell the House that Europe does not like the idea of a two-tier Europe: the people of the Community do not like it, nor, certainly, do the members of the European Parliament. In that body I have heard as much talk about the need for convergence in order to bring tie economies closer together as I have heard about mechanistic monetary union. There have been many reports and resolutions on the need for a stronger regional policy and for a battle against unemployment; for the helping of the smaller man; for the extension of training standards and harmonisation of the human elements; for the treatment of the elderly and guaranteeing them a minimum standard of life; and the fight for women's rights. All those matters have occupied the European Parliament. That is what is meant by a European Community&#x2014;a people's Europe. That should bring the lowest up to the standard of the highest. Even the strongest economies like Germany know that that is absolutely essential if the Community is to work.<lb/>
The other day there was a debate on monetary and economic union and on the internal market. I can remember a Portuguese socialist reminding the Parliament that a worker in a German factory earned eight times as much as a Portuguese worker in the same type of factory. That is not what Germany wants. It can see that the whole thing will blow up in our faces unless we harmonise in the most constructive way.<lb/>
I tell the Members of this House why that is so. The Community is alienated from our British Government not merely because of the Prime Minister's Boadicea chariot-type nationalism but because of her nine-teenth century Victorian values which are out of date: unregulated free enterprise; keep government out. When she rejected Jacques Delors' charter of fundamental social rights she said, "I am not going to have socialism brought in by the back Delors"&#x0021; Do not believe that those remarks go unnoted. Why should we be listened to when we are no longer strong? Also, we are not listening nor are we co-operating in the great Community effort to lift the economic standards; throughout the whole Community to the level of the best.<lb/>
The issue is this. We should lead that campaign in Europe by saying that convergence must come before monetary union. Left to itself, monetary union will make matters worse. I believe that millions of voices are ready to listen to us in the European Community.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03259"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, little did I think, when I first had the privilege of meeting the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, some 40 years ago that I should have the privilege and pleasure on behalf of your Lordships of thanking her for the most stimulating and exciting maiden speech to which I have listened. I did not listen to her other two maiden speeches, which may have
<col>360</col>
been the same. I suspect that they were. However, it is good to know that after all her experience not only has she not lost her fire, her enthusiasm and her capacity for straight speaking but she has been able to combine them with the traditional non-controversial speech which is our custom. It makes me even more anxious to listen to her future speeches when she will not be trammelled by any such impediments of convention.<lb/>
So far we have been listening to a series of fine, able, electioneering speeches, with the exception of the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham. I hope that your Lordships will not be surprised and will not object if I do not follow the electioneering speeches which we have been privileged to hear. However, I shall follow the first point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, because I agree with him that when one compares the problems of the Uruguay round with the other problems which are exercising politicians in this country and in Europe today, there can be no question but that a successful outcome to the Uruguay round will have a far greater impact on the prosperity of the whole world than any of the other matters which we have been discussing. I share the noble Lord's fears as to what will happen to world trade if we fail to reach agreement. There is not now much time to enable such agreement to be reached.<lb/>
There can be no doubt in any of our minds that the reason that we are having such difficulty in the Uruguay round is solely because of the Community's agriculture. Several points must be borne in mind when we are discussing that. First, throughout a very large part of the world&#x2014;and we must not forget the third world in particular&#x2014;and certainly within the European Community agriculture is going through a very difficult time. I know that it is nothing new for farmers to complain of recession, bankruptcy, and so on. However, on this occasion I say quite frankly that they are speaking the truth. We have a grave problem in agriculture which must be faced today.<lb/>
I shall not weary your Lordships with too many figures, but since 1979 there has been a decline in the real income of farmers which averages 9 per cent. per annum in real terms. That is a quite serious and steady decline. Interest payments to the banks by farmers in the same period have risen from something less than &#x00A3;260 million per year to something over &#x00A3;950 million. Total bank borrowing has risen from just over &#x00A3;2 billion to &#x00A3;6.5 billion. Those figures are far more important than any statistics produced about bankruptcies, and so on. Farming is particularly resistant to the bankruptcies of the butcher of the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, smaller shopkeepers and people of that kind. When farming profits decline, the farmer does not do his job properly and he knows that. Above all, and of particular interest to the public at large, he is unable to do his duty in looking after the environment.<lb/>
We need only look at what happened in this country during the agricultural depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s to see what that meant. I am firmly convinced that help must be given to farmers not only in this country but throughout the world. I
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0220"/>
<col>361</col>
do not believe that people realise sufficiently what an enormously capital-intensive industry is agriculture. The reason we have such good agriculture today&#x2014;we are proud of it, and the consumer benefits from that as does the country's economy as a whole&#x2014;is that for the past 50 years we have enjoyed stability. That has encouraged not only farmers to invest their money but also manufacturers to invest their money in producing new appliances and in developing them also.<lb/>
The chemical industry spends billions of pounds a year conducting research into various agro-chemicals which make possible a new and efficient form of agriculture. The seed breeders, the basic scientists and the genetic engineers for plant breeders have all contributed. Their work will take 20 years to come to fruition; they will not invest that money unless there is a degree of stability in the industry, something which has fortunately been given to us over the past 50 years.<lb/>
That is a lesson learnt by virtually all countries throughout the world. For more than a century most European countries have protected their agriculture; certainly for half a century we have done so in Britain. But it is not only a matter considered within the Community. I apologise for bringing statistics to your Lordships' attention, but they are significant. They are taken from the OECD publication of 1989. New Zealand, the least protected country of all, gives 2,000 dollars per head to each of its farmers; Australia gives 4,000 dollars; the EC, surprisingly, gives only 8,000 dollars&#x2014;double Australia's support; Canada gives 13,000 dollars; Japan gives 15,000 dollars; the United States gives 20,000 dollars to each farmer. The differences, to a large extent, are dependent on whether the farms in those countries are large or small.<lb/>
I shall restate those figures as a percentage of a farmer's income. New Zealand farmers depend on subsidies of one kind or another for a mere 5 per cent. of their income; in Australia the level is 10 per cent.; in America it is 27 per cent.; in Canada 35 per cent.; in the EC 38 per cent., and in Japan a colossal 72 per cent. Therefore the Community should not be the only scapegoat. It is simply doing the same, to a greater or lesser extent, as all the other countries. Without some, often substantial, help, many farmers throughout the world would face bankruptcy and much land would be deserted.<lb/>
Help is needed. I hope that point is accepted by noble Lords and others. However, the help should not be that provided by the present common agricultural policy. That may possibly have been sufficient when first introduced in the old days for a Community of six, with food shortages and memories of war and all the troubles that then existed. Today it is completely useless and harmful to the agriculture and trade of the Community and the world. We must wipe the slate clean and evolve an entirely new policy. In so doing there is another factor which must be borne in mind.<lb/>
Within the next five years or possibly sooner, the countries of Eastern and Central Europe will have revived their agriculture. They will once more become, as they were in the years before the war, major
<col>362</col>
exporters of agricultural products. Interestingly, two years before the war Bulgaria exported 30 billion dollars' worth of agricultural produce; Czechoslovakia exported 25 billion dollars' worth, and Poland 43 billion dollars' worth. Hungary, Romania and what was until recently East Germany were also huge producers of surpluses, and were countries which were looking for overseas markets for those surpluses.<lb/>
That situation will return once their economies begin to thrive. At the same time they will be more closely associated with the EC than at present. Any plans which are evolved for dealing with the present problem must bear in mind that it is not only the need to contain our existing surplus in the Community of 12 which must be considered; we shall have to deal with the far greater export surplus of those other countries.<lb/>
I shall not repeat at this stage what I have said on other occasions regarding the right way of dealing with the problem. I simply remind those noble Lords who may have listened to me on other occasions of the kind of approach there should be. First, we should abolish intervention buying, and the enormously costly and trade-disruptive method of subsidised exports. That would greatly please all our colleagues in the GATT. At the same time farmers and the countryside must have support, so we must make payments to them of some kind or another. It should be left to each individual member state, without disrupting the Community and its agricultural policy, to decide the best way to distribute such sums as are allocated from Brussels among farmers so as to fulfil the purposes of, above all, maintaining and improving the environment; paying farmers for doing what the public want rather than producing food which the public does not want.<lb/>
Those are the bare outlines of a scheme. It is, alas, too late to work out the exact details of such a plan in time for the Uruguay Round. However, I urge Her Majesty's Government to speak to their colleagues in Europe and try to persuade them to go to the Uruguay Round with proposals along those lines. They should say, "We suggest this. We will collaborate with you, and if you have a better idea let us use that". Above all, they must abolish intervention buying and the dumping on world markets of export surpluses. At the same time they must protect our own farmers and our environment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03261"><member>Lord Butterfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am honoured to have the opportunity to convey my personal congratula-tions, and I am sure those of other noble Lords, to the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, on her third maiden speech. I am particularly grateful to the Whips for giving me this opportunity. When I was a lowly professor and vice-chancellor in Nottingham I received the most courteous and kind reception and help from the noble Baroness when she was running the Department of Health and Social Security. I should like her to know that for many years&#x2014;it is still to be found on my bookshelves&#x2014;her work on the priorities in medicine was a great help to me when I
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0221"/>
<col>363</col>
was thinking about the future of the health service; it is one of the most thumbed reference books from the government of all my collection.<lb/>
I can say in the presence of the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, that we have had an outstanding series of maiden speeches. The noble Baroness, Lady Castle, has certainly maintained the high standard.<lb/>
I conclude my congratulations to the noble Baroness by saying that I only wish I could speak with the same fervour, eloquence and enthusiasm that she commands on European issues which I espouse just as strongly and deeply as she does.<lb/>
I shall speak about a quite different and, in my view, quite precious part of our economy; namely, our young people and particularly our able young people. Europe has different forms of educational process. I am intrigued by the German procedure which permits people to repeat parts of their courses. I do not believe that that would be popular in this country, although I have to tell your Lordships that I had to repeat a course when I was a medical student. I returned from the States, failed an obstetrics exam and had to take it again. When I attained the position of Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge I was pleased to hear from my immediate predecessor, Professor Joseph Mitchell, that he too had failed obstetrics. It is a great help when speaking to distressed students who have failed an exam to be able to start the exchange by saying, "I have done the same and I know exactly how sad you feel".<lb/>
The other side of the German system which may cause some difficulties for our young people is that it takes a long time to get through the educational process. Indeed, young people in their late twenties and early thirties are just emerging from their masters degrees in German universities and going on to the labour market. Therefore, there is a way of employing young people in Germany which probably assists the employment figures.<lb/>
By contrast&#x2014;and here I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, for providing me with a report from the Thames-Chiltern Chamber of Commerce and Industry about European school education&#x2014;it is disturbing to hear how distressing it is for people visiting Nantes, a university town with over 20,000 students, to find that they are solicited so often by young unemployed people who are begging.<lb/>
Therefore, although I know that all our young people have a great hope of becoming Europeans I am sure they will want to proceed step by step into the new situation. I do not know whether that is what the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, meant by convergence but if it is, I know that that is what the young people are striving for in the university world, in the polytechnics and elsewhere.<lb/>
I put down my name to speak in this debate because I was anxious that at least someone should say how pleased they were that in the gracious Speech the Government indicated their intention to take action to improve quality in education. I am sure that all noble Lords were as delighted as I was to hear later, in the Autumn Statement, that the Government are to spend
<col>364</col>
an additional &#x00A3;500 million on education, and that a great deal of that is to finance the record number of students that we now have in higher education.<lb/>
I have to tell your Lordships that I spoke to people in the office of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and I shall report directly what was said. They are pleased with the outturn of the Autumn Statement. Indeed, one lady said that perhaps we should subscribe to send the Chancellor a bunch of roses. I am not sure of the political significance of the rose but that is exactly what was said and it is a point on which the Government can take some pleasure.<lb/>
I have also spoken to Sir Ronald Dearing, chairman of the Polytechnic and Colleges Funding Council. He is delighted with the additional infusion of money for the rising number of students, but he is worried that there is still a backlog of maintenance work that needs to be carried out on the polytechnic buildings. Your Lordships will remember that the polytechnic buildings stayed under the control of local authorities long after it was clear that they were to be transferred to a funding council. Not surprisingly, maintenance was not a high priority within the local authorities who were to give away these buildings.<lb/>
I should also point out, lest people think that we are over-pleased and over-optimistic, that there is hardly a research laboratory in British universities where people are not lamenting that much better equipment is available to those with whom they are competing in Germany, Japan and sometimes, perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Dunn, in Hong Kong. Therefore, I should not like it to be thought that, although we are doing better and achieving a much higher proportion of the 18 to 19 age group getting into higher education, we shall not be continuing, like everyone else to make pleas and demands for support for our young people in the way they are polished and assisted in their way forward.<lb/>
I conclude by saying that there are other parts of the work of universities which fit in with points in the gracious Speech. The gracious Speech stated that the Government,
<quote>"will promote further international co-operation on environmental issues".</quote>
I remembered, and extracted from my filing system, the work that the universities are doing on the environment generally. I give your Lordships a few examples so that you can see that a good investment is being made in our universities and young people, which is the main point that I wanted to make. Computer models from the University of Anglia Climatic Research Unit are being used to predict the global greenhouse effect and to provide information for planning in the future. Bradford University is mapping the lichens on trees in order to follow what is happening as a result of acid rain. The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology is mapping acid rain hot spots in Britain. As regards the ozone hole, which is related to the greenhouse effect, I am glad to say that atmospheric modelling at the University of Cambridge is providing international workers in that field with helpful information. I could
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0222"/>
<col>365</col>
go on and refer to the investigation of natural resources at Reading, Newcastle and Strathclyde. Others are keeping a close eye on oceanography.<lb/>
Perhaps I should also mention that the gracious Speech included a reference to the Government maintaining a substantial aid programme for the developing countries. I should like you to know that there are committees of the British Council which do great work in assisting developing countries. Your Lordships will also be well aware that the Association of Commonwealth Universities does all it can to find people to assist the universities in the Commonwealth. A great deal of private work is going on. I have the privilege occasionally of going to Oman. Qaboos University in Oman is largely based on advice given by university administrators from Oxford University.<lb/>
I hope that with those few brief words I have been able to remind your Lordships that we have an important economic heritage&#x2014;perhaps "asset" would be a better word, although it is becoming a heritage &#x2014;in our young people, and I hope that the Government will continue to do all they can to foster them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03263"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who has had the privilege and pleasure, on and off, during the past 45 years of listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Castle of Blackburn, perhaps I may say what a personal pleasure it was for me to have the opportunity of hearing her again this afternoon. I hope she will allow me to say that that pleasure was accentuated by the fact that, far from having lost any of her previous vigour, she seems stronger and more determined than ever. As such, she gave great pleasure to all her admirers, among whom I venture to number myself. I am sure that she will be a very great asset to your Lordships' House and I hope she will speak frequently on issues, though I somehow doubt whether I shall always find myself in the completest agreement with her.<lb/>
I am in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, on one point. At the beginning of his speech he said, I thought very rightly, that it was a pity that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, had put down his amendment on a very important subject; but it is a separate one which your Lordships' House will in any case be debating on 22nd November.<lb/>
I shall, therefore, confine myself to the amendment which the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, so eloquently, forcefully and inaccurately proposed. When I looked at the Order Paper and saw the extraordinary proposition which he had tabled by way of amendment I began to feel that he had an unsuspected sense of humour. For the spokesman of the Labour Party to come forward with criticism of anybody else for incompetent management of the economy argued a degree of courage, determination and forgetfulness that I had not previously associated with the noble Lord.<lb/>
<col>366</col>
One must admit that on the subject of incompetent economic administration the Labour Party speaks with enormous authority. It has great experience on the subject; it has displayed it in every administration that it has formed. I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Jay, in his place. As he will recall, the government of which he was an ornament, until I succeeded him as Financial Secretary in 1951, left our economy in the most awful mess. It is unnecessary to remind the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, that in the 1970s the Labour Government had to call in the IMF to bail us out. Therefore, it argues extreme determination and courage on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, to accuse the present Government of incompetent management of the economy&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03264"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to say that every government to which I have belonged, whether as ornament or not, began life with a huge balance of payments deficit left by a Conservative Government and ended their term of office with a balance of payments surplus.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03265"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord is trying to attribute blame he will recall that the government of the late Lord Attlee to which I referred succeeded a coalition government in which Lord Attlee was Deputy Prime Minister. I forget whether the noble Lord, Lord Jay, was a member of that government&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03266"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is not even accurate about that. They succeeded a caretaker government which did not include the Labour Party.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03267"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is of course pedantically right; they succeeded a caretaker government which lasted for about four weeks. However, that is utterly irrelevant to the argument and no one knows that better than the noble Lord. The succession as regards the management of economic policy fell to the coalition government and the noble Lord will well recall that in 1951 they left behind them a mess.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, charges the present Government with incompetent manage-ment of the economy. Does he realise the actions which this Government have taken? For nine successive years there has been a substantial growth in the economy, the first time that has happened in this century. Business investment is now at an un-precedented rate. Is that incompetent management of the economy? There are more people at work in this country today than ever. Is that incompetent management of the economy? The unemployment rate in this country is one of the lowest in Europe and it is particularly low among young people. Is that incompetent management of the economy?<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned the fact, apparently critically, that living standards have risen substanti-ally. He will find that most people outside this House are thankful for that. The standard of life for ordinary people is higher than ever, and there is frequent possession of cars, television sets, washing machines, refrigerators and so forth. That represents a higher
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0223"/>
<col>367</col>
standard of material life and existence than this country has ever known. Is that attributable to incompetent management of the economy?<lb/>
As was mentioned by my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal, for three successive years there has been a repayment of the national debt which is now lower than at any time since before the 1914 war. That is a change which will save subsequent generations substantial interest payments and it has liberated capital for productive use. Can that be described as incompetent management of the economy? It does not appear that the noble Lord has begun to establish a case for that argument. The noble Lord tended to dismiss the service industries as being unimportant, yet their growth has done an enormous amount to build up the strength of the national economy. The noble Lord may be aware that the more advanced an economy the higher the proportion of its effort is in the service industries as compared with the manufacturing industries. He has only to look at the United States to see that that is so. In addition there has been a steady reduction in the levels of taxation. Most people would not regard the reduction in the levels of direct taxation as being a mark of incompetence. Most people are grateful for it and would "like to see it go further.<lb/>
The noble Lord was wrong to quote the CBI in defence of his position. He may have seen the letter published in <i>The Times</i> last Thursday written by my noble friend Lord Hanson who is a major supporter of the CBI. It includes the following sentence:
<quote>"This government has achieved immeasurable benefits for everyone in industry over the last ten years and now that the country is facing a downturn the last thing we need is statements which can be seen as attacks from what might ordinarily be perceived to be the industry's natural supporters".</quote>
If the noble Lord, Lord Williams, was trying to quote the CBI, his witness appears to have let him down.<lb/>
Noble Lords who travel regularly on the Underground will be familiar with the intoned advice, "mind the gap". When I listen to the noble Lord's speeches the expression "mind the gap", comes into my mind. There always appears to be a gap between the argument that he is trying to sustain and the facts that he is presenting in support of it&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03268"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the gap in the noble Lord's mind to which he is referring?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03269"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted that the noble Lord should equate himself with me but I refer to the gap in his distinguished mentality. Probably he does not have to use the Underground but the expression "mind the gap" is only too familiar to those of us who do. There is a gap in the noble Lord's reasoning.<lb/>
Noble Lords may recall that when speaking the noble Lord, Lord Williams, never touched on what is the really important issue: that the creation of wealth is what everything else depends on. Many noble Lords, myself included, can make appeals for various good directions of expenditure&#x2014;areas where we should like to spend more, where we could relieve poverty and improve the situation. However, that is
<col>368</col>
all dependent upon the creation of wealth. Unless the economic policy of a government helps in that way all the other good things that they may wish to do become impossible. Yet the noble Lord devoted none of his speech to the basic question: what is the best way of creating wealth and are the Government going the right way about it? It is upon the correct solution of that problem that the solution of all our other problems absolutely depends.<lb/>
I shall devote the remaining part of my speech to one or two suggestions for making even further improvements in the creation of wealth. If we can create more wealth there is so much more that we can do. As the experience of the Labour Party should convince the noble Lord, failure in the creation of wealth results in failure to achieve all the other admirable public-spirited objectives that one may have.<lb/>
I suggest that a 40 per cent. rate of direct taxation, although lower than it used to be, is still very high indeed. I trust that my noble friend will be able to hold out some hope that the rate will come down. Such a high rate hampers wealth creation. It gives an incentive to able people, particularly able young people with a high earning capacity, to go abroad where they do not have to submit to such a heavy levy. It is also an incentive to older people to remove themselves to the Channel Islands or other places where they are not subjected to these heavy rates of taxation.<lb/>
It is an illusion to believe that a high rate of tax brings in a high revenue return. That does not happen because the higher the rate of tax the greater the incentive to people to avoid it, either by perfectly legal and technical methods or by illegal methods and refusal to disclose. Therefore the higher the rate of tax the smaller the percentage of the nominal yield. The converse is undoubtedly true&#x2014;and experience has shown it&#x2014;that the lower the rate of direct taxation the higher the proportion of the possible yield going to the Treasury.<lb/>
I very much criticise the incidence of VAT. It is an inflationary tax, particularly where it is imposed upon labour costs. From that point of view it compares very badly with the old purchase tax, which the noble Lord, Lord Jay, will recall, as he used to administer it before I followed him in doing so. The old purchase tax was adjustable so that it did not inflate the cost of living. It was very high on luxuries. I recall that the rate was 66.66 per cent. on jewellery. It did not apply at all to many necessities. It certainly did not apply to children's clothing. It was therefore a much more flexible instrument of taxation with the additional advantage that it did not add to inflation. I very much hope that the Government will adopt a severe attitude towards those, including those in the European Community, who are always urging us to extend the scope of VAT.<lb/>
There is one especially shocking example of its drawbacks. If one buys a car one pays not only the price of the car but tax on the car and then VAT on the cost of the car as inflated by the tax already paid on it. That is not only unfair but also inflationary. It
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0224"/>
<col>369</col>
is distressing to see that the European Community, about which we have heard so much from the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, now proposes to extend VAT and wishes to apply it to airline fares. I hope that the Government, from the point of view of the proper management of our economy, will be quite resolute in resisting efforts to extend VAT, with all its damaging effects.<lb/>
I should like to hear a little more from my noble friend Lord Hesketh about what is being done to deal with the massive payment which we in this country have to make to the common agricultural policy. The policy does much harm to the world economy and to non-European producers of food. The damage it has done to New Zealand has been very serious indeed. It derives from the fear which French and German politicians have of their small farmers. It is a fact that the working of the <i>Code Napol&#x00E9;on</i> in France has meant that there is a large number of small farmers. Noble Lords will recall that, under the <i>Code Napol&#x00E9;on,</i> when someone dies his land or farm cannot go only to his first born but is spread equally among all his children. The result is that there are many small farms. They are too small for economic administration but large enough to constitute large bodies of voters. It is the indirect effect of the <i>Code Napol&#x00E9;on</i> which motivates this excessive expenditure on the common agricultural policy. I hope that my noble friend Lord Hesketh will be able to tell us how much the policy will cost the country this year. The figure is indeed substantial. If we could eliminate it we would be able to make further tax reductions.<lb/>
My next point arises on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins. Until the European Commission shows the ability and will to deal with the common agricultural policy many of us will be hesitant to entrust any further responsibilities to it. One must doubt whether a body that is incapable of controlling the common agricultural policy could handle the infinitely more difficult matter of a common currency.<lb/>
Perhaps my noble friend can tell us how much of the British contribution to the common agricultural policy goes for the infamous purpose of subsidising tobacco growing. It is mainly in Spain and Greece that tobacco is grown. As consumption of tobacco in the advanced countries diminishes as education spreads, more and more of the exports of this crop go to Africa. It is quite immoral that we should subsidise the production of this health damaging commodity simply to maintain in business those who wish to grow it in Community countries. I hope that the Government will be resolute and say that, quite apart from the expenditure, from a moral point of view it is wrong to subsidise the production of this commodity. Morally there seems to be little difference between doing that and subsidising cannabis and having done with it.<lb/>
In connection with tobacco, it is my only regret that, in the current Finance Act&#x2014;I hope it will be remedied in the next one&#x2014;we have not substantially increased the duty on tobacco. I say that with no
<col>370</col>
hostility to those who wish to smoke, but I would say that those who follow a practice which must inevitably increase the cost of the National Health Service, with all the illness and disease that it will breed, should at least be called upon to contribute something extra towards the cost of maintaining that service. That makes good sense.<lb/>
We have had an interesting year in which the handling of the economy has not been free from difficulty. But it appears that we are getting a grip on inflation and that exports are rising. We already export more per head than either Japan or the United States. The economy is responding to the Government's firm handling. I very much hope that the Government will not allow themselves to be induced to weaken that firm handling simply because of criticisms such as are contained in the amendment. I am quite sure that if they persist in this policy the economy will come fully right, their policies will be justified and the country will be able to go forward once again with confidence and good will into a prosperous future.<lb/>
I believe that this lies within our hands if we do not lose our nerve. I hope that the House will reject the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and then show its emphatic support for the Government's policies which have worked so well over the years and which are working so well today. We can then go into the future with quiet confidence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03271"><member>Lord Callaghan of Cardiff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to begin by adding my congratulations to my noble friend Lady Castle for her maiden speech. Running through many of the themes of today's speeches, it seems to me that we have experienced a rather fresh breeze. I do not know whether she is already having the effect on us that she had on the European Parliament, but certainly the robust frankness which she expressed in her speech seems to have been reproduced in the speeches of others. For myself, I must say that I am beginning to feel rather at home. I trust that I shall be able to continue in that particular vein.<lb/>
I listened this morning to Mr. Kenneth Baker on the radio; indeed, I always seem to be listening to him on the radio. He said that there has been a fundamental transformation in the fortunes of our country. In the same programme Mr. John Cole referred to another Conservative who said that the Government have effected an economic miracle. Well, in the robust spirit which has characterised the debate thus far, I must ask: who do they think they are kidding? That is absolutely absurd. Moreover, Mrs. Thatcher made the brazen comment at the Guildhall that she had broken,
<quote>"the post-war mould of bureaucracy and decline".</quote>
That is a new line; usually she just blames my noble friend Lord Wilson and myself for what has happened. However, the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, had better note that this time she includes him. It is not just the government I led and that led by my noble friend Lord Wilson, it is also the government
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0225"/>
<col>371</col>
led by Mr. Heath&#x2014;perhaps that is not surprising&#x2014;by the noble Lord, Lord Home, by Sir Anthony Eden, by Harold Macmillan, by Winston Churchill and by Mr. Attlee. I have noticed that the noble Lord is very ready to condemn the government of Mr. Attlee; but he cannot escape being part of the bureaucratic mould which the Prime Minister has removed during the past few years. I see that he is anxious to intervene. I am happy for him to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03272"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, will withdraw the charge that he made against me of having been a member of Mr. Heath's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03273"><member>Lord Callaghan of Cardiff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not mean to say that. In any event, I apologise to Mr. Heath and congratulate the noble Lord.<lb/>
As to breaking the bureaucratic mould, I must say that that is a bit rich coming from one of the prime mover; of the poll tax which has been fastened on this country in recent years. If we wish to get nearer to the truth about what the position is in our economy, we must consider other factors. I propose to make further distinct party comments about them in a moment. I give noble Lords opposite that warning so that they may leave the Chamber if they wish to do so.<lb/>
It would be nearer the truth to admit that in our economy today, as in our economy 11 years ago, the tendency to inflate whenever the economy is growing is as great today as it was in the 1970s; indeed, there has been no fundamental change. The tendency to consume more than we produce is the same today as it was in the 1970s. There has been no fundamental change in those attitudes. Therefore, for the Government and government apologists to pretend otherwise is self-delusion and is concealing the truth of a serious situation which has not been fundamentally changed, despite what has been said by noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
Admittedly, the fundamental change was brought about of making the rich pay less in order that the poor might pay more. That was supposed to bring about a change of attitudes. However, it has not worked, as I shall show your Lordships later. Of course the 1980s yielded a new breed; namely, the Yuppies, which is an ugly word but one which adequately describes the greed and selfishness of the era which spawned Thatcherism.<lb/>
I intend to back what I have said by a snapshot of the economy as it existed in 1979 and as it exists today. All the figures I shall use have been culled from government statistics. It is my desire not only to remove the smears that I have heard about the Labour Government of 1974&#x2013;79&#x2014;although that washes over me like water over a duck's back &#x2014;but also to show the country, if I can, and certainly make your Lordships comprehend, that the situation we face is as grave today as it was in the 1970s and that it has still to be remedied.<lb/>
Chancellors of the Exchequer always use four main indicators to measure the health of the economy at any one time. The first is the rate of growth of the economy; the second is the rate of inflation in the
<col>372</col>
economy; the third is the level of unemployment in the economy; and, the fourth is the balance of our payments with other countries. I shall deal with them one by one. In 1978 the rate of economic growth was 2.7 per cent. In 1990 it is expected to be about 1 per cent. The government apologists will no doubt say, "Ah, this is only a temporary slow down after a long period of record growth". However, next year's growth will only be one-half of 1 per cent.<lb/>
Let us be fair. Let us take a run of years just in case objection should be taken to my abstracting a single year for comparison. We can consider a run of years of the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s to see whether there has been this fundamental change in the rate of growth during that period. In the 1960s, the average rate of growth was about 3 per cent. per annum; in the 1970s&#x2014;a decade for which I have some responsibility&#x2014;the average rate of growth was 2 per cent. per annum. That was a decline. There was the great oil shock which I shall neither explain nor defend because everyone knows about the situation at that time&#x2014;indeed, both governments shared part of the guilt.<lb/>
During the Thatcher decade the rate of growth has not been 2 per cent. or 3 per cent.; it has been about 2.2 per cent., and that ignores this year's figure of 1 per cent. and next year's of one-half of 1 per cent., or whatever it may be. Where is the fundamental change? There is not much sign of it in the economy and fortunes of this country.<lb/>
I turn now to the rate of inflation. I have already had an exchange of words about this with the noble Lord, Lord Belstead. In fact, I agree with him that when I left office wages were increasing. There had been the Ford settlement which, incidentally, the Conservative Opposition at that time supported wholeheartedly. It helped to break that particular issue. In any event, I agree that wages were increasing. However, I believe that the noble Lord would accept&#x2014;I think he has already done so&#x2014;that what Sir Geoffrey Howe did in doubling the rate of VAT clearly added to inflation; indeed, there was almost a runaway in inflation after that time. Nevertheless, I stand on the figure in my snapshot. When I left office it was 10.3 per cent. and it is now 10.9 per cent.<lb/>
Perhaps I may emphasise the point made by my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel in what I thought was an outstanding speech. He said that we have always inherited a higher rate of inflation than that which we left. I wonder how many of your Lordships remember that when the Labour Government took over the government of this country in 1974 the rate of inflation was 13.5 per cent. and that in one month it had risen to 15 per cent., because of events which had taken place beforehand. We took over with an inflation rate of 15 per cent. but when I left office it was 10.3 per cent. I see no reason to be ashamed of that situation.<lb/>
There has been no fundamental transformation from a government who were supposed to be returned in order to rid this country once and for all of inflation. This is the third bout of inflation that we have experienced under this Government. Perhaps I may re-interpret Oscar Wilde: to have one bout of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0226"/>
<col>373</col>
inflation might have been careless; two was reckless; but, to have had three, as my noble friend said, is sheer "incompetence". On that ground alone we are entitled to vote this evening. I believe that Sir Geoffrey Howe has let the cat out of the bag. He has told us that, but for the Prime Minister's obstinacy, the third bout of inflation could have been avoided.<lb/>
The third Treasury indicator is unemployment. When the Labour Government which I headed left office, the number of unemployed people in this country stood at 1,140,000, and it was falling. Conservatives were deeply shocked. Saatchi and Saatchi produced that famous poster showing a long queue of unemployed people with the caption, "Labour isn't working", and displayed it on every hoarding in the country. It helped the Conservatives win the election. Today another half a million people are standing in that queue. The latest total is 1,667,000 and it is rising. There has been no fundamental transformation there unless it is for the worse.<lb/>
The fourth major indicator is the balance of payments&#x2014;the ultimate test of whether Britain is more competitive than it was and whether it is paying its way. I almost hesitate to mention the figures. It is almost indecent to do so. When we left office there was a small surplus of &#x00A3;1 billion. I hope that noble Lords are aware of the figure today&#x2014;an expected deficit of &#x00A3;15 billion. If our industry is so much stronger, so much leaner, so much fitter, and has shed so much of its inefficiencies, why is it that a small surplus of &#x00A3;1 billion has been translated into a deficit of &#x00A3;15 billion? That is something that would have been unheard of in the days when I had some responsibility for our affairs. I shall be interested to hear the Government's explanation of that point. I have my own, but I shall not give it because I should be speaking for too long. I am afraid I am making rather a long speech, but I want to put some of these points on the record. I shall not refer to them again, but whenever I hear a Minister stand at the Dispatch Box and tell us how much worse things were in 1979 I shall have my copy of <i>Hansard</i> in my pocket.<lb/>
In 1979 our share of world trade was 9.7 per cent. If we have effected that fundamental transformation in our economy, why has our share of world trade diminished from 9.7 per cent. to 8.2 per cent? So I could go on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03274"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: Go on!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03275"><member>Lord Callaghan of Cardiff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all right, I shall give one or two more examples. I am always ready to yield to a little encouragement. I was told that interest rates were high under a Labour Government. I agree that they were inhibiting growth and development. They were 12 per cent. Today they are even higher at 14 per cent. Where is the fundamental transformation there? Where is the economic miracle that I was told about by Mr. Kenneth Baker on the radio this morning? The mortgage rate is 14.5 per cent. When we left office it was 11 per cent. Personal savings were about 13.5 per cent. Today they are about 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. As for the health of this
<col>374</col>
entrepreneurial economy, there were more bankruptcies in the three months ending October than there were in the whole of 1979.<lb/>
I have produced enough evidence to demonstrate that claims of an economic miracle are a mirage, a sham and a confidence trick, made believable only by clever propaganda. Of course the Government made some important changes. Of course the Government have made some improvements. Not even this Government could be in power for 11 years without doing something worth while, but the truth is that there has been no fundamental change in our position. We face the same problems as we faced in 1979, and there has been little improvement in the way in which we handle them.<lb/>
The problems are long-standing, but, as Sir Geoffrey Howe pointed out in his speech yesterday, it is the nature of the challenge that is changing. That is something that he recognises even if others do not.<lb/>
The 1992 process, the unification of Germany, the growing links&#x2014;political and economic&#x2014;of the Community, Eastern Europe and the EFTA countries, and the intense pressure from Japan and America, to which the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, referred&#x2014;I agree with much of what he said on that point&#x2014;make the pace and form of economic and monetary integration hard to predict, but I am certain that it will come. I have no doubt of that. Equally I am convinced that Britain's best interests will be served by making it clear to our partners that we fully accept economic and monetary integration as a final long-term goal, and that we shall play a constructive and leading role in shaping its form.<lb/>
Our requirements are&#x2014;as my noble friend Lady Castle said &#x2014;economic convergence (that is vital); the evolution of democratic practices as we transfer competence from the national level; parallel development of all regions in the Community; and the establishment of understanding between the social partners: between commerce, industry and agriculture, and between employers and trade unions. In that last respect many countries in the European Community are well ahead of us. That is one reason&#x2014;I shall return to this point in a moment&#x2014;why the trade unions of this country have started to view the future of the Community with rather less suspicion than they did some years ago.<lb/>
Starting from that position, Britain will be well placed to give a lead in the difficult task&#x2014;I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, said about this&#x2014;of setting a long-term, open-ended timetable for economic and monetary union; but I believe that it should be set, and that when we have set that open-ended timetable it is one towards which member states can move at their own varying speeds.<lb/>
I support the decision to join the ERM, although I fear that Mr. Major has made a serious mistake in entering at a central rate of 2.95 deutschmark to the pound sterling. That rate is too high. I can see his dilemma. Fix the rate too low, and he runs the risk of fuelling inflation. Fix it too high, and he restrains
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0227"/>
<col>375</col>
exports and increases unemployment&#x2014;perhaps up to as much as 2 million within a relatively short time, and certainly within the next 18 months. That is the course he has chosen. Ministers defend it by pointing to the recent improvement in export levels. We heard that this afternoon, but that has occurred because sterling was much lower than 2.95 deutschmark when the improvement in exports took place. I have the figures. As recently as last January, the sterling/deutschmark rate was 2.80 to the pound, not 2.95. Since then, sterling has risen against the deutschmark by 7 per cent., although inflation has been rising at the same time. It cannot be right to have chosen such a rate against that combination of economic circumstances.<lb/>
Mr. Major has taken a substantial risk. It brought back to my mind the classic decision of Mr. Churchill after the first war when he fixed the dollar/sterling rate at five dollars to the pound&#x2014;a decision that led directly to the General Strike of 1926. I hope that my fears are misplaced on this occasion. I do not believe that that would happen, but the decision that has been taken to fix the rate at that level will rebound. I do not know whether we shall be able to hold it. If Mr. Major holds it, it will only be at the price of more unemployment and lost jobs and of some of our industries going to the wall.<lb/>
There is little doubt that a European central bank will be created. The question is not whether we can veto it&#x2014;we cannot&#x2014;but whether Britain will be a founder member. The answer must be yes. Should it be independent? Here a little history of the 1930s is needed. Many of your Lordships will recall that it was the idiosyncrasies of Montagu Norman (Mr. Skinner), when he was Governor of the Bank of England in the 1920s and 1930s, and the economic consequences of his handling of the Bank of England at the time, that convinced many of us who were then young in politics that the Bank of England should not be entrusted wholly to the bankers without some accountability, and led to its nationalisation. So it was in 1946.<lb/>
I observe today's banking fraternity. I do not have undiluted admiration for it, but there is no doubt that the banking fraternity of 1990 is different from what it was in the 1920s. Even so, a new central bank cannot be wholly independent. I agree that there will be difficulties in working out how it should operate, but its objectives are clear. The principal one must be the avoidance of inflation. These objectives and others must be laid down clearly by governments, but at the same time an appropriate means must be found to make the central bank accountable at regular intervals. I could suggest a number of devices for that purpose that would begin to make it accountable. I am sure that: they are in your Lordships' minds in any case. Under those conditions and subject to the fulfilment of those conditions, I am sure that such a central bank should have strategic and tactical operational independence.<lb/>
As I said, an important development has been the more positive attitude taken by the British trade unions to the Community. They have spotted that with the removal of trade barriers a European labour market is developing with growing cross references in
<col>376</col>
wage claims and other negotiations. The social action programme put forward by the Commission to which this Government have taken exception is one reason why the suspicion in the 1970s by the trade unions is now giving way to this more affirmative approach.<lb/>
Given the concern of Ministers about the adverse effect of large wage increases&#x2014;which they constantly express while saying that they can do nothing about it&#x2014;I simply do not understand why the Government have spurned what seemed to be constructive ideas put forward by the TUC and some trade unions. For example, I refer to ideas such as the proposal to synchronise the wage round in order to avoid leap-frogging; the idea of pendulum arbitration in order to encourage wage claims that are realistic and responses from the employers that are reasonable.<lb/>
On these and other matters it seems to me that in such areas as training and retraining, how to get the best out of employment for women, not only for their own sakes but for the sake of the economy, the trade unions have much first-hand experience and goodwill that they would have placed at the disposal of the Government if the Government had had the wit to take them up.<lb/>
I conclude. The Government's claim that Britain has experienced an economic miracle and a fundamental transformation is untrue. Until we face that fact, we shall not be ready to take the steps that are necessary in order to improve our situation and make the claim true. My noble friend used these words; I had already written them down and I must repeat them because the same great idea occurred to both of us. What is more, the British people have ceased to be taken in by such claims. People no longer believe what Ministers say because the evidence of their eyes tells them that it is not so. That is where we are. We have a Prime Minister who is so blinkered that she cannot come to terms with the changes that are taking place; and so domineering in Cabinet that Ministers are prevented from doing what they believe to be necessary in the economy's interests. We should be failing in our duty tonight if we did not record our votes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03276">5.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03277"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had many important speeches in the debate so far, not least from the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan. I was especially pleased, like the rest of your Lordships, to hear the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Castle. I had the pleasure of sharing a platform with her in the late 1960s when together, but on different subjects, we addressed the National Union of Mineworkers in Lancashire. I was impressed then with the vigour of her presentation, as we all have been today. I should like to come back to the substance of her remarkable speech in a moment.<lb/>
I begin by turning to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Williams. He drew attention, as other noble Lords have done, to the difference between the estimates in the Autumn Statement which was read to us the other day and the views of how the economy is
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0228"/>
<col>377</col>
likely to go in the short term, expressed from other quarters, notably the CBI in their various publications.<lb/>
I remind your Lordships that the estimates contained in the Autumn Statement were that by about the middle of next year growth would be resumed, the balance of payments gap would be substantially closed, unemployment would start falling and headline inflation would be cut in half. That is a very convenient degree of timing. We must be sure whether these are realistic estimates. Until one recognises the nature of the problem, it is difficult to determine the remedy.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, purported to report the position of the CBI from a letter of the noble Lord, Lord Hanson. However, I read from the CBI's report on the economic situation for October 1990, which must be taken as its authoritative statement. The review showed the largest drop in business confidence for 10 years, with manufacturing reporting sharp falls and output and orders both at home and overseas also falling. Investment intentions have fallen likewise. These were hard words to read. They can be contrasted with the rather more positive statements indicated by the Government in their Autumn Statement.<lb/>
I believe that we must try to resolve these problems (which will be relatively short-term, if the Government are right, or longer term if the CBI is right) not by short-term expedients but by recognising the importance of longer term solutions. The worrying aspect of all this is that we seem to be returning to the stop-go or boom and bust situation. Who is to say that after some degree of recovery, following the present recession, we do not again get into difficulties?<lb/>
It seems that we should look for remedies which have a longer term impact. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, referred to a longer term vision. We need to see whether we can find remedies which will enable the economy to be maintained on a sustainably higher basis than previously. I wish to make some suggestions as to what might be contained in such a policy by referring specifically to monetary policy, infrastructure policy and industrial policy.<lb/>
As to monetary policy, the difficulties that we have had in recent years&#x2014;they emerged in statements made only yesterday in another place&#x2014;are in large measure ascribable to changes in the approach to monetary policy made by the Government in the mid-1980s. Until that point, they had regarded the control and limitation in the growth of broad money as being of importance. Broad money, of course, includes credit. However, from 1985 onwards they seem to have given that up.<lb/>
At the same time the currency was fluctuating widely. So we had neither the restraint of a currency linked with stronger currencies nor the control of broad money supply. As a result, as we know, the growth of credit mounted enormously. It is from that that we now suffer.<lb/>
<col>378</col>
The decision to enter the ERM will impose some measure of discipline which we were then lacking. I believe it is now commonly agreed on virtually all sides that we would have been far better advised to have entered the ERM in 1985. Whatever the case, we are there now. It is important to build on the situation. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, when he says that we shall inevitably have to enter into monetary union. There is no way round it. We are members of the Community; we fully subscribe to the single market; and we have entered the ERM. We cannot just stand still at this point. That is precisely what lies behind the amendment proposed by my noble friend. The amendment seeks to emphasise that we must move forward. To move backwards would mean getting out of the Community. And to stand still is an impossibility. Therefore we must move forward. The question is: what role should we play in that forward momentum?<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Castle, with her unrivalled experience of debates in the European Parliament has pointed to the importance of obtaining some convergence of economies before we finally enter monetary union, and particularly before a single currency is established. I agree that that would be highly desirable but nothing in my view emerged from the last meeting of the Council which suggested that a single currency would be introduced tomorrow. The Council has talked about it being introduced in the year 2000. There are to be discussions between governments in December on the way this is to be achieved. It would be perfectly appropriate for the view expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, to be aired at that stage. It would, of course, be far better and more effective for a greater economic convergence to be achieved before the final step is taken towards a single currency. However, my belief is that the two should go together. We have, therefore, the opportunity in a European context, of establishing a more effective monetary policy than we have hitherto had. That should lead to sustained control of inflation.<lb/>
It has been a worry to many of us on this side of the House that the Government's policies towards the various aspects of the infrastructure have not been drawn up on a co-ordinated basis. Two days ago there was a debate in this House on transport in which my noble friend Lord Tordoff said that the Government's
<quote>"transport proposals show &#x2026; lack of coherence".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 12/11/90; col. 173.]</quote>
My noble friend went on to explain how that had arisen. The Government keep telling us that they are spending substantial amounts of money in such important sectors as transport, education and health. However, every time we suggest that there should be some co-ordinated policy in those matters, the Government draw back. The idea of a co-ordinated policy is not something that they accept; yet unless we can move ahead on that basis it will be difficult to know whether the Government's expenditure in these areas will be justified, as expenditure in one part of the transport network may well create difficulties in another unless they are all brought together. It is
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0229"/>
<col>379</col>
possible that we need more expenditure in certain parts of the infrastructure: we certainly need a much more co-ordinated approach on a long-term basis.<lb/>
There is also the matter of industrial policy. Here the problems from which industry, and particularly manufacturing industry, suffer are well recognised and have been well rehearsed. Inadequate effort is put into research and development. There are many ways in which this could be put right; for instance, additional expenditure on basic research. That must inevitably fall on the public purse. We need a stimulus to industry to carry out more applied research. This can be achieved by fiscal measures, as is the case in many other countries.<lb/>
I now turn to training. There is continuing debate about education and the training of young people at school. However, the continued training of people at work is equally important, particularly when technology is developing at such a fast pace. Here again, some fiscal incentive to industry to extend its training facilities and operations is highly desirable.<lb/>
Finally, there is the question of investment in industry. For a long time recommendations have been made that there should be an additional fiscal incentive for manufacturers in particular to invest in plant and machinery. This incentive was reduced some years ago to a figure of 25 per cent. The CBI strongly recommends that the figure should be increased to 40 per cent. I fully support that recommendation. If the figure were increased to 40 per cent., manufacturers could write off in tax terms the value of equipment of this kind in two-and-a-half years. That seems about right.<lb/>
We face a difficult situation. The depth of it is a matter for debate and argument, but its existence is beyond doubt. The argument that I put forward&#x2014;I have referred to the speeches of other noble Lords in support of my argument&#x2014;is that in trying to resolve present difficulties we should adopt long-term solutions. There are ways of doing that and we should make a start now.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03279"><member>The Viscount of Oxfuird</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too wish to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Castle of Blackburn. It is the first time that I have ever seen her take part in public debate. I am sorry that she is not in the Chamber at the moment. We hope to see her again very soon.<lb/>
I speak not as an economist but as one who works daily in the manufacturing sector of British industry for a company called Lansing Linde, which makes mechanical handling equipment. Certainly our sector of industry is more depressed than at this time last year. However, that has not prevented my company from starting on a &#x00A3;40 million investment programme on a world-leading production unit.<lb/>
We should not forget that since 1983 some 3 million new jobs have been created in this country. That figure does not just apply to the service sector. Although the Chance for forecast no overall increase in manufacturing output for this year, there still abound pockets of
<col>380</col>
real growth in places where hard-working and dedicated teams of men, both managers and workers, are welded into a force that defies the forecasters.<lb/>
The survey of European companies carried out by P E International that was summarised in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on 4th November adds to the reality of this debate. That survey quantified the truth that British companies are still Europe's top corporate performers. The survey, which covered Europe's 250 biggest companies, confirmed that our major British industrial enterprises are top on all of the three parameters measured which comprised the return on total assets, margins of profitability and added value per employee. Some 80 per cent. of the top 10 and 54 per cent. of the top 50 companies in the survey are British. Why is it then that we hear so little about this good news? Does it raise the old question that good news does not sell media products?<lb/>
The word "loyalty" comes to mind in this connection. I mention that concept in the context of loyalty to our country's endeavours, its achievements, its hopes and its workforce. Why is it that we seem to take a delight in discounting our national abilities? If one looks at other European industrialised nations which are also under strict economic pressures, one is led to the belief that we are incapable of describing our cup as being half full but are much happier with the thought that it is half empty. The spreading of doom and gloom seems to be a national sport. Bad news sells newspapers and success is quickly forgotten. Yet in reality this process is contrary to human nature, for pain and unhappiness are harder to recall than joy and felicity.<lb/>
When we look at the increase of 21 per cent. over the next three years in the external assistance programmes of the Overseas Development Administration, we are looking at a cup that is well on the way to being full if not overflowing. We may have problems, but let us get up in the morning acknowledging that for every problem there is a solution. Being subjugated by problems and revelling in self-criticism will do nothing to improve our economic performance.<lb/>
For too long we have been bedevilled by short-term views. We must seek to change that mental attitude and to think in the longer term. The company director is wasting his talents if more than 50 per cent. of his time is spent keeping his bank manager happy. The bank manager cannot be regarded as loyal if he has to change the goalposts with each and every economic fluctuation. Perhaps noble Lords who are directly involved in the banking world would care to think deeply as to their loyalties at this time and not withdraw their support from those industries which have been accorded the red carpet treatment in the recent past but now face the pressures of anti-inflation policies, which must be long term.<lb/>
Long-term solutions need wise and long-term support and the courage to keep British customers first. Let us consciously unite and display a loyalty to our industries and reject the tears-before-bedtime amendments before the House tonight.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03280">6.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03281"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is proving a very good debate. I should like to begin by congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, on her characteristically rousing, punchy, and&#x2014;I dare say in her absence but I should be more nervous if she were present&#x2014;lengthy maiden speech. I should also like to congratulate my noble friend Lord Williams for his very effective and enjoyable demolition job, and also my noble friend Lord Callaghan who brought his customary authority to our proceedings. I apologise to the Minister that I shall be absent from the inevitably rather late conclusion of the debate as I have to host a long-standing engagement.<lb/>
The most striking and disappointing feature of this Government as it draws unquietly to its close is the sad sense of <i>d&#x00E9;j&#x00E0; vu</i>. How long ago seems the initial excitement generated by the Thatcherite militia and their friends in the media concerning the hope that at last the chronic weaknesses of the British economy were being tackled. It is a matter of public record that even from an opposing political position I personally wished them well because Britain would have benefited had they succeeded.<lb/>
Now we are back where we were a decade ago and there has been much suffering among the unemployed, the poor and the homeless along the way. As my noble friend Lord Callaghan made very clear, all talk of the economic miracle and the fundamental restructuring of the British economy, all the hype which surrounded the 1987 election campaign which often filled the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Young, to this House, has faded. It was rather like the Saatchi and Saatchi advertisement to which my noble friend Lord Callaghan referred, and just as bogus.<lb/>
Instead, what are the headlines today? There is a recession. That has finally been admitted by the Chancellor on television. It is already the third worst recession since the war. Bankruptcies have risen by 60 per cent. over the past year and are at their second highest level ever. Inflation is in double figures. Unemployment is shooting up beyond 2 million. I see that today Goldman Sachs forecast unemployment of 2.2 million by the end of next year. There is a multi-billion pound annual trade deficit which is forecast to total over &#x00A3;60 billion in the period since the last general election in 1987. Sterling is very weak. Interest and mortgage rates have been at record high levels for record lengths of time. Labour productivity, of which the Government were previously rightly proud, has sadly been falling since mid 1988. Even the domestic budget, which is often paraded before us, has been briefly in surplus but is expected to be several billion pounds in deficit by the end of next year. That is a depressing tale. Not even the much-maligned Labour Governments of long ago did as badly as that in an off year.<lb/>
To adapt the lovely old song by Tennessee Ernie Ford, which I am sure is familiar to all noble Lords and noble Prelates opposite, "You work 12 years, And what do you get? Twelve years older, And deeper in debt" that might almost be the theme song of the Thatcher administration. I say that without pleasure
<col>382</col>
or venom since we all lose from any government's economic failure and many would have benefited had the Thatcher experiment worked. Sadly, it has not.<lb/>
I should like to look more closely at three aspects of that long litany of economic failure: the recession, inflation, and sterling in the ERM. I shall try to be brief, but those three aspects interact in complex ways and have created an economic box for the Government. It may prove a coffin. It is not easy to see how the Government can solve the problems relating to those three aspects, especially within the timescale of the next election. That is not least because the obvious short-term remedies for one, such as recession, tend to aggravate another, such as inflation. Sterling's position in the ERM, at a perilously high rate, takes away some of the Government's room for manoeuvre. Being of Irish descent, it is tempting for me to say that the best solution would be not to start from here.<lb/>
As to the recession, the Chancellor has been curiously coy and the Prime Minister characteristically blinkered in denying its existence until this week, when on television Mr. Major was pressed on the matter. Even the Autumn Statement ducked the word. The Minister, with his customary charm and skill, ducked it at Question Time again today. The forecasts in the Statement make it clear that we are now in recession in the second half of 1990. British industry has made it clear to all who would listen for some time that we are in recession. The latest City forecasts show real growth presently to be negative, right through the year to mid 1991. They show it to be zero in the calendar year 1991. That is not a modest recession, that is very painful. There is little doubt in my mind that the Chancellor's forecasts in his Autumn Statement last week will once again prove to be optimistic. The recession will be longer and deeper than he presently admits.<lb/>
In such a recession it would be natural to ease interest rates. It is bizarre to contemplate interest rates of 14 per cent., or even 13 per cent. as they may be in the New Year, in the middle of such a recession. However, the Government do not have that freedom because of their failure on inflation and because of the sterling factor. They are boxed in. Therefore interest rates will stay in double figures next year.<lb/>
The headline rate of inflation will inevitably fall next year as the Government-induced increases of the recent past &#x2014;mortgages, poll tax, excise duties, various public sector charges&#x2014;drop out, but the underlying rate will stay stubbornly high. I should like to ask the Minister whether he will then, like his recent predecessor, still press this House to focus on the underlying rate and ignore the headline rate. Will the headline rate still be described as meaningless when it is falling?<lb/>
I have a further question about inflation. Has the Minister any views which he is prepared to make in public about the Treasury's record on forecasting inflation?<lb/>
This year we have an inflation outcome double the forecast in the last Autumn Statement and 50 per cent.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0231"/>
<col>383</col>
up on the Budget forecast. Perhaps I bored noble Lords throughout the summer by repeatedly questioning the noble Lord's predecessor on the validity of those forecasts. He stuck to them, shrewdly declined to take a bet on them and then wisely moved on to more distant problems before the truth emerged. Perhaps the present Minister will tell us how he proposes to be less exposed to bad Treasury forecasts.<lb/>
After recession and inflation the third wall that is boxing in the Government's economic policy is sterling. Perhaps I may say that the fourth is the Prime Minister, but I shall leave that issue to the private grief of noble Lords opposite and Members in another place. Sterling's entry into the ERM was a two-day wonder which has since gone very sour. The stock marker is down to its pre-entry level and sterling is towards the bottom of its ERM range. That was before the Prime Minister's present troubles. Why is that? The reason is that entry into the ERM was fatally mismanaged and was clearly initiated for party political reasons. The currency markets know that the decision was not taken as part of a planned monetary strategy. I should declare that I employ a team of currency traders&#x2014;I may be in a minority on this side of the House in that position. They know that the Chancellor and the Bank of England had a later date in mind for entry when interest rates and inflation would be more convergent. They know that the Prime Minister panicked ahead of her party conference and intervened to decide to cut interest rates, prematurely in the view of the Bank. They know that entry into the ERM was an after-thought extracted from a reluctant Prime Minister by the Chancellor as the price of agreeing a premature rate cut.<lb/>
In sum, the markets know that it was a panic package and that our monetary authorities were unhappy with it. That is why the currency traders remain unhappy with the conduct of our monetary policy and why they will sell sterling at the first smell of further political interference. Confidence, once it has been handbagged, is hard to win back. That closes the box. Ideally, normally, to help the domestic economy the Government should cut interest rates drastically. It cannot do so because of the impact that that would have on sterling. It should reflate the economy but it dare not do so because of the impact on inflation.<lb/>
In this dilemma we must all wish the Chancellor well because Britain loses if he fails, and the next government suffers if they inherit a greater economic mess. But it is not a happy story. After 12 years of this Administration these problems are of their own making. We look forward to hearing the Minister tell us how he will get out of the box. I am not that sure he can.</membercontribution></p>

<col>384</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03283"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the National Debt has been reduced; but that is a single aspect. I am sure the noble Lord does not think that is the only aspect of debt which concerns the economy, or the 50 million or so people of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03284">6.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03285"><member>Lord Moran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had some hesitation in putting my name down for this part of the debate on the gracious Speech, for to take part in a discussion of economic affairs is, for me, an unusual experience. I am doing so today because the questions of a single European currency and a European central bank seem to me of transcendent importance, and a single currency is referred to specifically in the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. It has given me the opportunity to listen to an exciting maiden speech, full of fire and eloquence, from the noble Baroness, Lady Castle of Blackburn.<lb/>
Essentially, I want to make two points. First, in the national debate which has now begun, I think those with knowledge and experience of economic and international affairs have a plain duty to put this issue to their fellow citizens in a clear, comprehensible and, above all, frank and honest way. Not all of them are doing so at present.<lb/>
Secondly, I believe that any profound change in the way in which our country's affairs are run, and certainly a revolutionary change of the kind now being considered, should be made only when the broad consent of the people of this country is not in doubt. As yet, they have not been asked.<lb/>
What would a single European currency mean to us and to our fellow countrymen? Those in favour of it frequently argue that it would not affect our sovereignty. For example, Mr. Heseltine is reported to have said on 9th November that nobody seriously expected the creation of a federal Europe in which the member states surrendered their sovereignty to a common government, and that only a handful of people thought such a thing conceivable. In his speech yesterday to the Kangeroo Club in Hamburg, he said, rather more ambiguously, "I do not expect the emergence in the foreseeable future of any political structure that would submerge the instincts of national sovereignty". I am not sure what he meant by inserting the word "instincts". The Foreign Secretary similarly told the CBI the other day that "no one is seriously expecting Britain to submerge our Parliament &#x2026; into a federal state". But I think that is exactly what those who want rapid progress towards economic and political union are expecting, though obviously not immediately. However, in this country those who believe in a fully integrated Europe appear to be reluctant to come out and say so.<lb/>
By contrast, I listened to the President of the Bundesbank, Herr P&#x00F6;hl, on television the other day, just after he had seen the Chancellor, and he at any rate explained clearly that he expected the creation of a European central bank and a single currency to lead to centralised control of economic and financial policies, and in due course to centralised control of political decisions. That must surely be right, but who
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0232"/>
<col>385</col>
is saying it in British public life? I know of no instance in which a single currency does not mean a single nation. The Library has kindly checked for me with the Treasury, which says that it is unaware of any example of a common currency being sustained by two or more countries for any appreciable length of time. It is true that the pound sterling and the Irish punt were effectively linked until the late 1970s but that scarcely seems a relevant precedent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03286"><member>Lord Jenkins of Hillhead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, why does the noble Lord dismiss the Latin Currency Union which persisted from 1861 to 1914 and which included France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Greece?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03287"><member>Lord Moran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess that that seems to have escaped the notice of the Treasury which did not mention this point to the Library. Money is fundamental and, as I see it, the establishment of a single, as opposed to a common, currency would mean not just the extinction of sterling but that the key step in the creation of a European state had been taken. The Queen and this Parliament might continue in being, but their essential sovereignty would have gone.<lb/>
Three and a half years ago, when we were discussing in this House the Single European Act designed to "transform relations as a whole among their states into a European Union," my noble and learned friend Lord Denning said that sovereignty was being eroded and we were coming under another sovereignty&#x2014;that of Europe&#x2014;and that it looked as though that was one step towards a federal union. It is true that we have already surrendered a good deal of our sovereignty, but not yet the capacity to take independent action, or our freedom of choice, or our ability to call to account our own elected Government.<lb/>
Of course we need to work closely with our partners in the Community and to present a common front when we attempt, for example, to deal with Japanese protectionism. But that is not in question. What we are talking about is the way in which the Community should develop from now on.<lb/>
We now have the report of your Lordships' committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, on Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union. It will be debated on 22nd November. I saw it only on Monday and have not yet had time to study it carefully. But I see that committee argues that there is a strong economic case for a single currency but says that this must involve a willingness to make political commitments and indeed sacrifices. The report states in paragraph 75:
<quote>"One concern has been that a single currency would jeopardise national sovereignty. The Committee do not consider that the power to issue and regulate a national currency is in itself of such importance that a decision to pool this power would mean that Member States' international sovereignty would have been lost. In any case, in an interdependent world economy, Member States' freedom of action is in practice severely curtailed. However, power over currency does normally rest in the hands of national States, and a decision to relinquish control over monetary policy will not be taken lightly".</quote>
<col>386</col>
It may be that in itself a single currency would not automatically mean the loss of member states' sovereignty. However, my view is that it is such a giant step that sooner or later&#x2014;and probably sooner if M. Delors has anything to do with it&#x2014;it would mean the creation of a European state.<lb/>
I believe that it is very important that there should be more frankness in the public debate. There have been a number of recent pronouncements, from Sir Leon Brittan among others, which seem designed to soothe, to allay fears, to suggest that nothing very unusual is happening and that there is nothing to worry about, coupled with suggestions that anxieties could be met by putting the Queen's head on one side of the ecu used in the United Kingdom, or something like that. I believe that that does the public a disservice. I can see no reason why those who honestly and sincerely desire a European state should not say so. Why, I wonder, are they so reluctant to say plainly what they mean? There is a case for it. Equally clearly, some of the leaders of other Community countries want to move rapidly in that direction.<lb/>
Apart from the "softly, softly" integrationists, another group adopts the "it's all over bar the shouting" approach. I confess that I find it extraordinary that Mr. John Banham, director general of the CBI, should say on 4th November:
<quote>"We do not want the United Kingdom's commitment to a single currency to be questioned".</quote>
I emphasise "questioned", my Lords. He continued with what seems almost quasi-religious dogmatism:
<quote>"We believe in economic and monetary union. We believe in the long run in the desirability of one currency".</quote>
I think that what we need, contrary to Mr. Banham's wish, is the asking of every kind of question, in fact a genuine debate on the pros and cons of a single currency, and of M. Delors' concept of Europe, with the issues clearly brought out and put before the public in a form that they can understand. I do not believe that the public are stupid. They are entitled to know what knowledgeable people in public life really think or believe. They should not be fobbed off with bromides. The debate needs to focus on the real issue of what the Community is to be and how we as a country can best help it to develop on sensible lines. It does not help, as Dr. David Owen pointed out in a notable speech in another place on 7th November, if the issue is trivialised. The BBC and some of our newspapers have been presenting it purely in terms of personalities and of manoeuverings within the Conservative Party. The issue is more important than that.<lb/>
I come to my second point. A change of this magnitude ought not to be made without broad consent from the British people. Too often in the past they have not been asked&#x2014;whether about the transformation of British society since the war through mass immigration, or beforehand about entry into the Community, or about the Single European Act. I believe that they have a right to be asked. In refusing to give way to pressure to commit this country to an arbitrary timetable for the transfer of responsibility for economic and financial policy before
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0233"/>
<col>387</col>
it is clear precisely what we shall be letting ourselves in for, the Prime Minister, as I see it, has been defending the fundamental interests of this country. She has been violently attacked for doing so and the vigour of her defence does not seem to have won her too many friends in her own party. She is fully accountable to Parliament week in and week out and fears that that accountability may disappear.<lb/>
Are her fears justified? Your Lordships may have seen the first page of the business section of today's edition of <i>The Times</i> where it is reported that the draft statute for the European central bank,
<quote>"is understood to include provisions that would completely insulate the ECB from national or even supranational political control, while giving it sweeping powers over the domestic monetary policies of member countries".</quote>
If that is correct, what sort of accountability or democracy is that?<lb/>
I do not think it is fair to describe the Prime Minister's vigorous objections to this sort of proposal simply as "obsessive xenophobia", as did the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, in this House the other day. Is it not rather M. Delors&#x2014;who does not have to face any prime minister's question time&#x2014;and some other European leaders who have been trying to bounce the Prime Minister into signing up for policies which do not seem to her, or to Her Majesty's Government, wise or appropriate?<lb/>
Surely the right way to build a united Europe is to allow Europeans to get used to working together, to establish mutual confidence, to let close co-operation grow naturally into a common approach, to take account of national feelings, prejudices and sensitivities, and to use tact and courtesy, and not to hector and force the pace?<lb/>
If I were convinced that a solid majority of my countrymen considered that the independent British nation had run its course and that our future lay as part of a European state, I should be immensely sad, but I would accept that. But I am quite sure that it would be wrong to go further in surrendering our sovereignty without firm evidence of general assent by the British people. The Prime Minister pointed out in another place on 30th October that that House decided to go into the Community by a majority of eight votes. I do not believe that that is the way to take great historic decisions. We should have a thorough debate. We should put the issues to the public squarely and honestly. Then, before taking any irrevocable step, we should, I believe, have a national referendum.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03289"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Moran, with great interest. Were it not for the fact that we shall be debating the subject in detail next Thursday, I should have liked to take his argument a stage further.<lb/>
In one respect he is quite right. It is the utmost intellectual arrogance for anyone proposing a certain course of action to say, "It is inevitable anyway". Nothing is inevitable until it has happened. Inevitability depends upon the experience of the event. I am by no means persuaded that because an author
<col>388</col>
advocates certain courses of action&#x2014;either in relation to the European Community, or in relation to the world at large&#x2014;as inevitable, they are thereby rendered inevitable. All such courses can be and ought to be subject to proper argument with all the facts and inferences to be drawn from them laid before the country and before Parliament. Nothing is inevitable until it has happened.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, made a speech about pessimism and a general sense of gloom. He surely missed the point. I am a confirmed optimist. I believe that many of the evils and disabilities that are suffered by a country can be or will be altered. I do not lack faith in my country. I lack faith in the present Government. I am determined to change them. On this side of the House there are reasonable grounds, not for glee, because there is nothing to be gleeful about yet, but for cheerfulness. Perhaps after the necessary political changes and the economic directions that will follow from those political decisions have taken place we shall move into slightly balmier times.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel has put down an amendment in terms of excessive moderation. He merely complains of the incompetence of the Government. Had it been left in my hands I should have used the words "gross incompetence", because only a government of the type that is at present inflicted on the country could have achieved the record to which my noble friend Lord Callaghan referred and achieved such a dismal result, after having had the benefit of &#x00A3;8 billion worth of North Sea oil revenues. Only a government who have lost all contact with any kind of reason could possibly have achieved the results that this Government have achieved.<lb/>
There has been talk of an economic miracle. For approximately 250,000 people, or probably slightly more, there has been an economic miracle. The rich have had massive tax reliefs; they are able to disport themselves and their yachts all over the world and their spiritual homes, which is where their money is, can be spread not necessarily within the counties of England but in the Seychelles, in the Antilles, in Guernsey, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg and indeed possibly in the south of France by the Gran du Roi or La Grande Motte, where their yachts lie in basins, or in Gibraltar. They have had a wizard time, and for them there has been an economic miracle.<lb/>
However, for the rest of the population, and particularly its poorer sections, there has been no such miracle and none is yet in sight. There are many people in the little streets of Britain tonight who have every reason to curse and to refer in the bitterest terms to the infliction upon them of burdens imposed by Mrs. Thatcher's Government. Many of them are living lives of misery, to which most noble Lords in this House are not accustomed and of which they have very little knowledge.<lb/>
In dealing with the incompetence of the Government, I am bound at the same time to express some fears. I am optimistic that we shall get over them but I think there is a danger, possibly within my own
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0234"/>
<col>389</col>
party, of underestimating the difficulties that are going to face the next Labour administration. One thing bothers me and it may also bother your Lordships. One of the figures that was not given owing to the time that had passed referred to manufacturing investment in the United Kingdom. Such figures have not been part of the success story. Valued at 1985 prices, investment in manufacturing industry in 1979 was &#x00A3;11 billion. The average for the next 11 years, during which Her Majesty's present Government have been in office, was &#x00A3;8,690 million&#x2014;a considerable drop.<lb/>
Therefore in order to be competitive, particularly under fluctuating sterling rates of exchange against the dollar and the deutschmark, we have exerted an upward pressure on unit labour costs by failing to invest at the same rate as our competitors, because unit labour costs are composed not only of wage levels themselves paid to individuals but also of other costs. If one neglects research and development and also training, there is pressure to send up unit costs. How could it be otherwise? Wage rates in the United Kingdom are from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. lower than those obtaining on the Continent of Europe. The reason unit costs tend continually to press upwards in competition with our competitors is precisely that there is a shortfall of manufacturing investment, a shortfall in training and a shortfall in research and development.<lb/>
The trouble is that it is one thing to recognise this and another thing to be able to take action. The fact has to be faced that there will have to be a two-year gestation period before any improvements can take effect in order to counteract this monstrous lack of investment which has been part of the Government's policy&#x2014;partly because they tend to encourage overseas investment rather than internal investment from our own financial resources, as the figures show very well.<lb/>
This has resulted in there now being profound skill shortages. If one looks at the manpower survey of skills and shortages one finds these figures, as reproduced in the <i>Financial Times</i> for 15th October last:
<quote>"Nearly half of Britain's employers were experiencing shortages of skills in mid-year according, to a survey of 1,400 personnel officers published by Manpower, the employment services company.</quote>
<quote>Nationally 44 per cent. said they were experiencing a shortage of skills, a figure which rose to 50 per cent. in the Midlands, 53 per cent. in the South and 72 per cent. in the West and South Wales".</quote>
The figure for Scotland was under 28 per cent. and that for the North West 34 per cent.<lb/>
This situation has resulted in employers competing with one another for the skills available. That stokes up wages claims. All these things will become chronic unless they are tackled speedily. I take the view, and always have, that there has to be a degree of consensus between all sections of our community in solving national problems&#x2014;the kind of consensus which has been so successful in Japan, Germany and many other countries.<lb/>
<col>390</col>
Confrontational politics in the old style, apart from the normal confrontation in debate, as I am sure your Lordships appreciate, are out. One has to induce in the United Kingdom a spirit of co-operation between those who work on the shop floor, those providing the services, the supervision and management, those who determine policies and those who finance them, government services, educational services and everything else. There has to be a degree of co-operation, but for this Government "consensus" is a dirty word. One of the daftest things they have done in the past month is to snub the TUC approaches at Neddy for there to be tripartite discussions on the future development of the economy. That is something the Government will regret. The only cause for optimism that they will not be in office for very much longer.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03291"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just spoken says that in Europe wages are far higher than in this country. However, he cannot say that about the whole of Europe. In certain countries in the EC wages are definitely lower. Also, he has not taken housing into consideration. I am an employer in agriculture and industry. From my knowledge, our housing is far superior to what I have seen in many countries in the EC. Of course there may be exceptions. However, I shall not follow the noble Lord in everything he said because that would take too long and I intend to be brief.<lb/>
I am against a single currency. The Single European Act came to the House of Lords on the day before the Recess, having been rushed through the House of Commons. We did not know that it was coming here so soon. I saw a sheet of paper and did not even know what it was until I read it. We were astounded that here was an Act which would alter the whole of British law of which we had no advance information.<lb/>
I believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, spoke on that occasion, as did about five other noble Lords. I spoke briefly but I am small fry compared to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning. The noble and learned Lord was very upset about the matter. I was concerned that he might have a seizure. The noble and learned Lord is a great expert on the law and he was very upset. The Act has now been softened somewhat. However, that was quite an experience.<lb/>
About 18 months ago I wrote a letter to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> about Mr. Delors. He had said, although he probably regretted the remark subsequently, that when the Single European Act came into force it would destroy 80 per cent.&#x2014;he must have been exaggerating&#x2014;of British law. That was an amazing thing to say. My letter was published but there was no response to it. I do not believe that the answers were known. However, it is a fact that he said it.<lb/>
I was delighted when we discovered oil around Britain, as I am sure was everybody. I said at that time that I hoped that the Government would re-equip our factories and modernise them from the proceeds of our fairy godmother: oil. Those proceeds amounted to a considerable sum, I believe some &#x00A3;80 billion. The
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0235"/>
<col>391</col>
problem is that, for example, at Ashford two large companies have folded as have companies all over the country. I wish that the proceeds from oil had been used for the benefit of our industry. The Government have of course used those proceeds beneficially in other ways, but our industry is very important.<lb/>
The Government have improved considerably the standard of living of the people of this country during the years in which they have been in power. They must take same credit for that. They have improved it in a number of ways; namely, by denationalising many industries and by reducing the national debt. That has saved the country a good deal of money in interest payments. On the whole, therefore, the people of this country are far better off than when the Government came to power, inheriting as they did from the former government an extremely serious economic position.<lb/>
Mr. Lawson tried to achieve parity with the deutschmark. Had he been able to do so, that would have been satisfactory. However, he failed. As a result, very high interest rates were imposed. Before the Conservative conference this year there was a cut in interest rates. But until that time we were paying 18 per cent. We are now paying 17 per cent. That causes considerable difficulties, however efficient the employer I have never dismissed a man. It is very difficult. I am a chairman of a public company, but I am not talking about that. The position is very difficult for private employers because they know all their employees and become fond of them. I have never dismissed a man even if he is redundant; I would never do so. However, it may become impossible for me to pay my employee because of the very high interest rates.<lb/>
Inflation is a very serious problem. However, I do not believe that it is as serious as having a great number of companies closing down. I hope that in the near future the Government can and will bring down interest rates. One cannot start up a new business if one has to pay such high rates of interest. I hope that something can be done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03293"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in one of the less well publicised speeches made at the recent national conference of the CBI the chairman of a company used these words,
<quote>"Inflation is not an act of God. High inflation is a man-made disaster like southern beer and nylon shirts. It is caused by economic mismanagement".</quote>
I quoted from that speech for two reasons. First, I hope that the Government will take more notice of a successful businessman than they do of those of us on these Benches, who have been saying exactly that for a long time. Secondly, when we on these Benches raise the great economic disasters of this Government&#x2014;inflation, high rates of interest, balance of payments deficit and unemployment&#x2014;the Ministers' replies express concern, yes, but they are couched in language that suggests such problems occur in the natural way of things; that they could not possibly have been brought about by the incompetence of the Government. In fact it is the sheer incompetence of the Government that has caused the present difficulties.
<col>392</col>
My noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel made that one of the themes of his excellent opening speech. It was confirmed by my noble friend Lord Bruce in his excellent speech, and I have no hesitation in supporting that view.<lb/>
The Government, during their time in office, have trotted out a number of reasons for the difficulties; for example, the militancy of the trade unions. They cannot now say that. One of their most frequent boasts is that they have smashed the power of the unions; they have tamed them. That excuse cannot be used any more. They also frequently called in aid the importing of inflation. That indeed occurred from time to time. But they cannot use that reason now. Most of the countries from whom we import have much lower rates of interest than we. The average rate of our European partners is half our own. We were told a thousand times that industry and business were not investing enough. We are now informed that we are investing more than ever, yet we have these major problems in our economy.<lb/>
There is yet a further reason why the words of that company chairman are valid. This Government have had unbridled power for more than 11 years. When a government have been in power for one Parliament they can legitimately claim that they did not have time to do everything that they wanted to do. They can, though with less conviction, say the same thing after two periods of office. What they cannot do is use that reasoning in their 12th year in office. Given that, and the other reasons I mentioned, this Government have nowhere and nobody to turn to. The sheer incompetency is there for everyone to see; it has been reflected in opinion polls and election results for several months.<lb/>
There have been two fundamental causes for the present sorry state of affairs. First, the problems caused by the so-called Lawson boom. The Government&#x2014;not just Lawson&#x2014;were so obsessed with cutting taxes, particularly in 1988, that they paid insufficient attention to the growth in domestic demand that eventually came about. Consumer spending was projected to rise by 4 per cent.; in fact it rose by 8 per cent. That is only a 100 per cent. error&#x0021; In that context, it was a most serious mistake.<lb/>
Allied to that was the incredible under-estimation of the effects of financial de-regulation on the spending of both ordinary people&#x2014;if I may so describe them&#x2014;and the company sector of the economy. Almost everyone took advantage of the easily available credit. It can be argued that the Government are still doing little or nothing about that. That also was a mistake of great proportions.<lb/>
All of that took place against a structure which is of fundamental importance in a modern society. I refer to the essential need of a sound industrial base. The devastation of our manufacturing capacity in the early 1980s caused by the monetarist policies of those days was such that we have not yet fully recovered from it. It is significant that our industrial manufacturing rate is now 20 per cent. as a proportion of gross domestic product compared with 30 per cent. in Germany and Japan. The difference is crucial. It is the difference
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0236"/>
<col>393</col>
between success and failure. If the industrial base is not rebuilt, living standards cannot be raised. The substantial needs of the health service, education, transport and all the matters that we hear about in your Lordships' House almost every day, will not be met unless that base is not only restored but improved.<lb/>
Things might be better if we could see light at the end of the tunnel. However, there is no doubt that the economy will become worse. That friend of the Government, the Confederation of British Industry, tells us that is so. I assume that the Government will take notice of what it says even though they do not take notice of what we on these Benches say. In its recent report, which I am sure your Lordships have read&#x2014;the gloomiest report for several years&#x2014;the CBI say that output will remain flat in the coming months; investment is under threat; jobs are being lost, and order books are at their weakest for eight years. How that differs from the reeling off of the success stories that we heard from the noble Lord the Leader of the House in his opening address today&#x0021; I thought I was living in a different country when I heard that contribution.<lb/>
All that I have said stems from a government who we are constantly told understand business, understand money, know what being an entrepreneur means, and know how to maximise profit and efficiency. They are even refraining&#x2014;my noble friend Lord Donoughue referred to this&#x2014;from using the word "recession", when the evidence is all around us that we are well and truly into a recession.<lb/>
The figures for my own part of the country are probably no worse than those elsewhere. In the North as a whole 3,500 businesses failed in the first nine months of this year&#x2014;that is 600 more than in 1989 &#x2014;and another 72 firms have called in the receiver. A disturbing feature of those figures is that all types of business are being affected, from heavy engineering employing hundreds of men&#x2014;for example, Northern Engineering Industries, which announced 600 redundancies only two weeks ago&#x2014;to the smallest service firms employing only two or three people.<lb/>
The Forum of Private Business&#x2014;the Minister will note that I always quote from friends of the Government to be absolutely impartial on these matters&#x2014;said in its recent report that high interest rates, the poll tax, and other direct government policies have strangled hopes of expansion for businesses and robbed the northern region of thousands of jobs. Perhaps I may remind the House that the northern region has always had the highest rate of unemployment outside Northern Ireland. In the past two or three years I must say that there has been some improvement, in spite of some unimaginative policies such as the wholesale closure of pits in areas where no alternative employment was available.<lb/>
However, we are once again on the slippery slope. Unemployment in the country as a whole has increased in each of the past six months as a direct result of government policy. When we raise unemployment matters on this side of the House the standard response from the Government is, "We have
<col>394</col>
more people in employment than at any other time in our history". We heard that again today in the opening speech of the noble Lord the Leader of the House. That may be true, but in view of the doubts &#x2014;indeed, the proven inaccuracy&#x2014;of government statistics these days we have to be generous in accepting them.<lb/>
What is true is that the number of unemployed is still higher than it was when the Labour Government left office in 1979. If, after getting on for 12 years in office, the economic miracle still has 1.5 million unemployed then the word "incompetence" does not begin to meet the inadequacy of government policies.<lb/>
I believe, and I say this sincerely, that noble Lords opposite and Ministers in particular do not know what unemployment means. The personal devastation and the effects on families have to be experienced to be fully realised. The worst feature is that of long-term unemployment; people who have, by definition, been unemployed for more than a year but who in fact may have been unemployed for several years. Long-term unemployment is now again on the increase. There can be no stronger condemnation of the Government's economic policies than that. It is significant that the word "unemployment" does not appear anywhere in the gracious Speech. We have to assume, therefore, that a figure of 1.5 million for unemployment is the norm for this Government.<lb/>
The unemployed have become the forgotten people of our society. I ask the Minister who is to reply to the debate to deny that the number of people who will be unemployed by the end of next year will be 2 million. The only satisfaction I obtain from the present economic situation is that the Government have at last been rumbled by the people of this country. Their incompetence has been exposed as never before in their 11 years in office. The result of the next general election will not be changed whether it comes in 1991 or 1992. Perhaps I may also add&#x2014;and I end on this because of the present circumstances of the Conservative Party&#x2014;that it will be regardless of who is leader of the Tory Party.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03295"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wholly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dormand, in his criticism of the Government and with his insistence on the importance of manufacturing industry. I was also particularly struck by two previous speeches&#x2014;one by my noble friend Lord Ezra and the other by the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Ezra was right to stress that what we need are some long-term measures to assist the economy of the country. As for the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, who has held all the great offices of state&#x2014;he particularly graced the office of Prime Minister in which his performance was much better than in other offices &#x2014;my heart warmed to his dismissal of the myth that some sort of Thatcherite miracle has been performed. It is absolute nonsense and high time that someone in authority exploded that myth.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, pointed out that in every major index of our economic success the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0237"/>
<col>395</col>
Government that he presided over, which is now regarded particularly in Tory circles as something of a disaster, was far better than we can produce today. Future historians will be amazed that we were conned into believing that there was any kind of major miracle in our affairs. The only changes&#x2014;nearly all for the worse&#x2014;are an increase in bureaucratic attitudes and in the extent of government. The nanny state has extended vastly more under this Government than ever it did under any Labour Government.<lb/>
I see sitting next to the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, in a semi-recumbent position, the noble Lord, Lord Jay. As far as I remember, the noble Lord, Lord Jay, was pilloried for suggesting that the gentlemen in Whitehall knew best. It is quite possible that in that highly technical matter relating to nutrition the gentlemen did know best; but now the gentlemen in Whitehall, the town halls and in innumerable quangos are thought to know best about everything. The whole extension of the bureaucratic attitude for which the noble Lord, Lord Jay, got into trouble has been enormously extended. In fact, he stands out now as a rather rugged individualist in a semi-socialist world.<lb/>
The next change has been that the division between rich and poor has enormously increased. The third change is that there has been a considerable increase in materialistic greed. Finally, there is now the belief that public relations can cover up all ills.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, dealt with the internal position in this country, but in comparing this country with foreign countries the position is just as bad. I am amazed at the complacency of the Government. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, read out what he thought the Conservative manifesto at the last election should have contained in view of what has happened since then. Noble Lords on the Government Front Bench might at least have blushed but they show not the slightest sign of anything except being well content with an absolutely disastrous performance.<lb/>
Compared with this country our neighbours on the continent &#x2014;France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands&#x2014;have all increased exports and decreased their imports in recent years. Taking the years 1979 to 1985, one need only refer to the report from the Select Committee on Overseas Trade, and particularly the graphs on pages 8 and 9. The position has not improved since then but the Government appear to be completely satisfied. With a smaller workforce and with no oil&#x2014;I cannot too often emphasise that any success this Government have had has been due to the enormous bonanza of North Sea oil&#x2014;the German national income has increased by 46 per cent. more than ours since the war.<lb/>
Our record in manufacturing is particularly bad, as the noble Lord, Lord Dormand, said. Employment in manufacturing industry has fallen by 63 per cent. since 1958 but by only 17 per cent. in Germany. When the North Sea oil pipes were laid I remember being struck by the fact that they were nearly all manufactured in Japan or on the continent. Now we see that the major pipe producing works in Scotland at Clydesdale are to
<col>396</col>
be closed. Why cannot we make pipes in competition with the continent or Japan bearing in mind that for 15 years we have had oil on our doorstep?<lb/>
Incidentally, I should like to know what the Government intend to do about the steel industry in Scotland. I do not believe that a steel industry is essential to a nation and I would not expect British Steel to keep open the works in Scotland if convinced that the works are uneconomic, but I have to say that the treatment in this matter has been appalling. Even the Secretary of State for Scotland has protested strongly against the methods used. These have been to make promises that something will happen, which does not happen, and then gradually to cut down, not only at Clydesdale but at Ravenscraig and other steelworks in Scotland. The Scots are entitled to know whether the Government have washed their hands of the industry&#x2014;certainly the Secretary of State does not appear to have done so&#x2014;and if not, what attitude they propose to take. The Government should at least make up a package of steel production in Scotland which, if the board cannot operate it, can then be offered on the private market.<lb/>
In regard to investment generally, it is true that we have invested enormous sums of money, a great deal of it abroad. Again, the Government have boasted that they have attracted investment into this country. In fact, between 1980 and 1989 the outflow was 108 billion dollars more than the inflow of investment in this country; and the return on that investment is only 11 per cent. compared to the figure for Germany of 20 per cent.<lb/>
The Government have also told us that it is Japanese management that has made the motor car industry in this country semi-successful. If that is their assessment, and it appears to be, it seems strange that every year those in management and on the boards of companies receive increases in salary far beyond the rate of inflation while calling upon their workers to take less. How can we expect the workers of this country to take less when in many cases management increases its salary, perks, pensions and every other emolument regardless of whether there has been an increase in profit?<lb/>
If too much money is chasing too few goods one of our troubles is that the chase is led by the top people. Only yesterday we read that Members of the Cabinet increased their salaries by 8.5 per cent. We are told that that is well below the rate of inflation. However, only last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer told us that the rate of inflation will fall to 5.5 per cent. If the Cabinet really believes that it will fall to 5.5 per cent. surely it can rub along on its not totally insufficient salary for a month or two until it comes down to that figure or lower. Only a year ago the Government were going to abolish inflation. Members of the ordinary public are not given much confidence if the Cabinet feels it necessary to take an increase of 8.5 per cent. while saying that inflation will fall to 5.5 per cent.<lb/>
Another issue that we must look at is indexation. It began by being a perfectly sensible policy but now it is wholly out of hand. Practically everything is indexed. I discover that as a Member of the House of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0238"/>
<col>397</col>
Lords my car allowance is indexed and rises along with that of God knows how many others in the Civil Service. I reckon that if I had a car I could live on my car allowance. I believe that we should look at indexation. We shall never stop inflation unless people have an incentive to stop it&#x2014;and the top people do not&#x2014;and while there is a failure to achieve wage awards and so forth far below the present rate of inflation. Indexation prevents both those things.<lb/>
I am sure that we are an under-trained nation and that we should train more. However, my experience is that no amount of training will do any good unless it is properly applied. There is a lack of skill. One sees in this House the lack of skill in drawing up statutes. One sees on the Underground the lack of skill in keeping escalators running. All around this country there is a grave lack of skill which can be cured to some extent by training. However, it requires more than training.<lb/>
I remember that during the war the Germans in Normandy had practically no airforce or artillery and an army of only old men and boys. However, they had a few good tanks and one or two nasty mortars. They held up the whole British and American effort because they were skilful at using what they had to hand. When we arrived the Falaise Gap was full of horses because a great deal of their transport was still horsedrawn. Yet they held us up because they knew what to do with it. I do not believe that training is enough and I suspect that German success still relies not upon their expertise and up-to-date machines&#x2014;although they may exist &#x2014;but upon the fact that they use their resources so well.<lb/>
I do not share the view that the Government have controlled the money supply or credit with any efficiency whatever. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dormand, that to flood the place with credit, totally fail to control the broader money supply and then to be surprised by inflation is a bit much. However, that was the Government's policy. We are now told by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Government's great hope is to be able to continue with their policies. If they do, goodness knows where we shall end up&#x0021; So far their present policies have hardly cured the troubles that we face. We face serious troubles, including a recession. In doing so we are led by a broken-backed government in which not even the Conservative Party has any confidence. The Government are introducing no new thoughts upon those matters whatever. In my view, the sooner we have a general election the better.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03297"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was a pleasure and like old times to listen to my noble friend Lady Castle of Blackburn. After listening to her uncontroversial speech today I look forward with great pleasure to her controversial speeches to come.<lb/>
In our previous economic debate in July I was optimistic enough to express the view that if the Government were to enter the ERM the euphoria would last for a few months or perhaps a few weeks. In fact, it lasted only two days which is a shorter
<col>398</col>
period than that after a party conference. My noble friend Lord Williams said only two hours, but on this issue I am slightly more charitable.<lb/>
Apparently some people believed that joining the ERM meant an automatically fixed exchange rate behind which we could do what we liked with interest rates and other internal policies. Unhappily, under any system, if more people sell your currency than buy it, the rate will fall. Therefore, we are now compelled to maintain a cripplingly high interest rate which damages the domestic economy. For that reason we as a country have in effect abandoned the control of interest rates in addition to exchange control, credit control, low-cost food imports and any incomes policy. It is not surprising that after decontrol on that scale&#x2014;an orgy of decontrol&#x2014;the economy is now wholly out of control. Indeed, for the first time since 1945 we have at once a huge balance of payments deficit, high and rising unemployment and falling output, profits and investment.<lb/>
For a deficit country to fix its exchange rate is, in effect, to deprive itself of the one effective mechanism for returning into external balance. But, in addition, to fix it at a grossly over-valued rate is not so much a gamble as an act of unilateral disarmament. That the rate of 2.95 deutschmarks to the pound is over-valued is proved by the fact that we are suffering from unemployment and a balance of payments deficit at the same time. The right exchange rate for any country is that which enables the country at once to employ its full productive capacity and preserve a sustainable balance of payments. In our case the probable over-valuation is at least 20 per cent.<lb/>
The tragedy is that we have been through all this more than once. In these matters a little experience is worth a ton of theory and a mountain of political propaganda. In 1925 the sterling exchange rate was fixed at a rate probably over-valued but by only 10 per cent. All the promises that we have heard during the past year were then peddled around. We were told that we were to have stability and a strong currency. After six months of euphoria we had a prolonged coal strike, a general strike and six years of rising unemployment until the over-valued rate was abandoned in 1931. After that we enjoyed five years of rising output and employment.<lb/>
In 1979&#x2013;80 roughly the same mistake was repeated. The rate was allowed to rise to the hopelessly over-valued level of 2.40 dollars to the pound whereupon output fell disastrously, unemployment rose by 60 per cent. in less than two years&#x2014;that had never happened before&#x2014;and we lost valuable industrial capacity which has not yet and may never be regained. It was only in 1985&#x2013;86 when the exchange rate fell substantially against the deutschmark that the downward plunge was halted. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer discovered that for a short time he had created an economic miracle.<lb/>
The same lesson stares us in the face from overseas. Nobody has mentioned this point, but from 1931 to 1935 France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Holland and Poland operated what was then called the gold bloc, an almost exact prototype of the ERM today,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0239"/>
<col>399</col>
with fixed parities and exchange rates and close central hank co-operation. In those four years, while the United Kingdom recovered after the drop in the exchange rate, the gold bloc suffered deeper and deeper depression and higher and higher unemployment until Belgium broke ranks in 1935 and France in 1936. It has all happened before.<lb/>
In one crucial respect however the ERM is even more crippling to the deficit country than either the old gold standard or Bretton Woods. Both the gold standard and Bretton Woods put some pressure on the creditor country to reflate as well as on the debtor country to deflate. The ERM puts all the pressure on the debtor country alone, and thus is an even more primitive system than the classical gold standard. If we were to slide down the slope any further and plunge recklessly into the extremism of a single currency, the result in terms of unemployment would be even worse. In that respect I wholly agree with what the present Chancellor said on television on Sunday. I shall not pursue the argument today because I understand that we are to discuss European Community matters next week.<lb/>
What must be expected from all these policies over the next year or two? The over-valued exchange rate will subsidise imports and discourage exports, both those tendencies increasing unemployment, reducing output and increasing the payments deficit. Incidentally, the Autumn Statement estimates for the balance of payments and for the RPI are simply not credible. We must not forget that when France and Italy joined the ERM unemployment increased very substantially. In France it has doubled since that country joined. In our case, as a result of the worsening of the balance of payments, the exchange rate will sink towards the ERM minimum&#x2014;indeed, it has already done so&#x2014;and interest rates will have to be kept very high to prevent a further fall. That will depress real investment. Indeed unemployment may well reach 3 million again on present policies by the end of 1991. Reserves will be lost and more foreign exchange borrowed on top of the &#x00A3;20 billion a year which we are now borrowing to cover the deficit in the current account. All this will inevitably weaken the country further, economically and diplomatically.<lb/>
We are asked to endure all this damage in order to restrain the rise in the RPI. I am not surprised that the Government are worried. The Government are trying again to cure a cost inflation in the belief that it is a demand inflation. In fact it is money costs which are rising because the Government have no incomes policy other than exhortation. And exhortation will not be heeded from a Government who have not lifted a finger or raised a voice to restrain company chairmen and City operators paying themselves outrageous salaries. Even the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, since he left office, has not exactly been a shining example of pay restraint.<lb/>
How right Winston Churchill was in 1925 in writing a private minute in the Treasury in which he said:

Lasting damage has been done and is being done by the present over-valuation of sterling and other policies. Fundamental changes will be necessary before our economy is really restored.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03299"><member>Lord Alexander of Weedon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may first make the briefest mention of the Uruguay round of GATT talks and the contentious issue of agriculture. Western Europe is, in world terms, comprised of rich countries. It seeks to promote free trade within the Community. It seeks access to world markets on a multilateral basis. Yet in regard to agriculture it has been and is protectionist, and is currently grudging in the concessions that it offers. For many of the 107 countries taking part in the Uruguay round, countries less rich than those of the Community, the main hope in negotiations is to secure big gains from cuts in farm protection. It was wholly appropriate that this should have been the principal topic on the agenda for the recent Rome meeting of heads of government. It was wholly inappropriate that the issue was not debated then and that the stance of some Community countries remains curmudgeonly and self-seeking.<lb/>
I very much hope that the present ungenerous position will be modified as the GATT talks come to a climax. It would be not only sad but highly damaging if those talks were to fail. I agree with every word said by my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham on this topic. I speak on this subject more strongly because I believe firmly in the progress of the Community. Participation of this country in that progress depends on two principal factors: our domestic economic and monetary attitudes, and our commitment to the development of Community institutions.<lb/>
I start with our domestic challenge. It is heartening that the Chancellor of the Exchequer consistently pledges the Government to the task not only of reducing inflation but also, when this is done, of maintaining for the future a low inflationary discipline. To achieve this will be painful. At present we are "boxed in" to a thoroughly unattractive corner. Industry requires, as the CBI reminds us, a significant reduction in interest rates to avoid continuing damage to the corporate sector. Yet such a reduction of interest rates, quite apart from its potential effect on the value of sterling within the ERM, would carry the risk of renewing inflation through increased personal spending. There is said to be a good deal of pent up demand for housing. We dare not, as I see it, risk the encouragement of any new surge in house prices or in personal spending.<lb/>
Shortly after the recent interest rate reduction, I read a newspaper report which suggested that house prices might start to rise a little. The headline read "Good news for house prices". A senior German banker, to whom I mentioned this last week, suggested that in his country the headline would have read "Bad news for house prices". We cannot afford any such inflationary risks, in the same way that a false "boomlet" before the next election should. I believe,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0240"/>
<col>401</col>
be regarded as wholly off the agenda. We should give the Chancellor the fullest and continuing support in his resolute stance against inflation.<lb/>
Our membership of the exchange rate mechanism should obviously require us to impose an anti-inflationary discipline. That is one reason why in my view it is to be welcomed. Another is the opportunity it gives us to be taken seriously in the coming inter-governmental talks. I cannot begin to match the knowledge of economic history of the noble Lord, Lord Jay; but on practical grounds I diffidently but firmly disagree with his conclusions. I believe, with respect, that they ignore the dynamic of reality. It is difficult to over-emphasise how vital it is that we as a country should play a full and constructive part in the next stage of negotiations.<lb/>
Much of our past history in our dealings with the Community has been unfortunate. We stood aside from the initial shaping of Community institutions and rules, only to join later on terms which had been agreed by others. Those terms included the common agricultural policy, which I mentioned earlier, and that should surely serve as a salutary reminder of the dangers of absence from the table.<lb/>
Surely now our participation is even more important because of our present status as a member of the Community. In many aspects of economic and social affairs, Community laws override our own. Except on those issues which require unanimity, we can be out-voted. In practical as well as legal terms, the impact of Community developments affects our affairs: we have for a long time had scant real sovereignty over our exchange rate, and 60 per cent. of our exports already go to Europe. Decisions are taken there which affect our ability as a country to compete. It is a major issue of foreign policy that we should use our full negotiating skills to ensure that we are not disadvantaged at this crucial time.<lb/>
What then should be our stance? Perhaps I may join those who paid tribute to the report of the Select Committee on the European communities. In general, I respectfully share their views and I do not propose to rehearse them again tonight. However, I should like to emphasise that the Government's proposal for a hard ecu, so ably and tirelessly explained across Europe by Mr. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, has merits. It focuses the arguments on the need for economic convergence to precede currency union, and for such union to take place when, and only when, the market-place is ready for it. There are clearly elements in the proposal which could form part of Stage 2 of the route to currency union.<lb/>
One problem is that, when initially proposed, the hard ecu proposal was regarded as a stalling device. It is sadly true that we carry at present less credibility than we would wish in Europe. Some are even doubtful as to whether we are sufficiently committed to an anti-inflationary discipline should the going prove tough, as it did in France when it accepted the need to maintain a stable exchange rate early last decade. We must continue to strive to dispel that impression, as we have much to contribute. In
<col>402</col>
particular, we can help in our pragmatic way to ensure that the impetus for speedy progress is tested on a hard-headed but constructive basis. One virtue of the hard ecu proposals is that they concentrate minds on how much there is still to be thought through.<lb/>
I believe that the hard ecu proposal cannot ever begin to carry any weight abroad unless the Government acknowledge that it is intended as a constructive way forward to ultimate monetary union. There are undoubtedly difficulties to overcome and the process may not be as simple as some may hope. There is no reason to be starry-eyed or idealistic about what still falls to be achieved. The Community as a whole is a long way from economic convergence; nor is there a clear acceptance by all governments of the need for an independent, central European banking institution which will, after all, replace some of the powers of the Bundesbank as well as those of the Bank of England.<lb/>
The division of responsibilities between central and national banking will need to be negotiated carefully. Yet the principle of subsidiarity, so relevant to this task, has yet to be precisely defined or made enforceable in Community law; nor have we worked out whether, or to what extent, fiscal powers will need to be exercised from Brussels. All those are momentus questions. Monetary union will undoubtedly increase calls for economic and political integration. As an adherent of the need to make progress, I accept that fact. However, those are but illustrations of the hurdles to be crossed.<lb/>
I also believe that the logical coin of a single market is a common currency. It would reduce transaction costs, eliminate exchange rate uncertainties and, above all, it would further the simplicity of trade within the market. We must also accept that our partners in the Community increasingly and understandably pursue this objective. We must play our part in making certain that we traverse the route in a thoroughly practical way with the goal clearly in mind.<lb/>
If we do not adopt that approach, other countries will probably seek to go ahead without our participation. That possibility is increasingly spoken of on the Continent, and we should not regard the idea as posturing or as the idle beating of drums. As has been said by others, two speed Europe carries a logic for those countries ready to move ahead. But for us it has the danger of being a two-tier Europe. I, and many others, are much concerned at the effects of such a development on the City's current position as Europe's leading financial centre.<lb/>
London has been a dominant financial centre for so long that some assume its place is immutable. It is in the middle of time zones, its skills base is formidable and wide-ranging and leading financial institutions from abroad currently have their base here. But competition from Frankfurt and Paris is determined and it is accelerating. In the past, the deregulated nature of our markets has helped us enhance our competitive edge. But this advantage is diminishing as our European partners themselves deregulate their own markets. It would be of the greatest concern if we
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0241"/>
<col>403</col>
were rot in the mainstream of the next developments which promote economic integration and growth in the Community. It would put at risk our dominance if other countries furthered their political, economic and monetary integration and we stood as an island apart. We would be seen to be peripheral, away from the centre of gravity where commercial interests are determined.<lb/>
This Government, under the courageous leadership of the Prime Minister, have done, as my noble friend the Leader of the House mentioned briefly earlier this afternoon, so much to reverse the decline of this country. I hope that they will have the confidence, which they are entitled to have, to take and keep our rightful place in the mainstream of Community decisions.<lb/>
I shall end with one final thought which I hope is wholly non-contentious. It is undoubtedly right, whether or not we agreed with the idea, that membership of the ERM, and further progress towards monetary union, will limit the scope for us to seek to influence individually our own monetary policy. We shall lose the ability to seek to secure competitiveness by financial adjustments in the future. That will throw us back even more on fundamentals. It will mean that education, training, investment, productivity and infrastructure will provide the essential long-term keys to competitiveness. The extent of our commitment to these basic qualities in our society will be the touchstone of our future success I believe that that is healthy, but it is also a mighty challenge to all of us.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03303"><member>Lord McCarthy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a pleasure to begin my speech by congratulating my noble friend Lady Castle on what I suppose is technically a maiden speech. I would have said more about that, but it appears that the lady has vanished and therefore it is perhaps better left unsaid until the next time we meet.<lb/>
In supporting this amendment, which was especially well argued by my noble friends Lord Williams and Lord Callaghan, I do not wish to follow the general line of the debate. That is what people usually say when they want to change the subject. However, that is not quite the case. I wish to focus upon part of the area covered by my noble friends Lord Callaghan, Lord Dormand and Lord Bruce of Donington; but not, I am afraid, that covered by the
<col>404</col>
noble Lord the Leader of the House or by any government speaker. In some ways that is remarkable, but it is also perhaps healthy.<lb/>
Recent speeches made by Ministers in another place&#x2014;namely, the Secretary of State for Employment, Mr. Howard, in a speech which he gave to the Institute of Personnel Management, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a contribution he made to the recent meeting of NEDO&#x2014;have focused on the need to solve the Government's problems and the problems of the economy by reducing the level of wage settlements. Several Ministers, especially those two, have said that what we need to solve the difficulties which Members of the House have discussed this evening, to stop the increase in unemployment, to reduce the increase in prices and to regain competitiveness is not real wage improvement but real wage decline. In other words, we now need a period during which the level of wage settlements is significantly below the level of price increases, especially the level of increases in historical prices in the RPI.<lb/>
I have four questions. My first question is: is that economic policy? Although it has been mentioned by the Ministers to whom I have referred, it has not been mentioned in the House tonight. Do the Government believe that an essential part of our economic recovery, even of our economic survival, is that we should now move through a period of negative real wage growth; that is, a period in which wage increases fall below the level of price increases? If the Government are saying that, a number of further questions follow.<lb/>
If they are saying that, why is there so little evidence that the difficulties we are in&#x2014;the deficit in the balance of payments, inflation, high interest rates and the recession&#x2014;have been caused by undue real wage advances? There is no evidence for that. Between 1982 and 1989 earnings in this country were remarkably, and most unusually, stable. The increases were between 7 per cent. and 9 per cent. Over those years, the average was 7.9 per cent. Prices moved up and down for various reasons and in some years produced a real wage improvement and in other years did not, producing a real wage advance over the period 1982&#x2013;89 of something like 2 per cent. a year.<lb/>
The Government won two elections, partly by pointing to that real wage advance. They contrasted it to the detriment of the previous Labour Government, and said that of course during much of the period of that Labour Government there was no real wage advance. If noble Lords remember, in those days that was part of the Prime Minister's economic miracle. It may now be Sir Geoffrey Howe's economic miracle or Mr. Lawson's economic miracle. Mr. Heseltine may claim that it was his economic miracle, but a miracle it was. The problem is that that miracle&#x2014;that modest but sustained increase of 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. in real wages in that period&#x2014;went wrong. It went wrong in particular after 1986; after the long period of devaluation; after the Government's own goals on
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0242"/>
<col>405</col>
poll tax; after the election boom; after the RPI began to rise. It rose between 1986 and 1990 by 66 per cent. That is what eroded the real wage advance.<lb/>
The annual rate of increase in the RPI between 1986 and 1990 rose by 66 per cent., but earnings increased by only about half that rate&#x2014;31 per cent. Annual earnings were remarkably laggardly in following the upward movement in prices, as a result of which between 1986 and 1990 the whole of the previous real wage advance was wiped out. This year the figures suggest that we shall have negative real wage growth: an increase of about 10.2 per cent. in annual earnings and 11 per cent. or more in the level of prices, and so a period of negative real wage growth after a period of remarkable stability in earnings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03304"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but he claimed that the RPI increased by 66 per cent. between 1986 and 1990. If he checks the figures I believe he will find that he is incorrect, because as far as I am aware the RPI has increased by 60 per cent. since 1982.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03305"><member>Lord McCarthy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that the noble Lord is right. The point I am making (and I think he will find that I am correct) is that the RPI has increased considerably more than the increase in earnings. That is the essential point, and so any advance in real earnings over the past decade has now been wiped out. I do not believe that the noble Lord will challenge the fact that we now have negative real wage growth.<lb/>
That brings me to my third question: if the Government are still committed to real wage decline &#x2014;if that is the Government's policy despite the fact that it has not been mentioned this evening&#x2014;how much real wage decline do we need and how long must it go on? When Mr. Lawson was Chancellor of the Exchequer he was committed to the notion that there were all kinds of advantageous consequences if one could only get down the level of real wages. He produced a document entitled, <i>The relationship between employment and wages: empirical evidence for the United Kingdom,</i> published by the Treasury in 1986. That document was much disputed at the time, especially by those who were said to have contributed to its conclusions and who said that it suggested a much more positive relationship between the level of wages and the level of employment. Nevertheless, we can take that publication as some kind of index of what the Government believe that they might achieve by negative real wage growth.<lb/>
"Lawson's law" suggests that a 1 per cent. reduction in real wages produces another 165,000 jobs. In other words, a 3 per cent. reduction in real wages cuts unemployment by about 500,000, or about 2 per cent. My question therefore is: is that the Government's policy? Do they accept that relationship? Do they still accept Lawson's law? Do they believe that to cure the problem of rising unemployment and to knock something like 500,000 off the figures we should now see a reduction in real wages of
<col>406</col>
about 3 per cent.? If that is the Government's policy, how long would it need to continue to produce that result?<lb/>
Is that policy practical? In that respect, we can look back to the few occasions when we have managed to reduce real wages. It is unusual to reduce real wages. After all, if real wages did not rise people would never be better off. If real wages did not rise we would still have the standard of living that they had in Dicken's day. The main way in which working people raise their standard of living is by obtaining wages which are slightly ahead of prices. It happens in all countries virtually all the time. Nevertheless, since the 'sixties we have managed to drive down the level of wages below the level of prices one year in six.<lb/>
The problem is that except on one or two occasions that has been followed by a compensating rise in real wages in the following year, or the one after, which has largely wiped out that position. The only two occasions that I can see when we can argue that there has been a more or less lasting (not permanent) reduction in real wages is in 1981&#x2013;82 when the unemployment rate rose by about 10 per cent. to 12.1 per cent. and there was a small reduction in real wages. So my next question is: is that what the Government foresee &#x2014;a return to the unemployment levels of 1981&#x2013;82? Is that how we will drive down real wages? If so, we cannot say that we are doing it to increase employment.<lb/>
Secondly, there was the much despised period of 1975, 1976 and 1977, with the concordat with the TUC, when as a result of an incomes policy which I am bound to say in retrospect was much too ambitious and tough the Labour Government got the RPI down from about 24 per cent. to about 7.8 per cent. in three years. Is that the model? Perhaps not under this Prime Minister but the next, will the Government launch a wages policy? History would suggest that there are only two models to get real wages down: mass unemployment or an incomes policy.<lb/>
I do not suggest, and I hope that noble Lords will not think that I do, that there is no relationship at all between real wage growth and economic activity and prosperity. I do not suggest that it never matters to the economy how far real wages move ahead. Indeed, if we look at some of the countries whose economies have been praised in the debate this evening&#x2014;Germany and Japan&#x2014;we see that the notion of sustainable real wage growth is an essential part of their economic success. It is understood in those economies that there must be something like a rate each year, depending on circumstances, in which real wages can advance. If real wages systematically attempt to advance beyond that sustainable rate, various things must happen which the economy will not like and which would probably bring real wages down.<lb/>
We have had something like that in the past. There have been periods when it was reasonable to argue that the rate of real wage improvement was a problem. In the 1960s there was undue escalation in real wage growth in the upswing of the cycle. That upswing
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0243"/>
<col>407</col>
produced all kinds of shortages in the labour market which the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, has mentioned. This fed further wage increases. We thought that the answer was incomes policy. I do not believe that it is. The answer is on the supply side. The answer is training, to try to meet the shortage of skills before the upswing.<lb/>
There are occasions&#x2014;and there was one in the 1970s&#x2014;when, as a result of some external factor (in that case a deterioration in the terms of trade), there needs to be a reduction in real wage growth. If the external factor is sufficiently severe, there may even need to be not a reduction in real wage growth but a period of negative real wage growth. That is what we tried to achieve in the 1970s with the incomes policy. As a result of the two oil shocks we suffered a traumatic deterioration in the terms of trade which necessitated a reduction in real wages. We tried to bring it about by the incomes policy. The Labour Government did so. They were so successful that in one year they reduced real wages by 7 per cent. and the next year they ran away.<lb/>
I do not suggest that there are no circumstances in which Teal wage growth is a problem. There are two ways of solving it. One way is the way of the Left which has been mentioned in this debate. It is to try to have some kind of round table economic assessment with a new bargaining agenda and some way of bringing the parties to the bargaining process to discuss the state of the economy and to try to arrive at an understanding of sustainable real wage growth. Presumably that is not obvious or available at the moment.<lb/>
However one action can be taken. I wish to end by suggesting this to the Government: they must stop trying to talk out and rubbish the historical notion of the RPI as a measure of the justice or adequacy of a wage settlement, in favour of what they now use&#x2014;the forecast rate of the RPI. They must recognise that they have failed to predict the RPI for three years. I have looked at the economic surveys and it seems to me as though since 1980 the Government have forecast the RPI too low on five occasions; too high on one occasion and just right on five occasions.<lb/>
The difficulty is that the times when they forecast too low include the past three years. That has devalued the notion of forecasting the RPI. Again, I calculate that in the past three years the actual increase in the RPI has been 25 per cent. in the period during which the forecast increase was 14 per cent. Thus the postulations of the RPI have been more than 50 per cent. out. That is why the Government must go for the historical RPI. It is the only figure that makes sense to working people. If the RPI continues to go up and down from year to year, as it has in the past, then it all comes out in the wash. If we try to relate wages to historical prices and they fall next year, we are better off. If they rise next year, we are worse off. It all comes out in the wash.<lb/>
If the Government are right and the RPI is now heading steadily downwards, never to rise again, to the 0 per cent. in which Mr. Lawson used to believe, then we can afford it. If we have a declining RPI which
<col>408</col>
will not rise in the foreseeable future, we can afford real wage growth. If, as I suspect and as many speakers on this side have said, the forecast of a 5 per cent. RPI by the end of next year is hopelessly optimistic, then it is a good thing that we should not seek to link pay settlements to it.<lb/>
I believe that even this Government could get somewhere near common sense if they would say, for example, in the public sector and certainly generally that a historical measure of the RPI is the best way to talk sense about wage settlements. There may be companies that cannot afford the RPI. They have to say to their employees that this year the RPI means bankruptcy. That makes sense. Other companies will say to their employees, "We can only just afford the RPI. If you want more than that there must be a contribution, some productivity, some improvement". At least in those circumstances we have a base of sense on which to talk.<lb/>
In the meantime and in any case, I reiterate my questions. Do the Government consider that declining real wage growth is a key to recovery? If so, for how long? How much? How do they believe it would affect unemployment? Why not accept the case for a historical RPI?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03306">8.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03307"><member>Lord Briginshaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and congratulate him on his presentation. I should like also to make one or two brief remarks in response to Her Majesty's Government's proposals for the coming Session. I wish to talk about three subjects which, for our purposes, can be called: the big problem; the big question and the big idea.<lb/>
What is the big problem? It is that this Government have, after 10 years in office, utterly and miserably failed to place the nation's economy on an internationally competitive footing. How has this come about? The answer is depressingly simple. The Government have sacrificed, are sacrificing, and plan to continue to sacrifice, our manufacturing industries and capacity in favour of what can only be described as speculative and short-term economic arrangements.<lb/>
We need look no further than the square mile for the evidence. The City's verdict on the ill-timed entry into the European exchange rate mechanism makes plain the Government's failures. The exchange rate mechanism was not designed as a panacea. Its stability is only valuable as a background to proper economic management. It is a facility rather than an answer to the problem. Its likely short-term effects make this abundantly clear.<lb/>
It is possible, though far from certain, that come the spring there will be a temporary revival in the southern British economy based on an easing of interest rates. The property sector may recover enough to enable those who are clever enough to do so to take their money and run. The aim, of course, is to shore up the crumbling walls of the so-called Tory heartlands. Interest rates, however, can only ease if the pound remains at its current high level. This is not good news for our manufacturing industries, still based largely in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0244"/>
<col>409</col>
the Midlands and the North, as they need a lower pound to compete in the international market place. By entering the exchange rate mechanism with this high pound, the Government have ensured that manufacturing industry will suffer in the coming year. They have once again sacrificed a prospect of sustainable growth for political rather than economic gain. We admire the Germans and the Japanese. However, they are not sacrificing their manufacturing sectors. They encourage them at all costs. We should do likewise. However, there is no such encouragement outlined in the Government's plans for the new Session.<lb/>
What, then, is the big question that I referred to? It is the question of who will manufacture and sell the goods to satisfy the vast market that is unfolding to the east of Germany. It looks at this moment as if the American/German axis will supply the mechanics of the answer to what has been the most important question to face Europeans this century. A conclusion that denies British interests is not however inevitable. The expansion of potential and existing trade eastwards will take up much of the next four decades. If, in the short term, manufacturing industry is given the support it deserves and in the long term proper investment in education and technology is made, we can still participate in the prosperity that we would otherwise miss.<lb/>
Finally I turn to the big idea that I referred to. My party espouses this idea of education. A skilled and educated workforce is the greatest form of long-term encouragement to manufacturers who seek to compete with the Germans and the Japanese. Patchwork measures such as a few city technology colleges do not qualify as encouragement in the real world. What is needed is billions more pounds than the sums currently proposed to be spent on creating a modern and technologically advanced educational infrastructure. It is all very simple. Better education means greater manufacturing strength.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03308">8.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03309"><member>Lord Boardman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join other speakers in congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Castle of Blackburn, on her maiden speech. I do so with particular pleasure because I made my maiden speech in another place on an occasion when the noble Baroness was on the Front Bench conducting a transport Bill through that House. I am afraid that I made far less impact upon her and upon the House on that occasion than she made upon me and upon this House on the occasion of her maiden speech today.<lb/>
The topical issue today is the amendment which has been moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. However, before I discuss that, I must refer to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. All kinds of statistics have been bandied across the Floor of the House. I do not propose to do likewise. I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, perhaps drawing inspiration from what the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, said, drew his figures from a date which happened to be particularly
<col>410</col>
convenient for him. We are now in a period where the economic position is less favourable than it has been in the past.<lb/>
I shall sum up the present economic position by saying that we have had 11 years of ever-increasing prosperity. Rising standards of living have occurred in that period. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, shakes his head, but he can argue with me when he has the opportunity to speak. There has been rising prosperity and rising standards of living for young and old alike across the board. The noble Lord will no doubt try to refute that but I hope he will choose his statistics less selectively than has been the case in some speeches today.<lb/>
As I have said, the economic position today is less favourable than it has been in the past. We are going through a difficult period. We are going through what I believe was referred to earlier this afternoon as a technical recession. However, that phenomenon is very different from the kind of depression which previous generations experienced when the economy of this country suffered from bad political management.<lb/>
I believe that the main cause of our present downturn, if it is a downturn, was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. There is no doubt that overgenerous credit has been granted worldwide in previous years. Today this has resulted in a worldwide credit squeeze. That applies across the board. The Opposition cannot deny that. When I was a banker I was constantly criticised for the banks having failed to provide the money needed to enable expansion and growth to take place. Now my successors are criticised by the very same people for making improvident loans which are causing problems as regards repayment.<lb/>
As I have said, there is now a worldwide credit squeeze. That is having, and will have, an adverse effect upon world trade for some time to come. The United States of America, Japan and Europe are all suffering from similar symptoms. This situation may well last throughout the year ahead. Britain has now entered the exchange rate mechanism. That is imposing, and is intended to impose, a severe discipline upon us. Your Lordships will recall that that step was necessary as the value of sterling had fallen by an average of 5 per cent. per annum against the deutschmark since 1970. Therefore United Kingdom exporters were able to retain their markets while increasing wages to a higher level than those of Continental firms. However, the exchange rate mechanism will mean that such a process will no longer be possible.<lb/>
Increases in wages must now be in line with those of our major competitors in Europe or else we will suffer a heavy loss of jobs. I hope that noble Lords opposite, including the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, who has now left us, will wish to press for salary and wage restraint in line with that in the Community. That is a strong medicine and in the short term it will he quite painful and not entirely pleasant. However, I believe it is right. The noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, referred to the point at which we entered the exchange
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0245"/>
<col>411</col>
rate mechanism. He asked whether the figure of 2.95 deutschmarks was correct. I do not know whether that figure was right. It was a difficult decision which had to be taken. However, on balance, I support the Chancellor in fixing the rate at that point.<lb/>
There is one area of the economy which causes me exceptional concern; that is, agriculture. My noble friend Lord Alexander of Weedon referred to this matter earlier. I do not wish to start a discussion on agriculture but I must voice my concern. I believe agriculture is the most important industry in this country and it is getting a raw deal both from the Community and beyond. There are signs of major bankruptcies occurring. My noble friend Lord Young of Graffham referred earlier today to transatlantic telephone calls. He gave an example of where competition had brought down the price of transatlantic calls. He appeared to challenge any other industry to match that achievement. However, agriculture is suffering from prices which in real terms are far below those which existed even before the war. I believe the consequences of that are somewhat alarming. I do not expect my noble friend to deal with this matter today, but it is an area which demands special attention. I should declare an interest because I have a small involvement in a farming business.<lb/>
I turn now to the amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. I recognise that we shall have an opportunity to debate the Select Committee report in a few days' time and that perhaps it would be more appropriate to save most of my remarks for that occasion. However, one cannot avoid mentioning the single currency in an economic debate because it is such an important factor in our economic planning for the years ahead.<lb/>
I hope that I am a good European. I have consistently supported measures aimed at producing a wider and fairer Europe. I see the attraction of a single currency, but I also see some of the problems. It must inevitably mean a European central bank with authority over many matters which are at present under the control of individual nations. It must mean control of our monetary policies, control of interest rates and the pooling of reserves of gold and foreign currencies. Those are major decisions. It is also conceded by all the advocates of a single currency that it must mean a degree of political union. At the same time it must be free of political control.<lb/>
The Bundesbank is often quoted as an example of the type of central bank that Europe should have. I question, however, whether it has the degree of independence that some advocates claim for it. Dr. P&#x00F6;hl himself, when giving evidence earlier this year to a select committee, said that Parliament could change Bundesbank law with a one-vote majority. That is not complete political independence. We all know that when a very important decision had to be made on the basis on which the deutschmark and the ostmark would merge the decision was more that of Chancellor Kohl than of Dr. Karl Otto P&#x00F6;hl.<lb/>
If there is to be a European central bank I question how it would be created and democratically controlled. Earlier the noble Lord, Lord Moran,
<col>412</col>
referred to an article in <i>The Times</i> today which mentioned the draft statutes which had been agreed, but not published, by the central bank governors and apparently claimed that a European central bank must be independent. I understand that. So too must all the national central banks, which again I accept would be a logical consequence. The draft statutes also state that the governing council should be appointed by the Council of Ministers. Its members should have long tenures and should not he subject to recall or replacement by national governments or the European Parliament. I ask, therefore, how democratic control is to be exercised. I wonder how many of the other 11 members of the Community would be prepared to leave their economies to be ruled by such an undemocratic process. Of course I see the attraction of a single currency to tourists, exporters and, largely, to the City.<lb/>
Tonight is not the time to deal with questions of regional policy. That is a matter which I hope can be debated when we debate the report some time next week.<lb/>
Finally, it would be ironic if Europe were to move towards a federation or confederation, or whatever name is given to it, because the pooling of our resources into a European central bank with political and monetary union must move in that direction, while at the same time the other major economies were delegating such authority to their constituent parts, such as in the USSR. Those are matters which need consideration. I have no concluded view. I am not trying to be an advocate for or against, but I believe that the proposals need much more thought, not just by us but by the other countries involved in the operation. I hope that that consideration will be given before any decisions are made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03311"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House always listens with great respect to the noble Lord in view of his wide experience and the well-informed contributions that he makes to our debates. However, I fear that on a number of the points I cannot agree with him. I agree entirely however that the position in Europe is central to the whole of our economy.<lb/>
I had thought of making a comparison and taking Shakespeare's words that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet and saying in reverse that a recession by any other name is equally unpleasant and disastrous. I cannot possibly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, that we are now in the midst of a technical recession. That is a new term. My noble friends have already documented the extent to which the economy is on an uncontrolled downward trend. I would go so far as to say that we are back to the dreaded stop-go method of controlling the economy which was the nightmare of successive governments in the 1960s and 1970s. One stopped when there were desperate balance of payments problems and then boosted the economy in the month before one expected to have a general election. That, at least, was the policy of successive Conservative governments. It is very likely that that is what is happening now.<lb/>

We all thought that once we had the God-given gift of North Sea oil the position would change and we would never have the problems suffered by the governments of which I had the privilege to be a member under the noble Lords, Lord Wilson and Lord Callaghan, of facing the IMF simply because of the lack of exports to sustain necessary imports. It was widely believed that the 1979 election was a particularly good election to win because the new government would have the benefit of the flow of oil. I venture to say that if anyone in your Lordships' House had suggested at that time that the deficit on the balance of payments, which was &#x00A3;1 billion, would amount to &#x00A3;15 billion in 1990 it would have been widely thought that there was a second reason why that noble Lord should not have a vote in parliamentary elections.<lb/>
In the same way, I believe that anyone who years ago had predicted the present dramatic changes in Eastern Europe would have found little support. We discussed such questions in detail yesterday but they have a bearing on our economic circumstances. I confess that I am anxious about the position of President Gorbachev, without whose immense influence the transformation in Eastern Europe could not have happened. I cannot understand why we do not raid the larders of the Community and get rid of the stocks of meat, milk, cheese and even the wine lake and send them out there. President Gorbachev does not need lectures on capitalist economics or how to run a market economy to sustain him. He needs something to put on the shelves for the consumers. It is widely understood that living standards in his country are a great deal lower today than when he first came to power. I should have thought that what I propose, together with assistance from our friends in the United States and Canada who must have plenty of grain which they could contribute, would make the transformation which is essential for stability in Europe.<lb/>
I want particularly to talk about our relations with Europe and what, I believe, sadly, is a history of lost opportunities. Until we can assess the situation with our European friends we need to face up to what place and role we have in the world&#x2014;something that we have never done. There are still those who think that we are a great power; we are not. In my view, we cannot be a great power. As my noble friend Lord Williams pointed out in moving his amendment, in what I thought was an extremely able and persuasive way, our standard of living was certainly higher (with the possible exception of neutral Sweden and Luxembourg, based on the steel industry) than anyone else's in Europe in 1945 and in 1957 when the Common Market started. Now, except for southern Italy, of the original Six we are well behind. In my view we have not faced up to the circumstances of a changing world.<lb/>
In a sense, I think one can compare our problem with that of Austria which in 1919 found itself to be a very small state, having had an enormous empire. Austria had a bad time over the years, ending up, as
<col>414</col>
one knows, with the Anschluss to Nazi Germany. They faced up to the situation, and Austria is now a very prosperous country.<lb/>
I feel it is probable that in our relations with our European friends we have lost 45 years. My own views about European union were shaped by that great European, Jean Monnet. I had the privilege of visiting him when he had just become president of the Coal and Steel Community. After dinner in a long conversation, fortified, I confess, by some excellent brandy from his family firm, he persuaded me of the essential role that we all had to play in Europe. He said that as a Frenchman he believed France had a contribution to make to the world and could not make it alone. That was why he felt that France had to work in conjunction with European allies. As an Englishman, I believe we have a contribution to make. I also believe we cannot do it alone. That is why we should use the Community to pursue the ends that all of us wish to achieve.<lb/>
I accept that since we were offered the leadership of Europe at the end of the war and turned it down, it could be alleged that the Labour Government of the late Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin were mistaken in not joining the Coal and Steel Community in 1951. But I think they had already done a tremendous job in harassing, or rather harnessing, the United States to Europe (with a little bit of harassment as well) through the Marshall Plan and the Treaty of Brussels which led to NATO. I think their contribution was enormous and will be duly recognised by history. But in those circumstances one can understand that they tended to have a transatlantic rather than a European view. I am bound to say that many thought that the idea of a supra-national authority was a totally alien concept. I recall people flicking their fingers through the index of Erskine May and not finding any reference to it at all. That was one opportunity lost.<lb/>
There were great expectations in Europe when the 1951 Government came to power because that great man, Winston Churchill, had raised many expectations in Europe with his speech at The Hague, his great oratory at the foundation of the Council of Europe, and his proposal that there should be a European army. There was great disappointment in Europe when it was found that he followed the same foreign policy as his predecessors.<lb/>
It is worth reflecting that the reason that the concept of a European army failed was because France was not prepared to join together with Germany without us. That is in stark contrast to the recent history of the Community when we have all been a little concerned about the dominance of the Franco-German alliance. It was possible for German re-armament to take place only when, in the modified Treaty of Brussels, we committed ourselves, uniquely within NATO, to a 55,000-troop commitment and a tactical air force commitment on the Continent. In the contributions that we have made to NATO we have stretched our resources rather more than we should. The fact is that we missed all those opportunities. I was not surprised when Paul-Henri Spaak told me that it was his intention next time not to get just some
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0247"/>
<col>415</col>
commodities into a European framework; but they were going to have something which would control the whole of the economies. That led to the conference at Messina which led to the Treaty of Rome. For reasons that I have never understood, we were not represented, even by an observer, at the Messina Conference. We lost a great deal as a result. I am quite certain that things would have been very different had we been there. People sometimes talk nonsense when referring to sovereignty; it is quite ridiculous because every time one signs a treaty one does it in good faith; one is giving up a certain amount of one's sovereignty. In a rather important area, the British Parliament has given <i>de facto</i> if not <i>de jure</i> sovereignty to the Falkland Islands&#x2014;to what I should imagine amounts to a rather small parish council&#x2014;by giving them a veto over our affairs with the Argentine. In this day and age in no way can it be accepted that one can be totally in charge of all one's affairs.<lb/>
Although belated, I welcome, as did the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, our membership of the ERM. Unlike him, I think that we have gone in at the wrong time, at the wrong parity and for the wrong reasons. I have never been taken with the idea that sterling is something sacred; I believe it is so only in politicians' speeches, not in any other real sense. One understands that when one runs at a very adverse balance of payments deficit, to have a lower rate of sterling against the mark and other currencies is in the short run an immense problem. It increases the attraction of imports and probably makes it more difficult to get a quick balance. But in the long run it is the only way to reach a solution; namely, more exports and fewer imports. I have never been persuaded that we should allow sterling to dictate our economic policy.<lb/>
Equally, I believe that a great deal of nonsense has been talked about the importance of a high rate of interest in order to bring down inflation. While I was very much in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, who stressed the importance of indirect taxes in pushing up the inflation rate, for many people their increased poll tax is rather more serious than marginal increases in VAT.<lb/>
Let us face it. The real reason that the rate of interest came down, and why we joined the ERM to obtain some stability for sterling, was because it was widely reckoned that with the likely loss of capital through the decline in the value of the pound because of our declining economy, we should not be able to borrow the necessary money to bridge the deficit between our exports and imports. That is the main reason why a fall&#x2014;in my view a too small fall&#x2014;in the interest rate occurred. However, whatever happens down the corridor was put into perspective by a French journalist. This morning on the BBC, when asked his view about whether or not there would be an election within the Conservative Party, he said, "It will not make front page news in France. We have far more serious issues to consider. We have a students' strike at the moment." It is probably salutary to consider matters in that context.<lb/>
We must avoid some of the mistakes that we have made in the past, very largely from a lack of
<col>416</col>
understanding. We have not accepted as right some of the different procedures&#x2014;in parliament and in government&#x2014;that our Continental friends adopt. However, we should avoid the arrogance of saying that our way is the only way and necessarily the best. We would do better to listen more, to learn, and to preach rather less.<lb/>
The preamble of the Treaty of Rome is in very eloquent prose. It states the virtues&#x2014;and I believe in many of them&#x2014;of a collective Europe and its contribution to world peace and prosperity. Among the annexes and protocols one finds, for example, that there had to be special arrangements for Luxembourg agriculture. I did not realise that in the 1950s this was one of its problems. I thought it was prosperous as a result of the Arbed steelworks. We also find a special arrangement to import an extra quota of bananas to Germany. We find special arrangements for imports of unroasted coffee beans to Italy and the Netherlands. In a sentence, one has to speak the language of the preamble and look after one's national interest, as in the spirit of the annexes.<lb/>
My experience in Europe is that if one is thought not to be looking after one's own national interest, there is something extremely suspicious about one. I worry every time the right honourable lady the Prime Minister embarrasses 11 colleagues by banging the table and saying that her job is to look after our national interests. What does she consider that the other 11 are engaged upon in that gathering? I suggest that the difference is that many of them look after their national interests rather more effectively and efficiently than we have managed to look after our own.<lb/>
Finally, I know that it is the greatest crime in politics to be right if one's party is wrong. If one is wrong and the party is right one can be forgiven. But if it is the other way round, one is never forgiven. However, in the interests of Europe and of our own national interests, I believe that many more people in all parties ought now to take that risk.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03313"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first I should like to join with others who have congratulated the noble Baroness, Lady Castle (elusive though she may be) on her very powerful maiden speech. It was a remarkable speech. To have achieved triple maidenhood must be a near miracle. In addition, I should like to say how grateful I am, as another woman, to the noble Baroness for all that she has achieved in her career on behalf of women. It will not surprise noble Lords that I frankly do not agree with a great deal of what the noble Baroness says or does. However, I very much agree with the work that she has undertaken in that area. She and Margaret Thatcher&#x2014;and I recognise that they are not always coupled together&#x2014;must forever have killed the myth that women do not have the stamina, the toughness, the determination, or even the sheer downright beastliness when required, to play the game of politics and to play it very successfully.<lb/>
Looking back over the past 20 years, I am also extremely grateful to her for the initiative that she
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0248"/>
<col>417</col>
took to get the equal pay legislation on to the statute books. No doubt she had to fight not only opponents on the other side of the House, but opponents inside her own party. I was never privy to those debates but it would surprise me very much if she had not encountered considerable difficulties on both sides of the House. However, the determination that we saw this afternoon carried it through. Ahead of what was being done in other countries in the Community, it was the start of the improvement of the position of women which was of the greatest importance and which we undoubtedly owe to her.<lb/>
Listening to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Williams&#x2014;it now seems a long time ago&#x2014;I felt that one had to have a very short memory if one were to accept the argument implicit in everything he said: that the Labour Party is the party of financial responsibility, efficiency in government, and clear economic vision; and that its economic policies had brought success to this country, and would do so again.<lb/>
In my pocket I have a little chart. It shows the decline of the UK share in world markets in manufacturing. It is a steady downward trend through both governments with very few upward blips. It is a decline in both volume and in value. When the noble Lord spoke of the failure of the Government to control inflation, I cannot but remember the days when, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd&#x2014;sitting where the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, now sits&#x2014;stated in a debate in 1975 that the country looked over the abyss of appallingly high inflation and then drew back.<lb/>
Nor can I forget the heavy overmanning that characterised industry during the days when Labour was in power. They were unable to tackle it because of their subservience to the trade unions. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, wishes to take me by the throat, but I do not propose to give way at this time of night. Nor do I forget the inadequacy of the Labour Government's contribution to training and to education. It is our greatest disaster that we are woefully behind our competitors in Europe and in the Asian countries in good training. However, that did not start with the Conservative Government. The Labour Government had been in office long enough in order to have had an opportunity to put that right, and that they failed to do. There is great joy in Heaven over the one sinner that repenteth, and I am almost prepared to believe that the Labour Front Bench here has repented. We may or may not have the opportunity to see whether they can put their new determination into practice.<lb/>
That being so, on the Government's performance, which is what we have been discussing today, I would say that in the early days of the Conservative Government they did a number of things that very greatly needed doing. They took on the issue of the trade unions. That needed to be done. I remember canvassing in 1970 in my last totally unsuccessful attempt to get into another place and being told in
<col>418</col>
Labour neighbourhoods, "We are Labour here, of course; but what are you going to do about the unions?"<lb/>
I believe that today the Conservative Government have gone too far in their attack on unions; and you cannot run an industrial country without some trade unions. However, the unions were completely out of hand before, and the reforms that were brought in were necessary. Also necessary was a very great deal of the de-manning inside industry. Industry needed to be made a great deal more efficient. Those of us who studied these things at the time know perfectly well the comparative studies which were done inside companies then using the same machinery and making the same products in different countries. They proved again and again the low level of our productivity in relation to the productivity of factories in other countries. The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, talked about levels of pay. I was very interested because at no point did he talk about the relevance of levels of productivity in relation to levels of pay. He talked only about the RPI in relation to levels of pay. But surely both must be taken into account if you do not want inflationary pay settlements of one kind or another. I agree that excessive payment to top managers has been unwise and has given an extremely bad example.<lb/>
However, just to get the record straight, I should like to say that while the increases to the very top people have been outrageous in many cases, the average level of pay to our managers in this country is low in comparison with their competitors elsewhere. That may in fact have something to do with our poor performance. But it is by no means as simple an issue as has been represented by some speakers today here and elsewhere. There were therefore some very big improvements, and getting into people's heads the value of the market&#x2014;something which we have heard very little about&#x2014;and the importance of competition have been genuine gains.<lb/>
Having said that, things have gone pretty badly wrong since; and I think there is a bigger failure on the part of the Government. I should like to spend a little time on that aspect. I believe that the years 1989, 1990 and 1991 will be seen in the future as historic years of major dramatic changes in the world, politically and economically. We are moving into a global economy. The changes are of a very great order of scale and importance and I do not believe that this Government have framed strategies on a long-term basis to deal with the totally new order of challenge with which we are being presented at the present time.<lb/>
I should like to give one or two examples, but before doing so I should like to give the Government up-to-date credit for one thing, and here I echo the noble Lord, Lord Alexander. I am very glad that they are fighting for the Uruguay round. Strong European though I am, I am ashamed that we are holding up the settlement of the Uruguay round because of differences in farming policies inside Europe; and the Government are right to be fighting this battle. However, as I said a moment ago, they have not
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0249"/>
<col>419</col>
prepared adequately either themselves or the country for the scale of change with which we are being confronted.<lb/>
The scale of change is global. I have just mentioned the Uruguay round, and part of that change involves our attitude towards developing countries: our trade with them, our policies towards them, our debt policies and our policies in relation to population. These all form part of the problems of the economy and tonight does not give us time to spend on them. However, I would remind your Lordships that in this great global change that is going on we are facing a doubling of world population between now and the year 2025. That is a figure which dwarfs almost all other figures in importance economically, politically and socially. Any policy dealing with the change that is going on in the world as a whole must be a policy to deal with the problems of developing countries.<lb/>
Not least of those problems is the poverty of those countries; so there is management of debt, there is trade and, used judiciously, aid. There are opportunities for training there. The need is of the highest order and we have heard very little about it. There is very little, if anything at all, in the gracious Speech about what attitude we are going to take towards that whole segment of the world, which is important not only in its own right but important to our trading position in the future.<lb/>
Then there is the problem of getting our competitiveness right in two major ways. We have talked about it so often before. Infrastructure is one element and making the most of the opportunities which will open up with the Channel Tunnel is another. How extraordinary it is that the money has gone into the Channel Tunnel but that we are failing to provide the necessary transport links so to make it possible to put goods on the train in Liverpool or Newcastle and take them off in Dusseldorf. Money invested to achieve that would pay off in a very short period of time in so many ways; in straight trade terms and in the alleviation of unemployment in various parts of the country. It is so short sighted. I think it is the short-sightedness of the Government for which they are most culpable. It is so short sighted not to see that money put into this now will pay dividends again, again and again in the years not very far ahead.<lb/>
As to training and education, I have talked so often about this that perhaps the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, might say it should be put to music because it is the same old song. But the fact remains that we are grossly behind and the tinkering that we are doing in those areas at the present time does not begin to meet what is needed. There will not be work for the semiskilled, and the unskilled in this country and in the highly industrialised countries of the world in the future, except for a very small number.<lb/>
We should be looking in every possible place and seeking in every possible way to up-rate the levels of knowledge, skill and competence of all the people in this country, young and old. The sixteens to eighteens are very important indeed; but so are a great many people in the older age groups, who, because they never had training before they left school and left
<col>420</col>
school only too willingly, have never really acquired any skills or competences. Much can be done if the resources are there to upgrade those skills. The prejudice against employing older people is keeping many women of a high level of potential out of the labour market where they are very badly needed. These are just some of the major schemes on a long-term basis which we urgently need to have developed if we are to meet the real problems of the future.<lb/>
Again, another example which has already been referred to many times today concerning the lack of a long-term policy of the Government is their attitude towards Europe. Of course we went into the ERM at the wrong moment. We went in at the last possible moment and we should have been in five years ago. We were urging the Government from these Benches to enter five years ago, and they did not do that. Changes are taking place whether or not we want them. I shall not spend a lot of time on this matter this evening because we shall discuss that next week when we debate the report from the Select Committee. However, unless we are there to influence what is happening, we shall lose out extremely badly.<lb/>
We should have been at Messina. Had we been there, the balance in favour of agricultural interests against industrial interests would not have taken place because we, as an industrial power, would have ganged up in our own interests, as the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, said&#x2014;and why not?&#x2014;in order to see that there was a proper balance between the industrial and agricultural interests. However, we were not there. Again and again we have not been there.<lb/>
Of course, I believe in the single market, a single currency and a central bank as general ideas. Nobody yet knows what their shape will be. The important matter is to be in on the shaping so that it comes out in a form and in a way which is acceptable to us. As we have said before from these Benches, the Government should not continue to say "No, no" but should say, "Yes, but" and be there to argue the toss. It is very important to be there to argue the toss.<lb/>
Here I disagree with much that was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Castle. As she is now here, perhaps I may say to her how much I enjoyed her maiden speech although she would not expect me to agree with all of it.<lb/>
I do not believe that Brussels should be laying down in detail what should be done in social terms. There should be some social programmes to match the economic development. Without that, there will be no economic development. That is two sides of the same coin. However, the details of that should not be laid down by Brussels. The details of general principles, laid down in Brussels and agreed by the Council of Ministers in the parliament, should be worked out in the individual countries. That is what subsidiarity&#x2014;a horrible word&#x2014;is all about. However, we should be there to explain what is involved in subsidiarity and to insist that we get it right and that the right decisions are made in the right places.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0250"/>
<col>421</col>
On a previous occasion I believe that I quoted the words of Paul-Henri Spaak&#x2014;a great socialist European. I make no apology for repeating those words because they are so apt to our circumstances today. Thirty years ago I heard Paul-Henri Spaak speaking in Chatham House, and he said, "At the end of the war you people in the United Kingdom could have done anything you wanted with Europe. We expected you, we waited for you, you did not come, so we went on alone". Are we going to do that again?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03314">9.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03315"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, most of the relevant topics have been covered. I hope therefore that I shall be forgiven if I concentrate on only a few themes. Of course, I begin by congratulating my noble friend Lady Castle on her maiden speech. I was particularly impressed by the balance of her exposition and by her objectivity. Perhaps I may echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Walston. I cannot wait to hear her when she feels truly able to speak her mind.<lb/>
I wish to deal with one remark made by the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, which was repeated by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. The noble Lord, Lord Belstead, produced the standard clich&#x00E9; on wealth creation and the private sector. Is he saying that the purveyors of pornography in Soho are the wealth creators while the people in the medical profession who help the workforce to return to work are not? Is that what he means when he pushes the private sector against the public sector? Is he saying that the <i>Sun</i> newspaper, with its disgusting front page yesterday attacking his honourable friends, is an example of wealth creation while the teachers in our schools are not?<lb/>
Both of those private sector activities are designed to make money. To my mind, or that of any reasonable person, that should not be called wealth. I believe that when noble Lords produce those clich&#x00E9;s, they should reflect rather more on exactly what they are saying.<lb/>
While I am criticising the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, I pursue the point made by my noble friend Lord Jay that the noble Lord should get his facts right. He referred to nine successive years of growth as being unprecedented in our economy. From 1959 onwards for 15 years there was continuous economic growth. Indeed, that was the heyday of Keynesianism and again that is something which he should not forget. Indeed, I believe that he was a Minister at that time and although it seems to me that he is currently anxious to go down with a sinking ship, he should not underestimate the contribution of his own government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03316"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for the compliment to the late Conservative administration, which is unusual from him, does he not realise that the long continued development under this Government is a complement and continuation of that? There is no conflict between the two ideas.</membercontribution></p>
<col>422</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03317"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is merely a conflict of fact. I believe that one should get one's facts right. He said that nine years is unprecedented, but 15 is a larger number than nine. Therefore, he is simply mistaken. That is the only point I am making.<lb/>
While I am in this mood, perhaps I should make a similar comment to the noble Lord, Lord Boardman. He referred to 11 years of continuing prosperity. That number should be eight or perhaps nine because we do not yet have the figures for 1990. Noble Lords opposite seem to have a problem with 1981 and 1982. In both of those years output fell. Sigmund Freud may have understood their desire to repress those two years but it is somewhat beyond me.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn to the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, who I cannot see in his place. When I was preparing for today's debate, I looked forward to hearing his speech. In particular I thought I should try to predict what he might say. In my personal life I am deeply conservative and absolutely hate change. The noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, did not let me down. He devoted the opening part of his speech to a personal attack on my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel. He has been doing that for four years and much as I always seek to protect my noble friend, I was delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Young, did not feel able to change his standard pattern. However, he said something with which I agree. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, said exactly the same thing. They emphasised the importance of the GATT round. It is vitally important that that should succeed. From reading newspaper reports many of us are extremely gloomy that the whole thing may collapse.<lb/>
Curiously, the noble Lord, Lord Young, referred to the tariff barriers of the 1930s. I cannot help but reflect on the history of that time. It was essentially members of the Conservative Party who were the greatest exponents of tariff barriers in those days, aided and abetted by the Beaverbrook press. The great figure who encouraged us, when the war was coming to an end, to fight above everything else to move towards free trade was Maynard Keynes. Again, he was a figure much denigrated on those Benches. If one favours free trade arrangements and suitable monetary affairs one should recall the great contribution that Keynes made.<lb/>
I turn to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, who again does not seem to be in his place. I am not sure what is happening with his amendment; perhaps it has been withdrawn. We shall no doubt be told about that in a moment. I was surprised by some aspects of his comments. When I was a student I was taught, and still believe, that the essence of British parliamentary democracy is party government. I do not, and never would, apologise for being concerned with party unity. I make that point especially to noble Lords opposite as a non-party matter. Party unity is extremely important.<lb/>
On the European issue I can say that I am in favour of the European Community. I regard those who take the opposite view as mistaken. I do not regard them as evil or as enemies. I simply disagree with them. Again
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0251"/>
<col>423</col>
addressing noble Lords opposite, as well as my own friends, I do not regard this great European question as a valid ground for leaving a party, let alone destroying a great political party.<lb/>
I do not propose to say much more in this debate on the European Community or on EMU. I was a member of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington. Its survey of the subject and analysis of the problems are first rate. In my view its conclusions are sensible, and your Lordships will be able to debate them in detail next week. I am not a Euro fanatic. If I may recycle an old joke, the only way I can retain my degree of pro-Europeanism is never to visit Brussels. Merely setting foot in the Berlemont converts me into a raging anti-European even more than one or two of my noble friends.<lb/>
More seriously, realism requires us to recognise that we are permanently in the Community, and the only way to go is forward. I for one wish to see us lead that forward march in a sensible direction, not lagging behind like a recalcitrant child moaning and groaning and&#x2014;to continue the simile&#x2014;asking for a smack.<lb/>
Perhaps I may refer briefly to a remark made by my noble friend Lord Donoughue which was of extreme importance. One or two noble Lords referred earlier to the reduction of the national debt and the government claim that that is some kind of achievement. Reducing the national debt simply involves a reduction in internal transfers from taxpayers to interest earners, and many of those are the same people. In discussing the cumulative balance of payments on current account deficit, the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, put the figure at &#x00A3;50 billion but I would put it higher. He referred to that correctly as a reduction in the net assets of this country. That is what is so important and also so frightening.<lb/>
Turning more generally to the balance of payments deficit, if there has been a supply side transformation, and if the rate of exchange was right&#x2014;whatever that means&#x2014;the deficit must be attributable to excess demand on a massive scale. But that excess demand is directly attributable to the Government's policies. All that can be said for the Government at the moment is that they are attempting to rectify, albeit belatedly, their own errors.<lb/>
Unfortunately, matters are worse than that. We must ask what level of capacity utilisation and what level of unemployment the Government are aiming at. In particular, we must ask what they are aiming at which is compatible with a satisfactory balance of payments. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is careful not to tell us. However, we can infer from his pronouncements that it will he a long time before we return to anything like stability. The sustainable position for the real economy will continue to involve large-scale unemployment. In the Government's view, 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. unemployment is the best we can do even in the long term.<lb/>
Finally on this point, to reiterate what my noble friend Lord Williams said, the Government's position implies that what is called core or underlying inflation will be permanently stuck at around 5 per cent. Per
<col>424</col>
annum, which means that the value of money is halved every nine years. As my noble friend Lord Callaghan and others said, that really means that improvements on the supply side have been on an altogether smaller scale than the Government claim. Our manufacturing base is far too small. Without active policies involving more research and development and much more training we cannot reach a viable position. Apropos the Autumn Statement, it is disgraceful that in these circumstances the training programme is being cut back, that research and development is not given a central position and is not being strongly enhanced.<lb/>
As for the rate of exchange, the silence on this matter is disturbing. I understand the anti-inflationary benefits of a high nominal value for the currency. However, that only works if those who set incomes and prices act rationally and rapidly. But what are the Government doing to encourage that? They are pursuing a covert incomes policy in the public sector. Clearly again from the Autumn Statement the Government expect workers in the public services to suffer real wage cuts in the coming year. That is so, even though no one is arguing that the cause of our troubles is excessive real wages in the public sector.<lb/>
The Government offer pathetic exhortations to the private sector which in my view are echoed by even more pathetic remarks from the leadership of the CBI. Both the Government and the CBI were silly, as my noble friends have said, to reject the initiative offered by enlightened union leaders at the recent NEDC meeting. I should like to add, while on the theme of the CBI, that it looked as though the CBI had learnt that its role was not to be a slavish devotee of this Government. After all, the recent policy antics of this Government have been so damaging to British industry.<lb/>
I cannot emphasise too much therefore my distaste at recent statements by the CBI which appear to imply that given a choice between a Labour Government which would help industry and the Conservatives, its friends, it would go for the latter. I remind the CBI, since there may be one or two noble Lords present who know the people involved, that it seems increasingly likely that there will be a Labour Government fairly soon and that leading figures in business will have to learn to co-operate with us, whether they like it or not.<lb/>
Reverting to the rate of exchange, sadly one is obliged to take note of recent events in the Conservative Party. I had intended to refer to what has happened as the "twilight of the gods" but that would be to exaggerate the stature of some of the people involved. Nonetheless, the instability of government that has emerged and which must now, whatever happens, continue right up to a general election is extremely damaging to sterling.<lb/>
I wondered why the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he took us into the ERM, chose to go in with broad bands rather than narrow ones. It certainly did nothing for national pride to justify that, as he did, by drawing a comparison with Spain and Italy. However, now I understand. Clearly he had a very strong inkling of the likely political background and sterling could
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0252"/>
<col>425</col>
not have been kept within the narrow bands in the midst of a political crisis. As it is, the position remains perilous.<lb/>
To get a perspective on the whole of Tory rule it is worth looking at some of the key ratios in the economy. What emerges is startling. Certainly over the decade&#x2014;I take the whole decade of 1979 to 1989 and I hope I can be forgiven for not referring to 1990 because, as I said, we have not yet gone through the whole of this year&#x2014;there has been a small decline in the ratio of current government spending to the gross domestic product. Noble Lords opposite may favour that but I, for one, do not&#x2014;a point I have often made in the past. There has also been a rise in the ratio of total investment to GDP, but, as my noble friend Lord Williams and others have indicated, much of that is poorly structured and if we do take account of what I agree are the rather poor figures on depreciation it is not even obvious that net investment has risen at all.<lb/>
What does stand out is the rise in the ratio of consumer spending to GDP, an even bigger rise in the import ratio, and a serious fall in the export ratio. That is what lies behind all our troubles. If one asks what has happened to North Sea oil, the answer is simply that it has been spent on consumer goods from abroad.<lb/>
Recently, the Minister replied to a Question from my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington, who emphasised the fall in the export ratio. My noble friend's view was rejected by the Minister, who quoted figures in constant prices to rebut my noble friend's assertions. However, my noble friend was right. When we refer to the balance of payments, it is figures in current prices that matter. That is why the fall in the export ratio is of such great significance. If the noble Lord doubts that, I point out that bills, not least those occurring on current account to our foreign creditors, have to be paid for in current money. I regret to say that one cannot pay in so-called constant money because there is no such thing, except in the minds of economists.<lb/>
I come to my conclusion. I listened most attentively to the Leader of the House, but I have to say that it was not so much that I was puzzled by what he said in his speech but that he himself must have been puzzled by what he said. If there has been so much success, if people are so contented, if they are so much better off, why do all the tests of public opinion show the nation to be so pessimistic? Why do they view the future with such concern? Why are the Government so committed to so stringent a set of policies? Why are the opinion polls, let alone the by-election results, so bad for the Government?<lb/>
Since becoming a Member of your Lordships' House I have learnt that the Government specialise in blaming everyone but themselves for our economic ills. Are they now, as it appears, to blame an ungrateful electorate? If so they must soon recognise that the ungrateful electorate has turned on them. For once the short-termism of the Government&#x2014;by which I mean their desire to be elected no matter what
<col>426</col>
happens to the country&#x2014;cannot succeed. It is time for a change of government and a change of economic policy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03319"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was in no way surprised by the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Castle of Blackburn. I mean that in the most complimentary manner. I was expecting a superb performance. Your Lordships' House was well rewarded and its chalice overflowed. I cannot wait to see the noble Baroness when she is really in high dudgeon.<lb/>
I now wish to make an apology. Earlier today when answering a Question I pointed out to your Lordships' House that I was unable to answer on behalf of the <i>Financial Times.</i> No doubt that was of great relief to the shareholders of the <i>Financial Times.</i> The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, had referred to a quarterly figure. It was for the second quarter rather than the third quarter to which I had referred. I did not have the second-quarter figure and was unable to confirm the figure that he gave. I am now able to confirm the fall of 1.8 per cent. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that my omission was not intentional.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peston, went to some length to take apart the Government's record. A tremendous restoration has occurred this evening because in the noble Lord we saw a re-emergence of scientific socialism. The Government's aim is to keep firm control over public spending totals to bring a steady fall in the share of public spending in national income. That is essential to defeat inflation and to keep the burden of taxation to a minimum.<lb/>
In this aim we have had success. Since 1982 we have reduced the ratio of public spending to national income by a full 8 percentage points from nearly 50 per cent. to under 40 per cent. In doing so, we reversed an upward trend which had lasted for nearly 30 years. In this survey, despite a weakening of economic activity, we have held the ratio stable for the next two years. In 1993&#x2013;94 the downward trend is set to resume with the ratio falling to 39 per cent., the lowest level since the mid 1960s.<lb/>
Our second aim has been to ensure that resources are directed towards priority areas of spending. Spending on the health service has been increased in real terms by nearly half since this Government came to office. In this survey we have provided for resources for the NHS to increase by &#x00A3;3 billion next year. We have protected these most in need. Planned spending on social security benefits is up in real terms by more than 40 per cent. as compared with when we came into office. Benefit spending for the long-term sick and disabled has more than doubled in real terms.<lb/>
Investment in transport has been increased dramatically. During the next three years we plan to invest some &#x00A3;7 billion in public transport; that is twice as much as in the past three years. Spending on trunk roads and motorways will rise to more than &#x00A3;2 billion in the next three years. The settlement also allows local authorities to carry out road improvements worth nearly &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; billion during the same period. All this has been achieved by careful budgeting within planning
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0253"/>
<col>427</col>
totals which are prudent and affordable. Total spending is projected to rise by 1&#x00B7;75 per cent. a year in real terms, well within the trend growth of the economy.<lb/>
This Government's commitment to investing in infrastructure can be seen clearly by comparing our record with that of the previous administration. Investment in British Rail has risen by more than 40 per cent. in real terms. Under the previous government it rose by only 8 per cent. Investment in London Transport is up in real terms by more than 200 per cent.<lb/>
Capital spending on trunk roads and motorways next year will be more than double the real level of Labour's last year of office. Under Labour, spending fell by more than 40 per cent. Capital spending on schools per pupil has risen by more than a quarter in real terms since 1978&#x2013;79. Under the previous administration it fell by 60 per cent. Capital spending on hospitals in England will be nearly 60 per cent. higher next year in real terms than in 1978&#x2013;79. Under Labour it fell by 16 per cent. We are now funding the largest ever programme of capital spending in the history of the National Health Service.<lb/>
We are also investing heavily in improving the environment, in waste recycling, in energy efficiency programmes, in improving the quality of drinking water in Scotland and Northern Ireland where it remains in the public sector, and in building up our flood defences.<lb/>
I have spoken at some length about public spending. I should now like to return to where my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal so eloquently began the debate&#x2014;by discussing the economy as a whole. I am in something of a difficult position here. Traditionally a wind-up speech should address the issues raised during the debate. But after this particular debate, that will prove difficult. Many of the comments made and the suggestions put before us seem to apply to another age, a bygone age. I know that many noble Lords present would wish that they could turn the clock back 10 years to 1980, or better still right back to 1974, when we still had five years of economic mismanagement to look forward to. But they cannot. It is 1990 and the situation, as the Lord Privy Seal made clear, could not be more different from what it was then.<lb/>
Those who wish to draw a comparison must be clinging to a straw. By highlighting the fact that 1980 was the last year that saw the economy's output actually fall for more than one quarter in succession, they beg the question as to what happened in the period between. I shall tell the House. In the 37 quarters since and the nine and a quarter years between the first quarter of 1981 and the second quarter of 1990, GDP has fallen only four times and each time for only a single quarter and by an average of 0.1 of a per cent. Much more importantly, for the other 33 quarters it has risen and done so strongly.<lb/>
I think the House will agree that this is an impressive record of strength and stability especially when set against the previous decade when GDP was
<col>428</col>
up one minute and down the next. It is also a record which puts the current slowdown in its proper perspective. Noble Lords are no doubt tiring of statistics and I sympathise. But they do need reiterating; otherwise those who work on the principle that if you say something enough times you will make it true will win the day. Fiction&#x2014;and we have heard a good deal of it today&#x2014;will supplant fact and we really will be back where we started all those years ago.<lb/>
What are the facts? In 1990 the economy's output will be more than 25 per cent. larger in real terms than it was in 1979. In other words, after allowing for inflation, the economy is a quarter larger now than it was then. That is solid achievement. This growth has helped to bring about prosperity. Real personal disposable income has increased by more than a third since 1979. That is a fact.<lb/>
The statistics leave no doubt as to the very real improvements in economic performance achieved by this Government. For my own part, I have never been completely comfortable surrounded by statistics. I hope that a simple analogy will work better. I hope that noble Lords will bear with me for a moment if I ask them to imagine the economy as a motive force, designed to move forward something like a train. After a necessary and for some an undoubtedly painful overhaul that was long overdue, the past nine years have seen impressive forward progress by the economy. As I have said, at times the speed has varied and there have been four brief halts at stations before the train has picked up momentum again. Now we are faced with another such halt. Some of the slowing down was entirely necessary. The demands on the engine in 1987 and 1988 were too great and it was in danger of overheating and wrecking the engine permanently. But this behaviour does not indicate any structural problem. The train has not been derailed as it was in the 1970s. This confidence stems from two features. First, because the private sector has been reinstalled in its rightful position at the front of the train, as I pointed out to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, recently, the whole of the economy will move and the whole of the community will benefit.<lb/>
Secondly, the Government have thankfully given up their attempts at old-style demand management which, interestingly enough, I note will be restored. Indeed, I was fascinated by the interesting remark made by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that industry will have to learn how to co-operate: "We the Labour Government have ways of making you co-operate; we know how to have a demand economy; and we know how to run industry better". It is very attractive. I have been at the DTI for only about three months and some days I already sense that I could be out there running an industry. The temptation is too great to resist. However, if there were a Labour administration the price we would pay would be borne by those least capable of bearing it.<lb/>
My noble friend the Lord Privy Seal gave many examples of the improvements that have been made. I should now like to draw the attention of noble Lords to one particularly crucial area; namely, investment. It
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0254"/>
<col>429</col>
is perhaps less tangible than the increase, consumption that is evident all around us, but it is of equal if not greater importance for our future prospects.<lb/>
The UK's record on investment over the 1980s as a whole is a microcosm of what the Government's approach has set out to achieve. In 1984 there was a major reform to the structure of corporation tax. The rate of tax was cut from 52 per cent. to 35 per cent., giving the UK one of the lowest rates in the industrial world&#x2014;an incentive to invest in itself. At the same time, we scrapped the distortionary tax breaks which led to investment being undertaken as a way of reducing tax bills, rather than because it was expected to earn an economic return. We were told at the time that cutting back on investment tax breaks would lead to a collapse in investment and that no one would invest without the carrot of a 100 per cent. depreciation allowance in the first year. But what actually happened? After 1984 investment grew and grew. That applied particularly to business investment, which increased by 45 per cent. in the three years to 1989 alone.<lb/>
It was not only, or mainly, the tax reforms which produced the investment boom. A lower inflation rate than that experienced in the 1970s provided the environment necessary for companies to plan ahead with confidence. There was a marked recovery in the rate of return, which meant that investment became profitable again&#x2014;without tax breaks. Taking the 1980s as a whole, UK growth in business investment outstripped that of every other major industrial country with the exception of Japan.<lb/>
By the end of the decade the United Kingdom was no longer investing at a lower rate than our competitors. Indeed, the proportion of GDP accounted for by non-residential investment in the UK in 1989 was among the highest of the major industrialised countries. Let me remind noble Lords that this investment record is only one aspect, albeit an important one, of the progress that has been made. Such progress will ensure that in the years ahead the United Kingdom, facilitated by the completion of projects such as the Channel Tunnel, will be competing alongside the best that Europe and the world have to offer. Let me also assure noble Lords that by simplifying the situation I have no intention of trivialising it&#x2014;far from it. The Government are keenly aware that the current economic situation has left some businesses and consumers in difficulties. But the Government have never shirked from difficult circumstances.<lb/>
Let us take the example of manufacturing. We heard much in the debate regarding its plight, as we have heard for much of the past decade. Incidentally, at times I wonder whether some speakers are aware of the other three quarters of economic activity which takes place apart from manufacturing. That is not to deny that manufacturing is still an important element in our economy. We have to face up to the fact that, as in all other major industrial countries, its
<col>430</col>
importance has diminished over the past 30 years. I speak as someone who dirtied his hands bashing metal in the Midlands.<lb/>
Nor do I wish to play down the traumatic experience of manufacturing at the beginning of the 1980s. But the manufacturing sector which emerged after that inevitable shakeout was more productive, more profitable, less strike prone, and much better equipped to hold its own in world markets, and that is borne out by the much improved performance of UK manufacturing since then. In each of the three years to 1989 manufacturing output grew faster than the whole economy, at an average annual rate of over 5&#x00BD; per cent., and 1990 is likely to be regarded as the second year running that sees an increase in our share of world trade in manufactures. Until the 1980s, the story had been one of decades of decline.<lb/>
There are two further items, one of which was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, who rightly pointed out that the solutions to the manufacturing problems are not entirely fiscal. The noble Baroness referred to the level of middle management pay; she may well have a good point there. We must remember something else. Manufacturers depend upon consumers. There has been a huge change. We are no longer making cars that no one wishes to buy. We are making cars that people wish to buy. Design is important. Marketing is important. The concept that by one twist of the economic button we can restore good faith in the nature of British manufacturing is a myth, and a dangerous myth, to sell to the country.<lb/>
Notwithstanding that news, it is clear that our economy is in a difficult phase. The Government have no wish to conceal that and no interest in doing so. Rather the opposite. The more aware people are of the threat posed by inflation the quicker our current difficulties can be overcome.<lb/>
Inflation must be squeezed out of the economy once and for all so that it can never return to plague us. As the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, pointed out, there is no room for complacency or half measures. The assertion that it is policy that has pushed the economy into recession conveniently ignores the threat posed by an inflation rate at its present level. The alternative to our tight policies to defeat inflation is a continuing acceleration of inflation. While inflation is not under control, the economy is existing on borrowed time, continually on the brink of a descent into economic destruction.<lb/>
That is why the defeat of inflation remains the Government's overriding objective, and why we shall not reduce interest rates further until it is safe and prudent to do so. Membership of the ERM reinforces our counter-inflationary policy.<lb/>
I refer now to the concise way in which the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, summed up the position of the ERM and difficulties over the rate of entry. I was grateful, as I am sure were other noble Lords, for his summation, which was neat and easy to understand, which is a great advantage in all European matters. But the one figure that has never
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0255"/>
<col>431</col>
been given from the other side of the House all day is a suggested alternative rate at which to join the ERM. I have waited for suggestions from a party which is talking about power. No suggestions came.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03321"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: I turn now to the subject of economic and monetary union. I shall limit myself to a few observations since we shall be debating that important subject at much greater length next Wednesday. On economic and monetary union, the Government continue to play an active and a positive part in discussions&#x2014;a fact which some commentators seem strangely to have ignored. Perhaps they have been dazzled by the brilliance of the federalists' rhetoric, for they certainly cannot have been looking at the substance. Others may have made grandiose statements. The UK has made concrete proposals.<lb/>
One is tempted to contrast the ease with which some in the Community sign up to the Delors' prescription for a single currency with the difficulty they experienced in agreeing urgent practical proposals on GATT, which, I immediately concede, the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and my noble friends Lord. Boardman and Lord Alexander, pointed out. The noble Lord, Lord Walston, gave some interesting facts and figures which are worth thinking about. He brought to your Lordships' attention the reality of Eastern Europe's potential agricultural output. He reminded your Lordships' House that in 1939 Poland exported 42 million dollars' (1939 dollars) worth of agricultural produce. These are relevant and important issues to which we shall no doubt return.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, asked me to supply him with the information on tobacco. Men are still scurrying in Whitehall, but I fear I have to admit to the noble Lord that I do not yet have the figure and I shall write to him.<lb/>
I turn to some of the points which were raised. Reference was made to businesses going into receivership. It is important to remember that business formation is still riding at high levels. It is worth remembering that business registrations, using VAT as the only way to obtain a reliable figure, were only 300 a week in 1980. Even today in difficult circumstances the 1990 figures still outstrip deregistrations.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred to 1982 as another year of no growth. I am reliably informed that output as measured by GDP increased by 1.8 per cent. in 1982, if that is of use and assistance to the noble Lord. I do not intend to bandy statistics because of the lateness of the hour.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boardman, referred to the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, taking advantage of his better years. I feel that I could do nothing that the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, would find to his benefit in arguing the toss over which year what happened. As a possible exception, I remind your Lordships that a matter not mentioned this afternoon is our old friend&#x2014;or rather old enemy&#x2014;the PSBR. That is a memory, and a fine thing that it should be so.<lb/>
<col>432</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Butterfield, drew your Lordships' attention to his failure in his obstetrics examination and that of his predecessor. The noble Lord congratulated the Government on the increase in funding that they had provided and it was gratifying to hear that at this Dispatch Box.<lb/>
The national debt has been rather derided by the Labour Party, but as long as this Government are in office they have an interest in reducing the national debt. The noble Lord, Lord Moran, expressed concern over the public debate on European currency. He also regretted the trivialisation of the debate and referred to accountability. I am sure that he will return to the subject next week, and I look forward with interest to listening to him.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, made interesting observations on the value of the word "inevitability". The noble Lord, Lord Grimond, drew your Lordships' attention to indexation, which he deplores, and also to Scottish steel. He then went on in a separate reference to mention returns of British companies at 11 per cent. compared with German companies at 20 per cent. I should add to that the outcome of government intervention in the positioning of steel plants. There are three different positions which I believe are impossible to reconcile to produce a world leader.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dormand of Easington, suggested that Ministers on this side of the House had no experience of unemployment. I wrote that down carefully. I assure noble Lords that I have had the experience of having to tell colleagues that they are unemployed. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Dormand, of what he said.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, moved us into a four-argument reason why this Minister would be boxed in. The difficulty is that every box I have ever seen has six sides. I await with interest the remaining two arguments which will ensure that the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, is correct.<lb/>
Great play has been made on this side of the House of wealth creation, but very little reference has been made to it on the other side of the House. When we talk about wealth creation, let us consider what the Labour Party means by it. If I were asked to tell an English or foreign businessman what I knew about prospective Labour Party policy it would be that they announced one quite interesting proposal: a 10p. increase in the top rate of tax and the uncapping of NIC. I should have to advise someone that if they wished to come into the United Kingdom and start a business they could look to pay 70 per cent. tax as the cost of employing a manager in the UK. That is Labour's big idea to get us back on the road to success. However, I do not think it works.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams, in erecting his temple of doom, placed beautifully in its place, like a master mason, the theory which suggests that nothing has happened in 12 years and that the level of inflation is roughly the same today as it was in 1979. However, there is a vital difference. In 1979 inflation was going west to 21 per cent. whereas today it is going south to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0256"/>
<col>433</col>
5.5 per cent. According to the great argument of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, whom I greatly admire, inflation was brought about through low interest rates in late 1987 and early 1988. I hope I may take advantage of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, in the subtlest of ways in pointing out that he was in a way insinuating that there had been a bonfire of financial vanities. However, it is worth recalling who else was standing behind and beside this figurative bonfire of explosive growth and over demand. It was said at the time that interest rates must be cut significantly. It was further said, "This is a time for judgment and that judgment decrees that there should be a big cut in interest rates". Thus spoke the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Neil Kinnock. However, noble Lords may feel that he sometimes fluffs figures on television.<lb/>
However, according to Mr. John Smith, a much admired man, then was the time to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. The fact of the matter is that there is only one answer and that is to curb inflation. This amendment has one problem: it is 11 years too late. It should have been moved by the Conservative opposition in 1978 to 1979.</membercontribution></p>

I am so glad that they have been attracted to your Lordships' House tonight by the quality of the speeches in the debate.

The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am not a great believer in second speeches, particularly at this time of night. Therefore I am inclined to move formally my amendment. However, in view of the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Hesketh, did not reply to it at all, I must comment. At first, I thought that maybe it was a little discourteous; then I decided that it was a really wise move. The noble Lord is an ardent and buoyant government spokesman. Who knows what European policy he will have to speak to in two weeks' time? I congratulate him on his wisdom. I beg to move.<lb/>

<title>AIDS Unit: Hammersmith Hospital</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03336">3.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03337"><member>Lord Ennals</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03338">Whether the new hematology ward for AIDS patients at the Hammersmith Hospital, funded by the National Health Service and charitable money, is now to be used for private patients.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03339"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Baroness Hooper)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this unit is not being used for private care. Although I understand that the Hammersmith Special Health Authority had planned to treat private patients in the unit, none has been admitted. As from next week the unit is to be used for its originally intended purpose &#x2014;to treat National Health Service patients who have infectious diseases, including AIDS.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03340"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer. It is very reassuring. Will she accept that there will be much satisfaction that the ward is to be used for AIDS patients, for which it was originally provided both with NHS and private funding? That is good news. Will the Minister also accept my thanks for the fact that the unit is not now to be used for private patients and that it will be used for the NHS? From the statement that the noble Baroness made, I assume that that position is not likely to change within the next two or three weeks and that the Answer she has given has some finality.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03341"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I simply answer yes to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03342"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, leaving aside for the moment the doctrinal question of private patients, important though that may be, perhaps I may focus the Minister's attention on the crucial issue of whether the resources of the unit are adequate to meet the needs of AIDS patients. Can the noble Baroness advise the House whether the hematological resources in the unit are wholly adequate to meet the needs of AIDS patients as we now know them to be, or will there be a shortfall, whether caused by private patients or otherwise?</membercontribution></p>
<col>440</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03343"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as always in these matters, the special health authority is the authority responsible for the spending of the budget. The money being made available for this unit is from the central AIDS budget, which is initially reserved for the use of special health authorities. The agreement as to the amount of funding in this case has been the result of discussions between officials of the Department of Health and the Hammersmith Special Health Authority in response to the formal bid for funds from the special health authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03344"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness accept that, if there is any change in the future and the beds are used as private beds, the hospital will have to make a refund to the charities which contributed money for a different purpose?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03345"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be grateful to the noble Lord if he could advise me which charities contributed to this purpose. My understanding is that the funds for the capital costs of the building of the unit were essentially National Health Service funds. Nevertheless, the principle is that in certain cases pay-beds have been allowed in National Health Service hospitals; that has been true since the inception of the National Health Service. However, careful consideration is always given beforehand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03346"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the unit is to be run in anything like a business manner, I am at a loss to understand why it is not an advantage to increase the turnover and the amount of money coming in from private patients.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03347"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. It is true that it is better to use facilities to earn money which can then be redistributed than to leave facilities lying idle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03348"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as matters are progressing so well this afternoon, is it possible for the Minister to say whether the report in the <i>Observer</i> last Sunday is true, that there was a similar alleged transference of funds for AIDS patients in the Riverside Health Authority?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03349"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I assume that the <i>Observer</i> article to which the noble Lord refers is alleging that the Riverside, which receives funds from the North-West Thames Region expressly for the purpose of providing services for people who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, proposes to use the &#x00A3;1 million underspend for purposes other than HIV/AIDS. The region is discussing the position with the district and seeking ways of correcting the situation. The department is also looking at ways in which the monitoring of earmarked funds can be improved so that no such problem occurs in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Gordon Hospital</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03350">3.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03351"><member>Lord Ennals</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03352">What will be the future of the Gordon day hospital, Westminster, opened five years ago by Lord Ennals, to treat patients with mental illness in South-West London.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0260"/>
<col>441</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03353"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the future of the Gordon hospital and its day hospital is secure. Riverside Health Authority is committed to the hospital and is considering ways in which more specialised services can be brought onto the site to supplement the core mental health services already provided there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03354"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I visited the Gordon hospital two or three days ago and as from last Friday it has been forced to close 18 beds. Is the Minister aware that the hospital was largely opened in its current form to enable the Banstead mental hospital to be closed and therefore to provide beds in the community for those discharged from the psychiatric hospital? Is the noble Baroness also aware that there is considerable concern among doctors and nurses at the hospital about the closure of the 18 beds? Surely the Minister is not saying that it has not closed those beds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03355"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. There has been a temporary closure of 18 beds at the Gordon hospital. That is part of a range of measures that the health authority is putting into effect to ensure that levels of expenditure are contained within revenue allocation. The industrial therapy unit, which was moved to the Gordon hospital on a temporary basis following the closure of Banstead hospital, to which the noble Lord referred, can best fulfil its function in a community setting. The district is exploring the possibility of relocating into the community, and a working group has been established to consider that position. In all those matters I understand that members of staff in the unit have been consulted and have agreed to the general strategy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03356"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister accept that there is great concern about the closure of beds? She said that they are temporary closures, but how temporary is temporary? When I was at the hospital I was told that they may be closed until April. That is a long time and may lead to a great build-up of single homeless people without a place to go to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03357"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that since the proposal to make some closures was agreed it has been possible to limit closures to a net reduction of only nine beds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03358"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: Good news, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03359"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the noble Lord, Lord Ennals, is by no means the only Minister of Health to have opened beds which subsequently were closed? Does she recollect that every Minister of Health since the NHS was formed has opened beds which later were closed? Is she further aware that I attended the opening by a Conservative Minister of Health of some new beds in Oldham and that I then waited after the official opening to see the beds locked up by the caretaker because there were no nurses to staff them? Is it not a fact that there has been a shortage of resources ever since the NHS began, irrespective of the party in power?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03360"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only say that there has been considerable activity within the NHS
<col>442</col>
and an enormous increase in the number of people treated. It is misleading to look at London in isolation because the fall in bed numbers has been faster in London than elsewhere. That reflects the policy of successive governments to move resources out of London to surrounding areas, thus enabling people to be treated nearer their homes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03361"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I opened the hospital only five years ago, in the days of a Conservative Government.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Education: A-Levels</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03362">3.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03363"><member>Baroness David</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03364">What is their plan for the future of A-levels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03365"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are fully committed to maintaining A-levels' standard of excellence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03366"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot say that I am satisfied with the Minister's reply. Surely the need for reform has been brought forward not only since Higginson in 1986&#x2014;a report which the Government turned down&#x2014;but by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, by the School Examinations and Assessment Council, the National Curriculum Council and Her Majesty's Inspectorate. Therefore, does the noble Baroness agree with Professor Pring of Oxford University that before reform of examinations at 16 it would have been more sensible to reform the whole provision of education at 16, as the staying on rate is so very poor in this country? It would have been wiser to do that before the reform of A-levels. Is the whole provision being considered?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03367"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it must first be said that there has been considerable reform. Indeed, when the national curriculum changes work through the system the hope is&#x2014;there is some evidence already&#x2014;that the staying on rate will improve. We are committed to maintaining A-levels. That is not to say that we do not have concern about breadth and about introducing some changes. Indeed, the noble Baroness knows that SEAC is at present looking at that area of examinations. I can say with absolute assurance that we are not prepared to compromise standards at that level.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03368"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend assist the House? It seems to me, as a father of one university child and one who has just left university, that we in this country specialise far too early. Is my noble friend aware that at American and French universities the level of specialisation is much lower? Specialisation forces children into choices at too early an age.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03369"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that with these reforms the Government have addressed that problem. All children will now study a range of subjects up to the age of 16 whereas hitherto many young children dropped sciences, languages and other subjects which are extremely important. That is one
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0261"/>
<col>443</col>
important change. Secondly, the Government have also addressed breadth at 16-plus with the introduction of AS-levels, which have half the content of A-levels but allow those taking A-levels to study other subjects to the same standard but with half the content.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03370"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister accept that although AS-levels may have been well-intentioned, very few schools can afford to run A-level and AS-level courses in the same subject? They have different curricula, and as a result very few schools can offer more than two or three AS-levels. Consequently, they may offer 15 or 17 A-levels and the hope for breadth therefore is not being carried by AS- levels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03371"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware that head teachers themselves are arguing for breadth. They would not be arguing for breadth if they could not deliver it. I am not sure about the schools with which the noble Baroness is familiar but I know that AS-levels are offered and many schools, where they believe it to be appropriate, are encouraging young people to take them up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03372"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government make it easier for schools to offer vocational courses such as BTEC alongside A-levels? That is apparently rather difficult under the terms of the Education Act 1988.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03373"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is an important point. Certainly vocational courses and the extension of BTEC courses are actively being considered. For example, we know that Kingshurst CTC is applying vocational courses at 16-plus level with some success. We hope that SEAC will take that into account when it reports.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03374"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I welcome my noble friend's reply, can she take this occasion to inform my noble friend Lord Onslow and others that it is very unlikely that any government in the foreseeable future will have the financial resources to enable universities to extend three-year courses into four years and four-year courses into five years? That would be the inevitable result of a lowering of A-level standards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03375"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend makes a very important point. The inevitable consequence of any dilution of standards would be an extension of courses at university level. I believe that A-levels have served our brightest children very well. We should now be aiming to have more children in that percentage bracket actually taking and passing A-levels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03376"><member>Baroness Platt of Writtle</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that there are other alternatives, such as the international baccalaureate which is already offered, and also BTEC and City and Guilds courses which are available in colleges of further education? They are often better options for many children in our schools than staying on at school.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03377"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has also made a very important point. I believe that we should not he so hung up on where the children are
<col>444</col>
educated at 16-plus but that they should be educated in the most appropriate place. Very recently my right honourable friend the Secretary of State said in a press release that he will take into account the increasing recognition that. A-levels are not the only option and will give consideration to, for example, the international baccalaureate and BTEC courses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03378"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is there not now overwhelming evidence that A-levels cause over-specialisation, and not only at certain ages as referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow'? That, in turn, causes under-education in other important fields, not least in science and technology.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03379"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not agree. I know that there is some evidence and that there is a strong body of opinion which believes that A-levels have served us well and should be retained but that we should be giving some consideration to breadth at A-level. I have given an assurance that that will be taken into account. There is also a minority opinion that for many years has been doing its level best to have A-levels taken out of the system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03380"><member>Baroness Cox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that there is widespread concern over possible falling standards at GCSE level, particularly with the 100 per cent. course work? Therefore, will my noble friend reiterate her welcome and unequivocal assurance that A-level standards will not be compromised in any way?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03381"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no difficulty in giving that assurance. A-level standards will not he compromised. When SEAC comes forward with its proposals it will have to prove and demonstrate that standards will not be compromised. Any changes that are proposed must be changes that do not compromise standards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03382"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a former chief examiner at A-level I believe that the noble Baroness exaggerates the quality of the standards, but we can leave that on one side. Will the noble Baroness take more seriously the remarks made by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow? Is she not aware that pouring into our universities every year are, for example, students of science, engineering and (I regret to say this) economics, who know nothing about the history of their country, or who certainly do not retain such knowledge? They have no interest in literature, which is a subject they drop once they have done it at O-level.<lb/>
Is the noble Baroness not aware of the disaster that is hitting our system, led, may I add, by our university teachers who go for narrowness of knowledge in education? Is she not aware that this constant reiteration of standards is damaging to the education of most of our children?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03383"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot agree with that statement. The rationale for the reforms that have been put on the statute book by the Government was that young people were coming out of the top end of school without an understanding of geography, history, a language and so forth. The national curriculum changes and those reforms, as they work through the system, will result in young people leaving
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0262"/>
<col>445</col>
school with a broader education. If one applies AS as well as A-levels and some consideration is given to BTEC and vocational courses, I believe that we shall serve our young people very well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03384"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend add to her consideration of the point made by my noble friend Lord Beloff this further consideration? In the sciences, which arc cumulative and growing subjects, the volume of knowledge to be acquired by those seeking degrees is constantly increasing. Scientists who return to university 25 years after having left, find not only that they could not answer, but also that they could not have asked a number of the questions on the final examination papers. Therefore, does the noble Baroness agree that there is an impending problem of national proportions on the length of courses for science degrees anyway?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03385"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend's remarks strengthen the reasons why we should keep some subjects to be studied in considerable depth as a preparation for university courses.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Political Parties: Funding</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03386">3.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03387"><member>Lord Holme of Cheltenham</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03388">What plans they have to require political parties to declare all their sources of funding and to publish full accounts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03389"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, none.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03390"><member>Lord Holme of Cheltenham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his admirably brief Answer. Is he aware that there is an election coming up soon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03391"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Which one?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03392"><member>Lord Holme of Cheltenham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not refer to the election which exclusively preoccupies the attention of the party opposite. I refer to the election which involves everyone in the country. Is the Minister aware that at that election there will be a serious double standard? This House and Parliament generally requires companies, trade unions, businesses and charities to publish their accounts and for them to be open and accountable. Does he not agree that there is a double standard in that political parties alone are exempt from this requirement and, when the election comes, voters will be deprived of information that is relevant to their decision?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03393"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no, I do not think so. Company law requires that political contributions in excess of &#x00A3;200 in any financial year must be mentioned in a company's annual report, together with a note of the recipients. The law does not define political parties and as such they are not recognised by electoral law &#x2014;only the candidates are recognised. If parties are in receipt of gifts which are freely given, I do not see that there is any reason to say where the gifts have come from.</membercontribution></p>
<col>446</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03394"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that there is another example of double standards? The Government have rightly required unions to hold ballots before making political levies, but they oppose any requirement of shareholders to hold ballots before making political donations. Does the Minister agree that that is a rather discreditable example of partisanship?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03395"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think so at all. People can buy shares in whatever companies they choose and they can remove their shareholdings. If one is a member of a trade union one can remain a member of it and pay the funds irrespective of where they go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03396"><member>The Viscount of Oxfuird</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question on the Order Paper says that there should be a declaration of
<quote>"all their sources of funding and to publish full accounts".</quote>
Does not that mean that a proper audit has to take place which will automatically involve an audit of membership? Can the noble Earl comment on the membership of the Liberal Democrat Party?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03397"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a very interesting question indeed. I do not think that I shall venture into that quarter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03398"><member>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Earl tell the House whether any foreign-based companies are currently making donations to any British political party? If so, can he advise the House how many companies there are and what are the funds involved?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03399"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answers are no, no and no to all three questions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03400"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the reason why the noble Earl is so reluctant to answer any of these straightforward questions straightforwardly that the Conservative Party is profoundly ashamed of the sources of its funds and of the influence that its funders bring to bear on its policies?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03401"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not understand the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, and not for the first time. He said that I have not answered the questions straightforwardly. I answered the last three questions with a "no, no and no". I do not think that anyone can be more straightforward than that. However, coming to the substance of the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, the answer to that is no, too.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03402"><member>Lord Wade of Chorlton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that, as far as the Conservative Party is concerned, there has been a no more honourable organisation as regards the raising of funds? Surely, any company that makes a donation to a political party makes quite clear in its accounts that it does so and such information is public. Does not my noble friend agree that when a private individual gives his own money to anyone, that should be his own private business?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03403"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in deference to the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, the answer is yes.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0263"/>
<col>447</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03404"><member>Lord Monkswell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after 11 years of a Conservative Government, is not the noble Earl aware that there has been a change in the way that money is available for disbursement? Is he further aware that until fairly recently the sources of funds for political parties were, in the main, the trade unions and companies? However, since the successes&#x2014;if one likes to describe them in that way&#x2014;of the Conservative Government, individual wealth has increased. That wealth has become a major potential source of funding for political parties. Does not the Minister agree that that is a reason for the Government to review the regulations that pertain to the funding of political parties?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03405"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, for having acknowledged that over the past 11 years individual wealth has increased. That is a very good reason why companies should give donations to the Conservative Party.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03406"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, many people in this country are concerned about financial contributions by trade unions to the Labour Party and by the City to the Conservative Party. I am not too sure who contributes to the Liberal Democrat Party. In so far as this concern has been reflected in the House today &#x2014; and the noble Earl has taken full cognizance of it&#x2014; will he consider with the Leader of the House the possibility of one day having a full debate on this particularly important subject so that the matter can be cleared up for the benefit not only of Members of this House but for the people of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03407"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if noble Lords wish to have a debate on this subject it is for your Lordships to arrange it through the usual channels. The position is absolutely crystal clear. Those companies which give over &#x00A3;200 to a political party are obliged to say so. Any individual who wishes to give of his own money can do so quite freely. There is no reason why these donations should be declared by a political party of any kind for the very good reason that political parties are not described or prescribed in law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03408"><member>Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend educate the parties opposite by telling them that the biggest donation to the Conservative Party is time which is given by people in the party organisations who work to raise a very large proportion of the money that is given to the party?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03409"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. Money is one thing, but actual work and dedication is another. Both of those factors are very important. The party of which I am a member is very good at both.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03410"><member>Lord Whaddon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the noble Earl agree that it is simple justice that individual shareholders should be given similar rights to those enjoyed by individual trade unionists; namely, the right of opting out individually without shareholders being obliged to contribute to the Conservative Party as a condition of holding shares?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03411"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if an individual does not like the way in which his company is dealing with
<col>448</col>
matters, he can raise it at the annual general meeting or he can sell his shareholding. I know of one company which subscribed at a general election to all three parties, presumably because the company did not wish to upset anyone and in order to keep the hounds off them. I thought that was rather wet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03412"><member>Lord Brookes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that for many years it has been much easier to opt out of a company by selling one's shares than to opt out of a union in order to keep one's job?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03413"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is entirely correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03414"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: He is not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03415"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend asked me a question. If the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, wishes to answer it he had better come to this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03416"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am perfectly willing to swap and to go to the other side of the House and ask my question right now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03417"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that we generally take pride in the way our elections are conducted through the Representation of the People Act? Does he further agree that this failure of openness in political affairs does great harm to the provisions of the Representation of the People Act? I am a member of a party which for nearly 60 years has always published its accounts. Surely that is an example for other parties. The public would like to know and to have full details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03418"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that may be an example, but there is no reason to change the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03419"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that I had the honour to represent a constituency? We had a membership of more than 10,000. They subscribed in order to engage an agent and keep the office going and they also made a contribution to headquarters. That is quite common form in most constituencies in the country. We published our accounts every year. Is my noble friend further aware that I have yet to see the publication of the accounts of Labour Party constituency organisations? They might show the contribution local union officials make in the running of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03420"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is entirely correct. Once one goes down that path the matter becomes extremely complicated. It could be impractical to require political parties to declare all their sources of funding, which include large numbers of small individual donations. As my noble friend said, one also becomes involved with paid employees as well.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Future of Rural Society: ECC Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03430">3.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03431"><member>Lord Middleton</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the report of the European Communities Committee on <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> (24th Report, 1989&#x2013;90, HL Paper 80).</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03432">The noble Lord said: My Lords, it was a happy coincidence that your Lordships' European Communities Committee should have produced its report on <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> at virtually the same time as that of the Archbishops' Commission. We were working quite independently but looking at very much the same problems and coming to very much the same conclusions, the difference between us being that the inquiry of my Sub-Committee D was done in a European context, in contrast to the English context of that of the most reverend Primates. It is also a happy coincidence that I should have the honour of presenting our report on the day when the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York presents the other one, living as I do, if not quite within the shadow of York Minster, at least within half an hour's drive of Bishopthorpe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03433">The European Commission published in 1988 a communication addressed to the Council and to the Parliament entitled <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> which attempts to identify policies for sustaining the economies of the rural areas in the Community and to face up to the problems arising from diminishing support for farmers. The issues addressed in that communication have far-reaching implications for the Community and particularly for the agricultural sector.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03434">The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. MacSharry, has closely identified himself with initiatives to implement a programme based on that communication. Indeed, Sub-Committee D of the Select Committee has already found the thinking expressed in it to be increasingly evident in Commission proposals. We therefore decided that an inquiry into the subject would be opportune.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03435">In our report, also entitled <i>The Future of Rural Society,</i> we concentrated on the United Kingdom experience, though we have attempted to relate this experience to that of other member states. We paid special attention to the implications of change in the countryside for the agricultural sector and for agricultural policy-making. Our report is a long one, and we received a mass of evidence, printed in the accompanying volumes. We are grateful to all those who contributed to the report; to our specialist adviser, Dr. Berkeley Hill of Wye College, who guided us through the complex issues involved, and particularly to our clerk for his industry and skill.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0266"/>
<col>453</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03436">What then are the problems? In its paper the Commission identifies three standard problem areas. We agreed that this was a sensible attempt at classification on a European basis. In the United Kingdom there are problem areas that fall into all three of those categories which are described in paragraph 15 of the report. We found little evidence that, except in the more remote parts, the rural areas were suffering from depopulation or from disproportionate levels of unemployment compared with the national average. There is, however, especially in the United Kingdom, a pronounced change in the social composition of those dwelling in the countryside, as new businesses and urban dwellers relocate to rural areas. There is too a problem peculiar to the United Kingdom arising from the growing shortage of affordable housing for the indigenous rural population. The second of these problems is consequential upon the first.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03437">The Commission believes, and the committee agrees, that because of its major significance in the rural economy the restructuring of European agriculture consequent on its greater exposure to market forces will increase the risk of unemployment, depopulation and social disruption in the rural areas. I do not have to remind the House that a restrictive price policy in force since the late 1980s is putting increased downward pressure on farm incomes. Any conclusion of the current round of GATT negotiations is likely to continue that pressure. Structural adjustments are being made, the agricultural workforce is declining in numbers across the Community and farm organisation is changing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03438">In the United Kingdom statistics show an increase in the number of large-sized farm holdings and in the very small holdings. However, there is a decrease in the number of intermediate-sized holdings. A major trend seems to be an increase in the number of part-time holdings and a movement towards what in Eurospeak is known as "pluriactivity" in all EC member states as well as in the United Kingdom. The committee saw that trend as being favourable to sustaining the fabric of rural society. Nevertheless, it is clear that the capacity of the Community to produce food is outstripping its ability to consume it. We simply do not need as much land to be as intensively farmed as is the case today. The Commission estimates that in the Community anywhere from 6 million to 16 million hectares will become surplus to requirements by the year 2000. That compares with the total land area of the UK which is 24 million hectares, of which only about 40 per cent. can be cultivated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03439">The committee was told in evidence that there could e as much as 4 million surplus hectares in the UK. That would be a very high proportion of our 10 million hectares of cropping land. Estimates of surplus land depend upon the rest of the land being farmed as intensively as it is now. The alternative approach is to encourage more extensive farming methods&#x2014;something some people appear to want, although they may be less enthusiastic to pay for it. The question of how
<col>454</col>
the notional surplus of land is to be managed raises environmental problems to which I should like to return later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03440">As to what should be the objectives of rural policy, members of the committee were of the opinion that the potential objectives fell under five main headings: first and foremost, maintaining the potential of the countryside to produce food, timber and water; secondly, promoting economic performance and providing job opportunities so as to enable people to remain in their communities; thirdly, pursuing social objectives, maintaining social balance and ensuring access to basic services such as housing and schools; fourthly, protecting the environment; and, fifthly, maintaining cultural and recreational benefits.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03441">I turn now to rural development policies. Members of the committee had three main reservations about the Commission's initiative. First, we considered that policies towards the countryside needed to guide rather than to inhibit change. Secondly, we were of the opinion that rural policies must recognise the diversity of rural areas. The notion of some kind of model rural society is illusory. Finally, we felt that the Commission tends to overemphasise the relative importance of agriculture to rural economies and societies and hence the availability of purely agricultural means to deliver new economic prosperity. We felt that agricultural support should be merely one of a range of measures which can be addressed to rural problems. However, it is clear that agricultural policies will continue to play an integral role in sustaining the economies of many rural areas, in supporting rural communities and in determining the appearance of the countryside.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03442">There has always been some debate as to the extent to which the common agricultural policy is fundamentally a social policy. In some member states the social objectives of the CAP assume greater importance than they do in the United Kingdom because of the political weight attached to the maintenance of people in farming. In the UK farms are seen primarily as economic rather than social units. Hence the British tendency to regard the CAP as primarily an economic policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03443">By contrast, the committee recognised that, as the CAP is reformed, it will be necessary to target assistance to those farmers most affected. In that context a form of income aid which has been applied with great success in the United Kingdom is the system of payment to farmers in the less favoured areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03444">In addition to special payments to farmers in LFAs, the Commission has proposed three other types of support mechanism. First, the modulation of price support. The committee regarded a policy of modulation of price support in favour of economically weak family farms as doubtful in principle and flawed in practice. Further, it did not regard the concept of "the family farm" as one which is useful for policy purposes as it can mean more or less anything one wants it to mean.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03445">Secondly, the committee recognised that the current Community scheme for direct income aids
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0267"/>
<col>455</col>
may be impractical because in most member states there are administrative difficulties in assessing the level of farmers' incomes. Thirdly, in regard to diversification, while the present support scheme is welcomed, the committee believed that the focus should be switched away from on-farm diversification to the promotion of other forms of employment which will enable farmers, farm workers and their families to live in the rural areas. In general the committee was concerned that the entirely legitimate social aims of minimising hardship do not become reasons for inhibiting the development of more efficient agricultural structures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03446">I should like to reinforce what I said in that last sentence in the light of a recent statement made by Mr. MacSharry, which I heard two weeks ago in Brussels. I was invited to speak at a hearing convened by the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament, the purpose of which was to discuss the use of rural areas. The committee's report was considered to be of some relevance. The commissioner made an opening statement in which he said:
<quote>"We have begun the process of adapting the agricultural market mechanisms to ensure that they are more specifically targeted on farmers who find themselves in a structurally difficult position".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03447">As I have already said, such modulation of price support did not find favour with the committee. Members of the committee were in agreement with MAFF which said in evidence that in principle the market support mechanisms of the CAP should be neutral as between regions as well as between farmers. MAFF has long felt&#x2014;and we agreed&#x2014;that the issue of small farmers, or of farmers in less favoured areas, is primarily a social one which should not be addressed by distorting the price mechanisms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03448">Whatever social measures may be devised&#x2014;in my view, payments to farmers in less favoured areas come under this heading&#x2014;headage payments in LFAs are not primarily to do with lamb production; they are intended to keep farmers in the hills. Whatever social payments are devised, the way to preserve rural communities is to open them gently to market forces and not to insulate them from such forces.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03449">I turn now to deal with regional economic policies. As the committee says in paragraph 205:
<quote>"Agricultural policies alone will not be sufficient if many rural areas are to be helped to adjust to agricultural reform".</quote>
The committee continues in paragraph 206 to say that,
<quote>"the prime requirement is to broaden the range of economic activities".</quote>
If there had to be but one message I could give your Lordships from this report, that would be it. The main instruments at Community level to achieve this aim are the reformed structural funds. If rural development initiatives are to be effective, it is essential that the three funds are used in a co-ordinated way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03450">The selection of areas and the method of allocation of funds under the Commission's Objectives (1) and (5b) mean that some peripheral and sparsely populated areas such as the Western Isles and the Western Highlands have lost out under the reform of the funds.</p>
<col>456</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03451">In the United Kingdom the three most important agencies in the public sector which promote such economic diversification are: in England, the Rural Development Commission, and I am delighted to see that the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, who is the chairman of that organisation, will be speaking later; in Scotland, it is the Highlands and Islands Development Board; and there is a similar organisation in mid-Wales called the DBRW. Each of those agencies appears to have played a significant part in promoting employment in rural problem areas. The committee considers that they will remain the proper vehicles through which to channel public support for rural economies and social development.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03452">We noted the absence of similar agencies in many other member states and consider that those United Kingdom agencies may serve as a useful model to be adopted elsewhere in the Community. Less that should seem too chauvinistic an opinion, I should say that it was suggested to us by the Commission when it gave evidence to the committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03453">At a local level, the committee saw the need to bring together public, private and voluntary bodies to deliver integrated rural development initiatives. I note that the Commission itself is now taking steps to promote such an approach under what is called its LEADER initiative.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03454">One further issue of importance emerged in our inquiry to which I referred earlier: the question of low-cost rural housing and housing for rent. Many witnesses suggested that the shortage of affordable housing was the largest problem affecting rural areas in the United Kingdom. If the economies of such areas are to diversify it is clearly important that local accommodation at reasonable prices be available for workers. We therefore recommend that the Government take steps to increase the provision of low-cost rural housing and to retain such housing for the benefit of the local community. The announcement made last Monday night by my noble friend Lady Blatch on increased funding for low-cost rural housing in rural areas is welcome. I look forward to hearing anything more that she may have to say on that subject later this afternoon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03455">I turn lastly to environmental policies. The terrestrial environment is rightly perceived by the public as a common heritage to be enjoyed by all. However, the land is also the property of individual members of society who, equally rightly, wish to maximise their returns from it. Those two public requirements&#x2014;to protect the rural environment and to benefit from its produce&#x2014;have not been resolved satisfactorily. Farmers, as main land users, have been asked to play two roles: as food producers and as environmental managers. It goes without saying that farming practices which are harmful to or which pollute the environment can and should be controlled. Good environmental management in the sense of conservation of natural beauty and of fauna and flora is a much more subjective matter where regulation may not be appropriate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03456">If farming in a certain way produces environmental goods which the public wants, farmers must be paid
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0268"/>
<col>457</col>
for producing them. That principle has already been established in the environmentally sensitive areas schemes. The committee therefore supports an extension of the ESA principle more widely throughout the Community. I also note that the Commission has recently proposed such an extension. In that context, we have also drawn attention to the need to relate payments to farmers in less favoured areas more closely to environmental objectives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03457">Perhaps I may conclude by quoting a speech delivered by Commissioner MacSharry earlier this year at the University of Ulster, because I believe that it provides a summary of the committee's main theme. He said:
<quote>"The Commission's general approach is to ensure a balance between the agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors of economic activity in rural areas. In most cases their economies up to now have been based mainly on agriculture and will continue to remain largely dependent on it. We need a policy which both supports the primary sector and integrates it into a wider economic context by providing alternative sources of employment for those wishing to leave the land".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03458">The challenge on the Commission now is to live up to those words. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03459">Moved, That this House takes note of the report of the European Communities Committee on <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> (24th Report, 1989&#x2013;90, HL Paper 80). &#x2014;(<i>Lord Middleton.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03460">3.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03461"><member>The Archbishop of York</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been told that I should say that I shall not move the item standing in my name on the Order Paper, but I am nevertheless grateful to have the opportunity to draw to the attention of your Lordships' House the report of the Archbishops' Commission on Rural Areas entitled <i>Faith in the Countryside.</i> I speak as one of those who commissioned the report and to whom it was addressed. Later in the debate your Lordships' House will have an opportunity to hear the noble Lord, Lord Prior, who chaired the commission for us and who can speak on it with far greater authority than I can. I hope that he can take your Lordships into some of the detail. It is he who should be making this speech, but this is an opportunity for me to thank him for what he did on our behalf.<lb/>
I am glad that the report is being considered alongside that of the European Communities Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, has said, our report is primarily about the situation in England, but as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reminded us in the General Synod yesterday, the state of the countryside in England, especially in its agricultural aspects, is now about 80 per cent. dependent upon what is happening in the European Community. The two reports therefore belong together, and I hope they will reinforce one another.<lb/>
An organisation known as Rural Voice has already produced a list of agreements between the two reports, and what it says reinforces the message that there are severe and identifiable problems in our countryside which need urgent attention. What the noble Lord,
<col>458</col>
Lord Middleton, has just said about the vital importance of the diversification of employment in the countryside is one of the main conjunctions between the two reports. I hope that it will be taken seriously.<lb/>
<i>Faith in the Countryside</i> is a long report&#x2014;some 400 pages. The evidence is not included&#x2014;it is all report. It is one which needs to be read. In case any of your Lordships quail at the thought of reading 400 pages, perhaps I may say that it is a good read. It is entertaining to read as well as instructive. Your Lordships will be pleased to hear that two-thirds of its 148 recommendations are addressed to the Church and that the remaining 48 are not an exercise in government baiting because, as your Lordships will know, the Church of England never goes in for government baiting; it merely tries to state facts objectively and elicit a response. I say that despite the initial response in one of our popular newspapers which had the headline, "Runcie's Last Stand" when the report came out.<lb/>
The recommendations arise out of a serious and many-sided analysis of what is happening in the countryside and, in particular, an analysis of what a large number of people feel about it. It is that analysis and feeling which come through the report rather than the recommendations which constitute its main value.<lb/>
It was an enormously active commission. It did not just sit and receive evidence; it travelled widely. Members of the commission visited 41 out of the 43 English dioceses. They received evidence from some 500 individuals and organisations, and in their travels they talked to some 6,000 people. They have managed to provide a quarry of information, of ideas and encouraging stories of good practice on the social, economic and spiritual condition of the countryside. The report needs to be read as a whole because the totality of the picture is important rather than this or that proposal.<lb/>
It is a sad fact about the way in which our society is organised that very few bodies except the Church are in a position to look at the totality of what is going on in an area of activity. Government concern is inevitably fragmented between different departments, but in the countryside we are concerned with housing, transport, education, health, social services, agriculture, industry, tourism, environmental issues and such imponderables as the health and vitality of community life. These all interact with one another in what the report calls the arena of the countryside. The main message of the report is that unless these are brought together more effectively in terms of policy and planning we shall see a progressive degradation of the countryside; indeed, a loss of those very qualities for which both country and townspeople value it.<lb/>
This is a Church report, rooted in a clearly stated theology which stresses reverence for the created world, our need to cherish and care for it, our individual responsibility but also our need to do these things together as persons in community. Again, in our fragmented society so rooted in individualism these days the quality of community life in the countryside can be one of our most precious possessions and one of the things which drive many
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0269"/>
<col>459</col>
people to live in the country when they are fed up with the rat race in the cities. Alas, very often they destroy the very thing they have come to enjoy.<lb/>
The report tries to set out boldly some of the aims for human living, why we should care about these things and what we are doing about them. Unless we have such aims for human living and rise above the level of individual self-satisfaction or self-interest, we are not likely to be able to handle the complex choices which now confront us without further destroying what we have inherited.<lb/>
Many Members of your Lordships' House value their connections with village churches. Whenever a bishop comes into this House he is buttonholed by one or other of your Lordships with a horror story about what is going on in his village. I hope that your Lordships will find the report reassuring in the strong affirmation which it gives to the life of local parishes centred on lively churches and the determination which is expressed to maintain and develop this life, to strengthen community and to ensure that the spiritual heart of the countryside is not allowed to decay.<lb/>
However, there are problems. If I concentrate now on the secular aspects, it is because they lie more within the responsibility of this House. The commission found deep anxiety about the future in many of the areas which it visited, a deep sense that all is not well in the country communities and evidence in some quarters of real deprivation. There is the village family, for example, without its own transport, having to rely on minimal and diminishing public transport, without easy access to health services, without the cost savings that can come through shopping in supermarkets, without leisure facilities such as one might expect to find in the towns, with low wages and no prospect of buying its own house. Such a family is caught as effectively in a poverty trap as those who live in the most deprived areas of our cities.<lb/>
The single most common ground for complaint is &#x2014;as in the European report&#x2014;the shortage of low-cost housing, particularly housing for rent. Many of these people will never be able to buy their own houses on the levels of wages common in the countryside. This inability to find proper housing is not just an inconvenience for individuals who might be encouraged to move elsewhere; it is a major factor in driving people away from the countryside, driving away those very people who in the past have maintained it as a community worth living in. Therefore, unless this housing problem is tackled we shall destroy one of our greatest assets, which is the community life of the countryside.<lb/>
The report then draws attention to the obvious conflicts of interest between commuters, "second-homers", conservationists and those who see the salvation of country life in the bringing into it of suitable light industry and small businesses. These need to be worked through. There are questions too in the report about the closure of village schools, the closure of cottage hospitals and such basic matters as the maintenance of local post offices and village shops as well as the crippling financial burdens which are now placed on these fragile institutions. There are
<col>460</col>
problems about the limits set on general practitioners who act as their own dispensers in situations where it is extraordinarily difficult for people to travel to a properly set up dispensary. There are 101 issues of a similar kind.<lb/>
It is not for me to go into further details, even if I were competent to do so. Many noble Lords know these problems from experience because they are themselves deeply involved in the life of the countryside. All I wish to say is that in the report the issues are exposed. They need to be seen in relation to one another and not tackled piecemeal. They will need sensitive handling at local, regional, national and European Community level. Therefore I simply wish to commend the report to your Lordships as a resource for the tasks which lie ahead.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03463"><member>Baroness Blotch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House would wish me to thank both my noble friend Lord Middleton and the most reverend Primate for the way in which they have introduced the House of Lords Select Committee report on the countryside and the Church of England report, <i>Faith in the Countryside.</i><lb/>
The publication of the House of Lords report and <i>Faith in the Countryside</i> has focused attention on rural areas. I welcome this opportunity to debate the topical and wide-ranging issues raised by both reports. The debate also provides an opportunity for me to respond on behalf of the Government to the reports' recommendations.<lb/>
I should like first to set the scene by explaining the Government's overall approach to rural development and then to look in more detail at the committees' recommendations.<lb/>
Our overall aim is to maintain a thriving countryside through a sensible balance between farming, conservation, recreation, employment creation and the needs of rural communities. Our twin objectives are to achieve a healthy rural economy and an attractive rural environment. Our policies provide a framework for achieving these objectives. Government departments work together to develop policies to cope with changes affecting rural communities. They work closely with the private sector, voluntary organisations, local authorities and government agencies to solve rural problems.<lb/>
Our main task is to guide and encourage others. We want to encourage the enterprise of all those who live and work in rural communities and to see increasing activity by the private and voluntary sectors. We are anxious to see that the best possible use is made of limited public funds, by making full use of opportunities to influence others and by concentrating activities in the areas with the greatest needs. But we do not hesitate to take direct action where necessary, through legislation or by providing pump-priming finance.<lb/>
In many rural areas the efforts of all concerned have resulted in substantial improvements. The population of the rural areas of Britain increased by about 10 per cent. between 1971 and 1981. Employment and economic activity have become
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0270"/>
<col>461</col>
more diversified and, in many areas, the unemployment rate is now well below the national average. But there are still places with problems. These are often related to their remoteness from the main areas of economic activity or to a decline in employment in traditional industries. Other rural communities are now suffering from the problems of success, with shortages of low cost housing and strong pressures for extensive new development. Both reports have highlighted those points. I know that a number of your Lordships will have views on those and many other issues.<lb/>
The Government are taking steps to deal with these problems and to ensure that policies are flexible and up-to-date to meet the changing requirements of the countryside. Where particular problems develop in some rural areas, as with rural housing, we have developed new measures to deal with them. When necessary, we have commissioned research reports to provide the information which can be used to inform future decisions and policy changes.<lb/>
Many of the Select Committee's recommendations are directed at the European Commission. We share the committee's concern that the European Commission's activities should have clear objectives. They should be well related to the problems on the ground and should be sufficiently flexible to deal with the different and changing circumstances in member states. There are many recent examples which point up the need for flexibility.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have followed closely reports of discussions in the agriculture and foreign affairs councils leading up to agreement on the EC agriculture offer last week. The aim is to reduce agricultural support by 30 per cent. over 10 years from 1986. The proposal is a tough one with significant implications for our agriculture, industry and the rural economy.<lb/>
One very important element, which is of particular relevance to your Lordships' debate today, is that we are seeking to maintain and develop the environmental and conservation policies which will ensure that environmental benefit will flow from any restructuring that may result from the new competitive position. The Government have also been making strong efforts to ensure that the Commission's structural funds are directed at the most severe problems and that bureaucracy is kept to a minimum. We are pleased that the Commission selected some areas in the United Kingdom, although we were unable to secure eligibility for all the areas for which we bid.<lb/>
The Government entirely agree with the Select Committee that more support should be given to peripheral and sparsely populated regions in Britain under objective 5b of the structural funds, although this should not necessarily be done at the expense of objective 1 or 2 spending priorities. My honourable friend the Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry pressed Commissioner MacSharry hard to provide increased funds for the UK's objective 5b areas. While the increase of 15 mecu which he secured was welcome, it was insufficient to enable European
<col>462</col>
Regional Development Fund funding in the Highlands and Islands and other 5b areas in England and Wales to continue at more than a fraction of that in earlier years. We hope that the Community initiative on rural development, the LEADER initiative, will enable further funds to be channelled to those areas and we shall be pressing for a good share of the funds available for our objective 5b regions and for the objective 1 region of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
In order to limit the amount of bureaucracy involved in administering the funds, several decisions have been taken recently to streamline operations in the United Kingdom. Officials are also in discussion with the Commission on ways in which its procedures might be simplified and made more flexible.<lb/>
In addition to our efforts to influence the European Community, we have taken many steps to help rural areas through this period of change. In particular we have taken action ourselves on farming, forestry, rural housing and planning. We have also worked closely with our rural development agencies to provide assistance for rural areas when and where it is most needed.<lb/>
The encouragement of entrepreneurial activities both on and off farm is already an established part of Government support. Similarly, policies introduced to help farmers make the necessary adjustments to the new economic circumstances in agriculture, for example farm diversification and woodlands grants, or to assist in the protection of the environment, for example environmentally sensitive areas, can at the same time contribute significantly to rural development. What is not desirable is to introduce into the CAP, in the name of rural development, measures which are primarily social in character. In the first place other measures and expenditure, often at the national level, already exist to tackle social problems. We must avoid taking action at the EC level which cuts across perfectly adequate national measures.<lb/>
I think we must be cautious about the Select Committee's conclusion that,
<quote>"Agricultural policies alone can no longer be assumed to provide widespread benefits to the rural economy and society as a whole".</quote>
What we are seeing is a significant change in emphasis in those policies. As agriculture and forestry occupy 90 per cent. of the land, these industries have a major influence on the appearance of the countryside and on the condition of wildlife habitats and our natural resources.<lb/>
As the recent White Paper <i>This Common Inheritance</i> made clear, it is now Government policy to integrate environmental objectives fully into agricultural support measures. A great deal is being done to protect and improve the countryside and reduce pollution while at the same time bringing agricultural output more into line with demand. The Archbishops' Commission recommended that payment should be made to farmers and other landowners to facilitate communities' enjoyment of rural land. The White Paper sets out proposals for a national countryside initiative by the Countryside Commission which is very much along these lines. I am delighted to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0271"/>
<col>463</col>
say that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment was able to announce last week the provision of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;1 million next year and &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;8 million in 1992&#x2013;93 and &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;4 million in 1993&#x2013;94 to allow the Countryside Commission to launch this initiative.<lb/>
The Government have been in the forefront of attempts to shift the emphasis of the common agricultural policy towards improving the environment and have pioneered the introduction of support for this purpose. Environmental measures were first introduced into the CAP in 1985 and there has been considerable progress since. Most recently the Commission has proposed new measures this year to encourage low input, environmentally friendly farming right across the Community. Our experience with our existing programmes will stand us in good stead as these proposals are considered.<lb/>
I welcome the Select Committee's support for an expansion of forestry, especially in the form of multiple-purpose woodland and community forests, and its endorsement of the view held by the Government that foresty offers a major alternative use for agricultural land that is no longer needed for food production. There should be no doubt about the Government's continuing commitment to forestry; the fact that about a quarter of a million hectares of new planting has been grant-aided over the past 10 years is proof of this. Certainly much of that planting has taken place on land of poor agricultural quality and it is now central to our forestry policy to encourage more planting on better land. As I think the House is aware, the Government are supporting major forestry initiatives to create new national forests in the English Midlands and central Scotland. Three community forests in east London, south Staffordshire and Tyne and Wear are already being supported by the Government. Planting these new forests will provide a wide range of public benefits.<lb/>
As regards financial assistance, we are already doing a great deal. The Forestry Commission's woodland grant scheme is now well established and attracting a great deal of interest. This scheme offers substantial rates of grant with higher grants for the planting of broadleaves and with a supplement for planting on better land. We have also announced recently that we shall be introducing management grants under the scheme in April 1992. Care for the environment is an integral part of the scheme which has been designed to achieve the full range of our policy objectives.<lb/>
I will turn now to housing and planning in rural areas. Both the Archbishops' Commission and the Select Committee draw specific attention to housing issues in rural areas. We accept that it is crucial that affordable housing should be available for those who live and work in rural areas. We recognise that there are particular difficulties in some rural areas, especially where house prices have been driven upwards by demand from long-distance commuters and well-off retired people. On the other hand, we cannot simply resist these market pressures; after all they represent genuine demands from many people
<col>464</col>
who wish to live in attractive rural surroundings. The survival of rural communities depends on successfully adapting to change.<lb/>
In July 1988 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced his rural housing initiative which for the first time set out a policy on low cost housing in rural areas. Since then we have introduced a series of measures designed to boost the supply of low-cost housing in rural England. We are increasing the level of investment in rural areas through housing associations, which have a major role to play in providing affordable housing for rent and low-cost sale, particularly on shared ownership terms.<lb/>
We have increased the public funding available to the Housing Corporation from &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;1 billion this year to over &#x00A3;2 billion in 1993&#x2013;94, enabling it to increase the targets under its special rural programme for low-cost housing for rent and sale in small villages. Despite recent cash planning difficulties resulting from housing associations completing houses faster under the new financial system, the Housing Corporation has been able to maintain the programme. The corporation has publicly stated that no rural homes will be lost.<lb/>
In Wales, Housing for Wales launched a rural housing initiative last year aimed at assisting local people to find affordable housing in their own communities. Housing for Wales has directed around &#x00A3;25 million&#x2014;no less than a quarter of its resources &#x2014;to be spent by housing associations in rural areas this financial year.<lb/>
In Scotland the Government asked the housing development agency, Scottish Homes, to formulate a rural housing strategy as one of its first priorities. Research carried out by Scottish Homes has established that, although problems exist in rural areas, mechanisms are already in place which would allow Scottish Homes and others to tackle those problems and that very few new means are required to fill gaps in provision. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has approved a number of new initiatives intended to tackle rural housing problems. He has also approved 10 areas throughout rural Scotland where the initiatives can be demonstrated and proved. The Government have also made available to Scottish Homes an additional &#x00A3;1 million to launch the scheme this year.<lb/>
We have also introduced a scheme in England to allow housing associations in rural areas to repurchase former shared ownership dwellings at full market value when an occupier moves on, thus preserving the supply of shared ownership houses for local needs.<lb/>
Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that only last week we announced a new scheme to boost rural housing in England. A sum of &#x00A3;50 million is to be allocated to local councils where the needs are greatest to support housing association activity in rural areas.<lb/>
Of course public sector provision alone is not enough. We have also taken steps to encourage landowners and developers to provide new houses at prices or rents that local people can afford. In particular, we announced changes to the planning
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0272"/>
<col>465</col>
rules in England and Wales in 1989 which enabled local authorities to release small sites not previously designated for housing for low-cost housing schemes to meet specific local needs, subject to arrangements to ensure that the houses remain available for local needs. That should enable housing to be provided at lower cost since the land concerned will not be valued at the price of housing land. We shall shortly be commissioning research to investigate how successful that initiative has been. Scottish Homes has recommended that the Scottish Office should encourage Scottish planning authorities to adopt similar policies.<lb/>
I turn to the committees' recommendation on assessment of housing need. Earlier this month Housing for Wales published results of two research projects on the nature and extent of the need for housing in rural Wales. We shall shortly be commissioning research into the nature of demand for housing in rural areas in England.<lb/>
In Northern Ireland affordable rural housing is generally available. However the number of single unfit rural dwellings is a significant problem which is being addressed positively by enhanced incentives to improve rural dwellings and through a rural housing review.<lb/>
Considerable work has been done on the development of planning guidance for rural areas over the past few years. For example, in England planning policy guidance on rural enterprise and development was published in 1988. Advice on the countryside and the rural economy is now being finalised. The development plan system is to be improved and streamlined with regional guidance as an integral part of the system.<lb/>
In Northern Ireland, where the main responsibility for the countryside is shared by government departments, the Department of Agriculture has recently published a countryside management strategy and the Department of the Environment is developing a planning strategy to guide and control development in the countryside.<lb/>
The Government sponsor specialist agencies to do much of the work in implementing their policies for rural communities. In England the Rural Development Commission, which is sponsored by my department, is the Government's main agency for diversifying rural enterprise. Its task is to highlight rural problems, to create a climate in which rural businesses, communities and services can prosper and to initiate action which will improve the economic and social development of rural areas. In Wales similar tasks are undertaken primarily by the Development Board for Rural Wales and the Welsh Development Agency. In Scotland the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board fulfil broadly similar functions. In Northern Ireland, an inter-departmental committee is considering how best to tackle problems in the most deprived rural areas.<lb/>
<col>466</col>
The agencies have a star-studded list of achievements to their credit. They provide advice and work space and create jobs. The success of the Welsh Development Agency demonstrates that point well. Over the last five years the Welsh Development Agency has created over 12,000 jobs in its rural areas. Nearly 50 inward investment projects have been secured for rural areas in the Welsh Development Agency area involving capital investment of almost &#x00A3;40 million.<lb/>
The Archbishops' Commission has commended the use of the integrated approach to economic development being used in the Rural Development Commission's priority areas, the rural development areas. There are many other examples of close co-operation and the Government believe that it is important to allow room for flexibility to meet local circumstances while encouraging close working relationships among private, public and voluntary sectors. That is a point that was made very forcibly by the most reverend Primate and my noble friend Lord Middleton.<lb/>
For instance, I would draw your Lordships' attention to the rural enterprise programme which the Government are introducing in the Highlands and Islands. A project team with a programme controller and locally-based project officers has been set up. The Government envisage that a loose, informal structure will be set up appropriate to the wishes of local communities rather than a centrally prescribed format and membership.<lb/>
The Archbishops' Commission also suggested that local authorities and the Rural Development Commission should be empowered to declare a special status for areas which are dependent on a single employer and where that employment is being substantially reduced. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the Rural Development Commission already targets its activities on such areas as well as on others with pressing needs. Earlier this year the Rural Development Commission announced a package of financial assistance for rural coalfield areas with high unemployment. The Rural Development Commission offers its full range of assistance in the rural coalfields of East Derbyshire, North Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire. A more limited range of assistance has been extended to the rural coalfields of South Derbyshire and North West Leicestershire. Hence the Government are aware of the problems and pressures which the countryside faces. They are taking steps to protect the countryside, which we value, to open up more varied employment opportunities where that is appropriate and to ensure that the social needs of rural areas are not neglected.<lb/>
The last decade has seen rapid and substantial change in the countryside. In many cases we have been successful in meeting our objectives for a healthy rural economy and an attractive rural environment. We are targeting our policies on those areas where there are still problems. In future, above all, we must maintain a package of rural policies which will continue to meet
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0273"/>
<col>467</col>
our objectives and must ensure that European Commission policies are designed to meet the varied needs of the countryside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03464">4.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03465"><member>Lord Gallacher</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the report on <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> submitted by your Lordships' Select Committee on the European Communities is in our opinion an excellent document. If anything, the scope of the document is almost too wide, but that fault, if fault it be, lies with the Commission because the scope of its communication to Parliament and the Council of the European Communities is significant and almost without limitation as to the ideas it seeks to encompass. As it stands, the report is in some ways a definitive document. Everyone who has had a hand in its preparation deserves both the thanks and congratulations of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I go along entirely with the submission that it is impossible to define rural society, even in Great Britain. For example, the Scottish Borders and Western Isles have little in common. The affluent villages in the South East of England have little in common with the mining villages in the North Midlands and the northern half of this country. The hill farmers of North Wales do not have a great deal in common with the dairy farmers of Pembrokeshire. If such disparity exists in rural areas of Great Britain, how can the European Community define and effectively administer assistance with rural change in mind? There are 12 member states. They are all different and within each country there are undoubtedly disparities as wide as those which we know exist in our own country.<lb/>
That leads me to suggest that a weakness of the report, no doubt influenced by the communication, is that it addresses itself mainly to a European Community solution to the problem. I am well aware that the prospect of Community funding is something which no self-respecting committee can afford to ignore, but the opportunity to state a case for the repatriation of these problems as the beginning of the unscrambling of the common agricultural policy seems to me to have been missed on this occasion.<lb/>
Community funding as such, despite its undoubted popularity and acceptance&#x2014;indeed, we almost have an industry building in Britain in an attempt to get money out of the Community&#x2014;is both a roundabout and a somewhat expensive way of financing basic national activity. It is more so in Great Britain's case because of the additionality principle which all governments have applied ever since we became a member of the Community.<lb/>
For example, when one considers Britain's share of the FEOGA guidance awards, it is fairly obvious as and when they are announced that they tend to favour a few large applicants. No one quarrels with that. Undoubtedly the idea is that it is better to give fairly substantial sums of money to a few large applicants than to spread what is available too thinly over a great number of applicants. Therefore I believe that the opportunity has been missed in the report to begin what undoubtedly will have to happen one day: the
<col>468</col>
return of those aspects of common agricultural policy which are better dealt with on a national basis than by the European Commission.<lb/>
It was right to mention the GATT negotiations because until we know the full implications of the GATT settlement&#x2014;if there is a settlement&#x2014;on the common agricultural policy, we shall lot know for certain how the whole of the changes will impact upon rural society as well as farming. But we know that on the basis of what has already been offered by the Community the impact will be significant. Farming practices will undoubtedly change and in addition we shall probably face even more intensive import competition than is currently the case.<lb/>
In regard to planning aspects, I was grateful for the amplification conveyed in the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. Although country planning was not much mentioned in the gracious Speech, the document entitled <i>This Common Inheritance</i> is somewhat vague on the subject. Yet, reading that document and studying its references to agriculture, one has the feeling that there will be substantial changes, perhaps not during this Session but certainly in the future. Our feeling is that country planning needs careful handling, not least because town planning is not universally regarded as a great success by those people who have experience of it. It is a costly business, slow in operation and sometimes inflexible. If country planning is to be approached on that basis, it will be necessary for those who are likely to be affected by it to make sure that some of the errors inherent in town planning as such are not repeated in the country.<lb/>
For that reason we are glad that the Select Committee's report welcomes the reprieve for county councils' structure plans which the Government recently announced. Perhaps also county councils should be the planning authorities for rural areas. It seems to us that their wider geographical spread is more important in the context of county development than district councils can hope to be. But the whole question of planning divergence, which we know exists in this country, justifies my proposition that member states should handle the future of rural society rather than leave it to the Commission.<lb/>
Turning to national agencies, we accept as wise the recommendation in the Select Committee's report that those successful rural agencies which are already functioning and well experienced in this area&#x2014;namely, the Welsh Development Agency, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, the Rural Development Commission and the Development Board for Rural Wales&#x2014;should continue to be regarded as the main bodies in promoting diversification of the rural economy.<lb/>
Too many bodies in this area may result in much consultation &#x2014;a thought that crossed my mind as I listened to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch&#x2014;but may also result in too little being done about a problem which will not diminish but tend to grow the less urgently it is tackled. Also, the fewer reference points there are, the better as regards redevelopment. The less confusion that there is in this area, the better it will
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0274"/>
<col>469</col>
be for the rural economy as a whole. Indeed, in its conclusions the report acknowledges that by anticipating in the long term a rural development advisory service.<lb/>
Much attention has been given to housing. Undoubtedly it is a key question so far as concerns the rural economy. We all agree that rural housing at affordable rents for local people is the crux of the problem. It is the most basic aspect of the rural society problem. We recognise too that it is tied to land values in the country, which vary considerably, as well as to planning consent and local demand, which again are variables in the light of who administers the arrangements, who asks for what and who is prepared to pay for what is on offer.<lb/>
Here again the severity of the problem varies. As I listened to the noble Baroness I had the impression that it was bad in certain parts of the country&#x2014;for example, in Scotland, although there are other areas affected and, taking the country as a whole, the problem is not as acute there as it is in, say, the South East of England. We are all famililar in the South East with the syndrome of the two agricultural cottages which are knocked into one to provide a single home of high standard in an attractive area, appealing to the affluent commuter or the home-working professional and available for the sum of perhaps &#x00A3;200,000 plus. How can the local artisan who is born and bred in the village find accommodation in areas subject to such a situation? Come to that, how can small firms be encouraged to move to the area, having regard to their need to recruit local labour? In other areas, in our opinion planning refusals are too easily influenced by local people whose housing needs have been met. There is an element of selfishness which it is as well to recognise.<lb/>
Housing associations are currently favoured by Her Majesty's Government as the medium for providing rural housing. That view was fully confirmed by what the noble Baroness had to say on that subject. Quite frankly, we welcome the additional money that is to be made available to housing associations through the Housing Corporation for rented housing in rural areas. However, without prejudice to the housing associations, we ask whether there is not still a role for local authorities in rented housing in rural areas. Could not district councils with accumulated receipts from housing sales, the use of which is currently restricted, be allowed to use somewhat more of those funds if they were devoted specifically to housing in rural areas?<lb/>
The question of planning gain is important in this context. Currently we tend to think of it in terms of urban areas. From this side of the House we ask whether there is not also a rural dimension to planning gain. For example, a change of use from farming to other activities must be sympathetically handled, we agree, but if job creation is used as a supporting factor in applications for change of use should not applicants who use that argument be expected to make a contribution to housing demand?<lb/>
<col>470</col>
I have in mind golf courses, which are a popular form of alternative use for farmland in many parts of the country. In most such applications, in addition to the clubhouse and the hotel there is usually a substantial housing element. It is mainly the four-bedroom, two-bathroom detached house which the agricultural or factory worker in a rural environment could not afford even in his wildest dreams.<lb/>
In those circumstances would it not be reasonable to ask such applicants to make land available for housing so that the demand for labour which they say will be created by the development could be met by the provision of low-cost housing in those areas? It would not be a major contribution and, having regard to the economics of some of those schemes with which I am reasonably familiar, I am sure that it could easily be afforded.<lb/>
Regarding community co-operatives, I was disappointed to note that the only mention of co-operatives in the report was a reference to a visit made by the Select Committee to a co-operative society in south-east Belgium. Of course housing associations and co-operatives are not always referred to as such. Is there not a role for a community co-operative on a village basis, possibly to run a post office, a shop, a local bus, a petrol station and even a pharmacy? One can run a pharmacy on a co-operative basis provided that one gives the pharmacist a seat on the board of directors&#x2014;as we well know from our experience.<lb/>
Now that Her Majesty's Government have wound up the co-operative development agencies, and recently have discontinued grants to establish agricultural societies, we on these Benches see a gap in the provisions for the formation of new co-operatives in such areas. Cannot the four rural agencies commended in the report be asked to undertake the provision of advice on forming community cooperatives in villages? A small survey would show whether or not there was a reasonable prospect of success for such a development. Such self-help should commend itself to Her Majesty's Government.<lb/>
I do not wish to spend too much time dealing with other farming aspects in the report, important though they are. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, will deal with them when he replies. Perhaps I may conclude by saying that the problems of the rural society are likely to be with us for some considerable time. On the basis of all the evidence, they are likely to intensify. However, there are also opportunities, and both reports indicate ways in which they can be fully realised. The reports make a valid and useful contribution to the question. We are grateful to the authors in both cases for bringing the matters to our notice in such a clear, concise and helpful fashion.</membercontribution></p>

They both make
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0275"/>
<col>471</col>
fascinating and interesting reading to someone like myself who was brought up on a family farm and still lives in the heart of the Welsh countryside.<lb/>
I regret that the two reports have been discussed together. It seems to me that the report of the Select Committee deals basically with the underlying economic problems&#x2014;the skeleton, as it were&#x2014;while the Church of England report deals with the flesh to be put on the skeleton thereafter. Both would have made more interesting debates had they been debated separately.<lb/>
I intend to limit my remarks to one issue. I should like to quote on it from the report of the Archbishops' commission. At page 310 it states:
<quote>"Policies which provide local work, local homes and local communications for those who are less well-off, but who wish to remain in the country, are crucial if rural living is to retain the balance and cohesion which appear so attractive not only to those looking on from outside, but also to many of the people whom we met throughout the villages of England".</quote>
It seems to me that that presupposes a basically sound agricultural policy and a paternalistic role in the state or in the European Community. I am a firm believer, as I am sure is the noble Lord, Lord Prior, who chaired the commission, in the paternalistic role of government and the need for it to interfere at times to protect the governed.<lb/>
I refer to page 17, paragraph 43 of the report of the Select Committee. From my experience I entirely agree about the importance of farming to the rural economy as emphasised by the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland Office. It states:
<quote>"the Welsh Office emphasised the 'strong dependency' of rural parts of LFAs on agriculture and the Northern Ireland Office considered agriculture 'the cornerstone of the rural economy"".</quote>
I was brought up on a family farm. I well remember my parents and the agricultural community talking about the grave slump that hit agriculture in the 1920s and 1930s, the terrible devastation that it caused to rural communities, the rural depopulation that took place as a result of it, and the interference with and undermining of the cohesion of social and cultural life as well as its economic life. In 1962 I fought a by-election in my old constituency of Montgomery when we were suffering enormously from depopulation. It was before there was a rural development board, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, referred. In the by-election I concentrated on the need for a policy for the rural areas which maintained some certainty of a decent future. The noble Lord, Lord Plumb, will remember how important the Milk Marketing Board was to the rural areas of this country. It brought some certainty where uncertainty existed before.<lb/>
I therefore wish to concentrate on the basics: agricultural policy. Although from my experience a rural community cannot live on agriculture alone, certainly the rural community cannot live without a healthy agriculture. We are today discussing the reports against the background of the Uruguay round of the GATT talks where there is increasing pressure from the United States in particular, from the Cairns group, and, to a lesser degree, from Japan, for greater
<col>472</col>
liberalisation in agriculture. Free trade in agriculture is their eventual aim. I believe that we should regard the process with considerable circumspection.<lb/>
I wish to put the much maligned agricultural policy of the European Commission into proper perspective. In many ways, whatever differences we may have, however we may criticise parts of it, it is the greatest success story of the EC so far. Without it there would have been enormous depopulation in Europe. There would have been great unemployment. There would have been not only agrarian unrest; there would have been tremendous industrial unrest.<lb/>
Noble Lords who have talked to German politicians know the importance that they attach to the small farmers whom one often sees farming the land around the perimeters of the great cities. They regard them as being the most stabilising factor in their industrial sphere. It is estimated that between 10 million and 12 million farming families within the EC benefit enormously from the agricultural policy. In addition to the 10 million or 12 million farming families, there are those who depend on agriculture, servicing it, and so on. Without these farmers in the countryside one would not have the population for one's rural industries.<lb/>
I have been involved with the development of rural industries in mid-Wales. I have had an association with one of the great success stories of rural mid-Wales&#x2014;a company which has become a great international company. That in itself brings other problems in its train. Nevertheless, the point I make is that one cannot find the labour for rural industries unless one has farmers, farm workers, whose daughters and sons provide the workforce in the rural industries. Rural industry and agriculture are closely linked.<lb/>
I was in the United States last weekend. I have already adverted to the fact that it is the United States in particular which is bringing pressure to bear on the Uruguay round of the GATT talks. It is interesting to ask the question: why was agriculture not included in the GATT negotiations in the first place? It is because in 1955 at the specific request of the United States it was excluded because it served the United States book at the time. It did not consider it wise from the point of view of its own economy to include agriculture in the GATT discipline.<lb/>
However, in a leading article in the <i>New York Times</i> this week the following statement appears:
<quote>"European taxpayers pay huge sums, more than &#x0024;100 billion each year, to support a handful of inefficient family farmers".</quote>
That is the way in which the agricultural policy of the EC is being mispresented. It states,
<quote>"to support a handful of inefficient family farmers",</quote>
instead of referring to the fact that between 100 million and 200 million people within the EC may be directly supported by that policy.<lb/>
The article goes on to state what American policy has in mind:
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0276"/>
<col>473</col>
<quote>"The economic gains from an international trade agreement would be enormous, adding perhaps &#x0024;1 trillion to the US economy alone. To reap these benefits, the Western leaders will have to stare down the special interests".</quote>
In fairness I must quote an earlier passage from the article. It states:
<quote>"The Europeans are not the only obstinate leaders. The Japanese won't agree to import rice; and the US proposes to exempt telecommunications, aviation and shipping from the new regulations governing service industries".</quote>
I believe that France and Germany were right to object to going beyond the concessions now made by the EC in their negotiations on agriculture. If we were as successful in our economy as France and Germany have been during the past decade we could read them lessons on how to run their economies and how to balance their agricultural interests with their industrial and commercial interests. After all, between the two of them they indulge in much more world trade than we do. Our Minister of Agriculture described the attitudes of the French and German opposition to further subsidy cuts as making the Community look ridiculous and incompetent, and that was a stupid observation. It makes our country look stupid and incompetent.<lb/>
We must appreciate that the problems of agriculture are difficult to anticipate. A fair balance must be made with many other interests. I have in my hand a copy of a publication by the OECD. It was published this year and is entitled <i>Agricultural Trade Liberalisation: Implications for Developing Countries.</i> The argument has been put forward that the Western countries are extremely selfish with regard to their agricultural policies, for example, and benefit would be brought to third world countries if we had far greater liberalisation. The studies do not bear that out.<lb/>
I shall quote from page 476 of the publication. The OECD studied many models and it states:
<quote>"All the models point to increases in meat, dairy and sugar prices, and all but one &#x2026; forecast rises in food grain prices".</quote>
The article goes on to discuss those various aspects and concludes:
<quote>"Certainly some developing countries will be adversely affected by international price rises, particularly of food grains".</quote>
Noble Lords will be aware that the world price of grain is now just above &#x00A3;40 per tonne. However, that is the subsidised price of food grain. I am assured that the actual price in economic terms if there were no subsidies in any country would be about &#x00A3;86 per tonne.<lb/>
Every country, even a large industrial country with an enormous agricultural background such as the United States, Argentina or Brazil, subsidises its agriculture. The reasons for doing so are obvious and I shall quote again from page 479 of the publication. It states:
<quote>"In practice, we know little of the actual factors that drive the instability in agricultural markets".</quote>
Everyone concerned in agriculture knows how during the past three or four decades we have been protected from that instability. The paragraph continues:
<col>474</col>
<quote>"But we do know that political uncertainty cannot help. The major political actors should define clearly and irrevocably the direction that liberalisation is to take to avoid contributing to this inherent uncertainty in agricultural markets. Equally, price booms and busts which are sure to occur must not be used as an excuse to derail the long-term adjustment process and further contribute to uncertainty".</quote>
Agricultural policy is and still will be the basis of our rural economy in this country. I believe that we should get it into the correct perspective. It is important to us to have a measure of protection from instability. It is important that this basic component of the health of the rural economy should be right. That means a fair balance between the industrial and commercial interests within our country and the Community, on the one hand, and of our agricultural interests, on the other.<lb/>
I hope that in reviewing the two reports it can be seen that we must achieve such a balance in our policy approach. That alone will enable us to add the superstructure with which much of the reports&#x2014;particularly the Church of England report&#x2014;is concerned. We can talk about rural housing and about bringing industries to rural areas. In my part of the country much of that has been or is in the process of being done. However, such areas cannot survive without a basic healthy agricultural policy.</membercontribution></p>

I should particularly wish to commend the theological reflections at the start of the report and the analysis of the objectives of ministry halfway through. In view of the way in which the debate has progressed my contribution may not be sufficiently in line with your Lordships' thinking.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0277"/>
<col>475</col>
However, my heart sank when I read the list of recommendations arising out of the report and that is so for the following reasons. First, out of 47 principal recommedations only about 15 can really be said to have any connection with spiritual affairs. The rest are concerned with material, practical and political problems. That leads directly to the question of what the function of the ordained ministry should be. To what extent should the priesthood involve itself in political and domestic issues at national and local levels?<lb/>
There are some who will tell you that if religious faith is to have any relevance to contemporary society the Church&#x2014;here meaning the institution as opposed to the individuals who compose it&#x2014;must involve itself in all aspects of modern life and particularly the problem areas. On that view of the matter there is unlikely to be any aspect of the domestic and political scene on which the Church will not feel entitled to hold a view and to get involved. This in turn will lead to, indeed has already led to, the creation of a substantial bureaucracy in order to keep these interests properly serviced and the expenditure of a great deal of money in order to promote the various corporate endeavours and initiatives that require to be undertaken.<lb/>
I do not believe that the scriptural authority quoted at the beginning of the report supports this proposition, and nor do the more modern authorities quoted under the chapter heading "Ministry" appear to do so. The foremost duty of the ordained ministry is correctly stated by the 1988 Lambeth conference as being "to proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom", and this is something as different from official involvement in the material, practical and political problems of the day as the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount are from a political manifesto.<lb/>
It is perfectly true that the proclamation of the good news will undoubtedly result in a deepening commitment by individual Christians to all aspects of our national, social and environmental well-being. After all, the whole purpose of the proclamation is to make manifest the workings of God in the lives of men, and the whole essence of a Christian life is one that is dedicated to the service of our fellow man. But involvement in public affairs for the benefit of the community is the end product of the proclamation and not the proclamation itself.<lb/>
My own conviction, and the reason why, after 63 years as a layman, I felt impelled to offer myself for ordination to the non-stipendiary ministry in June this year, is that the Church in the countryside is wilting for one reason only, and that is that the sheep are not being adequately fed. And in this context it should be remarked that to feed them with the wrong food is no better than not feeding them at all.<lb/>
The difficulty I see with the kind of recommendations made in the report are, first, that by suggesting solutions to current national, domestic and environmental problems the Church identifies itself with particular courses of action and thereby implicitly rejects all others. I dislike the word "judgmental". But
<col>476</col>
on this occasion it seems to me apt to describe the espousal by the Church of points of view which have no direct connection with the promulgation of the gospel. Politics is about legitimate differences of opinion on practical affairs, not about ethical issues, and the Church makes a mistake when it takes sides on these matters.<lb/>
Secondly, it seems to me that the main purpose of the Church is to equip individual Christians with the spiritual armour necessary to go out into the world and tackle these problems most effectively. To the extent that the Church itself decides to get involved in these affairs of state it usurps the functions and free choice of its individual members who have no moral obligation whatever to favour any particular solution to the exclusion of others. The Church must not fall into the error of the petrol pump attendant who, having filled his customer's car with the best lead-free spirit, took it upon himself to tell him where to drive afterwards.<lb/>
Thirdly, my training leads me to suppose that there is considerable confusion at the present time as to where the functions of a welfare officer leave off and the functions of the ordained clergy begin. It is perhaps significant that in order to accommodate Moslem susceptibilities our padres in the Gulf are now officially referred to as welfare officers, thereby one might suppose effectively hiding their light under a bushel. All I can say, and I do so with absolute conviction, is that church membership will not be increased by the appointment of welfare officers in the guise of clergymen, which seems to be the implication of some of the recommendations in the report, and still less will it help to appoint public relations officers as per Recommendation No. 34.<lb/>
Nothing that I have said should be interpreted as implying that the Church should not get involved in good works to the extent that these can be undertaken without prejudice to the wider responsibility of bearing witness to Christ. There are respectable precedents for this, one of the more obvious perhaps being the hostels for weary travellers that used to be run by medieval monasteries. But to undertake charitable work oneself is a very different thing from directing others to do so. The danger of the recommendations in the report is that they go a long way towards turning the Church into a political pressure group, and nothing could be more fatal to its survival than that.<lb/>
By way of illustration of the dangers I must tell you that when I was an impressionable young man, the question arose as to whether I should be confirmed into the Church of England or the Church of Scotland. The Church of Scotland, I was assured, was immeasurably better at preaching sermons. So in order to sample their wares we arose at 6.30 one Sunday morning and bicycled 20 miles to the nearest church. I regret to tell you that the minister preached at length about the current housing situation, and this finally and irrevocably determined my confirmation into the Church of England.<lb/>
However, the commission has merely responded to the terms of reference put to it, and one feels bound to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0278"/>
<col>477</col>
say that it has responded very well. The danger lies in the terms of reference themselves, which assume that the objectives of the rural ministry require rethinking as opposed to restating. If the commission had been asked the simple question, "In what way can the relevance of the gospel message to the problems of modern life be more effectively demonstrated?" it might have come up with very different answers. As it is, one is conscious of an uncomfortable lack of distinction between the things which are Caesar's and the things which are God's.<lb/>
I dislike either hostile or destructive criticism and I hope that what I have said will not be taken as either. The sower went forth to sow good seed; he did not tell the plant how to grow, and that in essence is what I have sought to say.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03474">5.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03475"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I first put my name down to speak in this debate there were relatively few noble Lords who had already done so. It was only today that I realised that the debate would perhaps go on for a time far beyond the last train that I have to catch. If that is so, it means that I shall not be able to be here for the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, and possibly for other noble Lords, and I ask the indulgence of the House for that. The reason why I did not withdraw, as I perhaps should have done, was partly my great interest in the subject and also my particular respect for the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, as chairman of the committee on which I was privileged to sit and which brought out this report. It is indeed a valuable report. I shall not go through it. The noble Lord has done so in a way that would make it otiose for me to do so.<lb/>
However, I would emphasise one point. The noble Lord spoke of the difference between social and economic objectives in agricultural policy and that they must be kept separate. That was emphasised even more by the speeches of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and the noble Lord, Lord Hooson. At least on one or two points I feel I must take issue with them, and I speak as someone who has been involved in farming for virtually the whole of his life.<lb/>
It is entirely misleading for us to believe that we can solve the problems of rural society purely, or even primarily, by having a prosperous agricultural industry. It is of course important that we should have one for a whole variety of reasons. But let me remind your Lordships that, whereas in the days of the youth of the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, on his family farm &#x2014;why he did not stay there I do not know if it was such a lovely life, but that is a question one can ask a great many people who have been brought up on family farms and have taken the first opportunity to leave them&#x2014;the chances were that you needed one man to milk about 12 or 15 cows, today you need one man to milk 100 cows.<lb/>
In those days on an arable farm of some size you needed three men for every 100 acres, and that was pushing it rather fine. Today you are not doing very well if you have one man on 300 acres. It is more like
<col>478</col>
one man on 500 acres. Therefore, no matter how prosperous agriculture is, while the countryside will look prosperous and tidy and may have trees planted on it and even some hedges trimmed, it will not repopulate the rural areas and it will not play a significant part in helping to create a vital rural society.<lb/>
Why do we like the idea of a rural society? What is it about a rural society that attracts all of us no matter where we live? In what way does it differ from an urban society? Partly it is because the countryside is much more attractive to look at than the streets of London or Manchester. It is more fun to play and recreate oneself in the countryside than to wander through streets teeming with the noxious fumes of motor cars. In other words, it is attractive because to town dwellers it is an escape from town life.<lb/>
Part of the reason is also nostalgic. People still think of thatched cottages, with roses growing around the door. They do not remember that those thatched cottages were lucky if they had a privy down the garden; that they had no running water except the water which came through the leak in the roof. The countryside is a lovely nostalgic idea. People like the idea of lowing cows and the absence of bustle. Very often when they come to live in the countryside those same people are the ones who complain about the noxious smell of dung when the cattleyard is cleaned and the smell seeps in through their bedroom window or about the cows blocking the road as they hurry to catch their morning commuter train. The picture is not always 100 per cent. rosy, so that is not really what attracts us.<lb/>
The real reason we are all anxious to preserve rural society is that it is a small society. It is a society where everyone knows everyone else; everybody feels some responsibility for their neighbour, tolerates their weaknesses and helps where help is needed and, as the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York said, people are prepared and able to take community action to make their community a better place.<lb/>
There is nothing anonymous about rural life. People know each other. We can compare that with the big cities where every night when we walk home we pass the homeless sleeping in the doorways of shops. They are anonymous people; we do not know who they are. We pass by on the other side and pay no attention to them; that is someone else's job. One has virtually no neighbours except the people who live in the flat next door. They may do the same kind of job, work in the same office and leave for work at the same time as oneself. But that is not community life.<lb/>
It is the absence of community feeling in towns which draws people into a rural life if they can possibly manage it. Above all it makes rural life worth supporting for the country as a whole. It is important to ensure that there are places still, in spite of our urban bustle, our great factories and huge insoluble problems, where problems are soluble, where one can play a part in the community and one feels a worthwhile member of society.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0279"/>
<col>479</col>
In order to achieve that, a true rural society must be small, though not too small. It must have a mix of ages, of interests and of income. It must welcome newcomers but not be swamped by them. It is essential that rural communities allow new houses to be built to accommodate newcomers. Some newcomers will undoubtedly want to live in former farmworkers' cottages. Houses will have to be built for those who would have been farmworkers had they been born half a century earlier. They must now look elsewhere to live. But they may not want to leave the village of their birth, the friends with whom they played football and the village life of which they are part.<lb/>
The most reverend Primate and the noble Lords, Lord Gallacher and Lord Middleton, mentioned the overriding need for rural housing of a sort which can be afforded by these young people who are anxious to marry, to start a family and to contribute to their rural society. Often they cannot afford the houses that are available at the present time.<lb/>
Those young people must find work. There will not be sufficient work in the village, forgetting the farming side. There will not be sufficient factories and offices in the village to give them all an occupation. In any case, they will want to spread their wings and travel a little further away. Opportunities must be provided for varied employment &#x2014;high technology, shops and offices, the whole range of jobs&#x2014;within reasonable travelling distance of the rural areas. Without that it will be impossible to keep young people in the village.<lb/>
New jobs will be needed and the siting of those jobs will be decided mainly by local authorities. They must bear in mind that there should be small towns and industrial centres which are close enough to every village for young people to reach them within a reasonable time. At the same time, the training of those young people, which has also been mentioned and I should like to support and emphasise the point, must not simply be as it was under the previous Agricultural Training Board, to teach them to milk cows, look after pigs and drive tractors. They must be trained for a whole variety of other jobs&#x2014;industrial and office jobs&#x2014;which can be obtained within the locality.<lb/>
We must not simply cater for the young; we must also look after the old. A whole variety of services are needed for old people, as most of your Lordships are aware. There must be a good bus service provided to enable the old to travel into town from time to time to do their shopping. There must be a village shop. Increasingly village shops find it impossible to continue and are succumbing to poll tax business rates, the competition of the multi-nationals in the nearest town and the supermarkets.<lb/>
By some means or other the shop and the post office must he maintained in the villages. The post office is particularly important for old age pensions and so on. There must be a doctor's surgery and the facility for the doctor to dispense medication in his surgery rather than writing out a prescription and people travelling a long way to have it fulfilled. All those things and many
<col>480</col>
more are needed&#x2014;especially adequate transport facilities&#x2014;to make life supportable and reasonable for the older people of the community.<lb/>
If the natives, old and young, are provide with affordable houses, work, schools and shops, it will be easier for them to accept newcomers and not resent them. Also the potential conflict of interests&#x2014;again mentioned, rightly, by the most reverend Primate&#x2014;between these people and the commuters, the retired and other people who come in (I believe nature lovers were mentioned) will be minimised and a form of community of the sort that we all wish to see will he created.<lb/>
I believe that in that way the old spirit of a rural community can be maintained or perhaps one should say revived. We will find in our country districts a new form of rural society to take the place of the old form. It will no longer be based on the squire and the parson. I imagine that the parson will have a role to play, if enough people can be found to play that role. The squire is of the past. Mutual interest and shared responsibilities will prevail and the dangers of an uncaring, divided urban society will be avoided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03476">5.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03477"><member>Lord Shuttleworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is unusual, regrettably, to receive one major report on rural areas let alone two. However, within a few weeks of each other we have seen published both our Select Committee's report and the Archbishops' Commission's report. Both complement and reinforce each other and have done much to raise the profile of rural matters which I for one find most welcome.<lb/>
Before I go further I must declare an interest in this debate on two counts. First, I am chairman of the Rural Development Commission to which much reference&#x2014;favourable reference, I am glad to say&#x2014;is made in both reports. Secondly, I am also an upland sheep farmer, identified in both reports as an endangered species. On both counts I must congratulate the chairmen, my noble friends Lord Middleton and Lord Prior, and their colleagues, on their inquiries and the reports. Taken together they provide a superb analysis of the problems facing rural areas, highlighting in particular the issues facing the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Your Lordships will know that the Rural Development Commission is the government agency for economic and social development in rural areas of England. We have a statutory duty to keep under review and advise government on all matters relating to the economic and social development of English rural areas. We have wide powers, together with an annual budget of just under &#x00A3;40 million, to take measures to further such development.<lb/>
Much of our effort is concentrated on advising government, raising awareness of the particular needs of rural areas and rural dwellers and seeking to influence the policies and actions of other bodies&#x2014;public, private and voluntary&#x2014;to take account of the rural dimension. However, what distinguishes us from other government countryside agencies is that we are concerned principally with the people who live and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0280"/>
<col>481</col>
work in the countryside. We are, therefore, very concerned with all the contents of both reports, but I shall be as brief as possible.<lb/>
One of the important messages from the Select Committee's report is the danger of confusing "rural" with "agricultural". Here in England the proportion of jobs related to agriculture is in fact the lowest in the European Community. The ratio is about one-in-50 compared, say, to one-in-four in Greece. While agriculture remains the major land use in the countryside and its contraction poses serious problems for the management of the landscape, it is no longer the main economic activity in most rural areas. I am not sure that that point is always understood or accepted elsewhere in Europe. We must try to ensure that the European Community initiatives on rural development do not have too narrow a focus on agriculture and the land.<lb/>
In many areas the rural economy is adapting and becoming more diversified, with a minimum of public sector intervention. In other areas, particularly the remoter or hillier areas such as where I live, the economy is fragile because of over-reliance on agriculture or on other declining industries and because of geographical obstacles to the easy establishment of new businesses. These areas have a continuing need for support.<lb/>
The Select Committee's report&#x2014;and other noble Lords who have spoken today&#x2014;recognise that there is a great diversity of rural areas in England. Even the commission's priority areas encompass places as different as upland hill farming areas in the North and West, relatively inaccessible lowland areas such as the Isle of Wight and North Norfolk and the declining rural coalfield closure districts of the East Midlands.<lb/>
There cannot be one solution for the development of them all. Our approach through our regional staff structure is to work out rural development programmes with local bodies in each priority area. These are suited to local needs. Rural development needs to be small scale, environmentally sensitive and locally determined. We put that point strongly to the European Commission and it seems to be reflected in its proposals, which envisage local agencies playing a key role in the delivery of community programmes.<lb/>
It is gratifying that all these reports recognise the work of the Rural Development Commission as providing perhaps a useful model for other parts of the European Community. Personally, I take no credit for that as I became chairman of the commission only this year; but I pay tribute to the work of my noble friend Lord Vinson. He has asked me to say how sorry he is that due to an inescapable engagement elsewhere he is unable to take part in the debate. He has also asked me to convey to your Lordships his endorsement of both reports.<lb/>
Just for a moment I shall concentrate on one particular issue&#x2014;that of rural housing. The subject has been much mentioned today but it is so important that I make no apology for doing so again. For some years now the commission has seen this as the key
<col>482</col>
issue facing many rural communities. We welcome the recognition of the problem by the Government and the steps they have taken to increase the supply. However, we are quite clear that much more still needs to be done.<lb/>
A recent study for the commission estimated that at least 116,000 additional homes will be needed over the next five years. In the main what is needed is an increase in the amount of rented accommodation at affordable levels. The private sector, through developers, landlords and landowners, has a role to play but by definition adequate provision of low-cost affordable housing is not susceptible to a commercial market solution. Much of the need will be met only with public sector financial assistance.<lb/>
After helpful discussions with the chairman of the Housing Corporation and with others the Rural Development Commission suggested a number of additional steps to the Government which we feel should be taken as a matter of urgency. These proposals are additional to the support we already give to achieving the existing programme. I do not suggest that any particular step will have a major impact on its own, but taken together with earlier government initiatives I think they can all make a useful contribution. I wish briefly to refer to three of them.<lb/>
First, we should like to see an increase in the Housing Corporation's rural rented programme. The corporation has given an assurance that current slippage in the programme will be recovered by the end of 1992&#x2013;93. That is welcome, but the fact is that the planned target for 1992&#x2013;93 of 1,500 units is simply not enough. Secondly, local authorities should be allowed to retain more of their capital receipts from council house sales on condition that the extra amount retained is reinvested through housing associations for an increase in the supply of low-cost housing in those small communities targeted by the Housing Corporation's special rural programme. I welcome the statement made by the Minister for Housing last Friday on a new scheme to boost the supply of low-cost rented housing in rural areas through local authority housing credit approvals. However, it is not yet clear what this means in terms of additional houses to be built and which areas will be eligible under this new initiative.<lb/>
Thirdly, further steps are needed to make sure that sites which landowners are willing to make available for affordable housing are not lost due to the current shortage of public funds for development. One option is to make funds available to purchase sites in advance. A more attractive proposition might be to build on the land bank trust concept which has been adopted by the Devon Rural Community Council, which takes options from landowners on sites which have a reasonable expectation of planning permission. The only costs involved are administrative and legal. If the Government were willing to support the idea, the Rural Development Commission would fund the costs of similar trusts in other counties. These are not
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0281"/>
<col>483</col>
the only steps&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;that might be taken, but I believe that they could go some way to ease the immediate problem.<lb/>
I am sometimes asked whether housing is an economic or social problem. It is both. Those who try to categorise problems in this way fundamentally misunderstand the countryside. It is an extremely complicated web of interrelated issues. For example, I visit businesses which are short of labour because of the lack of local housing. I visit village housing schemes isolated from services like shops and schools. The Commission sees most aspects of life in the countryside as interrelated and practises an integrated approach to rural development. It believes equally in the importance of working in partnership with local authorities, the county rural community councils and so on in assessing the problems, needs and opportunities of an area and in drawing up programmes of action. I am pleased that the Select Committee endorsed this approach in its report.<lb/>
I have referred principally to the issue of rural housing this afternoon because a shortage of rural housing now threatens the very viability of rural areas. However, that is in no way to minimise the importance of many of the other issues identified in both reports. We in the Rural Development Commission feel that rural areas and rural people do not get enough attention. We live in an urban-dominated society and too often policy is formulated from an urban standpoint. The Select Committee's report and the Archbishops' Commission report have helped to remind a much wider audience that the countryside is where large numbers of people live and work. There are some special problems and solutions need to be tailored to local circumstances. I welcome both reports for focusing attention on the rural areas and the future that they face.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03479"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome our debate today partly because the report of your Lordships' Select Committee well deserves consideration, and partly because it provides me with an opportunity to draw your Lordships' attention to the very serious problems which face the rural community in my own country of Wales. I listened with much interest to the stimulating speech of the most reverend Primate. It left me with the feeling that salvation stops at Offa's Dyke. I am sure that that was not intentional. It was very much an English enterprise.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hooson, also made a wide-ranging and very interesting speech. I could not help feeling that he was so much immersed in American journalism that he had not been reading the Welsh press recently. Otherwise I feel that we would have had more reference to the problems in rural Wales than the very agreeable personal reminiscences with which he regaled us.<lb/>
In the report of the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, and his colleagues, there are some references to the Principality. But the only oral evidence taken, which allowed cross-examination by members of the Committee, was that of the Development Board for
<col>484</col>
Rural Wales. It is true that the Association of County Councils, whose team included the very knowledgeable chief executive of the county of Gwynedd, also touched on Welsh affairs. The Welsh Office submitted a written memorandum but did not think it necessary to send representatives to London, although the Scottish and Northern Ireland Offices did.<lb/>
The committee interviewed the National Farmers' Union and the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, but not the National Farmers' Union of Wales. Of the voluntary environmental bodies, audience was awarded to the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), but not to CPRW, which is its Welsh counterpart. The committee itself numbered 11 Members of this House, including the chairman. Of these, four noble Lords are based in Scotland, one in Northern Ireland and five in England. The noble Lord, Lord Raglan, who unfortunately is not able to be with us today, is based in Wales. I can only suppose that the forebears of the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, must have had some Welsh connections in 1765, when the title came into being, but he seems to be firmly established in Wiltshire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03480"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must put the noble Baroness right since she has mentioned my name. There is no connection whatsoever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03481"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is most regrettable. I had always hoped to recognise him as a fellow countryman, but I am obviously deprived of that privilege. Perhaps he will tell me afterwards which Radnor he belongs to.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Raglan, has an exemplary record of public service in what is now the county of Gwent and in the border country adjoining Gloucester, Hereford and Worcester. I am sure that he himself would not claim close familiarity with the position in south-west, mid and north-west Wales which is where our acute anxieties lie. I am aware that the membership of the Select Committee in this House is personal and not representative. Nevertheless, in the circumstances which I have described one could have expected that the committee might feel it necessary to include Wales in its programme of visits. It did not. Visits were paid to the Highlands of Scotland, Northern Ireland and south-eastern Belgium. No one bothered to come to see what is causing alarm and despondency in large areas of rural Wales.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, suggested, most of us in Wales can trace our origins to a rural, if not a farming, background. My paternal and maternal great grandfathers farmed in Cardiganshire and Denbighshire respectively. The mainstay of most Welsh farming, as I expect most of your Lordships recognise, is sheep or cattle. Today, especially but not exclusively in the upland areas, there is not just anxiety about the future. There is an element of fear. I wish that had been more fully recognised.<lb/>
This fear is based mainly on the collapse of livestock prices, with even darker clouds on the horizon. It is true that the Government are trying to take palliative measures such as advance payments on the sheep annual premium, the suckler cow premium
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0282"/>
<col>485</col>
and beef intervention, referred to by the Secretary of State for Wales on 29th October in another place. But these provide no permanent foundation. In addition to the 30 per cent. farm support reduction, who is to know how far the present international discussions may change the current restrictions on imports&#x2014;for example, of New Zealand lamb&#x2014;or whether there may be further reductions in dairy quotas or a drop in milk prices? We do not know. Two days ago Sir Simon Gourlay, known, I am sure, to many of your Lordships, was trying his best to sell the idea of supply management to Welsh farmers. I can say that was done with only limited success.<lb/>
By Mediterranean standards, small farmers in Wales may appear better off than those in Greece and Portugal, but as Professor Michael Haines of University College, Aberystwyth, pointed out in his memorandum to the Select Committee, what matters in social and economic terms is what is relative to the society in which you actually live. Proposals for an income support scheme based on Mediterranean standards could be very damaging, and not beneficial, to small farmers in Wales. I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, endorsed that view in her speech. I hope that we shall not have any move in that direction. It is essential that in dismantling the CAP we lose no time in establishing an alternative regime which will sustain and retain our upland farming population.<lb/>
A partial framework is to hand in the less favoured areas, to which the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, referred, and in the environmentally sensitive areas which, with national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, cover virtually the whole of rural Wales. But the framework must be filled in and the pattern thought through&#x2014;and quickly.<lb/>
I understand that, under the ESA regime, the Community pays 25 per cent. and the Treasury 75 per cent. of the cost. That explains the reluctance of the Treasury to agree to extensions of the ESA areas, although the concept has the great advantage of being environmentally beneficial while restraining production. There is also an EC proposal for a LEADER scheme as a mechanism for sustaining local economic and community development work in selected rural areas. Meanwhile, the proposed reduction in agricultural support payments, to whatever level, will release Community funds. Unless our negotiators are skilful and persistent, we may fail to transfer adequate amounts in other ways to sustain rural society, particularly in the physically disadvantaged areas of our country, at a tolerable and ongoing level. Hence our profound concern at the present state of affairs.<lb/>
This concern is greatly intensified in Wales by the fact that it is primarily in the rural areas of north-west Wales, mid-Wales and south-west Wales that our Welsh language, traditions and culture survive and flourish. If these areas seriously decline, then much of what we cherish may go too. It is far more than simply an economic problem, most particularly in the Welsh speaking areas.<lb/>
There is no doubt that the past decade has shown
<col>486</col>
marked Welsh success in obtaining inward investment to replace the declining basic industries of coal, steel and shipping. The present Secretary of State for Wales was recently in Japan, simultaneously with the Prince and Princess of Wales, but with more mundane objectives than imperial ceremonial on his mind. We have attracted both Japanese and German entrepreneurs of substance. It is only right to acknowledge the efforts of successive Secretaries of State, including the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who set an excellent example to his immediate successor and to the present incumbent. But they and the Welsh Office have not been equally successful in bringing European Community funds to Welsh rural areas.<lb/>
This too was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. It is partly but not entirely due to the bureaucracy of Brussels. In particular, the delay in obtaining any financial benefit at all for rural Wales from the European Community ERDF source, although the three Welsh rural counties of Powys, Dyfed and Gwynedd have been lingering in the designated 5B queue literally for years, has been irritating beyond belief. I am told that there is now something definite in the pipeline. Perhaps the noble Baroness who is to reply to the debate may have some good news for us.<lb/>
Finally, I turn to the major agencies with economic and to some extent social responsibilities in rural Wales&#x2014;the Development Board for Rural Wales, the Welsh Development Agency and the Wales Tourist Board. Important as tourism is, in this debate I believe that the two economic agencies should take precedence.<lb/>
For reasons of history, their relationship is anomalous. Sir Wyn Roberts, Minister of State at the Welsh Office, has recently provided some very interesting information on their respective achievements. This too was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. The Development Board for Rural Wales, based at Newtown in Montgomeryshire, has jurisdiction in the country of Powys and in one district each of Dyfed and Gwynedd&#x2014;in all, some 40 per cent. of the land area of Wales but only 8 per cent. of the population. Its writ does not run in the other distinctly rural areas of Pembrokeshire, Carmarthen, Caernarvon or Anglesea nor in the more industrialised counties of Glamorgan, Gwent and Clwyd. In these, it is the Welsh Development Agency which operates, with increasing emphasis on rural investment, but lacking the social remit of DBRW.<lb/>
This is not the occasion to discuss these irrationalities, but in relation to the increasing influence of Community decisions on patterns of rural life throughout Europe one must ask whether the present arrangements are really the most effective ones that we can devise for Wales. Both DBRW and WDA are doing admirable and, in general, successful work in the Principality, assisted by the Wales Tourist Board, Coed Cymru and Tai Cymru, for woodland development and rural housing respectively. But are the two agencies, separately or conjointly, in a strong enough position to carry adequate weight in Brussels? They are both answerable to the Welsh Office, as is the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0283"/>
<col>487</col>
Welsh Agricultural Division. But the Welsh Office has multifarious concerns and its ministerial team carry extensive responsibilities. Can they spare the time and effort needed seriously to influence both Whitehall and the international activity on which the future salvation of rural society in Wales depends? Judging by the showing of the report which is before us this afternoon, one cannot help expressing a certain degree of doubt. But the noble Baroness who is to reply was put on notice that Welsh concerns would be raised today. I for one await her response with interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03482">5.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03483"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to speak in the debate as a member of the committee which was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Middleton. He is an admirable chairman. He has a wide knowledge and a kindly way of putting one down. He has all the necessary characteristics except that he is too kind a man. When the Whips came to him and said that they wanted to lump two reports together, one from the Church and one from the committee, he said yes, of course. He would not be nasty enough to tell the Whips where they should go. However, that would not apply to me.<lb/>
It is ridiculous for us to discuss two important reports. The most reverend Primate who introduced the Church report said that it was 70 per cent. addressed to the Church. The Select Committee report is one on rural society and is mainly concerned with economic and other social factors.<lb/>
We now have a situation where we have a list of 30 speakers which means that the proceedings will run extraordinarily late. I am 500 miles away from home. I expected to discuss one report and, as a result, both my noble friend Lord Hooson and myself, who live in remote parts of the United Kingdom will have to be discourteous and leave before the end of the debate. We apologise to the assembled noble Lords and to the Minister for that fact. Of course, the latter has full permission and scope to be rude about us in our absence. Nevertheless, we shall read what she says with great interest.<lb/>
As everyone has said, the whole question of rural society is one which is not susceptible to one single solution; indeed, there is an enormous variety over the whole of the United Kingdom. In some parts of the South East the great problem is not to let people into the countryside, but in parts of the Highlands, and in agricultural areas, the problem is how to retain the population.<lb/>
I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord Hooson that the question of agriculture still remains absolutely paramount in many areas. I know that those directly employed in that industry represent only 2 per cent. of the whole working population, but there are also a large number of dependent industries which make agriculture remain one of the most important industries in the country. Certainly, in large areas of the countryside, if you do not have a viable agriculture then you will not have a very comfortable or viable countryside.<lb/>
<col>488</col>
In the debate on the gracious Speech, I, and others, gave figures on the decline in the income of agriculture which applied not only to small farmers and family farmers but also to the larger farmers. There is no questioning the fact that farming income is in decline. However, that is not the part of the report upon which I wish to concentrate.<lb/>
I wish to concentrate upon the other industries in the countryside. I dare say many noble Lords have visited the Black Forest. I recently toured the area. It is absolutely delightful. One valley which we visited had perhaps half a dozen farms. We came across on the top of a hill a most glorious little chapel which was beautifully kept. We noticed that there were two good cars outside each farm and that there was no possibility of that standard of life being supported from the acres of land which we saw. Of course, the answer is that there is spread throughout greater Germany, or the Federal Republic, a large variety of industries in which people may work, while still living on their farms. It was quite apparent to me that that was supporting an extremely healthy rural society. Clearly that factor is one of great importance.<lb/>
I was delighted to hear the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, whom I regarded with great suspicion because he succeeded such a good chairman in the RDC. However, no doubt he will be relieved to know that my fears have been set at rest. I am sure that the commission will continue to carry out extremely good work. Members of the committee were very impressed with its evidence. I hope and trust that the Minister will pay close attention to what the noble Lord said about the need for rural housing, the need to support rural local government communities and the need to release money. Further, I hope that they will be allowed to keep the houses and that they will not have to sell them because of the sale policy of the Government which, taken as a whole, is excellent; but, in rural areas, there are many places where this has done a great deal of harm.<lb/>
Along with the RDC in England, the noble Baroness will be pleased to hear that the committee also took evidence from the development agency in central Wales which was obviously on top of its job.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03484"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may interrupt simply to correct the noble Lord. It is called the Development Board for Rural Wales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03485"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I stand corrected.<lb/>
These other agencies have been of enormous value in showing us the way which we should go. I hope that the Government will not only bless them in theory but that they will also bless them with money. The Highlands and Islands Development Board and the Scottish Development Agency in Scotland have done much good. However, the format has now been altered. They are now called, respectively, the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Board and the Scottish Enterprise Board. A great deal of devolution of power has taken place. I am not sure about the situation, but I shall watch it with great interest. In my view, it is most important that the Government
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0284"/>
<col>489</col>
support these agencies by giving them the money which they need. Of course, they will get the money back because there is nothing which costs a government more in the countryside than having to support a run-down area. Indeed, if an area proves to be prosperous, the Government's investment will provide dividends. That is the essential assurance which we need from the Minister.<lb/>
I was not altogether reassured when the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said that Scottish Homes were to receive &#x00A3;1 million in respect of an experiment in housing. I hope that that is not all that it will receive. I say that because, so far as I know, &#x00A3;1 million will not build many houses. I see that the Minister does not wish to say anything further on the matter, so it appears that &#x00A3;1 million is the correct figure.<lb/>
I have great hopes of Scottish Homes; that is, if it is properly funded. However, if it is not, then the present troubles that we have in the Scottish rural areas will continue. In that area we are seeing exactly the same situations arising as has been the case in the South for many years. People come up to Scotland, having sold their homes at a high price, and buy up the houses. That means that local people cannot afford to stay in the area.<lb/>
Many of the topics mentioned in our report have proved to be most useful. All the evidence the committee took&#x2014;and the evidence given by the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, is recent confirmation of this&#x2014;showed that housing in the countryside for local people must he available for rent at an affordable price. If such housing is not available, we shall not see the right kind of development.<lb/>
Unless people actually work in a community, they do not take part in it. That is the evidence we heard from all over Scotland and England. If you commute 30 or 40 miles from your home to your place of work, you simply have a house in the area. That is not good enough. We know that the numbers of people in farming will decline, but a major Government objective should be to ensure that any enterprise outside farming is supported and that industrial ventures in the rural community are also supported. In that way we can contain and hold the indigenous community and make a much better community for people who wish to come into the countryside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03486">5.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03487"><member>Lord Plumb</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is timely that we debate the issues facing rural society. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Middleton on his Select Committee's report and wholly support his comments upon it. I also warmly welcome the fact that it is linked with that excellent document <i>Faith in the Countryside</i> produced by my noble friend Lord Prior. I am almost tempted to agree with the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, and those of the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, and say that we perhaps should take two bites at this massive report because there is the agricultural and the rural content to consider. We
<col>490</col>
should remind ourselves, however, that we have one rural society and therefore it might be appropriate to link the two reports.<lb/>
I shall deal with the various parts of the workbench: the land itself and those who live in the countryside. We are aware that since the report was written the problems facing agriculture have escalated. The financial position of many farmers is critical; and people are still leaving the land in ever-increasing numbers. The causes of that are well known and have been well researched, but solutions must be found if traditional farming families are to survive. We must avoid at all costs driving the whole of agriculture into huge intensive units. Neither farmers nor society want that. We should realise that at the height of the surpluses caused by the CAP, 80 per cent. of the cost of the CAP was spent upon the storage of surpluses and export subsidies. So a combination of measures is necessary to rectify that unbalanced expenditure. That can be done only by a switch from production incentives to market management, linked to further extensification and care for the environment.<lb/>
We are well aware&#x2014;we have experience of this that progressive price cutting does not by itself provide the answer. In fact it can, and does, do the reverse. Farmers are realists and accept that farm support will be reduced in the years to come, but within the framework of any GATT settlement we must not drive thousands of farmers, and young farmers, out of business.<lb/>
As has already been said, there has been a move into the countryside, with people taking over country dwellings. We note that one in five people in England live in rural areas, and nine out of 10 who live in those areas are not involved in farming. It is therefore essential to unite the voice of the countryside and to use every endeavour to create an environment in which we can all live and work together to maintain or protect village life, the Church, the school, the community centre and the very fabric of the countryside. However, we have first to recognise one another's needs in order to create the balance of demands for land use, housing, farming, recreation, country pursuits and the development of small businesses which now form a growing part of the national economy. The provision of services to those rural areas must not be neglected. Medical, pharmaceutical and advisory services and care for the elderly and sick are crucial in order to help rural areas.<lb/>
So we see the whole face of the countryside changing. Nearly every farmer in my village has applied for planning permission to convert barns and other buildings into dwellings or business enterprises which we hope will keep village life alive without destroying the environment; but will the newcomers be made welcome by those whose roots are in the village?<lb/>
The most reverend Primate mentioned the role of the Church in rural society. I was reminded of when I was staying with friends in Dorset a while ago. As we went into the village on the Sunday morning the church bells were ringing. People were coming out of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0285"/>
<col>491</col>
every house and going up to the church for the service. I said to my host, "This is quite remarkable. You must have a good vicar". He said, "On the contrary, but you see we own all these houses and I only let a house to a family which promises that at least one of its members will attend church on a Sunday". I said, "That sounds positively feudal". He said, "You see, I have to look after the welfare of the church. I am the patron and that is the way to keep it going". He said it had brought the community together and that all the village activities take place in the community centre.<lb/>
Villages will die without organisations to keep them alive such as the Women's Institute, the Young Farmers (that fine marriage bureau) and the many voluntary bodies that are wholly dependent upon voluntary contributions of time and effort. That is a factor that cannot always be measured in financial terms.<lb/>
As we hear so often, "No man is an island". We cannot live in isolation from one another. We look at the problems of pollution and environmental issues. Chernobyl shocked and frightened the world into the realisation that pollution knows no boundaries.<lb/>
Both rural and urban dwellers are therefore affected by the world's development. Every nine year-old schoolgirl will lecture over the breakfast table on the ozone layer, acid rain and the greenhouse effect on the weather. Even the world's 25 million flatulent cows are accused of blowing a hole in the ozone layer as we are told that they produce 90 million tonnes of methane gas a year, which brings global disaster nearer by boosting the greenhouse effect. Your Lordships will of course be aware that one tonne of methane has the same effect on the earth's atmosphere as 75 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The good news for cows, according to some scientists, is that brewery products are better for them than cereals and grass since they produce half the quantity of methane gas.<lb/>
I should like to concentrate on agriculture and the need for balance. We seem to live in an age where society has rediscovered the environment. There is an increasing demand for all things healthy or natural. The paradox is that against the concern for "natural" is the growing demand for a higher standard of living. It is a human characteristic to want to have one's cake and eat it: the countryside should be there as a haven of recreation, of calm and of natural beauty when work in the city or factory is finished.<lb/>
The public perception has changed. People now talk about the scandal of surpluses and of the rape of the countryside and do not applaud economic efficiency. Sir Derek Barber, who is known to us all, reminded us recently in his anatomy of "green" agriculture that by definition "green" should mean:
<quote>"a commercially effective industry which operates within the sensible constraints imposed upon it by the need to protect and enhance the farmed environment".</quote>
That seems to me the most balanced definition of what might be termed the environmental care of farm land and the economic health of the agricultural industry. It is outrageous to postulate a situation where wholly non-scientific pressures lead to agriculture being
<col>492</col>
placed in a straitjacket of dubious fashioning which will blunt the edge of its ability to produce economically and to compete in the market place.<lb/>
Farmers will be blamed and criticised increasingly by consumers and "Christmas Tree Party" supporters alike for polluting the atmosphere. Yet is it difficult to link a particular environmental quality problem to a farm or set of farms. That makes the design and enforcement of pollution control policies extremely difficult.<lb/>
Pollution transcends national boundaries, especially in respect of water. Countries that would benefit from reducing agricultural pollution are therefore often different from the countries that would have to bear the cost. Uniform environmental regulation across countries would result in differential incidence of control costs across countries. For example, the strict regulation of pesticides in Western Europe would disadvantage farmers in Mediterranean countries relative to northern European countries due to the greater pest problem in countries with warmer climates.<lb/>
I make no apology for stressing this point because I believe it is an important factor involved in what is happening in rural society: balancing food output with environmental legislation poses many questions. To make food and water safe, we must decide what we mean by safe. Safe from what? Safe for what? Safe for whom? At what cost, and who pays? Who decides what safe means? Is it the bureaucrats? Is it the scientists? The answer in money terms is simply&#x2014;a lot.<lb/>
The big question to legislators is: can a European directive be equally operative from Portugal to the Po valley? There is of course in all this a need for flexibility and common sense. To balance farming and further demands for land use in the countryside is, I believe, the most important and demanding task we face. We have to look at the development of rural society in two ways. The first concerns the living standards for all those for whom the countryside is a home and a workplace, farmers and non-farmers alike. We must remember that life in the vast majority of rural areas has been shaped by agriculture. This means that rural areas must adapt to the rapid changes occurring in agriculture. The European structures policy is designed to do this, covering not only purely farming interests but the non-agricultural income-earning activities which are open to farmers.<lb/>
Perhaps the second way of looking at rural society involves seeing the countryside as a vital part of the Community's geographical area. It means making the countryside accessible to the urban population, as well as recognising the role the countryside plays in the environmental balance. In this context, all the European Community's policy-making must take account of the importance of rural development. In monitoring the laws of supply and demand in the food market we must distinguish between those able to cope with reforms and those who through no fault of their own are unable to do so. The policy therefore has to be designed to help them adapt to new conditions
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0286"/>
<col>493</col>
and to help older farmers who so wish to hand over their farms to younger men and women who are perhaps more prepared to take up the challenge.<lb/>
I have a vision of people in the not too distant future working a 30-hour week for 30 weeks of the year. If that vision becomes a reality, then the growth industry will inevitably be the leisure industry. The rural areas of Britain can provide the facilities, but as David Bellamy said recently:
<quote>"Hotel owners and others involved in the tourism business should contribute towards the cost of looking after the countryside&#x2014;calling for urgent action if we are to avoid loving our countryside to death".</quote>
If faith is to be restored among the rural society in the countryside, as indicated so clearly in the report of my noble friend Lord Prior, following the initiative of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury we would do well to recommend action on the report so ably presented by my noble friend Lord Middleton.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03488">6.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03489"><member>The Duke of Somerset</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too rise as a member of the sub-committee that produced this report. I feel that the document under discussion produced by the commission is to be warmly welcomed. Today's debate on the Select Committee report occurs at a most appropriate time when the worldwide debate on GATT and public concern for the countryside are reaching a crescendo. As the report makes clear, the commission's initiative is a good start but it needs flesh added to it and it needs objectives clarified. It is significant that the EC finds it difficult to agree its own negotiating position in Uruguay.<lb/>
Agriculture is still the heart pump for the rural areas of the EC, all 80 per cent. of it, and the 50 per cent. of people who work and live therein. Even in the UK where agricultural sophistication has meant that farming touches upon a low percentage of the population, it causes the electorate concern where their aspirations for the beauty of the countryside are affected.<lb/>
A typical economist's view of any rural problem might be to consider abandoning agriculture to market forces. The reasoning for this embraces a wider political concept as well as that of a market economy. We believe that some third world countries are close to obtaining nuclear weapons. Perhaps in future the only way to stop them being used for territorial gain is for the developed countries to make third world countries more prosperous thus avoiding internal coups d'etat. In other words, they must improve their agriculture and primary industries.<lb/>
Thus the EC must, in the greater interest, give up any protectionist policies, such as for agriculture, to pacify these threatening countries. Of course, the result will be a slow dereliction over about the next 20 years with recreation being an important user of the land. I find it interesting to note that in the summary of the commission's paper, paragraph 2 at the back of the report refers to recreation and leisure.<lb/>
<col>494</col>
Is this the future that we want? We must not allow our greed for short-term profits to permit the sale of nuclear materials to such countries. Likewise, we must develop a policy to retain a viable rural economy while changing to an open market that is properly regulated throughout the Community.<lb/>
I am most taken by the mission of Rural Voice from which I quote:
<quote>"We look to the maintenance or creation of rural communities which have a measure of social mix &#x2026; in order to nurture that communal self-help without which very heavy financial burdens must fall on the statutory social services".</quote>
The management of supply in agriculture is not a success. Set aside has not been an environmental panacea nor will it reduce cereal outputs because of biotechnology improvements. Quotas have produced divisions of interest and reduced prospects for new entrants. They will inevitably ossify the industry. On the other hand, we do not wish to give up this country's efficiency and competitiveness which has been achieved by nearly 40 years of restructuring and investment. Let us make the most of our advantages and expertise.<lb/>
It is the smaller producers with, say, under 30 hectares that are most favoured by supply management. Paragraph 250 of the report rejects the concept of the family farm for policy purposes. As the CLA states, an open market is not inconsistent with a supportive market. Producers in the UK expect similar levels of support as in any other country and as allowed under GATT. A case in point is the hill farmers and those in the marginal areas. To my mind it is vital that those in the UK are aided by the raising of HLCA and extending the ESA. Environmental incentives are now allowed and should be incorporated into these provisions.<lb/>
The imminent decline of communities in these hill areas epitomises what could happen throughout the rural areas if a proper and sensible policy in the CAP and GATT is not achieved. To illustrate this, I wish to comment on one or two of the detailed points covered in the report. These are topics that we need to get right if an open market policy is to work. The greatest of these, to my mind and the minds of other noble Lords, appears to be rural housing. It may well be that the number of times the subject has been mentioned in this debate reflects the importance that noble Lords attach to it. However, I am afraid that I do not share the Minister's confidence in this matter. Rural housing is not such a pressing problem elsewhere in the Community. Second homes in the countryside do not hold the same appeal for Romans and other Continentals as they hold for British people.<lb/>
I wish to pick up the point of the Housing Corporation's desire to have 1500 rural dwellings built a year. As we have heard, the present rate of building is 300 to 400 houses per year. Even the upper figure of 400 per year will not go very far to satisfy the need for housing that exists over the length and breadth of the countryside. The Minister talked about surveys. A figure was given which tallies with the figure I have. The organisation Action with Communities in Rural England estimates that the rural shortfall is of the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0287"/>
<col>495</col>
order of 23,000 to 37,000 dwellings. Are the Government aware of the size of the need for rural housing? Will the funds that have recently been announced be adequate to meet the need? Further, will the Minister say why local authorities are not allowed to spend more than 25 per cent. of their sale receipts from council houses in assisting in the provision of social housing? The report highlights that factor as a major problem. I hope we can be reassured that the Government will address that problem.<lb/>
A point of concern that is of equal importance to the one I have just referred to is the environment and planning controls. Positive management which produces environmental benefits needs to be paid for. That management has been established under the environmentally sensitive areas scheme and in Part VII of the Environmental Protection Act. Those measures represent a start and they are good news. The Country Landowners' Association's environmental land management scheme and the Countryside Commission's "menu" scheme can be adopted Community wide. However, the negative effect of any increased planning controls in the countryside would not encourage entrepreneurship or the much vaunted diversification.<lb/>
The reorganisation of local government funding has thrown up a real crisis for village shops and post offices which are a lifeline in remote rural areas. The combined effect of the unified business rate and the personal charge is seriously threatening their viability and thus their continued operation. In my local village the unified business rate alone is almost twice the level of the former rates. In Suffolk a survey has revealed that increases of up to 235 per cent. have been levied. That figure will, of course, be reduced by the five year transitional arrangements but it still represents an increase of 37 per cent. this year. Most of the increases levied in that county are three-figure increases but admittedly one or two of the increases are as low as 8 per cent. However, a storekeeper then has to add to those expenses the cost of at least one personal charge, or more if he is married. The result is that a grocery and post office business comes near to losing its viability. Any closures of such businesses are devastating to a remote village without public transport. The Government must view that matter as a problem. I would be keen to hear how they will tackle it, or will it just be put to one side? Petrol forecourts and pubs are assessed on a profitability or turnover basis. Could this not be extended to the shops I have mentioned?<lb/>
Forestry is frequently mentioned as a good rural alternative to pure farming but it again suffers from a similar malady to that I have already mentioned and that is a lack of sufficient funding to make it a good starter. The prospect in two-and-a-half years' time of maintenance grants which are subject to the ravages of inflation is not encouraging and neither is a determination to avoid planting the much needed softwoods in England to feed the established processing sector. Without adequate rabbit, squirrel and deer control, the envisaged hardwood forests will not materialise. The shortfall that exists between
<col>496</col>
actual planting and the Government's targets is an adequate demonstration of the loss of confidence in this industry.<lb/>
The report touches on the subject of energy and the potential for renewable raw materials. Even now exciting experiments are being conducted to try to run diesel engines on raw rapeseed oil, apparently without any modifications. However, I gather that the engine life is fairly limited. Nevertheless the Brazilians have used alcohol as a substitute for petrol for a number of years. In view of the current price of oil surely there is plenty of scope for research into alternative diesel fuels. I wonder whether the Government have any information on that matter.<lb/>
Finally, I wish to encourage the Commission to develop training and educational facilities for the young. That point is emphasised in the report. I hope the Government will act upon it. Since the Second World War the UK has been a leader in Europe on matters of agriculture. Let us not squander that advantage but go into Europe and lead the way in adapting land and rural communities to present needs and constrictions. We have roughed out a basic framework but many of the schemes need a little more financial help to enable them to succeed. That is a better way than overt price support. I hope I may join the chairman of the sub-committee, the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, in thanking all of those who have helped in one way or another in facilitating the production of this report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03491"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I speak as a member of the Select Committee. The noble Duke, the Duke of Somerset, was also a member. I wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, for the splendid way in which he chaired the committee. The committee's affairs aroused enormous interest. We met a large number of people and many people expressed their views. Those views are all recorded in the report. That is vitally important. We are very much indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, for the way he handled the report.<lb/>
I wish to assure the noble Baroness, Lady White, that the interests of Wales coincide very much with those of Scotland. Although the only member of the committee who was a Welsh farmer was the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, a great many of the committee members knew about Wales and about farming in Wales. I live in a very beautiful area which is considered to be one of the less favoured areas. I appreciate that Wales has the same problems as those present in my area. Therefore the problems of Wales were continually before us and I wish to reassure the noble Baroness that we were concerned about agriculture in Wales.<lb/>
The important point that has come out of the report and this debate concerns the diversity of agricultural areas. It would be useless to have one general policy for all farming methods. The variety of farming methods has been and must continue to be recognised and catered for in any agricultural policy. I wish to mention five of the matters that the report
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0288"/>
<col>497</col>
considered as they outline what is needed. First, it is important to maintain the potential of the countryside as the public wish it to be maintained. However, that process must be carried out within the economic constraints that exist. The public, after all, enjoy the rural areas and they would be disappointed if those areas ceased to exist. It is not just agriculturalists who wish to preserve the countryside.<lb/>
Secondly, it is important that the right produce is provided to ensure that employment is maintained in rural areas. Money must be invested to provide for the production materials and methods that are needed. In my opinion agriculture represents a good investment. Money invested in it is not wasted. It is not a matter of throwing money away but rather of investing it in something that will produce what the ordinary consumer needs. I believe that is important.<lb/>
Thirdly, we must provide the right social conditions. The quality of life would then be as good in rural areas as it is in towns, or even better. We must not remove schools from rural areas. Rural children want to be educated in their home areas. Housing has been dealt with by a great many speakers so I shall not mention the subject other than to endorse what they said. There is also a need for doctors and pharmaceutical services in rural areas. No doubt many of your Lordships have received very interesting letters from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain urging that facilities for doctors and patients should be available in rural societies. Transport is also very important. Although nowadays many people have motor cars there are still some people who need to use buses and a bus service is therefore essential. Post offices are also vital. In my opinion, those needs are still with us and require to be supported. Opportunities for young people to learn about agriculture and rural activities are also of great importance.<lb/>
It is important to maintain the attractive aspects of rural areas&#x2014;landscapes and buildings, access to rural beauty spots and rural walks. All of those come into the picture. Although they do not necessarily involve production, they create the atmosphere and scenery which attract people from other parts of the country.<lb/>
The rural environment should be protected from ugly developments or uses which conflict with rural landscapes and interests. I had a shattering experience in my own area while I was still a member of the county council. There was a proposal to rebuild the county offices and the plans were put out to competition. We selected a very nice building which would have been most suitable. However, the Royal Institute of British Architects was involved and chose another building which is absolutely hideous. Every time I go past it I can hardly bear it. It was built not at the will of the rural population but at the will of the architects. I have never forgiven them.<lb/>
In modern times development in country villages means the integration of people who work in towns or in industry but who want to live in a village. The integration of different ways of life can be difficult but it is not impossible. In my village&#x2014;where I have lived
<col>498</col>
for 50 years or more&#x2014;there are now a great many people who work in towns. Although that has created problems they have been largely overcome. That is due to the voluntary organisations. I am very enthusiastic about the voluntary organisations in rural areas such as the Women's Institutes, youth clubs and sports clubs, which can bring people together in their spare time. Village halls and clubs are a great help. It is important to approach the problem with an open mind and see how the interests of urban dwellers coming into rural areas can be assimilated to the benefit of all.<lb/>
Members of your Lordships' House have spoken about finance. Without help from the department or the EC, agriculture would be in a very poor way. If farming is to continue in less favoured areas&#x2014;which are usually the most beautiful &#x2014;it is essential that there should be some income support. Unless that continues farms in by far the greatest proportion of land will go out of production. In Scotland almost 80 per cent. of farms are in less favoured areas and the figure for Wales is similar. That assistance is not expenditure; it is an investment. It ensures that the countryside stays beautiful, it provides jobs and means that people take an interest in the countryside, and people from urban areas can also enjoy it.<lb/>
If we did not have that support those areas would become wildernesses. I believe that that would also apply in Europe. I do not know what the situation is in Europe, but I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, with great interest. I believe that the same applies with regard to less favoured areas in Europe, which would also become derelict without support. The noble Lord, Lord Mackie, spoke about the Highlands and Islands, and we all know how important it is that help should be given there.<lb/>
Diversification is very much part of the picture, but it is difficult to carry out in less favoured areas where the only diversification appears to be in forestry. No income is generated by trees until they are felled, and that takes 30 to 40 years at least. I believe that the theory of alternative production in vast areas of the country simply will not work. If one does not want those areas to become derelict they have to be given support.<lb/>
Some farmers living near urban areas have diversified into other activities which are possible because they are near urban areas. For example, they sell farm produce or open small restaurants attached to their farms so that people from the towns can buy fruit or vegetables or have a meal. However, that will pay only if the farmer is near to customers, and that is not always the case.<lb/>
Nothing can be done without some financial aid. Financial support will keep down the price of food to the consumer, save the countryside from dereliction and help the preservation of country areas to the benefit of everyone, not only farmers. I hope very much that the Government will appreciate that and develop an agricultural policy which will really help farmers.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03492">6.37 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03493"><member>The Earl of Selborne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Select Committee report and many of the speeches this afternoon have referred to the changing face of agriculture. One of the problems is that we do not really know to what extent agriculture is changing. We know that it is changing but the implications are not clear. The Select Committee report points to conflicting evidence about the acreage that will go out of production in this country.<lb/>
The opportunity that a changing situation provides to influence the change in ways which are seen to be favourable to wider interests than agriculture alone also provides the opportunity to consider the objectives that government or CAP support should be trying to achieve. One of the problems is that in the past five to 10 years, since the times of surpluses, we have assumed much of the very real progress made since 1947 and the enlightened Agriculture Act. We have tended to underestimate the great advantages and take them for granted. As a result, there have been criticisms of the technological advances which have made that possible. It reminds me of the analogy of the internal combustion engine: we see it as something that we could not manage without and yet we are all too quick to criticise its implications for our society at large.<lb/>
Clearly the technological developments which have made that dramatic improvement in the ability not just of this country or of Western Europe but of the world as a whole to feed itself have also resulted in damage to the environment and landscape which we now have the opportunity to address. I regard that as almost fine tuning compared with the great objectives of the Agriculture Act 1947 and of the common agricultural policy, of which the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, spoke.<lb/>
Damage to wildlife habitats, pollution of waterways, overgrazing of uplands and the appearance of prairies are some of the subjects mentioned in the evidence to the Select Committee. I believe that the Government's attempts to give such support as remains&#x2014;clearly there will be much less support than we have been used to&#x2014;to achieve some environmental advantage in these respects are wholly to be welcomed. But there is a danger that we may be carried away by what I consider to be peripheral issues. Extensification is no doubt highly desirable for a number of farms. Management agreements for conservation for leisure will also be desirable in many instances to help meet and redress the balance of demands on the countryside.<lb/>
Nevertheless, agriculture, which in many areas may not employ a great number of people, has the largest influence on the appearance of the landscape. The core business of agriculture is food production. It must not be forgotten that if one is to have the landscape and a rural community which is reasonably balanced, one simply cannot afford to allow the core business of food production to be put dramatically at risk.<lb/>
From these Benches at least it is clear that we must accept that in the future we shall not receive the
<col>500</col>
generous support given by the Agriculture Act 1947 nor that of the common agricultural policy. The intervention of my noble friend Lady Trumpington, when she asked the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, whether he had taken note of Australia and New Zealand, reminds us that those are countries which, for better or worse, have experienced dramatic withdrawal of support from their agricultural producers. They have to manage, sometimes better and sometimes worse, in a very harsh economic climate. I fear that we shall be expected to live in that climate if we are to continue with agriculture in this country. We shall not like it but we shall not receive a very sympathetic response from either the Government or much of urban society if we bleat too loudly about it.<lb/>
I do not think that the implications for the countryside are entirely understood by society as a whole. But it must at least be understood that if this country is to have a dynamic agricultural industry which can continue to do its core business of providing safe food at economic cost and agricultural systems which are environmentally friendly, as well as take due account of the landscape and animal welfare considerations, it will all amount to a new definition of efficient farming, which presupposes that the food can be produced in competition with other sources of supply.<lb/>
If the hypothesis is accepted that we shall not receive the support for which we might otherwise have hoped, we shall have to implement new technology, exactly as we have done in the past. Our industry is technology driven. It is extremely responsive to new technology. I emphatically deny that new technology implies desecration of the landscape or the submersion of valid rural interests at the price of unacceptable farming practices. Indeed, much new technology is seen to be extremely friendly and clean; for example, the implementation of biotechnology to reduce the use of chemical pesticides and nitrogen fixing plants for reducing nitrates which leach into the water supplies.<lb/>
Society, which has such a large say in planning regulation, should understand that if it requires a well-balanced rural economy, in which balance food production will remain an important part, that industry cannot be fossilised. One cannot do as the commission suggested in one part of its support system; namely, to give income aid to the family farm because it consists of family farmers. That is simply to deny the basis of dynamic growth in the industry and competitive agriculture. I do not say that family farms are not desirable. Indeed they are; but I find unacceptable the basis of giving income support to the family as opposed to giving income support to food production.<lb/>
I turn to a subject that has been widely touched upon by other speakers in this debate; namely, rural housing. I participated in a rural housing scheme in our village of Selborne in Hampshire. No doubt the House will accept that both reports recognise that low-cost housing in rural areas is in many ways the key to achieving the balance for which we all strive. I have experience of a village which has a very high
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0290"/>
<col>501</col>
proportion of expensive houses and a population which feels that the next generation will find it extremely difficult to remain in the area. We were able to identify a piece of land which was on the edge of the village but outside the village structure plan and therefore had agricultural value and little else. By use of the Section 52 agreement restricting use of any housing on that site to people who lived or worked in the parish, or failing that in the neighbouring parishes, and by canvassing widely (a poll was conducted by the parish council), we were able to obtain support from the very people who otherwise might have been expected to be hostile to the proposal. I must add that there was strong support from the district and parish councils, which in many ways led the project.<lb/>
We took a brief from the National Agriculture Centre Housing Trust. The pioneering work of the Rank Foundation in starting that organisation at Stoneleigh and nursing it through to the present day deserves some recognition. East Hampshire District Council was extremely supportive, not just in its role as planning authority but also, when it came to the rented accommodation which consisted of about half the houses provided, by making the funding possible. Accepting that this is one method of helping&#x2014;and clearly rented accommodation is something which will always need funding support from some source&#x2014;I add my plea to those of others to the effect that where there are balances held by housing authorities, those housing authorities should be allowed to spend a larger proportion of them on social housing.<lb/>
I leave that subject aside and turn to owner-occupier shared ownership housing. I should like to point out that it is not necessary to have any government support at all in financial terms. Obviously it does not provide the cheapest low income family support. Nevertheless, it provides support for families who might have a joint income of, say, &#x00A3;10,000. On such an income one can raise a mortgage of &#x00A3;35,000 to &#x00A3;40,000. That is the cost in the South East of building a house when the land comes in at either a low or nil value. It is possible to find such land. It is already held within the community by local authorities, landowners (who will perhaps accept nomination rights as a contribution rather than funding), charities and other organisations.<lb/>
Perhaps we may all agree that the key to so many problems in rural communities may be found by identifying the way in which one can provide low-cost housing. Very often the key may already be in those communities. I believe that if each parish council took upon itself first of all to canvass for need and then to try to identify the simple pieces of land, it might itself be able to solve the problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03494">6.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03495"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great pleasure to speak after the noble Earl, Lord Selborne. We all know his contribution to agriculture over the years. There is no point in labouring the points that he made, which I had intended to raise as well. This is the first time that he has spoken in this House since he recently received his nice award. I am sure that the House will
<col>502</col>
want to congratulate him on it. I am sorry that an accident prevented me from being present at the award.<lb/>
Like other noble Lords, I must compliment the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, and his committee as well as the staff who produced this report. If the size of it is anything to go by, they deserve tremendous praise.<lb/>
When I consider a report that is to be debated I pick out one or two of a small number of conclusions and speak on those. However, I met the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, in the corridor late last night. We discussed the report for a minute or two. We both agreed that with 33 conclusions there were a little too many for us to speak on them all.<lb/>
I must apologise to the Church. I did not know &#x2014;I somehow missed the reference in the Order Paper &#x2014;that we are also discussing the report of the Archbishops' commission. The noble Earl, Lord Radnor, reminded me of that. I obtained the report and found that there were 47 conclusions. I have thumbed through the report. It is first class. It contains a tremendous amount of information. I believe that it is worthy of a debate on its own, not taken together with the other report, a point that I believe my noble kinsman made earlier.<lb/>
I wish to deal with three aspects: housing, diversification and taking land out of production. I refer to housing first. I should like to continue the quotation from Rural Voice, to which the noble Duke referred. It states:
<quote>"in which people with roots, and in particular with jobs, in their locality can find housing there whatever their income".</quote>
That is very true. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, has emphasised the point, as have many other speakers. The most reverend Primate the Archbishop also emphasised housing.<lb/>
Over a long period I have lived or worked in five different areas of the country&#x2014;in two parishes in my native county of Aberdeenshire, in Kincardineshire, in Lincolnshire, where I now live which is 20 miles from where we sit in this House. In the first four areas the picture is roughly the same. The mobility of the population by car, bus, train and so on, has made surrounding villages and small towns available to live in. In some cases new and different populations have taken over, much to the detriment of the local people with regard to housing.<lb/>
The village of Tarves, 16 miles from Aberdeen, is now three to four times bigger than it was when I was a boy some 70 years ago. That is a tremendous difference. It is due to the development of the oil industry at Aberdeen. The village has become accessible for those working in Aberdeen, although it is 16 miles away. There is a good road to travel back and forth to work in Aberdeen. In addition, the amalgamation of farms and the selling off of farm cottages and farm houses means that one has a totally different community than the original rural set-up.<lb/>
I farm in Lincolnshire. People are moving into houses at prices way beyond the rural population's income. I was interested in what the noble Earl, Lord
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0291"/>
<col>503</col>
Selborne, said about housing associations and the obtaining of land at an agricultural price. I am sure that we shall hear from the noble Lord, Lord Prior, on that subject. In some areas, in particular where I live now, the price of the land is almost equal to the price of the cost of building a house on it.<lb/>
Nazeing, where I live, is a different story. Nazeing was a village straggling along the border of Hertfordshire almost up to the new town of Harlow. The area next to Hertfordshire has developed into a small town with well over 5,000 inhabitants in the past 35 years since I came down here. However, it has left a rural area to the east with a small hamlet at its centre. It rejoices in the name of Bumble's Green. (I suggested to the gentleman who deals with titles that I should rather like to be the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Bumble's Green, but he did not think it suitable. However, that is by the way). In this area there is no question of farms being amalgamated. Any land with a reasonable house, or a house that can be developed, which comes on to the market, is bought by the yuppies, about whom we spoke a little yesterday.<lb/>
Council houses are bought, done up and sold at ridiculous prices. That is happening too much. Other than the few remaining council houses, there is hardly any low-cost housing in the village. The demand is quite extraordinary. At the bottom of our farm road, well off the public main road, is an old house in a very nice position, facing west. It is far enough off the road to be private. An elderly widow lives there. She is nearly 100. One would hardly believe the number of people who make inquiries about the house. It is a nice house for someone like that lady. Without a shadow of doubt it will be bought for some ridiculous price.<lb/>
To illustrate the point about the increase in the value of houses, my two neighbouring farmers have managed to raise &#x00A3;3 million and are building a golf course. I am not against that, but nonetheless I am not sure that many farmers could attain such diversification.<lb/>
Before my farming career, I built 16 new houses and renovated 17. I counted those from memory a few moments ago; I believe the figures are about right. I should be very annoyed if I saw many of those houses being knocked together to make a four-bedroomed, two-bathroomed detached house&#x2014;as someone described earlier&#x2014;completely out of the reach of ordinary people.<lb/>
Like other noble Lords, I can see no solution to the problem. I prefer the building of council housing. I cannot envisage ordinary developers coming into the market and producing low-cost houses, as I believe the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, mentioned. I very much agree with the noble Duke, the Duke of Somerset, that 1,500 houses is a fleabite when considering the demand. I believe that we should stop selling council houses. Far too many such arrangements are being made. I know of two families who have bought houses for their parents. I do not like to say that they are waiting for their parents to die, but there is no question that, as soon as the parents go, the houses will be renovated to a standard beyond council housing and sold at a fantastic price. I know others
<col>504</col>
who have done that. A house that was bought for less then &#x00A3;10,000 fetched &#x00A3;120,000 to &#x00A3;130,000 the other day. The selling of council houses should cease.<lb/>
I turn to diversification. That can bye done only by people who live in areas which are largely populated. We have diversified into a riding school and, as we are in a green belt area, after much persuasion we have been allowed by the council to let buildings to small industries. We have two sets of joiners and one set of gardeners occupying buildings that we no longer need. Diversification must be watched carefully and too good a gloss should not be put on it because farmers may enter into projects which will lose money. Frankly, there is a good deal of money to be made in merely letting buildings to small businesses, as we have done, rather than diversifying into something when you know nothing about the job.<lb/>
I wish to raise the issue of taking land out of production; that is set-aside, and so forth. Today there are 1,000 million people out of the world's population of 6,000 million who have a very poor diet. According to FAO figures, about 400 million people are starving. I have seen reliable figures which show that population control has failed, and it is estimated that by 2030 the world's population will be between 8,000 million and 10,000 million. Those people must be fed properly. Sir Kenneth Blaxter, Director of the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, wrote an article which I have quoted to the House previously. It was published in <i>The Lancet.</i> He pointed out that in order to feed that number of people properly, every present unit of agricultural production must be increased two and a half times. That should make the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, think about what he will do in the future in order to achieve that figure. We must be careful not to take too much land out of agriculture because the future may hold different needs, and in any event the surpluses are a flea bite.<lb/>
At present we have the RDC, the HIDB and the DBRW. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, read a long list of committees, and so forth, and some form of co-ordination is necessary if we are to save the countryside. I cannot say how it should be done; but there are far too many bodies and some form of co-ordination should be tried.<lb/>
I wish to comment upon what was said by my two friends on the Liberal Benches, the noble Lords, Lord Hooson and Lord Walston. The noble Lord, Lord Hooson, made a strong plea for agriculture, and I think he overdid it a little. The noble Lord, Lord Walston, went the other way, and he overdid it a little, too. On the whole, I favour the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, and I hope that the Government will take note of his comments.</membercontribution></p>

<col>505</col>
honourable and honourable friends about the extra expenditure being allowed for the Countryside Commission. That has been most gratefully received.<lb/>
Having listened to the debate, I come down on the side of a prosperous agriculture. I do not say that it is the only activity in the country but a great deal in rural areas depends on the prosperity of agriculture. Of course we must have various forms of industry and diversification, but perhaps there is one issue about which we can all agree: have we not reached saturation point with craft shops?<lb/>
A great deal of comment has been made this afternoon about rural housing. Some of the people who must take the blame are the planners. I recently had some land which was available for housing. I decided that I did not want maximum profits but wanted the land to be made available for low-cost starter housing. The matter went before the planning committee, and the next thing I saw were headlines in the local paper stating, "Greedy Earl wishes to build maximum number of houses on acreage"; and "Lord out to screw maximum profits by putting up jerry-built houses". Quite honestly, that is a bit annoying. Perhaps I feel a little bitter but even before then I believed that some of the restrictions which the planners put on areas that were right for development were unnecessary. I am sure that some areas of the country could be opened up for low-cost housing.<lb/>
I wish to comment on education. That has hardly been mentioned in the debate. I was glad to see that <i>Faith in the Countryside</i> does not fall into what I see as a trap by stating that the decline in the English village is due to the fact that the school has been closed. We hear a great deal of that. The report made some good points about the size of a school not necessarily influencing the quality of education. I agree with that. However, a great deal has been said about village society collapsing because the primary school has been closed.<lb/>
During the late 1960s and early 1970s I was involved with the old North Riding County Council in a plan to try to improve village schools by closing some, enlarging others and combining schools. After about five years we carried out a survey to discover the effect that had had on village populations. We found that there had been no effect whatever. We found that in some villages where we had closed the primary school numbers had increased. We found that often where we had erected a newer and better primary school numbers had dropped. We found that in villages which allegedly had good primary schools numbers had not increased. In one village where we closed the primary school there was later so much housing development that after five years we had to build a brand new school. Therefore, the suggestion is a red herring, and I was glad to see that it had been avoided in the report.<lb/>
I shall be brief because virtually everything I wished to say has been mentioned. However, there is a point I wish to make because I could find no reference to it in <i>Faith in the Countryside.</i> It is the part which is played in the countryside by traditional field sports. I
<col>506</col>
hope that the reason why the issue was not dealt with in the report was because there was no room for it. I hope that the Church of England is not following the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury down the road of banning hunting in National Trust areas. If the Church of England were to take that line, it would find that already dwindling populations in truly rural areas would trickle away virtually to nothing. I hope that is not the reason why the issue was not dealt with in the report.<lb/>
Traditional field sports play an enormous part in agricultural areas. At home we found that whereas the children of our tenant farmers used to come out beating for pocket money, now the farmers and their wives are doing so because they rely on the income. I found no reference to the matter in the report of the EC committee, although I found an excellent written submission by the Game Conservancy on page 366. In dealing with tourism it stated:
<quote>"We are encouraged to think that the Commission would recognise within this context the value of (properly conducted) game shooting and other field sports, particularly in view of their additional benefit as a stimulus to conservation.</quote>
<quote>In Brussels on 20th November 1989, staff of DGVI told us that shooting game was to be recognised in the interpretation of Regulation 2052 of 24/6/88, in the less favoured rural areas. Game shooting was specifically favoured as promoting employment, additional farm income, the hotel industry, etc."</quote>
What encouraged me most was the final paragraph:
<quote>"Rather than providing game shooting simply by releasing reared birds, as envisaged in Spain and parts of France, we would prefer inducements to habitat management and a relaxation of the CAP policies which have reduced wild game populations to the point where they cannot realistically be harvested. The end results would be the same economically but with our approach the environment would benefit".</quote>
I thought that that was most encouraging and I was sorry to see that the committee of my noble friend came up with no references on that.<lb/>
I was delighted that the Government have sent back to the European Commission their ridiculous ideas that wood pigeons and corvidae should have a protected season. This discouraged me a bit because, if that is the sort of nonsense that they send over in the first place, I do not have a lot of faith in them doing very well for our rural areas.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03499"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sat on the committee and, as others did, I should like to compliment my noble friend Lord Middleton on the careful way he steered us through an immensely complex subject. I should also like to congratulate the Church on, I would almost say, its novel. It is a complex subject. That is borne out, as the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, said, by the immense amount of conclusions there are when you add the two reports together, although there is a tremendous cross-over. It shows clearly that there is no straight answer to any of the problems that are upon us. It also shows, as my noble friend Lord Selborne said, that there is no way of quantifying matters such as how much land will go out of cultivation and what effect that will have.<lb/>
Having said that, I must take to task the noble Baroness, Lady White&#x2014;I am sorry that she is not in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0293"/>
<col>507</col>
her place&#x2014;who I think treated my noble friend a little unfairly by suggesting that we did not take too much notice of Wales. Now that she knows that I am not Welsh I am sure that she would not mind my saying this. In point of fact we had a mass of written evidence. I remember particularly that the Welsh idea for dealing with these mountainous areas which are obviously going to be in trouble, the sheep farming areas, was different from the Scots idea. The Welsh had this theory of sub-poles, whereby everyone was within distance of somewhere where work might be found. Of course I say all this advisedly.<lb/>
I felt at the time, and I still feel, that it is immensely important that some of these smaller farmers should become part-time farmers, and in this might lie some of the answers for Wales. Because of the way they are thinking of doing it, I can see farmers finding work off the farm, perhaps getting less favoured area grants and keeping their farms in their ownership at the same time.<lb/>
I was also immensely pleased to see in the first words of the preface of the Church's document a suggestion made of what Cobbett would see if he came down to earth again. It happens that Cobbett, though a radical, was a great friend of one of my forebears. In my garden and park there are still the trees that Cobbett brought back from America and gave to him because he preferred the American trees and thought them much more beautiful than the English ones.<lb/>
This is not just a passing remark, as my noble friend Lady Trumpington will realise. I am not sure of Cobbett's dates, but it will impress upon her once more that it takes an extraordinarily long time to grow a tree. As a number of people have said already, it will take a long time to get the money. Therefore, as an alternative to farming&#x2014;and I have always felt that it would be the best alternative&#x2014;there must be more funding than there is now, notwithstanding the maintenance grants that come in in 1992 and notwithstanding the prolificacy of grants, which confuses a number of us, that are in force now. Actually the funding is not quite enough. If more is not forthcoming a great opportunity to employ people in the country and to help to deal with this downturn in farming will be missed, and that would be a pity.<lb/>
I should like to touch on the GATT round. It puts the fear of God into everyone. Whether that is because it apparently takes place in Uruguay or not I do not know. But from the point of view of farming, if they accept what has been agreed within the Community I think that a large number of farmers will not find unattainable what they are expected to do. The feeling that I get in the country, admittedly among the larger and better farmers&#x2014;and I am not talking about Wales or the Highlands: I am talking about what I call more orthodox farming land&#x2014;is that if it does not get much worse than that, then a surprising number of people will be able to go on farming probably more extensively. I see nothing wrong in that, and the priority of my noble friend Lord Swinton might in a large part be satisfied throughout the country.<lb/>
On the other hand, as my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham insinuated yesterday in the economics
<col>508</col>
debate, it is quite probable that what we have accomplished and are so proud of in Europe at the moment, this 30 per cent. over 10 years, some of which has been eroded already, will certainly not please the Cairns group and will not please America, although they have a lot of subsidies hidden away themselves.<lb/>
If things go against the farming world there will be two major surpluses. One will be land and the other will be unemployed people&#x2014;not a huge number, but people who will probably be quite difficult to relocate. It is worth thinking for a moment or two of what would happen to those two resources if they were, so to speak, shot out onto the market.<lb/>
I have covered diversification. I do not think that anything except trees is of vast importance. I would not think that tourism could be taken any further than it has been, and certainly I agree that we do not want any more farm shops. There is one thing that has not been mentioned a great deal, and that is that farmers, either through the ELMS idea of the Country Landowners' Association or from Government, should be paid to keep the countryside beautiful. I think that is probably the right way to put it.<lb/>
Here, may I be allowed to be the Devil's advocate and tell a tale? Who in the world is going to decide on the priorities, and who in the world is going to decide on what is beautiful, let alone what the payment for it should be? A farmer who is paid to beautify his farm will probably do it in a year. If you plant a tree you do not do any more than just watch it grow up inside its arbour-guard, and a lot of nature is most beautiful if you just leave it alone.<lb/>
I have a fear too that, if it is not the ELMS idea but is essentially funded as grants or funded from the Community, it might well become a bureaucratic nightmare, and I have two anecdotes to recount. The first is connected with planting trees. They are personal experiences. I should probably declare my interest, as should many other noble Lords; we all have a stake in the countryside in some way or other.<lb/>
I felled some oak trees which were useless. They were what we call shaken, and were unsaleable and no good. I cleared it with the powers-that-be to be allowed to plant a species that were suitable for the soil. That species was Scots pine, because the land is silver sand. That set the cat among the pigeons. A number of quite highly paid people from the Forestry Commission came down and we discussed the matter in the office. There were three of them. We then went to the site and looked at it. The answer came back, "No. You must go on as we said before". We objected and that was passed on to some other committee. That committee met on the site and no doubt off the site. I expect letters have been flying to and fro, but nothing whatever has happened.<lb/>
That bit of wood is three acres in size. It is sunk in the middle of another bit of wood. Almost nobody goes by or sees it. If that scenario can happen on that small scale, what will happen when grants are given to people to beautify their farms and keep them nice? I believe it will be an absolute nightmare.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0294"/>
<col>509</col>
Before I conclude I should like to mention the people. I live in Salisbury, in the South of England. The people in the village are now quite different from those who were there even just after the war. The so-called incomers have come in and settled. Agricultural workers are also there, but in much smaller numbers. The noble Lord, Lord Walston, has had to leave. He pointed out why people came from the towns to the country. The only point on which I disagree with him is that he said it was to avoid the smell. In my experience, when they arrive in the country&#x2014;I live in a district where stock rearing is common&#x2014;they do not much like the smell there either.<lb/>
When one tries to organise alternative employment &#x2014;workshops, small factories, and so on&#x2014;there tends to be considerable resistance. That is precisely what those people left the towns to avoid. My noble kinsman, Lord Shuttleworth, who spoke so ably and whose offices are in Salisbury, must work tremendously hard. He has not yet knocked on my door and asked for lunch or anything like that.<lb/>
I sold, subject to planning permission, a small workshop which could probably accommodate only three people. The sale fell through. It was to be a fishing-rod maker, a nice rural pastime. As far as I know, the Rural Development Commission was delighted with the purchase. I felt I was to receive my pound of flesh. But the planners said, "That cannot be". The reason they said no was that people who were not concerned with agriculture, who went to Salisbury, Bournemouth and Southampton to work, had organised a petition. They delivered it to the planners and the planners capitulated, as they did with the trees. We appealed, and we hope for the best.<lb/>
I have spoken long enough. My sincere hope is that agriculture will persist. If it does not, we shall be in trouble. We shall be left behind in every way. In the event, people who feel that farmers are ruining the country will regret that feeling. They will see that, perhaps by accident or because they want to make money, farmers have enhanced it vastly more than they have spoilt it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03501"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury most kindly asked me to serve on the Commission on Rural Areas. Sadly, I had to decline. At that time I was helping with a member of my family who was seriously ill, and who has since died. Also, I was very involved with the health service and other commitments. I should have been most interested, and if I had been able to accept there would perhaps have been more mention of some of the needs of disabled people living in the countryside.<lb/>
On page 110 the report <i>Faith in the Countryside,</i> when discussing transport, says:
<quote>"For those who are physically handicapped the problem of mobility is a double burden".</quote>
The report states that 11 per cent. of the population has some form of immobilising disability. However, a
<col>510</col>
very high percentage has some form of arthritis&#x2014;nearly half the population. There is no doubt that Dial-a-Ride schemes would be of great help to disabled people living in the country. That is just one of the many problems facing disabled people.<lb/>
In the report <i>The Future of Rural Society,</i> I do not believe disability is mentioned at all. I shall therefore take the opportunity in this important debate to mention a few of the needs. I was born and spent a great deal of my childhood in the beautiful countryside of Caithness in the far north of Scotland. There was an abundance of wild flowers such as harebells, scabious and wild orchids. The hedgerows were full of birds such as yellow-hammers. One did not see the use of sprays and artificial fertilisers in those days. When I married and went to live in North Yorkshire I noticed the difference. Farming was far more intense and there was a lack of wild flowers in the hedgerows.<lb/>
The countryside is not always the peaceful safe haven that people believe it to be. Around Mashamshire, the area where I live, there is a high incidence of leukaemia. No one appears to know the reason. Often one hears a suspicion that it may come from sprays used for weeds, and artificial fertilisers. Also, with the recent mild winters there has been an increase in the rat population, and Weil's disease &#x2014;which is caught from rats' urine&#x2014;is a risk to farmers and vets, and perhaps anyone living in the countryside. The recent death of a farmer in North Yorkshire was attributed to Weil's disease, and farmers are advised to carry cards so that doctors recognise the risk. The disease starts with symptoms like flu.<lb/>
Living as a disabled person in a rural area involves without doubt additional costs. Costs to the general population in the countryside increase the more isolated people are. The main reasons are the long distance people must travel to shops, doctors, hospitals, schools, entertainment and railway stations, and the limited choice. A disabled person who does not own a car and may not have good family support can become extremely isolated. For one who owns a car and has problems getting in and out, opening and shutting the gates on gated roads is a great difficulty. In recent years shops which once had a delivery service no longer provide that, making even the essentials of life such as food difficult to obtain. It may not be possible to obtain a daily newspaper if there is no delivery service.<lb/>
There are many severely disabled people who only receive one visit per week from the district nurse and one visit from a home help if they are lucky. In some towns there are wonderful schemes such as the Cross Roads care attendant scheme. These do not exist in rural areas. People from towns may go to the country for a peaceful retirement but one of the partners may die, leaving the other disabled and still a newcomer not knowing the locals. It can take a long time to be accepted in a country area.<lb/>
It is a great pity that we do not have legislation making access to public buildings for disabled people compulsory. Such countries as New Zealand,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0295"/>
<col>511</col>
Australia, Canada and some states of America have such legislation, making life so much easier for disabled people. I live in a rural district and many elderly and disabled people come down from the hill farms to live in the small country town of Masham. Access is very bad. The library is on the first floor, with no lift. The post office is up several steps with no ramp. The bank has steps. The Anglican church, which I sometimes attend with my noble kinsman on ecumenical occasions, is only accessible when there is a funeral and a ramp is put down for the coffin to be brought in. The town hall, where nearly all the entertainment takes place, is on the first floor and there is no lift.<lb/>
Later this evening we are to have a debate on hospices, which deal with the care of the dying. Why should not there be some quality of life for the living in rural areas? With two important reports before us, I hope that some of your Lordships who are interested in rural matters will realise how easy it is to leave out and forget the needs of the growing population of disabled people.<lb/>
Both reports mention housing. I have at home many letters that I have received over the years from people who live in rural areas and who have become disabled but who have been refused permission to build extensions to their houses, perhaps because they are in a green belt or a national park. I ask your Lordships to place yourselves in that position for a moment. What would you do if your house was not suitable, having broken your back in an accident on your farm, or had multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, severe arthritis, a stroke, or any other disabling condition? It is frustrating to know how many people suffer when they come up against red tape and such opposition when they need suitable housing, because they are disabled and live in a rural area.<lb/>
The position can also be difficult for children who have a disability and have to choose a secondary school. Again, in a city such as Leeds there are integrated secondary schools. That is not so in a rural setting. Children might have to travel a long distance or go to a special school.<lb/>
<i>Faith in the Countryside</i> took on board the arguments about the dispensing services. The report reached the conclusion that doctors in rural practices would normally be permitted to dispense medicines. I appreciate the concern of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. On the whole, pharmacists give a very important service, especially with their independence and ability to check prescriptions to ensure that there are no errors. That is a safeguard for the public. Further, they often give advice to patients on the side effects of drugs. In rural areas, where distances can be great, both the doctor and the pharmacist should be able to cover this service for patients. I serve on the Family Health Service Authority for North Yorkshire and I expect this important matter will be watched with care.<lb/>
In my home village both doctors and pharmacists dispense and they seem to have a good working
<col>512</col>
relationship. I hope that co-operation will be worked out in other parts of rural Britain so that the best possible solution for patients is found,
I was pleased to read in <i>The Times</i> yesterday the headline:
<quote>"Rural GPs will get pay boost".</quote>
They have to travel great distances if some areas if they are to visit patients in their own homes. I hope the pay boost will give them the incentive to carry out such visits. For ill, disabled patients it is difficult to make long journeys, or sometimes even short journeys. I am pleased that Mrs. Virginia Bottomley has recognised the needs of rural GPs because they are most important to rural patients.<lb/>
I now move on to another topic altogether. Here I declare an interest. It is important to give the growing number of people who visit the country something constructive to do which will enable them to enjoy the countryside and learn about it. I have a stud of highland ponies. These ponies are very versatile and adaptable. Because of their delightful temperaments they are ideal for beginners and disabled people. They are strong, with substantial bones, so they can carry adults or young people. As well as stud I run a trekking centre. This gives a service to people who are visiting or living in the countryside.<lb/>
The breeders of native ponies are trying hard to preserve part of our heritage&#x2014;the national breeds. It is impossible to make money out of such an activity but our native breeds should be preserved at all costs. On page 20 of <i>The Future of Rural Society,</i> the Countryside Commission sums up its major concerns:
<quote>"We are all aware that the changing face of agriculture has led to questions about the future of agriculture, and the future use of rural land".</quote>
The commission says that we must move to some new mix of activities in rural areas which sustains the correct level of agricultural production. On page 25, in discussing environmental objectives, the report states that care should be taken to ensure that most land-use changes in the countryside are not irreversible. To give help to pony breeders who run riding establishments for the community's benefit would, I suggest, be a beneficial use of land not now needed for other types of farming.<lb/>
All people in the country who love and respect horses and ponies have been horrified by the thought that in 1992 the present regulations on equines going to Europe for slaughter may be lifted. Existing regulations are frequently flouted and animals, not only equines but sheep and cattle, may suffer terrible cruelty. If we are to be part of Europe, as we are, we must protect all animals in the community. The best solution would be for live animals not to travel overseas at all but to be killed as near home as possible. We have some cruel people in this country as well as in Europe and there should be very strict regulations in all European countries, overseen by the RSPCA inspectors. The regulations should be so foolproof that they cannot be flouted.<lb/>
I end on what I hope is a positive note. Recently there have been some good projects in the countryside
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0296"/>
<col>513</col>
to make country trails accessible for disabled people. A short while ago I opened one organised by the Countryside Commission. When developing projects everyone should ask the question, "Can disabled people go where you go?" Perhaps more could be done to make the countryside accessible for disabled people by using community orders as an alternative to prison. That would benefit all concerned in many different ways.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03502">7.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03503"><member>Lord Prior</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it can certainly be said that your Lordships' House is an oasis of calm discussing rural society at a time when the Lower House might be discussing more frenetic activities. I do not wish to disturb that oasis of calm, but I wish to thank those noble Lords who have been kind enough to say that the commission's report, <i>Faith in the Countryside,</i> was a useful document. I shall leave to the end of my speech my riposte to the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury.<lb/>
On the whole these are two excellent documents. I can say that about my own document. I cannot really claim parentage of it because a great many other people did a lot of work and they should take credit for it. The document produced by the Select Committee is very good. There is an abundance of information which I hope that the departments will look at carefully. I always get the impression in your Lordships' House that on the whole the departments tend to fob us off with a lot of waffle. It is time that they took these reports seriously. There is a great deal of good sense talked in this House and I do not think that the departments pay anything like enough attention to it. I hope that that message will get through.<lb/>
I have one or two other critical remarks to make later on. They will not be addressed to my noble friend on the Front Bench, who I think does a remarkably good job with very little help from the departments. I know that because in the Lower House we always regarded noble Lords who had to speak from the Front Bench as lesser beings who were left until last in the pecking order of the departments. We all know that that has happened. I do not like to see it happen. I want to give my noble friends on the Front Bench some support. They can do with it on occasions.<lb/>
Both these reports bring out the fact that there are remarkable changes taking place in the countryside. Of recent years there has been a very considerable change in the make-up of the rural population. That has undoubtedly resulted in a number of tensions between those who regard the countryside as their place of work and their farms as places to make their living and those who believe that they have just as much right to the countryside as a place of leisure where they can enjoy its beauty in all its forms. There is that tension and it is well documented in these reports.<lb/>
I shall take two items from the report. There is no need to go through all of them, but they are worth reading. Housing has been touched on by my noble friend Lord Shuttleworth in what I thought was an
<col>514</col>
excellent contribution. We much admire the work that the Rural Development Commission is doing. Undoubtedly there is an absolute need for low-cost rented accommodation and low-cost housing for sale in the countryside. That need has been there for some while. It is not a matter about which my Government have done enough. Even now they are not doing enough though we very much welcome the infusion of capital announced on Friday.<lb/>
The Housing Corporation intended to fund a programme this year of 1,100 units against an estimated requirement of at least 5,000 which the ACORA report mentions. ACRE has mentioned 25,000 units. We shall get nothing like 1,100 units this year. It is all very well to say that by 1992 the figure will have been made up. It has never been made up yet as far as I am aware. Some really tough talking needs to be done now in order to make certain that this situation is put right. It is no longer good enough to have a great number of excuses to the effect that the money is not there. The money must be put there, and kept there this time. I hope that it will be.<lb/>
Everything hangs on this. All the debate this afternoon has been about the need for employment, small industries in the countryside, better transport, the pub, the village shop and the church. All that ties in with the needs of young people and others who at the moment are being forced out of their homes either because they are too expensive or because there are no longer houses to rent. They cannot be housed in their villages. That situation is changing the whole social structure of rural England. It is a very important matter.<lb/>
I now turn to the subject of agriculture, which was mentioned by my noble friends Lord Plumb and Lord Selborne. They both have enormous experience and recognise, as we all do, that agriculture is only one of a number of pursuits now being followed in the countryside. But it is a very important pursuit. If agriculture were not there not only would we be very short of food but we would have a countryside that looked pretty dreadful. Agriculture is still practised on about 90 per cent. of rural land. In my noble friend's own words, it is a core business in rural England and a very important one.<lb/>
There is deep despondency in the agriculture industry. There always is. I declare an interest as a farmer. I know to my cost over the years that there has always been deep despondency. It is prominent at the moment. We should not be in any doubt at all that agriculture is about to go through, if it is not doing so already, perhaps the most serious problems that it has faced since the mid-1930s. This may be a tragedy because an impoverished countryside would be dreadful. It is no answer to the problems of rural England.<lb/>
Since the war governments have invested vast sums of money in British agriculture. It would be a tragedy and a total waste of that investment if it were now allowed to decay. Therefore, even on the economic side there is a strong case to be made. As my noble friend Lord Plumb pointed out, the problem with the common agricultural policy is that such a large
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0297"/>
<col>515</col>
proportion of the subsidy goes to fund the surpluses which are stored and which then have to be sold at knockdown prices and thereby heavily subsidised at the same time. Very little of that money actually goes into the pockets of the agricultural community. That is what the Uruguay round is all about. It is the objection that the Cairns group and the United States have. These subsidies enable the surplus production to be sold on world markets at a very cheap price and therefore very largely destroy the normal patterns of world trade.<lb/>
Somehow or other we have to get over the problem. One of the ways to do that involves the arable side. We shall have to move to what I should like to call quotas, but perhaps "standard quantities" would be another way of expressing it. I urge the Ministry of Agriculture to take this matter seriously. I have a feeling that in Brussels they are already beginning to look at quotas. They will never dare to say anything about them because the moment one talks about quotas there is trouble. People start to grow more in order to get a bigger quota. But it is important that we should take this position seriously.<lb/>
I so much agree with what the committee said on the subject. The report states at paragraph 192:
<quote>"What is important, however, is to ensure that the entirely legitimate social aims of minimising hardship do not become reasons for inhibiting the development of more efficient agricultural structures; and that reductions in price support are not undermined by alternative agricultural subsidies of ever-increasing complexity and economic dubiety".</quote>
I do not want to see that happen either but I can see it happening already. There is a great move at the moment to grow linseed. If one cannot grow anything else one grows linseed. There is an enormous subsidy on linseed. It is no answer to the agricultural problems of this country or of the Community. If it is not a total waste of money, it is almost a total waste of money. On the arable side we shall have to move quotas. Farmers will get a better price for a smaller quantity. That is a better way of dealing with the matter.<lb/>
I consider the small upland farm to be a marvellous asset to this country. The people are first-class and the beauty of upland farms and upland countryside is unrivalled practically anywhere in the world. We must keep them going. But we shall make an enormous mistake if we think we can do so through agricultural methods alone. If we do so through agricultural support we shall find that the Bavarian Alps, the south of Italy and other places within the Community will eat up the money far quicker than we can. We have the best farm structure in Europe, and we should regard the social problems as something different from the agricultural problems. I beg my noble friends to look very carefully at those points.<lb/>
I shall conclude on the subject of the Church itself. I am very grateful to the most reverend Primates the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York for staying so long in this debate to hear me speak. They have stayed, I know, only out of politeness, but I am very grateful to them for all that. The Church is immensely important in rural England. If I had not thought so I would not have chaired this commission. It has an enormous part to play in the countryside in terms of
<col>516</col>
social welfare, leadership and cohesion. I hope that we are not going to be defeatist about asking in the report for more money to be raised. I believe that the Church can raise more money if it says what it is raising the money for. We want more and better clergy and we must have better paid clergy. They will never be well paid&#x2014;we know that &#x2014;but they need to be better paid and better looked after. That can be done only by a certain decentralisation away from the Church Commissioners and by an absolute determination to push responsibility down to the parish and to get the parishes to provide more money. We can raise money for many things in this country. I believe that we could raise it to provide additional clergy and better facilities for them.<lb/>
Whether or not the Church is right to become involved in these affairs&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, believes that it is not&#x2014;I feel that the Church has rendered a useful service by setting up the commission and producing this report. But it is more than that. I should like to quote a little passage from Sir Laurens van der Post when he came to give evidence to the commission. He said:
<quote>"That feeling of 'wholeness' and 'healing' bestowed by contact with nature in the countryside is for many close to religious experience and is frequently expressed in religious language".</quote>
I believe that one cannot separate what is best practice in rural England, with all its beauty, character and history, from what a modern Church is seeking to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03504">7.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03505"><member>Lord Dunleath</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great privilege to speak after the noble Lord, Lord Prior. I received the report <i>Faith in the Countryside</i> only yesterday morning. I foolishly thought that it would be a 20-page booklet that I could read in the aeroplane on the way here. I ought to have known better. Knowing the assiduity of the noble Lord, Lord Prior, when he was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I should have known that it would be 400 pages long and that I would not get them read. But what I have seen of it so far is extremely interesting.<lb/>
What I have heard of this debate so far has been more about the countryside than about faith. I am extremely glad to see his Grace the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York in his place at the moment. There is much to be said about faith not only in the countryside but in the urban situation as well. I salute his Grace for his forthright manner in dealing with rather difficult passages of scripture. Perhaps his language has been a little more cautious than that of right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham whom I salute also. We have to accept that <i>Faith in the Countryside</i> or <i>Faith in the City</i> to an educated, literate and fairly sophisticated society is not easily assimilable in the way that it is presented. We have to face up to the fact that many people have not moved on from 18th century theology&#x2014;the unquestioning theology. They have not even moved on to the questioning that took place in the 19th century, let alone to Karl Barth and, more recently, to Tillich, Bultmann and Bonhoeffer. If faith is to be intellectually acceptable and assimilable to a
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0298"/>
<col>517</col>
sophisticated and educated society, these difficult matters must be addressed. I salute his Grace for being sufficiently courageous to have done that.<lb/>
The trouble is that many of us have reached middle age. We have perhaps matured in our political attitude, in our attitude towards society and in our attitude towards the arts and the sciences; but theologically we have not matured to the same extent. Until such time as we can present people, irrespective of whether they are from the countryside or from the cities, with a theology which is intellectually acceptable and of integrity to their level of education, I do not think that the Christian faith will be credible. That may be a hard thing to say, but it must be said.<lb/>
In the light of that, it is not surprising that society has become more secular and that support for the Churches has declined. I believe that the onus is on the leaders of the Churches, especially as regards the Anglican Church, to make the message real and relevant to present day life as people see it. That may not be comfortable. But our Lord Jesus Christ and Saint Paul never pretended that their message would be comfortable, relaxing or soothing; it was going to be disturbing and challenging. That is what the message of the Church must be today so as to alert people to what it is all about.<lb/>
The age of reason was not confined to the 18th century; in my view, this is also the age of reason. People must have a reasonable belief such as that expressed in the book written by the Rev. Dr. R. P. C. Hanson from Nottingham, whom the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York probably remembers. It is a most convincing book. As I said, a reasonable belief is what is needed; otherwise we shall be faced with a secular society which does not regard the Christian faith as credible. Faith in the countryside, faith in the City, yes, but we must make it reasonable and credible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03507"><member>Lord Wade of Chorlton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should first like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, and the Select Committee for producing a most excellent report. I very much support all the recommendations. A similar report was made by the Board of Agriculture in 1790. It appointed two gentlemen, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Wedge, to travel the country and report on the state of agriculture. They produced a report which was called <i>The Report on the Rural Economy.</i> The part covering Cheshire deals with horticultural crops, cows and milk production, beef cattle, cheese making, pig feeding, mineral extraction, salt extraction and mining, the chemical industry, implement making, woodland management, reclaiming lands, road canals and canal construction and fuel production of wood and coal. Therefore, 200 years ago it was accepted that the rural economy covered a whole range of activities.<lb/>
There are now many people who advocate returning to what they see as some rural idyll, where they look over the field gate and see nothing but a few cows. It was not like that in the past. Those who
<col>518</col>
advocate that we should return to the sort of agricultural system which we had a long time ago would actually be doing a great disservice to the environment that they say they want to see.<lb/>
Many people are very concerned with the environment, and concerned with it in a practical and sensible way. They wish to see a retention of our wildlife, our flowers, our plants and our various crops. However, there is another group of people within our society which I see as trying to prevent the development of opportunities in the countryside from a purely selfish point of view. To an extent they are the face of apartheid in this country. They have the view that they should be protected and deny others the very advantages which they have sought for themselves. Those points are clearly made in <i>Faith in the Countryside.</i> I very much support the most reverend Primates in what is put forward in that respect.<lb/>
In the report reference is made to the pressure groups which seek to prevent the development which is needed in the countryside. I should have thought that the Church could take a very much more positive and practical role in combating those points when they are presented in respect of planning decisions before planning committees. The view of the Church, which far outnumbers in membership many of those pressure groups, should have a much wider and more practical voice in such decisions.<lb/>
The report clearly shows that a decline will take place in agriculture. There are those this afternoon who have said that we should do all we can to avoid that outcome. However, it will happen. The agricultural economy of this country will decline over the next few years. It will probably recover as we move into the next century, but the next 10 years will be a very difficult time for all of us. We must appreciate that that is not necessarily a problem; it is in fact a great opportunity. It could mean that 5 million hectares over the next 10 years may become available for other purposes and another 150,000 people who are now employed in agriculture may become available for other employment. On many occasions in your Lordships' House I have heard people complain about the crowding in urban communities and the problems of health because of pressures in such communities. Why should we not see the opportunity to make much more land available for the whole of the population as an advantage and not as a restriction on what we do?<lb/>
Surely the key is to see the rural economy in the same way as it was seen 200 years ago; that is, with a whole range of economic activities taking place throughout the country. I strongly commend the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, on its decision to support the idea of off-farm economic activity. It is not a solution to expect farming activities, however diverse they may become, to generate more wealth in the countryside. There must be a much greater range of all kinds of economic activity within the rural community, and that means that planning applications must be dealt with in a much more relaxed manner. We must help and support those counties which are now developing a
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0299"/>
<col>519</col>
rural policy. Certainly my county of Cheshire recently put forward a very sound and positive rural policy which will go a long way towards stimulating the whole economy in the area. However, at present it is being more hindered than encouraged in putting it into effect. In that regard, I believe that much could still be done.<lb/>
Mention was made of the new technologies which are available. I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that in Denmark recently considerable difficulties were experienced because of the pollution caused by fish farming. As a result, two or three years ago many restrictions were placed upon fish farmers which would have virtually cut their businesses in half and put many people out of work. However, the matter was considered by a leading technology company in the fish farming area. In two years it came forward with a solution which meant that the pollution problem was solved and the environmental difficulties reduced by well over half. It also meant that the fish farming activities continued to be profitable at the same level as before and that there was employment. Therefore, the problem was solved. We know from our own experience that it is better when such a problem is looked at not from the point of view of the only way to solve it is to stop it, but from the point of view of, "Well, what we must do with this particular exercise which is seen as environmentally unacceptable is to make it environmentally acceptable".<lb/>
Farming has cleaned up its act, as it were, enormously in the years that I have been farming. The economic pressures that force people to take such decisions can be effective. When tackling the problems we must ensure that we solve them in a practical way. We should not take the view that if we do not like something we should stop it. I again thank the committee for producing what is undoubtedly an excellent report.<lb/>
I have been a farmer all my life. My family has farmed in Cheshire for several generations. During that time the changes in methods and systems have been enormous. We are now going through another period of change. When given the freedom to do so, the agricultural community can change dramatically. Its ability to move its businesses from one system to another is always effective. The key is to give farmers the freedom and opportunity to do so. We will then see the vast changes in the countryside which will allow more people to use it. It can then be a benefit to the whole of society, which is what it should be.<lb/>
I hope we do not see extensification techniques, something with which I completely disagree. I should prefer to see less land farmed, but the land that is farmed must be farmed efficiently because our business is competitively to produce good quality food, from the farm to the table. That cannot be done if everything is being run at an uneconomic level. If we must cut production, the answer is to farm less land but to farm that land efficiently. The land that then becomes available can be used to increase facilities and amenities for the rest of society.<lb/>
<col>520</col>
My little bit of the rural economy needs my attention tomorrow morning urgently. If I leave now to catch the train I hope that your Lordships will forgive me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03508">8.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03509"><member>Earl Peel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to thank the most reverend Primate and my noble friend Lord Prior for producing their report and also my noble friend Lord Middleton and all the Members of the Select Committee for producing such a comprehensive and enlightening report. It has been said&#x2014;I must say that I agree&#x2014;that it is a pity that the two reports are being discussed together. Since they are being so discussed, perhaps I may suggest that a better term for the debate would be "The future of rural society, and do we have faith in the countryside?". That may be one of the major points with which we shall have to come to terms over the next decade or so.<lb/>
I am ashamed to say that I have not looked at the report produced by my noble friend Lord Prior, but I have looked comprehensively at that produced by my noble friend Lord Middleton. That is not to say that I in any way under-estimate the role of the clergy in the countryside. Far from it. I regard the role of the local vicar very much the same as that of the local policeman. He is an integral part of society and a man who can do a great deal of good.<lb/>
As has already been said, rural society covers a magnitude of extremes. Many people's idea of the countryside is that those who make their lives there should be able to seek employment in any way that is available to them. There are those who believe that the countryside should be cocooned and preserved for posterity. As has been said, the rural economy and environment have always been, and always will be, dynamic, responding to the conditions of the free market and direct and indirect government grants. The rural population, while changing in character, is in many regions no longer declining.<lb/>
Whereas many of us would like to see the survival of the traditional communities with their histories and skills, I am afraid that we must accept that changes will continue to take place. I am sure that farm amalgamations will continue, but we may also see an increase in part-time farmers. I do not regard that as bad, because if it helps to keep people on the land, then so be it. The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, described his trip to Germany and talked about a prosperous rural economy. I suspect that many of the people to whom he referred were part-time farmers.<lb/>
I applaud the efforts that are being made to mitigate the demise of traditional communities, but those efforts must be kept within sensible economic limits. They must be for sound environmental or social reasons. It is important to sustain employment because, as has again been pointed out by many noble Lords, that is what bonds the fabric of rural society. If there is no fabric, there is no service; if there is no service, there are no standards, and everything will fall about. On that point I should like to join with other noble Lords in applauding the efforts of my noble
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0300"/>
<col>521</col>
friend Lord Shuttleworth and the Rural Development Commission. His contribution to the debate was outstanding. I very much enjoyed what he had to say.<lb/>
Whatever society we shall see in the countryside in the future, what interests many of us is how that countryside will be managed. It is likely to be managed by a smaller population, and, I suspect, by a population that, in many cases will not have had its roots in the land. The present recession makes it impossible for many farmers to consider their environmental responsibilities. There are many farmers who have never considered their environmental responsibilities, but there are many who would like to but who cannot at the moment because of the financial difficulties they face.<lb/>
Against the difficulties of over-production, there are enormous opportunities to redress the imbalance between what I call hard farming and environmental care. I go so far as to say that we may never have a better chance of devising a policy of sustainable methods of food production and land management for the wellbeing of nature and for ourselves.<lb/>
I in no way wish to undermine the need to farm profitably and efficiently. That is fundamental. Nor would I wish to cast any doubts&#x2014;I now declare my interest as a member of the NCC&#x2014;on our system of site designations, SSSIs, NNRs and the work of the county nature trusts in maintaining their reserves. They are core features of nature conservation both in themselves and as a means of monitoring change in the countryside, which is of course of equal importance.<lb/>
We must move towards the greater integration of farming and conservation in the wider countryside. Above all, we must resolve the problem where agricultural support mechanisms are promoting damaging countryside management. That, I am sorry to say, continues. It is something to which we must address ourselves as quickly as possible. That is not to say that support and incentives of a kind are not important. Without support many farming communities would not survive. The ill-effect on the infrastructure and wellbeing of the countryside would be profound, with severe social consequences.<lb/>
As again has been said, the incomes of hill farms have dropped by 50 per cent. in the past two years. I had a meeting the other day with a number of my hill farming tenants. There is no doubt that their plight is serious as the noble Baroness, Lady White, said. I believe that she said there is now real fear. She is not exaggerating the situation. Urgent action is undoubtedly needed.<lb/>
Production-related subsidies are a nonsense at this time and support must relate more closely to specific environmental aims and objectives or where good reason can be shown that without that community or that system the countryside would suffer. I appreciate that, as has already been said, there is enormous diversity within the economic community and this again stresses the need for decisions to be made at a
<col>522</col>
local level. To illustrate this, I simply draw noble Lords' attention to page 198 of volume II of the report of my noble friend Lord Middleton. It says:
<quote>"Dr. Berkeley Hill's recent report shows that the bulk of public support for the countryside comes through agricultural support and, in particular, through market regulation of agricultural commodities under the Common Agricultural Policy. In contrast, only about 2 per cent. of the total goes to meet objectives which are specific to conservation of wildlife or landscape and only about 1 per cent. on rural services".</quote>
I believe that those statistics are extremely important. I wish to see them redressed as soon as possible. To this end I believe that the wider use of the ESA principle is desirable, though I believe it is important to link the visual attractions of an area with the nature conservation objectives and to ensure where possible that rural development policies are based on properly researched conclusions. I think particularly now of set-aside. I am bound to say that I do not find it a particularly attractive way forward. I do not believe that it is good for farming and I know that it is not good for conservation.<lb/>
Positive management payments and not simply payments for profits forgone must be the right way forward. I am much attracted to the idea of the environmental menu proposed by the Countryside Commission where farmers can choose from a range of items which would benefit the environment. I see no reason at all why that could not be worked in conjunction with ELMS. My noble friend Lord Radnor was to some degree sceptical about how that would work. I agree that it would take some thought, but I believe that as a principle we should consider it more than we have. There could be great opportunities in this direction. Furthermore, it would help in establishing a market value for environmental management. That again is perhaps taken too much for granted at the moment and we should be able to see it in financial terms.<lb/>
I wish to add a word of caution on the Countryside Commission proposals. Whereas public access objectives are desirable and opportunities to expand access are considerable, they should not become an obsession. When that access threatens the management of wildlife, I believe it obviously becomes counter-productive. When it adversely affects the management of land, occupiers will be less inclined to take up those environmental payments.<lb/>
However, among all the discussions and deliberations on means of securing incentives for a better environment, one activity has been given scant attention. My noble friend Lord Swinton mentioned it. I am talking about the effect of field sports on the countryside. Statistics have been given to show us the effects of farming, forestry, etc. Forestry itself covers 10 per cent. of the land surface in Great Britain. Field sports are carried out in one way or another on approximately 60 per cent. of the land. That means that the habitat of that land is being managed to a greater or lesser extent for the benefit of wildlife.<lb/>
It has been shown on numerous occasions that that management is not only beneficial to the quarry species but to a wealth of other species besides. Recently, the BASC, in conjunction with the Scottish
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0301"/>
<col>523</col>
Development Agency, produced a report which estimated that &#x00A3;78 million was spent by field sports interests in Scotland alone. It is fair to say that much of that money went into the less favoured areas where, as we know, it is sorely needed.<lb/>
From the maintenance and management of the heather moorland to the retention of small copses and the creation of hardwoods and to the establishment and conservation of wetlands, I believe that field sports have been responsible more than any other single factor for the well-being of the countryside, largely without any form of subsidy. The grey partridge, once so prolific in the English countryside, has now been reduced to dramatically small numbers by modern agriculture. It can only be found in reasonable numbers where the shooting interests encourage it.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Swinton referred to the Game Conservancy. Again, I have to declare an interest. I am chairman of the research planning committee and a vice-chairman. I believe that the research that the Game Conservancy has done into determining the best method of creating and managing habitats and food supply for game birds and the advice that it offers is of national importance. In fact, I go so far as to say that it is of international importance, bearing in mind the number of requests now being received from European countries. The specialist knowledge that the conservancy has built up over the years should never be underestimated. I believe that it is of huge importance to the countryside.<lb/>
Anything which will undermine field sports threatens the well-being of the countryside itself. That is why I wish to take this opportunity of thanking my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment for his recent decision not to implement the 1979 bird directive. It was a bold move which will undoubtedly benefit our countryside greatly.<lb/>
We have great opportunities for the future of the countryside. We must take them now while we have the chance. Above all, the objectives must be clear and those owning and managing the land must know what is expected of them. Equally important, they must know what is available to them.<lb/>
I end on a note of sadness, if I may use that word. I am disappointed that my noble friend's committee did not accept the principle of a ministry of rural affairs. I personally believe that we must draw together in a way that has not been done all the various interests in the countryside. I believe that is one action that would go some way towards achieving that aim.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03511"><member>The Earl of Lytton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I add my voice to those who have heaped praise on the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, for his excellent and learned committee's report on this matter. It has an enormous breadth of common sense and statistical information and I warmly welcome it. I wish to associate myself with the views of the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, who gave
<col>524</col>
us an insight into the role of the Rural Development Commission. From personal experience perhaps I may say what an excellent organisation it is.<lb/>
I shall concentrate principally on the report of the Select Committee but I wish also to say how much I appreciated and was touched by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Prior, in his dissertation on the religious dimension applied to rural affairs. I agreed with everything he said.<lb/>
I must declare an interest. Not only am I a chartered surveyor dealing with a commercial activity in a rural base; I am also a farmer. My wife and I farm in West Somerset on Exmoor. I wish to dwell for a moment on the problems of the severely less favoured upland areas. There are problems of infrastructure. One is a very poor road system. There is the problem of the vast seasonal increase of visitors every summer. That produces a peculiarly awkward imbalance in the management of that rural environment and a corresponding over-dependency on tourism as an alternative economy, if it is not the main economy before agriculture. There are the climatic and geographic disadvantages that make agriculture particularly difficult in certain parts of the national park. Those factors also make the tourist season perilously short.<lb/>
As with all national parks, there is a fixation of the collective mind on environmental matters. It is right that that should exist, but not to the total exclusion of all other aspects as seems to have been the case in the past. There is the imbalance in the population and few opportunities for young people to start on the farming ladder and to have any prospect of conducting a business in the area where they have been brought up. There is the problem of an ageing population and the presence of a large number of retired people. Exmoor has problems which make it in many ways a microcosm of the rest of the country. However, Exmoor also contains acute examples of the problems that occur elsewhere in the country.<lb/>
I echo the comments made by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, when he said that there has been a lack of cohesive policy and a lack of a cohesive body to guide policy in rural areas. I shall give noble Lords a few examples of the kind of official bodies that I have to deal with. There is the Exmoor National Park; the Somerset County Council; the West Somerset District Council; the Nature Conservancy Council and the various offshoots funded by that council; the Forestry Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, English Heritage and the National Rivers Authority. There are also innumerable semi-official or unofficial bodies that all have a say in rural affairs. It is extremely difficult for an individual to perform his functions of stewardship on the land when he has to deal with so many different organisations, not all of which agree with the policies of the others.<lb/>
Some noble Lords touched earlier in the debate on particular economic problems such as the inherent unprofitability of the agricultural industry for upland farmers. I echo the comment that was made that there are serious problems as regards the financial future of many of the traditional farmers who have been the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0302"/>
<col>525</col>
warp and weft of Exmoor society. Great difficulties abound as regards opportunities for diversification. Those difficulties arise through planning constraints, the nature of the landscape, the geography and the remoteness of the region. There are also pressures from all kinds of bodies for designations which severely impair the opportunities for growth and expansion of rural businesses on agricultural and forestry land.<lb/>
Further, there are climatic problems which affect forestry and the type of crop and husbandry which can be conducted in the area. As I have said, the tourist season is extremely short and there is little opportunity for spreading that season over a longer period when the weather is heavily against such a course of action. In addition, there are pressures to formulate policies for environmentally acceptable approaches to land management. However, that approach costs something. Present returns on the kind of arrangements that are commonly offered by way of management agreements generally represent no more than an average income expectancy as applied to a wide basket of different holdings. I should add that not all of those options are particularly attractive in terms of the perceived loss of control and the fact that they may tie up the use of land for long periods of time.<lb/>
Nevertheless, I envisage a real opportunity arising from the fact that we need to consider the public interest element in land use. I pick up again on a point made by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, in that connection. We need to look at the public interest element as another crop. That concept must be farmed as a crop, and we must view it as that nature of animal rather than something which is wholly different from the rest of the agricultural operation.<lb/>
I wish to say a few words about the Government's policy. I must refer to a perceived discrepancy between the real anxieties that are apparent in the Select Committee's report and the comments made by the Minister earlier in the debate. I am not sure that I agree that the Government are doing all they can to support the rural economy. That is certainly not the case through the medium of agriculture. I could refer to many examples of contorted and difficult forms that need to be completed and the instances where arbitrary cash limits seem to have been introduced on grant aid. I could mention scheme revisions and scheme duration and the exclusivity of the schemes that qualify for agricultural grant aid as opposed to other schemes.<lb/>
I wish to point my finger slightly at forestry policy. I believe it is generally accepted that the Government's policy has successfully got rid of a number of pop stars who wish to invest in large tracts of forestry land in order to obtain tax breaks for doing so. However, at the same time the policy has severely prejudiced many other people who do not make a profit out of forestry but who try to do it because they feel that is their public duty. The present level of grant aid, particularly for hardwoods, goes nowhere near recognising the public interest element of forestry.<lb/>
<col>526</col>
Particular problems exist for hill farmers who are heavily dependent on cattle and sheep rearing. I shall have to wait to see what final decision is reached in this matter and whether we shall have to suffer a one-third cut in the sheep premium. If that is the case, what will replace the premium, if anything? When will an alternative measure be introduced?<lb/>
Reforms on rural policies generally are long overdue. It was said earlier in the debate that too much of an urban view is being taken. It is quite proper that urban society and those who dwell in towns should have and express a view on rural affairs. Nevertheless, I feel that there is an imbalance now between urban and rural prosperity. That imbalance runs against rural prosperity and has certainly not been arrested. Meanwhile, urban congestion and deprivation continue apace.<lb/>
I should like to see more of an effort made to secure adequate sources of funding. If that means decoupling agriculture from other rural operations, then so be it. I am not worried at the concept of supporting operations other than agricultural operations. Collectively the nation's commitment to rural affairs is not self-evident. In spite of intense public interest, I see no evidence of forward planning or other necessary resources being put into this extremely important matter. Indeed I see public interest being chiefly aimed at green issues. They butter no parsnips. At the end of the day it is rather like someone standing on the touchline cheering but not getting his hands dirty. Many supporters of green policies are quite happy to see lots of things being done provided that it is always at someone else's expense. That is an unsustainable method of going about things.<lb/>
The specific needs of the rural area that I know best are as follows. There is a need for a unified body to deal with the many issues. It may well be that a national park is an exceptional case and not typical of other rural areas. There certainly needs to be forward planning and a cohesive strategy. There should be a concept of the value-added element of land use. Whether or not that value-added element takes the form of recognition in financial terms of the public interest is not for me to say.<lb/>
I believe that the special interest groups and those who lobby so hard against farmers and others who have responsibility for the stewardship of our countryside would do better if they did not simply stand by and tell everybody else what to do but put their hands in their pockets and started making a contribution. If more of those groups contributed in the same way as organisations such as Greenpeace and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers a great deal more could be achieved. There must be a partnership. We cannot do it alone and we cannot do it without those groups. They should have a say, but let us formulate a solution that is fair to all parties. There is an economic solution and a balance to be drawn.<lb/>
I warmly welcome the report of the Select Committee. I should like to echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Prior, who referred to the fact that in creating the environment that we all want in the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0303"/>
<col>527</col>
countryside we shall in some way draw the spiritual element out of the closet and into the open. We can build a better world, but we cannot do so on an adversarial basis. The reports of the Select Committee and the Archbishops' Commission could well have been debated separately to greater effect, but they provide a valuable touchstone. It would be well if both reports were much more widely publicised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03512">8.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03513"><member>Lord Norrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the Select Committee's report. There can be no doubt that the issues it addresses are important and need urgent action, not least from the Government. Both agriculture and planning policies for the countryside are coming under active review. New initiatives are needed to protect the landscape and the social balance of our rural areas from the threat of excessive or unbalanced development. The report covers many important aspects but, like many other speakers, I shall concentrate on the vital issue of affordable rural housing.<lb/>
We do not need research to identify the problems of rural housing. The urgent need for a substantial increase in the supply of homes for those unable to compete in the open market ought not to be questionable. It is one of the most serious social problems facing rural areas. By whatever method we employ to measure rural housing needs, the Select Committee is right in concluding that the available supply falls far short of demand.<lb/>
We hear a great deal about the importance of having a living countryside&#x2014;a countryside with a balanced population which spans the social spectrum and through its different activities helps to retain social cohesion and the landscape of our rural areas. An adequate supply of housing to meet the needs of the young, the elderly, the retiring farm worker and others whose families by tradition have lived in villages for generations is essential if any sense of rural community is to be retained. The most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York emphasised the vital need for affordable housing to retain that sense of rural community.<lb/>
Much attention has focused on the financial difficulties being faced by housing associations and local authorities in providing affordable houses in the countryside. Both the Select Committee and the Archbishops' Commission on Rural Areas have implored the Government to increase substantially the allocation of public money for the construction of affordable homes and to ensure that the houses provided are not sold on but are retained at an affordable price in perpetuity.<lb/>
Too many affordable houses are being built only for them to be sold on at full market price by the first occupier&#x2014;a transaction now known as "staircasing". I can give the example of my own county of Berkshire, where the West Berkshire Housing Association has expressed great concern that over 55 per cent. of its social housing stock in the Newbury area has been or
<col>528</col>
is about to be sold. In some areas of Berkshire such as Aldermaston and Welford over 80 per cent. of the stock has gone.<lb/>
A permanent pool of affordable rural houses must be retained in the countryside to meet the needs of future generations without allowing unnecessary additional development. Placing a ceiling on shared ownership schemes to prevent staircasing beyond a 50 per cent. equity would also ensure better use of the limited resources available for building affordable homes, thereby allowing housing associations and others to concentrate on building new houses instead of on the expensive repurchase of the old ones.<lb/>
I also urge the House to recognise the continuing role of local authorities as providers of affordable rural housing. The undoubted success of the right-to-buy policy in rural areas has had an unfortunate side effect in reducing the supply of affordable local authority homes available to new generations. The houses sold have not been replaced by local authorities, housing associations or the private sector. I hope that ways can be found to enable local authorities to use more of the income they receive from the sale of their own affordable housing stock to replace it elsewhere and meet the housing needs of the future. That was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher.<lb/>
I now turn to the thorny issue of housing land supply and the planning system. Many commentators have suggested that the land issue lies at the heart of the rural housing problem. I suggest that the problem is not one of land itself but one of land capable of being developed for affordable houses.<lb/>
Let us examine the facts. In reality there is no shortage of land for house building as a result of planning controls. Even in the South East where development pressures have been at their highest the capacity of land identified for new housing development over the next five years stands at the record level of nearly 300,000 dwellings, no less than 58 per cent. above the requirements of the county structure plans approved by the Secretary of State. The problem is that little of that land is used for building affordable homes.<lb/>
Even more worrying is the paradox that sees high and accelerating amounts of development in all parts of the country coinciding with record levels of homelessness and the problems of access to housing. Between 1981 and 1988 over 1,140,000 houses were built in the shire counties of England and there was an accelerating rate of growth in every region. Yet in the same period there was a disturbing 64 per cent. increase in homelessness. The increase was 179 per cent. in Buckinghamshire. Last year fewer than one in three households could afford to purchase a three-bedroomed house on the open market in England. The equation is a simple one. There is a great deal of development going on and a great deal of land being made available by the planning system but neither the development nor the land is going to the people who most need it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0304"/>
<col>529</col>
I must express grave reservations about the Select Committee's criticism of the planning system and its plea for a relaxation of controls to provide more land. I do not believe that that would provide the answers. Relaxing the planning controls would not reduce house prices or provide many new affordable homes. It would place the countryside under even more pressure, turning a social problem into an environmental one.<lb/>
The Government have already gone down the relaxation road with their policy of releasing land on the village edge as an exception to normal planning restraints. I share the reservations of the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the local authorities about that approach. Only 60 schemes are thought to have started under the exception policy, while it has been estimated that about 185,000 affordable houses are needed by 1994. The major flaw in that approach is that it steers development to the sensitive boundary between villages and the countryside which for decades has frequently been protected by the planning system.<lb/>
We have a duty to protect the countryside, and the public expect us to uphold it. What is needed is a mechanism to safeguard some of the land that is to be developed in any case to make sure that some of it is used to meet social housing needs. By adjusting planning policy we could tackle rural housing shortages as part of the normal process of development.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, told us this afternoon that the Government will shortly issue a new policy planning guidance note to local authorities on the release of land for low cost housing. That covers small sites which would not ordinarily be released for housing. That may be reasonable in the short term but I believe that in the long term the guidance should go further. Local authorities could be given limited powers to specify in development plans a proportion of the land that was to be developed specifically for affordable housing.<lb/>
We should want to consider carefully the conditions under which councils could exercise those powers and consider the level and type of lower-cost housing which would be reasonable. I have reservations about the extent to which the housing market should be interfered with. We need to avoid any measures which effectively would give councils wide powers to dictate the levels of house prices.<lb/>
I welcome the Government's recent announcement of an extra &#x00A3;50 million to support a low-cost housing programme in rural areas of most need. Together with a different planning emphasis, this boost in public funding will provide the beginnings of an answer to what has become an urgent social problem.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03515"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we all agree that we have had a wide ranging debate over the whole field of rural policy. Like other noble Lords, I begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, on his expert chairmanship of the Select Committee and
<col>530</col>
presentation of the report. His skill in the chair ensured that what might have become a rather discursive and ill-targeted study has in fact resulted in an authoritative and tightly argued report. I should also like to congratulate the Archbishops' Commission on its Report. The noble Lord, Lord Prior, and his commissioners have produced an invaluable report which both supplements and underlines a number of the recommendations of the Select Committee's report. Indeed, it is significant that two reports which come from different standpoints&#x2014;one of them is secular and the other theological&#x2014;have reached broadly the same conclusions.<lb/>
There are many strands of argument which have developed in what has been a fascinating debate. In the time available it obviously will not be possible to cover them all. I should like to concentrate on agricultural policy and some aspects of rural services, particularly housing.<lb/>
The reports of the Select Committee and the Archbishops' Commission emphasise the central importance of a prosperous agriculture in a prosperous countryside. The noble Lord, Lord Walston, pointed out that we could not rely on a prosperous agriculture alone. It is certainly a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition.<lb/>
The report of the Archbishops' Commission points out that agriculture provides some 15 per cent. of direct employment in the rural areas and up to 30 per cent. in some areas. The Select Committee report bears that out, and we should not overlook the wide range of industries and services ancillary to agriculture which are not included in those figures. With an output of some &#x00A3;12.5 billion, agriculture is and will remain a major economic interest of the countryside. That is why the prosperity of the industry is so crucially important in securing a prosperous countryside.<lb/>
But the reality is that it is an industry whose net income has more than halved in real terms in the 1980s. The number of those engaged in the industry&#x2014;both farmers and farm workers&#x2014;has decreased by nearly 100,000 (some 12 per cent.) in the same period. It is an industry where low morale and deep uncertainty about the future are now endemic. That point was made most strongly by the noble Lord, Lord Prior.<lb/>
The problem is that agriculture, as a major industry and as an essential component of rural policy, does not know what is required of it. I am not at all sure that the policy makers know either. Indeed, considering the present confusion over policy one is reminded of Lloyd George's famous dictum that it is very hard to cross a chasm in two leaps.<lb/>
Only 10 years ago a book entitled <i>Britain's Future in Farming,</i> which had 14 expert contributors, concluded that:
<quote>"Britain now needs to increase agricultural production".</quote>
A reasoned case for agricultural expansion must continue to be pressed widely and with vigour. White
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0305"/>
<col>531</col>
Papers and exhortations from successive governments, which the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, will remember very well, said much the same thing.<lb/>
Ten years is quite a short time in farming. It is perhaps only a couple of rotations for those who continue to use such old-fashioned practices. But now we are told that there is a surplus of land. Estimates range from 6 million hectares to 16 million hectares. I have no wish to fall out with the terminology of the chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, but there is no such thing as a surplus of land. The phrase is a logical nonsense. We know that surpluses can be burnt, tipped into the sea, given away or dumped overseas with or without export restitution. So far as I am aware, there is no possibility of land being made available for any of those activities.<lb/>
What does exist from time to time in some parts of the world is a surplus of agricultural production accompanied by severe shortages (in some cases amounting to famine), in other parts of the world, with no effective economic mechanism to match the surpluses and shortages. That is a point that was very well made by my noble friend Lord John-Mackie.<lb/>
If effective demand is defined as need accompanied by the ability to pay, there is clearly a major deficit in demand but certainly not in need. We have to consider whether we wish to produce the same amount of food from a smaller area or less food production from the same area when we talk&#x2014;I think incorrectly&#x2014;about a surplus of land.<lb/>
The direction of agricultural policy in the European Community now seems to be based on a gradual move away from price support towards direct income aid, with payments to farmers progressively decoupled from the quantities which they produce, and towards dealing with their perceived impoverishment. The policy is further confused by the imponderables of the GATT Round and its implications.<lb/>
We must remember that such a shift in policy has major implications, which are mostly unfavourable, for British agriculture and thereby the prosperity of the British countryside. The Select Committee could find nobody prepared to define the family farm but everybody agreed that the United Kingdom has fewer of them than anybody else. We have already seen the first signs of a shift in policy: limitations of headage payments which will be based on flock or herd size; extra help for small cereal producers; and the reallocation of milk quotas towards smaller farms. None of those policies is necessarily wrong in itself but they all result in a comparative disadvantage for UK agriculture. The same thing may well happen when we come to renegotiate the operation of milk quotas after 1992.<lb/>
Our efficient farming structure (incidentally, advanced as one of our strengths when we joined the Community) now puts us at a serious disadvantage compared with most other members of the European Community. The Select Committee report deals briskly but effectively with the European Commission's proposed mechanisms: the modulation of prices support; direct income aids; special
<col>532</col>
payments to farmers in the least favoured areas and support for diversification. But both the Select Committee report and the Archbishops' Commission report mention another policy mechanism&#x2014;support for less intensive farming. The argument is summarised very well at the end of paragraph 228 of the Select Committee report:
<quote>"If farming in a certain way produces environmental goods which the public wants the Committee consider that farmers should be paid for providing them".</quote>
It seems to me that the benefit of such an approach to policy for UK agriculture and the British countryside is not just its obvious environmental attractions. It is a policy which, of its nature, if it is to be effective, must be implemented irrespective of farm size. Indeed, it could be argued that it would be most effective in terms of reducing agricultural surpluses if it were applied particularly generously to the 30 per cent. of farms which produce three-quarters of the total output.<lb/>
When we think about the possibilities of less intensive farming we have to consider the social effect. It has been calculated that every 750 acres in set-aside means one job lost. That is a prospect, incidentally, which I am not sure the National Farmers Union has taken fully into account in its proposals for compulsory set-aside.<lb/>
The potential redundancy of farm workers is expressed extremely well in the report of the Archbishops' Commission at page 50 when comparing the closure of a coalmine or steel works. Nonetheless, no attempt has been made to increase the compensation to help redundant farm workers to reach a training centre to prepare for other employment. Because they have been scattered they have been unable to bring political pressure to bear. However, they have a case which we feel needs closer examination and an imaginative response.<lb/>
An agricultural policy which improves the physical environment of the countryside and reduces surplus production but which is easily reversible if extra production is needed, and which keeps people&#x2014;farmers, farm workers and those in the ancillary industries&#x2014;employed in the countryside must be worthy of serious consideration.<lb/>
The facile comment is sometimes made: why are farmers or farm workers any different from coalminers, steel workers or any other people who have been made redundant in the past 11 years? It is possible to close a coalmine, a steel works or a factory. It is very hard to close down half a county.<lb/>
I believe that the environmental approach to agricultural policy is clearly a concept whose time has arrived. In the opening speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, we heard that the Government intend to maintain and develop their environmental policies. The Labour Party has worked out the idea of a green premium for environmental management. The Country Landowners' Association has the environmental land management (ELM) scheme. In the past few days we have had the joint report of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England and the World
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0306"/>
<col>533</col>
Wildlife Fund, entitled <i>Future Harvests.</i> They also refer to the idea of payments for environmental management.<lb/>
Those are all different approaches but they have a common theme. I do not suggest that support should be based wholly on environmental payments. Indeed, any successful agricultural policy in the future will be based on a sophisticated mix of tariff protection, supply management, some price support, environmental payments and direct income aids. However, if we consider that 65 per cent. of the cost of the CAP does not go to farmers but into the cost of storage and export restitutions, it appears that a sensible policy could see a substantial reduction in cost but increase the amount that ends up in farmers' pockets.<lb/>
The reports of the Select Committee and of the Archbishops' Commission deal with the importance of rural services, with transport, education, shops, post offices, health provision and above all housing. I do not apologise for concentrating on housing. The reports state in terms that the lack of affordable homes to rent or buy is the single most serious social problem in the countryside. The Select Committee report states at paragraph 217:
<quote>"The Committee were struck by the weight of evidence suggesting that the largest, and in some ways the most intractable problem affecting rural areas in the United Kingdom is the provision of adequate affordable housing for local communities".</quote>
The report of the Archbishops' Commission says almost exactly the same at page 95. It states:
<quote>"One issue above all others&#x2014;housing&#x2014;has been at the centre of the evidence which we have received, especially on our regional and diocesan visits".</quote>
A report produced for the Rural Development Commission by Action with Communities in Rural England (ACRE) which has been mentioned reveals that there are approximately 377,000 households in rural England in need of housing, either immediately or over the next five years. Perhaps the Minister will respond to this question when she replies: what is the Government's estimate of the total housing need in the rural areas? Do the Government agree with the estimate that has been made in the ACRE report?<lb/>
Every member of the Select Committee received a letter from the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, which gave the response of the Department of the Environment to the report of the Select Committee. The letter contains a long paragraph which summarises various government initiatives in rural housing. They were mentioned again today in the speech with which the noble Baroness opened the debate. However, in both the letter and the speech there was a significant omission. There was not a single figure in either for the number of housing units in rural areas which the Government expect to result from those initiatives. Will the Minister tell the House how many houses it is expected will be built in rural areas as a result of all the plans which were set out in the letter received from the noble Baroness and in her speech today? I advised her before the debate that I should be asking that question.<lb/>
<col>534</col>
We know that the Housing Corporation, before its current financial problem, devoted only 2 per cent. of its funds to the rural areas, although we know that 20 per cent. of the population live in the rural areas. The report of the Archbishops' Commission refers at page 99 to the work of the Wiltshire Rural Housing Association. I was pleased to see that reference because I had the pleasure of opening some of the units only a few weeks ago. The work of the Wiltshire Rural Housing Association meets only 1 per cent. of the known need for housing for local people in Wiltshire villages.<lb/>
It is no exaggeration to say that we are facing a major crisis in rural housing. In my view, and in that of my party, there is only one way to meet the need quickly. It is to use the local authorities as the main providers, either directly or indirectly. I know that the Government will have to swallow their ideology to accept that, but the main cause of the crisis is the direct result of government policy: the introduction of the right to buy policy for local authority housing and refusing the local authorities permission to use the receipts from the right to buy sales to replace stocks. That was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, the noble Duke, the Duke of Somerset, and the noble Lord, Lord Norrie.<lb/>
Now that the days of government by prime ministerial obsession seem to be drawing somewhat less than peacefully to their close, perhaps I may urge the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, to impress on their ministerial colleagues the urgency of the situation. We know that the local authorities have received billions from council house sales. Surely they should now be required to replace the stock that they have lost. Those houses are virtually the only source of affordable homes to rent in the countryside. I know that the Government place great reliance on the housing association movement and the voluntary sector. They certainly have an important part to play. However, for the past four years I have tried to put up low-cost housing on farmland, and I know exactly how long that takes.<lb/>
As regards the provision for low-cost rural housing we know that a number of schemes are based on landowners virtually giving away the land. The planners grant permission for low-cost housing where permission would not be given for full-price housing. In other words, the planners decide to allocate housing according to income. I find it a little ironic that this Government, which believe so strongly in the free market, seem to be relying on a combination of private philanthropy and quasi-Marxist social engineering to solve the rural housing problem. Indeed, it is nice to know that Ebenezer Howard and Karl Marx are apparently alive and well and helping to formulate the Government's rural housing policy.<lb/>
Of course we welcome the recent announcement of &#x00A3;50 million allocated to councils where the rural housing need is greatest. Can the Minister confirm that that is not new money added to the housing investment programme but an expression of the higher priority to be given to rural housing in the programme
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0307"/>
<col>535</col>
compared with other demands on it? It is a one-off shift in one year's programme. What is the Government's estimate of the number of houses that will result from the &#x00A3;50 million allocation?<lb/>
The rural housing association movement finds it difficult to plan properly when it does not know from one year to the next what priority the Government intend to give to rural housing. Frankly, the stop-go attitude to funding is causing nothing less than chaos to small rural housing associations. What is needed is a proper, rolling five-year rural housing plan setting out targets for local authorities and the voluntary sector. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell the House whether the Government intend to have such a plan.<lb/>
We have had a fascinating debate on a vitally important topic. The two reports that we have considered make an invaluable contribution to policy making. We must hope that their conclusions and recommendations are heeded in Westminster and in Brussels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03516">9.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03517"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having listened with interest&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, please note&#x2014;to Monday's debate on the environment and transport, I have listened with even greater interest to today's deliberations. I am delighted to be playing a part at the end of the day. I add my congratulations to my noble friend Lord Middleton and the most reverend Primate for the two reports.<lb/>
Before I reply to specific points made by your Lordships perhaps you would bear with me while I make some general points which I believe are relevant to the matters in hand. Agriculture may account for only 1&#x00B7;4 per cent. of GDP and 2&#x00B7;2 per cent. of the national workforce but it is much more important than those figures suggest to the rural economy. Agricultural policies are, therefore, of vital importance to rural areas. I believe that the Select Committee and the Archbishops' Commission recognise this.<lb/>
I was delighted to hear the stress laid by my noble friend Lord Selborne on the importance of food production. Farmers have always had two jobs&#x2014;producing food, thereby forming the landscape, and looking after the countryside. After the war it was as food producers that the nation looked to them and they responded to great effect. But no one in this life is allowed to rest on their laurels. Farmers' very success brought with it the seeds of the current difficulties&#x2014;surplus production and the need to restrain it and concern about some of the effects of farming on the environment.<lb/>
Farmers are well aware that people expect them to balance and reduce their output as against spending more time on the needs of the environment. At the same time, they must earn enough to provide for their daily bread. That is a difficult dichotomy and one which the Government well understand. Of course I agree with my noble friends Lord Plumb and Lord
<col>536</col>
Swinton, and let me make one thing crystal clear&#x2014;we remain committed to supporting efficient and productive farming.<lb/>
The new balance that farmers have to strike is mirrored in government. Agriculture Ministers have a statutory duty to seek a reasonable balance between the needs of agriculture and other interests in the countryside, including conservation. I should, therefore, like to underline our commitment to integrating environmental objectives fully into agricultural support measures. The White Paper <i>This Common Inheritance</i> describes both past achievements and the future approach to agricultural support. We are doing a great deal. We have been pioneers in Europe on this. Increasingly our approach is featuring in community measures.<lb/>
The most reverend Primate picked up the point that I am about to make. As my right honourable friend the Minister said at the General Synod yesterday, our agriculture is interlocked with Europe: 80 per cent. of the decisions are made in Brussels. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, that the GATT round will no doubt bring forth new developments. The GATT round is indeed moving into its final phase. The concluding ministerial meeting is due to open on 3rd December. The EC agriculture proposal is a major challenge for our agricultural industry and the rural economy. That is of course why the internal EC negotiations were so difficult. It is not clear what the final outcome in GATT will be. However, it will be vital to get agreement. All parties will need to compromise. All stand to benefit from a wide-ranging agreement.<lb/>
I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, is not here, but following his remarks&#x2014;I am paraphrasing&#x2014;that France and Germany were right to oppose the Community offer on GATT, I must reply and get on the record that if the EC had not been able to agree a negotiating position on agriculture, the whole GATT round would have been put at risk. That would have been highly irresponsible. The EC and the UK economies stand to benefit greatly from a GATT agreement on freer trade.<lb/>
I must assure the noble Baroness, Lady White, that there is no question of agreement on agriculture at any price; and no question of dismantling the CAP or of completely abandoning particular policies. Freer market conditions will not mean complete exposure to market forces. As my noble friend Lady Blatch made clear, one important element which is of particular relevance to your Lordships' debate today is that we are seeking to maintain and develop environmental and conservation policies which are likely to play an increasingly important role in the years ahead.<lb/>
The scene is a fast-changing one, and inevitably hand in hand with the actual farming of the land rural housing is an important part of that scene. My noble friend Lady Blatch devoted much of her excellent speech to that aspect. Let me pick up further queries raised by your Lordships. So many noble Lords spoke on the question of low-cost housing, starting with my noble friend Lord Middleton, that I really cannot name them all. However, I must begin by saying on
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0308"/>
<col>537</col>
this subject that we share noble Lords' concern that affordable housing needs to be available for those who live and work in rural areas if we are to maintain the viability of rural communities.<lb/>
We are determined to boost the supply of low-cost homes in rural areas, and we have introduced a number of measures since we announced our rural housing initiative in July 1988. As my right honourable friend explained, these include, first, changes to the planning rules allowing local authorities exceptionally to release small sites not previously designated for housing to meet local needs for low-cost housing; secondly, increased investment for housing associations in rural areas; and thirdly a new scheme announced last week to promote low-cost rural housing through local authorities.<lb/>
The Housing Corporation's capital investment programme is set to double between 1989&#x2013;90 and 1993&#x2013;94, topping the &#x00A3;2 billion mark for the first time, providing for a sustained increase in output of new subsidised housing for rent by housing associations. A big and increasing slice of this programme is going to rural areas.<lb/>
The &#x00A3;50 million of local authority credit approvals available next year will be targeted on the rural areas with the greatest needs to support a new programme for low-cost housing for rent. We would expect councils to use these resources mainly to support housing association activity in rural areas. This programme will act as a welcome spur to this urgently needed type of housing provision.<lb/>
May I just say that I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for giving me one of his questions before. As a matter of fact the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, also mentioned the number of rural houses. It is only just over two years since the special rural house building programme in England was announced. Housing corporation provision is building up steadily from modest beginnings to reach 1,500 per annum by 1992&#x2013;93. We have no means of measuring the number of houses that might be in the pipeline under the off plan land concession but we are hearing encouraging reports. We have also heard of a number of shared ownership schemes being delivered without public subsidy.<lb/>
The Rural Development Commission suggests that a fixed equity shared ownership scheme should be allowed in rural areas. We understand its view, but on balance we disagree. Most people want eventually to become full owners. We believe that people who have taken the first step into shared ownership should not be obliged to move in order to own their own home. We recognise that especially in small villages there is a need to preserve the limited stock of houses available for shared ownership. Therefore we have introduced the scheme enabling housing associations to buy those houses back when the first owner moves on.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, asked whether money from council house sales could be used for low-cost housing. That plea, which comes from all quarters, to allow local authorities to use more of their
<col>538</col>
capital receipts is based on a complete misunderstanding. The new capital finance system allows us to distribute resources much more sensibly among authorities according to their needs. Under the old system spending powers concentrated in the areas which had high receipts because they had sold large numbers of council houses. The new system, by requiring authorities to repay debts, enables us to give more money to authorities in need. Many of those will be in inner cities. But some will be in rural areas. That is surely fairer. We are able to allocate two-thirds of the total housing capital spending on the basis of assessed need compared with one-third previously. We make exceptions to the debt redemption rules where a good case exists, including help for low-cost home ownership.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Shuttleworth suggested new initiatives on rural housing and housing corporation funding. As I said, the housing corporation capital investment programme is set to double between 1989&#x2013;90 and 1993&#x2013;94, topping the &#x00A3;2 billion mark for the first time and providing for a sustained increase in output of newly subsidised housing for rent by housing associations. A large and increasing slice of that programme will go to rural areas.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked about the assessment of rural housing needs. Earlier this month <i>Housing for Wales</i> published results of two research projects on the nature of need for housing in rural Wales. We shall shortly be commissioning research into the need for housing in rural areas in England.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Selborne mentioned house building on land not previously designated for housing. I was delighted to hear that he has made good use of the change to the planning rules to encourage the construction of houses to meet local needs. I was also delighted that he found that the National Agricultural Centre Rural Trust, which is funded by the Rural Development Commission, gave him good and useful advice.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Middleton spoke of the extension of environmentally sensitive areas and bringing LFA payments closer to the environment. My noble friend Lady Blatch referred to the shift taking place within the CAP. In 1991 we shall be reviewing the ESA scheme when the results for the initial environmental and economic monitoring are available. That review will be important in guiding us on the approach we should build on for ESAs in future. Regarding payments in LFAs and what my noble friend Lord Prior said, we are examining whether existing environmental benefits afforded by HLCAs should be made more specific.<lb/>
The most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York and others referred to health service access. I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Masharn, for her recognition that special arrangements are made to encourage general practitioner doctors and pharmacists to provide services in rural areas. On 13th November the Government announced that rural GPs are to be better paid in recognition of the special demands of general practice in country areas. Small pharmacies in England which are at least 2 kilometres
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0309"/>
<col>539</col>
from the next pharmacy have special support arrangements which guarantee a minimum level of income.<lb/>
Several noble Lords also mentioned post offices and village shops. The Government and the Post Office remain committed to the maintenance of the network of rural post offices. To meet part of that commitment the Post Office has introduced a new type of office&#x2014;the community office, which is a part-time office often run from a local residence. A recent report on village shops prepared for the Rural Development Commission suggests that in England the rate of loss of village shops and rural sub-post offices has slowed down in recent years. The commission provides advice and training for village shopkeepers.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, referred to county councils being responsible for rural areas. County structure plans take account of the rural economy. My noble friend Lady Blatch also referred to the proposed new guidance on the countryside and the rural economy. Both the noble Lords, Lord Gallacher and Lord John-Mackie, spoke about the need to keep agricultural land available in case there is need for extra food production. I agree that there is still a need to protect the best agricultural land from development. That is a clear part of our objectives and we look to planning authorities to provide that protection.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Radnor referred to the difficulties involved in paying farmers to keep the countryside beautiful, but our ESA scheme has been extremely successful. I appreciate the points that he made and we continue to make efforts to minimise the bureaucracy of such schemes.<lb/>
The most reverend Primate, the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, and my noble friend Lord Swinton all mentioned schools. The Government recognise the degree of support that rural schools may command in the local community. Many small schools continue to be retained because of the geographical isolation of the communities that they serve and their value to those communities. In England and Wales where the closure of a school is proposed because, for example, its disproportionate level of resources cannot compensate sufficiently for the small size of the school, the proposal is treated on its individual merits. Factors such as the length of journey to the new school are taken into account.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, confined his remarks to the report, <i>Faith in the Countryside</i> and it must be for the Church to respond to what he said. However, I am sure that those associated with the Church have followed with interest what has been said by your Lordships today. It is clear that the noble Lord sees a vital role for the Church in our rural communities, both now and into the foreseeable future.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Plumb spoke about the difficulties of tracing pollution in water in some farms. I agree with my noble friend that the problems related to water are complex. That is why the Government place great emphasis on sound scientific research. For
<col>540</col>
example, on nitrate we have introduced our pilot nitrate-sensitive area scheme with compensation to farmers in order to begin tackling the problem and apply our research results in real conditions.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Plumb also spoke about the sympathetic conversion of redundant farm buildings. I certainly recognise the anxiety that has been expressed about some of the conversions of redundant farm buildings. Our old farm buildings are a familiar part of the countryside heritage and they add much to what we know and love of our rural areas. The Government are keen to ensure that the environment is taken into consideration when development takes place, be it new buildings or the conversion of old ones.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Shuttleworth spoke about the upland sheep farmers, identified in both reports as an endangered species. I was sorry to hear that my noble friend regards himself as an endangered species. I do not think the noble Baroness, Lady White, associated herself with those remarks; but perhaps I can reassure them both, and also my noble friend Lord Prior, that we recognise the difficulties facing sheep farmers in the hills and uplands. These problems will be taken into account in the current review of the HLCAs. The Government remain fully committed to supporting the livestock industry in less favoured areas. That is demonstrated by the expected payment of &#x00A3;125 million in HLCAs alone in 1990.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady White, spoke of her anxiety about livestock farming in Wales. With my recent change of responsibilities, I shall be taking even greater interest in Welsh affairs. I can understand the anxiety which she expressed. I pay tribute to the work of the development agencies and particularly that of the Welsh Development Agency which was mentioned by the noble Baroness. It is responsible for the development of rural areas other than those in mid-Wales which is the responsibility of the Development Board for Rural Wales. The schemes take the form of workshop development programmes and other enterprise promotion activities, including the promotion and marketing of Welsh foods and crafts. I am sure that there are not enough craft shops in Wales.<lb/>
The noble Duke, the Duke of Somerset, asked whether set-aside will reduce cereal production. The set-aside scheme was introduced in 1988 as part of a package of measures designed to curb overproduction and to bring the costs of the common agricultural policy under better control. The main aim of the scheme is to complement the overal1 price policy&#x2014;in particular, the operation of the agricultural stabiliser mechanism. It offers farmers most affected by support reductions an alternative income and also an opportunity to rethink their current farming practices as well as diversifying into new uses for their land. It was not designed to be a panacea for all the problems of cereal overproduction.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Elliot of Harwood said that diversification would have a limited impact in less favoured areas. The Government have never pretended that on-farm diversification will solve all
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0310"/>
<col>541</col>
farmers' problems or those of rural society more generally. Some farmers will not have the resources or the ability to diversify. Some will be too remote from markets though many will have the opportunity. It is important that they should be encouraged. More farmers have diversified than might have been thought likely. A recent study conducted by Exeter University has shown that nearly 23 per cent. of farmers in England and Wales have already diversified into non-agricultural businesses.<lb/>
My noble friends Lord Swinton and Lord Peel spoke about the importance of habitat management for game. I endorse my noble friend's views. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Game Conservancy. It is work that we commend and support. My noble friend Lord Peel referred to ELMS. That is a very worthwhile initiative. It follows a theme which is part of the Government's own thinking&#x2014;that is to say, that farmers should go out and look for markets for their environmental goods. I wish the CLA very well with it. We shall also look with interest at the development of the Countryside Commission's national countryside initiative.<lb/>
I found the speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, very moving. I do not have a great deal to say on the problems of the disabled in the countryside. She will know that indirectly I have understood and been part of them in a way. One or two of the points she raised worry me very much. Grants for livery enterprises are available under the farm diversification grant scheme. Livery enterprises have proved to be among the most numerous recipients of these grants. I am not at all sure that she knew about that. It is about time that she did&#x0021;<lb/>
The noble Baroness referred to the minimum value scheme now operating in this country with regard to the non-exportation of live horses and ponies. I can assure her that I am entirely on her side. What we all have to do is to convince our partners in Europe that our present scheme is the right one.<lb/>
I could make a great many other points but I hope that I have given everyone at least one bite of the cherry. I shall write to anyone who feels left out or aggrieved. It has been a great pleasure to take part in this debate. It has given me the chance to underline the importance the Government attach to a healthy rural economy. After three years in MAFF I know of the enormous willingness of farmers to play their part and to get right the balance about which I spoke at the beginning of my speech. I know how difficult the situation is for them. It is a hell of a thing to see one's world turned upside down. Of course farming is not the only industry to have faced major upheavals, but the situation is made no easier by saying that. The future of the industry is bound to be different from the past but fossilisation is not a recipe for the health and vitality we seek in the rural economy.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Elliot spoke of the need to protect the countryside for people's entertainment and enjoyment. The Government are fully committed to protecting the countryside for its own sake. They remain committed to upholding the policies on
<col>542</col>
national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. There will be opportunities to make things better than they were and we must all look for those opportunities and exploit them for all they are worth.</membercontribution></p>

If the report has merit then, as I have said when moving debates on similar reports in the past, it is due in great part to the assiduity of members of Sub-Committee D in obtaining relevant information from our excellent witnesses; it is due to the many individuals and bodies who tendered written evidence; and it is due, as I said earlier, to the skill and hard work of our clerk, his specialist assistant and our specialist adviser.<lb/>
I should like to thank the Government for their response to the report which was embodied in the most helpful speeches of the two noble Baronesses. I listened to what they said about the Government's policy in regard to rural housing, a matter of great concern to nearly every speaker. I shall read with enormous attention what they have said.<lb/>
Finally, I thank my noble friend Lady Trumpington for the great trouble she has taken to answer the many points raised. I should like to say how grateful I am to her for confirming that the prime objective of rural policy is to maintain the potential of the countryside to produce food and to ensure that that production is effective.<lb/>

<title>Census (Confidentiality) Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03521">9.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03522"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
Perhaps I may start by reminding your Lordships that the next census of population will be held in just over five months' time, on 21st April 1991. In Great Britain it will be carried out by the Registrar General for England and Wales and the Registrar General for Scotland, assisted by their respective offices: the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the General Register Office (Scotland). When I moved for approval of the draft census order on 21st December last year, I referred to the determination of the census offices to maintain their excellent record in preserving the confidentiality of personal census information. This Bill bears witness to that determination.<lb/>
In the light of the repeal of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, the registrars general have reviewed the legislation safeguarding census information. The current Bill, if enacted, will replace the second half of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0311"/>
<col>543</col>
Section 8 of the Census Act 1920&#x2014;the part which provides penalties for the unlawful disclosure of information by census staff. Section 8(2) as it stands covers staff employed in taking a census. It does not cover other staff of the two offices who need to have access to census information for statistical purposes; nor does it protect information collected in census tests and census-related surveys. This Bill is intended to close these gaps where hitherto reliance has been placed on Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. As well as the census next spring, a number of voluntary surveys associated with it are planned or under consideration. Hence the early introduction of the Bill at the start of this Session.<lb/>
Clause 1 would substitute six new subsections&#x2014;namely, subsections (2) to (7)&#x2014;for the existing subsection 8(2). The existing offence occurs where a person employed in taking a census discloses census information otherwise than in the ordinary course of his employment and has no lawful authority to do so. That is the primary offence. It also catches people who pass on information they have acquired as a result of unlawful disclosure; we may call this the processional offence. Offences under Section 8(2) carry a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and a fine.<lb/>
The changes in Clause 1 only affect the primary offence. Most of the changes are contained in the proposed new subsection (2), which extends the compass of the primary offence to disclosure by either registrar general or any member of his staff, not just by a person employed in actually taking a census. That will provide protection for the use of census data in statistical and medical studies and in surveys carried out by staff of the census offices under the authority of Section 5 of the Census Act.<lb/>
The proposed subsection (2) also brings in any supplier of services to either registrar general and the employees of those who supply such services. The information protected by subsection (2) is personal census information. I draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that definitions are given at subsection (7). Subsection (7)(i) refers to Sections 2 and 4 of the Census Act. The information acquired under Section 2 is so defined in the Bill as to include not only information collected on the census forms but also information acquired incidentally; for example, by a census field worker while visiting someone's home. This also brings in information collected in the voluntary census tests conducted in advance of the census as part of the duty of the registrars general to make such arrangements as may be necessary for taking a census.<lb/>
Under Section 4 of the Census Act, information is collected in surveys to help the registrars general report on the census returns. We now propose to follow previous practice by holding a voluntary sample survey after the census to check the accuracy of the census information. We also plan to collect census information from households whose members may be away from home over the census period but who agree to fill in a form when they return home.<lb/>
Therefore, the proposed subsection (7) also covers surveys to collect further information on samples of
<col>544</col>
people or households identified from the census returns. That is the purpose of the definition in paragraph (ii) in subsection (7) referring to Section 5 of the Act. As I said last December, the data collected in these surveys will be handled entirely within the census offices and treated in strict confidence. The Bill will reinforce, with legal sanctions, the administrative protection given to all the further information collected in such census-related surveys.<lb/>
The proposed subsection (2) refers not just to census information but to personal census information, defined as information relating to an identifiable person or household. Thus it focuses the protection more closely than is done by the Census Act 1920 as it now stands, where the existing Section 8(2) relates to any information obtained in the census. Here we are following the principle behind the recent reform of official secrets legislation by giving statutory protection where, but only where, it is really needed.<lb/>
We are not trying to make criminals of public servants acting in good faith. The proposed subsection (4) provides defences for people who reasonably and genuinely believe either that they had proper legal authority for disclosing information that they have released or that no one could be identified from the information. However, the registrars general will be issuing instructions to all their staff to ensure that they are under no misapprehension about what they may disclose and to whom.<lb/>
Subsections (3) and (5) preserve the processional offence, where someone passes on information which has been disclosed illegally.<lb/>
Northern Ireland has its own registrar general who carries out censuses under the Census Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. Clause 2 of the Bill will enable provisions corresponding to those for Great Britain in Clause 1 to be applied to Northern Ireland by Order in Council.<lb/>
Since 1921 there has only been one prosecution for unlawful disclosure of census information and we hope the provisions of this Bill will not have to be invoked, but it is important to put them in place before next year's census. We believe that the Bill will not only close a gap but reassure anyone concerned about the thoroughness of the protection given to personal census information. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;<i>(Baroness Hooper.)</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03523">9.46</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03524"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for explaining this highly technical Bill so well. I shall be brief. The Bill is non-contentious. It is largely technical. I should like to put just two points to the Minister. It has been pointed out to me that some information collected locally could enable individuals or groups to be identified unless there is a minimum level for any such group. Some combination of features, for example in a sparsely populated area, may just enable certain individuals to be identified. Is there any protection against that? If the Minister would like to write to me before the Committee stage,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0312"/>
<col>545</col>
rather than respond now I should be happy. It is a point that has been put forward by one or two organisations, and one which they would like clarified.<lb/>
My second point is important. I informed the Minister that I would raise it. Can information collected for the census be used in any way in connection with the poll tax to identify potential payers or non-payers or to assist in the compilation of the community charge register? Is the census information specifically excluded from the various sources of information that can be used to assist in the compilation of the community charge register?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03525">9.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03526"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for his participation in this Second Reading debate. On the point that he raised about the community charge, I can give a firm assurance that there is no cause for concern on that score. With or without the Bill, there is no lawful authority for passing to community charge registration officers or anyone else outside census offices personal information given on the completed census returns. Therefore no one in those offices will be entitled to do so. Even under Section 8(2) of the Census Act, it would be an offence for those employed on the census, including the registrars general themselves, to pass the information to any person for purposes other than those of the Census Act.<lb/>
The Bill will provide legal sanctions should anyone else ever be in a position to act unlawfully in that regard. Anyone will be able to see how many adults have been counted in an area for which census statistics are available and compare that number with a number from another source. But the census will not give community charge officials the names of individuals living at addresses, and in any case by the time census data are published that information may well be somewhat out of date and no longer directly relevant to the people then living in the area concerned.<lb/>
I can assure your Lordships that the proposals announced last December to include a check on the electoral register as part of the voluntary sample survey which is conducted to validate the census, will provide no basis for focusing on individuals or households. I hope that I have been able to satisfy the noble Lord.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Hospices: Government Funding</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03527">9.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03528"><member>The Earl of Longford</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government when their commitment to pound for pound funding for the hospices will be honoured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03529">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the purpose of this Unstarred Question should be plain to all, including the Minister. I have given her full information about what I propose to say. I hope that by this time she realises the high regard I have for her and perhaps she
<col>546</col>
will convey to the new Minister with responsibility for health how happy I am that he is taking over from his colleague. The new Minister has a brilliant academic record. In some eyes that is perhaps a disadvantage as people at once suspect someone who is immensely clever. However, I believe that it is a plus mark; we need intelligence in this difficult area in which so large a proportion of the public is interested. Let us look forward with hope to the new Minister proving even more successful than his predecessor.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03530">My purpose is plain: to press the Government&#x2014;having been given notice I do not know how many times&#x2014;to tell us clearly how and when they propose to honour their commitment to make sure that the hospices receive 50 per cent. of their total spending, pound for pound&#x2014;that is, &#x00A3;1 from public money for every &#x00A3;1 raised by voluntary subscriptions. There is nothing extraordinary about this commitment; the 50 per cent. arrangement is already operating in Scotland and again and again the Government have indicated their desire to honour it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03531">As regards this matter there is no party political issue; no party is remotely concerned here. However, before coming to the crucial, practical issue, I wish to say one word about the hospices. I dwelt on the subject at greater length on 31st October last year and I shall not repeat what I said then. I venture the opinion quite confidently that among all the excellent developments of the National Health Service in recent years none has been quite so noble as the development of the hospice service. I say that irrespective of anything done or not done by governments. It has been a wonderful human initiative.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03532">If one asks, "What can hospices offer that is not offered elsewhere?", the answer is a quality of life for those suffering incurable illness or dying. I understand that hospices today are not referred to as places to die but as places to live. There has been a remarkable harmony between what we might call the spiritual and medical initiatives, exemplified perhaps by Dame Cicely Saunders, OBE, more than anybody else, but also by many others. We find in hospices a coming together of the spiritual and medical, which in my experience is something unique. There have been big developments in hospice care but I do not wish to imply that one can only die with dignity when under hospice care. On Sunday I said goodbye to Malcolm Muggeridge, who was then unconscious. His devoted wife and brother were sitting at his bedside. Nothing could have been more inspiring than the serenity and beauty of the whole situation. I do not think one can say there is anything tragic about such a situation, unless one thinks that death is tragic. However, I do not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03533">I believe a good quality of life can be provided in all kinds of situations. I can say with absolutely no fear of contradiction that in the hospices a great many people are helped to die with dignity. They are also helped to live for quite a long time in a way that makes their lives worth living. Some people achieve that in the hospices who could not achieve it in other places.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03534">There is no doubt that this is, mercifully, a subject where party politics do not come in. The hospices have
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0313"/>
<col>547</col>
been strongly supported in all parts of the House. In this area humanity reigns supreme. I must offer a few quotations to the House. They will be familiar to the noble Baroness as I have already supplied her with a copy of them. The House will also remember the quotations as they concern a Starred Question of 31st October. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, asked a Question on the hospices. The noble Baroness speaks with first-hand authority on hospices. I always listen to her with particular respect for two reasons: first, because she is such a good Christian and, secondly, because she is a nurse. A Christian nurse is the tops, in my opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03535">The noble Baroness asked the Government on 31st October, at col. 1840 of the <i>Official Report,</i> how they intended,
<quote>"to fulfil their commitment to achieve matched giving to voluntary hospices".</quote>
The noble Baroness stated:
<quote>"hospices were encouraged by the Government Statement in December 1989 to plan their strategies on the basis of 50 per cent. funding".</quote>
I seldom quote anyone speaking on the other side of the House to this extent, but one has to make a start somewhere.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03536">The noble Baroness further stated:
<quote>"There is a real urgency for the situation to be addressed, otherwise hospices already face problems of redundancies and bed closures. That is a great tragedy given the enormously important services that hospices provide and the great dedication of staff who work in them".</quote>
I certainly could not express those sentiments better myself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03537">In reply the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, who is to reply to the debate tonight, said:
<quote>"I can assure my noble friend that the Government are still working towards that aim".</quote>
Those words need to be carefully studied. On the face of it, that is rather like saying that the Government are working towards the reduction of inflation. That may happen at any time but it does not actually happen. However, the Minister made that point more positively in reply to a question that I put later on in that Question Time. The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, said at col. 1841 of the <i>Official Report:</i><lb/>
<quote>"We are still working towards that commitment".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03538">I stress the word "commitment". A commitment is not just a good intention; it is a promise and an undertaking. I am bound to ask the Government how they are working towards fulfilling their promise. That is the issue before us and it is worth raising it even at this rather late hour.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03539">At the same Question Time the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, asked:
<quote>"is the Minister aware that originally the hospice movement asked for &#x00A3;23 million this year and received &#x00A3;8 million? She spoke of &#x00A3;11 million for next year. Is the Minister aware that to match giving pound for pound &#x00A3;30 million is now required?".</quote>
That is reported at col. 1842 of <i>Hansard.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03540">I should explain to anyone who is befuddled by those figures that the &#x00A3;8 million goes up to &#x00A3;11 million if one includes Scotland, where the Government are
<col>548</col>
already matching pound for pound. Therefore, whether one calls it &#x00A3;8 million for England and Wales or &#x00A3;11 million including Scotland the sum in no way approaches the government commitment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03541">We are all aware of the immense variety in the circumstances of the hospices and in the extent of their public funding. I pointed out last year that some hospices receive no public funds. One example is St. Luke's in Plymouth, where, as some noble Lords know, the medical director is Dr. Sheila Cassidy&#x2014;and if they do not know they are impoverished. Anyone who wants to hear her preaching on prayer should go to Westminster Abbey in the near future. She is a remarkable woman. Now the hospice will receive a share&#x2014;although it cannot be a very large share&#x2014;of the &#x00A3;8 million which has been conferred by the Government. A year ago it received nothing and now it will receive a little.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03542">It is difficult not to take an example if one wants to make a point, but any example in a sense cannot be typical because there are such variations. However, perhaps 1 may take an example from the area where I live, East Sussex. St. Michael's Hospice, Hastings, will spend &#x00A3;600,000 this year. Just under &#x00A3;100,000 will be received from the district health authority. As a result of the provision by the Government of new funds last year St. Michael's will receive more than &#x00A3;50,000 from that source. That is called the Bottomley money after Mrs. Virginia Bottomley, who is the Minister concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03543">As a result, a quarter of the hospice's funding will be provided from public money as compared with half of the funding, to which the Government are committed. I hope that they will not run away from that commitment and that the word "commitment" will not be elided into some phrase about an aim or an objective. I ask what is to be done in that one case about raising the public funding from one-quarter to one-half in accordance with the Government's commitment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03544">I have tried to pursue the matter locally. Naturally I approached the regional health authority. It says that it has no more money and that if more money were given to the hospices some other vital service would be deprived of the funds. I shall not accept that in detail. It may be possible to squeeze out more money by greater efficiency. However, without going into the question of whether that is 100 per cent. true, it is broadly true that if the Government's commitment is to be fulfilled it cannot be achieved by calling upon the local authorities, the district authorities or the regional authorities to find the money. The money must come from central government or the Government will be betraying their trust. That is the simple issue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03545">We should like to know whether the Minister agrees&#x2014;be the proportion a quarter or perhaps a third over the country as a whole&#x2014;that it should be raised to a half of the funding. I must ask the Minister whether she accepts the commitment for the central government to find the money. That is the simple issue before us tonight.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0314"/>
<col>549</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03546">I shall touch on other topics in a moment but that is the issue in question and we must not run away from it. If the Government are committed to it they should go to the regional authorities and tell them that they should find the means. In fact they know perfectly well that they cannot do so. It is a very simple issue that faces us tonight.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03547">There are one or two other issues which I might mention. In the Minister's statement of 13th July there is a reference to contracts. I shall not discuss that matter tonight. It fills me with disquiet and it has also filled with disquiet a good many people in the office world. There was a reference in the reply that the Minister gave to some system of contracts in the future. However, I shall leave that matter for tonight.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03548">There is also the question, which will always arise in a matter of this kind, of how far this government money is to be distributed. How will it be worked out? Many questions could be raised on that issue. There are other points too. It could be asked whether any authorities will lose under the new arrangements about income support. There are issues of considerable importance. On the face of it, it may be that an authority obtains more money and then the hospice loses it through income support.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03549">Those matters may be raised but I do not want to distract attention from the central issue. Are the Government ready tonight, through the Minister, upon whose word we rely absolutely, to stand firm by their commitment and how soon will it be honoured? If they give an evasive answer I shall view their reply with contempt. That is the last word that I would ever wish to apply to the noble Baroness and so I hope for good news when she comes to speak.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03550">10.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03551"><member>Baroness Cox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank my noble friend the Duke of Norfolk for allowing me to change places with him in the batting order so that I may the sooner relieve my noble colleague on the Woolsack from his responsibilities there.<lb/>
I should like to begin by congratulating the noble Earl, Lord Longford, for initiating this very timely and important debate on this crucial subject and for introducing it with his customary eloquence, charm, wit and sensitivity. I must declare an interest. I have the great privilege of being a member of the Council of Management of St. Christopher's Hospice. I therefore have in mind the particular concerns of that hospice. But they reflect the wider concerns of the whole hospice movement in this country at the present time. Therefore I trust that what I have to say will have relevance beyond the immediate experience of St. Christopher's.<lb/>
At the outset I want to join the noble Earl, Lord Longford, in paying tribute to the hospice movement, the ideals on which it is founded and all who work in it. Those ideals have transformed the care of the dying and those who love them. In traditional hospital care the inevitable tendency has been to define those for whom no cure is available and who have entered
<col>550</col>
terminal illness as those for whom "there is nothing more to do" other than to try to control pain and provide as much tender loving care as possible.<lb/>
But in the inevitable busyness and hurly-burly of a hospital ward, with the best will in the world it is often impossible to provide the most beneficial conditions for the care of the dying and their families. By contrast hospices have been able to specialise in the care of the terminally ill. In so doing they have developed great expertise in palliative care with the control of pain and other unpleasant symptoms. They have also developed a comprehensive service for the support of the families or other loved ones, helping them through the difficult days of seeing the person whom they love, dying and then continuing with the bereavement service, as in due course they have to come to terms with their grief and loss.<lb/>
That approach to the care of the dying has revolutionised the experience of death itself for countless people. The realistic reassurance of pain and symptom control, combined with the embracing of the family in their distress, means that it is often possible to conceive of a good death, of death as a part of life, and to achieve a well ordered, peaceful farewell to life and loved ones.<lb/>
The achievement of the ideals and practices of the hospice work entails high personal costs for those who work in the hospice movement either in the hospices themselves, or in outreach work in the community &#x2014;caring for people dying in their own homes. The personal and emotional demands on staff are very great indeed. For example, St. Christopher's staff recently gave a presentation illustrating not only the experiences of what they described in their presentation as "A family in pain" with the loss of a loved one, but also of "A team in pain" with the pressures and sorrows of working continually with human suffering, grief and death.<lb/>
Therefore I believe that it is very unfortunate that staff who may already be under great stress, perhaps at the limit of their endurance because of the nature of their work, should also be subjected to acute anxieties about the availability of funding necessary for them to continue to provide their unique ministry.<lb/>
That brings me to the general question of resources and to the specific question which is the subject of the debate. The extra support that has been given by the Government for 1990 and 1991 of &#x00A3;8 million has been most welcome. However, that does not meet anything like the level of matched giving. Moreover, in some cases the existing district health authority support for voluntary hospices has been reduced in the expectation that that loss would be made up from that &#x00A3;8 million. In the original announcement made on 15th December last year in another place, when stating the Government's commitment to provide matched funding, my honourable friend indicated that it would create a closer partnership between the NHS and the hospice movement. She also stressed that the arrangement would provide a clear basis on which hospices could plan ahead. However, committing hard-pressed health authorities to provide 50 per cent. of hospice funding without giving them the means to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0315"/>
<col>551</col>
do so is not conducive to a closer partnership. Instead it has been in many places divisive and a cause of friction.<lb/>
Moreover, health authorities are saying that they do not have the means to provide that matched funding and that they are not in a position to do so without more central funding. That means that although hospices were encouraged to plan their services on the basis of matched giving, they now find that they have no idea when that will be available and, as the noble Earl, Lord Longford, indicated, many long awaited developments are seriously under threat.<lb/>
Many hospices are also fearful of the negotiations which have to take place with health authorities over contracts. In the case of St. Christopher's Hospice, contracts will have to be made with nine different health authorities. That will generate a considerable burden of extra work with no guarantee of a reasonable financial outcome. Those responsible for hospice finances therefore consider that it is vital for matched funding to take effect before contracts are entered into and they are very fearful of the consequences if that is not achieved.<lb/>
In the short debate following the Starred Question that I asked recently, the Minister assured your Lordships that the Government would stand by their commitment to match funding. That was indeed reassuring. However, "standing by" is not the same as fulfilling. While the Government are standing by, the hospice movement is suffering. Some hospices have closed beds. Developments are under threat. The staff too are suffering from the additional burden of financial stress on top of the stress inherent in their professional work.<lb/>
That really is unacceptable. The hospice movement is highly cost-effective, operating with so much charitable support and voluntary contributions of all kinds. It is also highly care-effective, relieving NHS hospitals of some of the most demanding and difficult cases of palliative and terminal care with their distinctive and ultimately worthwhile ministry.<lb/>
I wish to ask my noble friend two questions. First, will the Government now give a commitment to achieve matched funding within a clearly specified timescale, say by April 1992? That would enable those working in the hospice movement to plan realistically. They could think ahead and it would give them the much-needed encouragement to continue their valuable work. Secondly, will the Government provide health authorities with the specific additional funding necessary to fulfil the obligations to ensure matched funding so that the money is not lost or dissipated <i>en route?</i><lb/>
I conclude with a brief quotation from the book edited by Dame Cicely Saunders called <i>St. Christopher's In Celebration, 21 Years at Britain's First Modern Hospice.</i> She concludes her introduction with these words:
<quote>"We celebrate a place where 'the new life rising within us' has had an opportunity to grow".</quote>
It would be tragic if the Government's failure to honour their commitment to matched funding
<col>552</col>
resulted in the stifling of that new life which has been growing so magnificently in the hospice movement. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the House, and more importantly all those who work with such dedication in the hospice movement, that the new life it embodies will be able to continue to grow.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03553"><member>The Duke of Norfolk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too declare an interest. Some years ago my wife and I visited St. Joseph's Hospice in Hackney. It is the second oldest hospice in the country and was working in the 19th century. We were so impressed that we founded an appeal and my wife founded a movement called Help the Hospices of which she is chairman. It is of great importance at the present time.<lb/>
It was in the name of Help the Hospices that my wife met Virginia Bottomley and talked about funding. In December 1989 it was agreed that they would work towards 50&#x2013;50 funding, as is the case in Scotland. Incidentally, the other day I learnt that Northern Ireland receives two-thirds funding. I ask only for 50&#x2013;50 funding as was promised by Virginia Bottomley during the meeting last December.<lb/>
When announcing the extra &#x00A3;8 million funding for England Ministers stated that it would bring the level of NHS support to &#x00A3;20 million. In fact, during the past year only &#x00A3;6 million was allocated to voluntary hospices by regional and district health authorities. That allocation has been very uneven. Charitable funding to meet the running costs of voluntary hospices, excluding Scotland, amounts to more than &#x00A3;50 million a year. It would therefore be necessary for the Government, in allowing for 50&#x2013;50 funding, to allocate more than &#x00A3;30 million now. That is very different from the &#x00A3;6 million that they have given. Even then health authorities would have to accept that the extra money should be allocated solely to cover the running costs of each voluntary hospice. We are talking only about the running costs. That point is every bit as crucial as the availability of the money required.<lb/>
In my view, it is unreasonable to expect the Government to predict when the problem can be satisfactorily resolved. It is more realistic to ask how and by what process Ministers will ensure that their intentions and their policy will, through the regional and district health authorities, be fulfilled. Then we might know whether "working towards" means something other than a progressive allocation of more and more money. It should mean working towards a goal which regional health authorities, under some form of direction, earmarking or obligation are actually going to implement.<lb/>
I believe that there is a second and even more important point that should be made. Health Ministers are presumably looking forward to the time when the provisions of the new health Act will apply &#x2014;I see the noble Lord, Lord Carter, nodding in agreement&#x2014;and when health services are provided through contracts with health authorities. Will the Government explain how they see this 50&#x2013;50 funding applying, or even being worked towards, which is the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0316"/>
<col>553</col>
phrase being used, for the voluntary sector in, say, 1993? Can we look that far ahead? Can they explain how they are going to reach that 50&#x2013;50, pound for pound, in 1993?<lb/>
If no such system is planned I have to agree that the Government's intentions in this matter are hollow. The two speakers who spoke before me, the noble Earl, Lord Longford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, said the same. I have supported the Government and I do still in every way&#x2014;let me say unequivocally that I support the present Prime Minister&#x2014;but I say without wanting to needle the Government that we have been let down. Will the Minister please bear that in mind when she replies?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03555"><member>Baroness Ryder of Warsaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would be impossible for me to overstress the urgency of the point that has been raised by the noble Earl, Lord Longford. The drain on the funds of those charities involved in the care of the sick and the dying is now running at a truly alarming rate. The charity of which I am a founder had to find over &#x00A3;1.5 million last year from central funds to help its homes. This year the sum is expected to rise to over &#x00A3;3 million, and the forecast is that next year it may be in the region of &#x00A3;4 million. That is over and above all the local fund-raising that the homes themselves are able to achieve and takes no account of capital expenditure, which all homes need to make from time to time.<lb/>
These demands, if not reduced, could bring to a standstill the foundation's plans to expand its badly needed services and could seriously damage the services being provided. I would therefore wholeheartedly agree with the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Longford. Bearing in mind the thousands of sick and handicapped with whom we have the privilege of working it seems most unfortunate that the foundation I represent, and also the Marie Curie Foundation and the hospices, are obliged to make such hugh efforts to raise funds themselves.<lb/>
I could quote dozens of examples from the past 40 years among the sick and the dying and those whose families, if they have one, are so distressed because they cannot cope with nursing them, especially at night, if they are not admitted to a hospice, a Marie Curie or Sue Ryder home. For board and lodging we receive an allowance from the Department of Social Security of &#x00A3;260 per week for patients in receipt of, or eligible for, income support. Later, a long claim form has to be completed and signed by a patient when he is so ill and often is dying. Later still, when he has died, the form is normally posted to the next of kin, who may well not post it back to the Sue Ryder home. To be frank, that leaves my foundation the poorer.<lb/>
If patients are in receipt of an attendance allowance of between &#x00A3;25 and &#x00A3;27 a week on admission, that is normally paid over to the Sue Ryder home. However, a claim made after the patient enters the home is often not allowed due to some contributions made annually by the health authorities. A great improvement could and would be made if board and lodging which dated
<col>554</col>
from the day of admission were payable to the Sue Ryder home. Treatment by DSS offices varies considerably throughout the country, and there is a perpetual struggle to obtain allowances. Meanwhile, the patient is dying, has died or is being discharged.<lb/>
I appreciate that the government commitment to which the noble Lord referred relates only to hospice care. I shall therefore confine myself to the help received so far from government sources by my foundation's cancer care homes. For every &#x00A3;1 provided for them from charitable sources this year, we received only 45p from health authorities; that included our share of the &#x00A3;8 million. Were the Government's commitments to be honoured this year we could expect health authority grants, including a share of the &#x00A3;8 million, to increase from &#x00A3;775,000 to &#x00A3;1,245,000. That would not resolve the financial problems to which I referred, but it would go a long way towards helping them.<lb/>
I urge the Government to take steps to ensure that the commitment that they clearly gave that funds which come from government sources will match those from charity sources is honoured without delay. If the present method of distributing the &#x00A3;8 million made available to 1990&#x2013;91 cannot ensure that all of it reaches the voluntary organisations entitled to it, perhaps some other arrangements can please be made.<lb/>
There are generous funds made by central government for many other charities. When I inquired and had the opportunity recently to meet the Minister, the right honourable Mrs. Virginia Bottomley, I was told that there were no funds for our charity. How can that be said when such blatant evidence is there for all to see? I refer to a long list in your Lordships' Library.<lb/>
There has been little or no mention of the necessity of providing funds directly to the charity; that is, the hospice movement, the Marie Curie homes or the Sue Ryder homes, rather than sending funds to the health authorities which can then decide to whom they want the funds distributed. That is quite paradoxical as direct funding works well in Scotland. The Scottish Office gives one-quarter of running costs and health boards give another quarter, which equals 50 per cent.<lb/>
I can give an illustration of one Sue Ryder home which receives &#x00A3;8,500 per year from two area health authorities towards the &#x00A3;700,000 which must be raised every year to cover the full nursing and caring costs. From 1st January to 30th June 115 patients in that particular home attended a daycare centre; staff made regular bereavement visits; 180 visits were made by domiciliary nurses, and 297 patients were cared for of whom 120 died in peace and without pain.<lb/>
No other facilities are offered in an area with a population of over 800,000 except for 10 beds in a small hospice. So pressed are the local consultants and doctors who worked with us in the Sue Ryder Foundation that the cobalt unit in the local hospital &#x2014;again paid for by local funds&#x2014;has only 30 beds. It admits patients on Mondays for radio therapy. They are discharged on Friday and at the weekend patients
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0317"/>
<col>555</col>
are admitted for chemotherapy. As I have already said, there is also a shortage of nurses in that radio therapy centre.<lb/>
This foundation which I represent tries to absorb some of the patients who are discharged from National Health Service hospitals as well as people from society in general, but it is faced with a vast and appalling increase in VAT and a continuing increase in nurses' salaries. No one knows how the foundation will cope, year in year out, and it is not the practice of the foundation to turn away sick people. I ask the Minister and noble Lords how they think the foundation can cope, now and in the future.<lb/>
We are always hearing that needy people depend upon the voluntary sector, but this is a blatant example of a situation where little or no help that we can absolutely count upon is given by the government for the very people the government suggest the voluntary sector should care for. This work does not come cheap, either in terms of money or human effort.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03557"><member>Lord Dunleath</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Longford, for having once again raised the matter of hospices. We have both spoken on this subject on previous occasions. I think that what the noble Earl has said in the past, and perhaps something of what I have said in the past, has helped to bring about a situation in Northern Ireland with which he would be satisfied. I am not aware whether the noble Earl is familiar with the way things are at present, but we have had very good treatment compared with Great Britain. I believe that what the noble Earl, and other noble Lords, have said has contributed to that end.<lb/>
In Northern Ireland direct rule comes in for a certain amount of flak from time to time, but credit where credit is due. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has taken a very personal interest in the Northern Ireland hospice and in the hospice movement. When a tight ship is run in the Northern Ireland Office and Ministers are personally interested in such matters, it is possible to get things done. I am extremely grateful for that. I am also grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Longford, for his support of the hospice movement.<lb/>
The only reservation we have in Northern Ireland is that with the way things are at the moment it is not possible to plan for more than two years ahead. However, with a hospice or a similar institution clearly one must plan more than two years ahead. While the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is in office I have complete confidence that Northern Ireland will continue to receive sympathetic treatment, but time, like an ever-rolling stream, bears all its sons away and on occasions, unfortunately, bears some of its daughters away, too. Therefore, we cannot be entirely confident as to the future. Nevertheless, I express gratitude to Her Majesty's Government, and particularly to the Minister, for the way in which he has supported the hospice. I hope that it is a
<col>556</col>
foundation which, having been laid, will result in continuing support in future. I thank the noble Lord for his assistance in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03558"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must respond by saying that that is the first time anyone has said that I did any good in Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03561"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to thank the noble Earl, Lord Longford, for bringing to your Lordships' notice the need for funding for hospices. At present we all know that many great changes are taking place in the running of the National Health Service. Recently I attended a seminar of regional, district and family health service authority members. Two members of the King's Fund centre had travelled to Yorkshire to be the main speakers at the seminar which was about the new National Health Service.<lb/>
At question time at the seminar I asked about the future funding of hospices. It seemed to me that this very important subject had not been included in the brief. That is why I am pleased that the noble Earl has brought up this matter tonight. I look forward to hearing the Answer of the noble Baroness. I hope that she will be able to clear up some of the problems of uncertainty. A long time ago I served on a community health council before going on to serve with the Yorkshire Regional Health Authority. I now serve with the FHSA for North Yorkshire.<lb/>
I know that hospice support is very patchy. The CHC received a letter from a young man who was dying of cancer and who was a patient in a general hospital ward at the local district hospital. He wrote a most heartrending account of why a general ward was not the best place in which to die. I have visited several hospices. What struck me most was the gratitude of the patients for being in a relaxed atmosphere with people around them who understood their condition, and for the fact that they were able to have their pain controlled.<lb/>
The other great advantage is the home care support service which treats patients in their own homes but has the hospice as a base. It is wonderful thing and something that we fully appreciate; namely, that everyone who is terminally ill should be able to have the choice of hospice care if he so wishes. One of the hospices that I visited was in Sunderland. I think that I am right in saying that it was, and still is, most likely run entirely by the National Health Service. In that hospice there was some special equipment, such as low air loss beds, to prevent pressure sores. This equipment was of immense benefit to some of the patients.<lb/>
The nursing staff understood and were trained in the use of these technical aids which can save much suffering. What worries me slightly about the noble Earl's Question concerning pound for pound funding is that some areas may not be as affluent as others &#x2014;here I speak of the North East&#x2014;and there might
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0318"/>
<col>557</col>
have to be total funding. If a hospice which had been part of the National Health Service suddenly found that it had to find half of the running costs, it might not survive. That would be a serious matter for the community at large.<lb/>
However, when the money starts to follow the patient, would that not also apply to a patient going into a hospice? Perhaps the Minister can answer these questions. There is no doubt that hospices need security, especially as fund-raising may become more difficult. My hope&#x2014;which applies to any patient who is ill and who needs good medical care and treatment &#x2014;is that the patient will get it without having to worry about the money. I hope that all terminally ill patients will have the opportunity to die with dignity if they possibly can.<lb/>
The first hospice for AIDS patients will shortly be opening in Scotland. I am sure that this is not before time. I should like to ask the Minister what plans the Government have for prisoners who become ill with AIDS and need the correct care when they are dying. Today a Question was asked about a ward for AIDS patients at Hammersmith Hospital not being used for its originally planned purpose. There is also an extra ward at Westminster Hospital unable to open to AIDS patients because of lack of money.<lb/>
What will happen in a few years' time when many more people will be dying due to infection from contaminated needles used for injecting drugs? I think it is important that there should be some forward planning, with the Home Office and the Department of Health working together and not hiding behind the prison wall saying that prisons have adequate facilities. To have seriously ill patients with AIDS in prison must be very bad for the morale of everyone involved.<lb/>
The hospice movement has expanded over recent years to include care for children. I feel it should also expand so that all people, including prisoners, who need a hospice place to die with dignity will have it. As your Lordships will, I am sure, agree, it is much easier to raise money for children than it would be for prisoners. Therefore we should have some flexibility.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03563"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to my noble friend Lord Longford for giving us a chance to debate this important topic. It is a topic which he has brought to the attention of the House before and on which I know he will continue to harry the Government until he receives a satisfactory answer. Your Lordships will know that once my noble friend takes an interest in something he does not easily give up.<lb/>
Other speakers in the debate have covered the ground most expertly and adequately, so I will not need to detain the House for very long. It is clear that a good deal of clarification is required concerning the amount of direct government funding for hospices, the amount which health authorities are supplying both in cash and in kind, and the shortfall in the
<col>558</col>
Government's own commitment to pound for pound funding. There is also concern about the reforms in the health service which are due to take effect next April.<lb/>
To put it simply, how do the Government propose to operate an internal market in terminal care? Will standards of palliative care be written into NHS contracts; and if standards are written in, how will they be monitored? How is the purchase of provider relationships supposed to work for hospice care? How is it expected&#x2014;this point has been made by other noble Lords&#x2014;that pound for pound funding will work when the internal market is introduced? Will the funding for hospices be in effect ring fenced so that the funds cannot be raided for other purposes?<lb/>
The point has also been made that the postponement of the introduction of community care plans until 1993 may have created a major problem for hospices as regards their funding from the Department of Social Security. I should like to know whether the DSS is interpreting the allocation of Department of Health funds to voluntary hospices as a reason for reducing or removing the allocation of the DSS funds for income support and board and lodging. A number of cases have been quoted where hospices are experiencing a net reduction in their total funding from the DSS and the Department of Health together. It would be helpful if the Minister could comment on that point.<lb/>
I hope that she will not mind if I say that her answer to the Starred Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, on 31st October was somewhat less than clear on these matters, although I appreciate that her reply was constrained by the need to await the Chancellor's Autumn Statement. However, the Statement has now been made and therefore the noble Baroness can be much more forthcoming in her reply. We are confident that she will be.<lb/>
There is no need for me to repeat the questions which have already been put to the Minister. She will be aware of the very real anxiety which now exists in the hospice movement. We all hope that she can allay those fears. It is right for us to press the Minister regarding resources, but it would be wrong to concentrate purely on money and not say something about the marvellous work carried out by the hospice movement. There is an American aphorism which says:
<quote>"The rest of your life begins today".</quote>
In a curious way that maxim seems to be particularly relevant to the work of the hospice movement. Those who work in it are much more concerned with living than with dying. The rest of the life of those for whom they care begins on the day that they come into care. Those of us who have cared for loved ones during their last days, or in some cases their last years, know that every day of that care is a blessing. Those who work in hospices express love for their neighbour in the most selfless terms.<lb/>
I know that governments have to make harsh choices when allocating scarce resources, but I very
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0319"/>
<col>559</col>
much hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that they have been able to find the resources to fund the hospice movement properly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03564">10.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03565"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Longford, and to all those who have spoken so warmly about the achievements and the worries of the hospice movement. I know that this is a topic of abiding interest and I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm the Government's attitude and intentions. I shall certainly convey the noble Earl's remarks to my right honourable friend the new Secretary of State for Health.<lb/>
As has been said, we debated this question fully last year. Since that time, I have had the opportunity to add to my first-hand knowledge on the subject by visiting the Princess Alice Hospice in Surrey, the Mildmay Mission Hospital and the Hospice Care Trust in North Devon. Even after acquiring this increased first-hand knowledge, I find that it is easier to recognise what the hospice movement is than to describe it.<lb/>
Hospice care is not about a disease or a building; it is first of all about people. It is a concept of care founded on high technical standards of pain and symptom control and &#x2014;just as important&#x2014;on social, emotional and spiritual support for patients and their families, so as to maximise quality of life right up to the end and through into bereavement. Hospice care is essentially a multidisciplinary approach but it is also more than that; it has helped to broaden the concept of teamwork, beyond harnessing the strengths of a range of professionals and voluntary helpers, into the active involvement of the patient himself and his family in the planning and provision of care. As has been said in this debate and in previous debates on the subject, one of the major benefits this concept has brought is a greater openness all round on the subject of death&#x2014;a more positive emphasis on living fully with disease rather than on dying from it.<lb/>
Among the important developments of the past 20 years is the relatively recent emergence of specialised training for doctors in palliative medicine. A network of training posts has been established in the National Health Service and in voluntary units which will have a significant impact on maintaining and raising standards as the doctors develop their careers. They can expect to work closely with the national networks that have already been established of Macmillan and Marie Curie nurses, who provide direct care in people's homes and in day centres or highly-valued advice and support to other carers. They may be based in one of the specialist in-patient units in the voluntary sector or in the National Health Service which have brought so much peace and comfort to dying people and their families and which often also fulfil a vital educational role in spreading their principles and practice beyond the physical confines of the hospice unit. They may become part of one of the symptom control teams giving expert back-up wherever it is needed in a hospital setting. They will also need to tap in to the experience of bereavement counsellors and
<col>560</col>
into the rich network of less formal voluntary, pastoral and self-help organisations whose roots strike deep into the community.<lb/>
The pattern of services 20 years ago, or even 10, was nothing like it is today. It is doubtful whether the raising of standards and expectations on the scale that we have seen in that time could have been achieved without the unstinting efforts of a few pioneers in the voluntary hospice movement and of the public who supported them. We have every reason to be grateful to them today.<lb/>
The Government for their part are deeply appreciative of what has been achieved. They recognise that the hospice movement has attracted widespread public support. Its hallmark is generosity in the time it gives to patients&#x2014;time which would not always be available on a normal busy general ward. That means higher ratios of staff, notably nurses, to patients; and that means that hospice care does not come cheap, as we all recognise.<lb/>
So our policy must, and does, amount to more than one of mere appreciation. We welcome the growing partnership between the NHS and the voluntary sector in this field, and we want to strengthen it. Our clear expectation&#x2014;for England this was set out just over three years ago in a circular&#x2014;is that the NHS should take the lead in planning and co-ordinating a comprehensive range of services for people with a terminal illness and their families, in collaboration wherever possible with voluntary organisations. We also expect that where such organisations provide services that form an essential part of its strategy the NHS will make a realistic contribution to the costs.<lb/>
In 1988&#x2013;89, the Government contributed &#x00A3;1.3 million towards the cost of pay awards for hospice nurses in England. They also distributed &#x00A3;400,000 via the charitable trust, Help the Hospices, to support voluntary projects in short-term financial difficulty. This year we have moved away from ad hoc interventions of that kind and fortified our commitment to the hospice movement in two ways. First the Government have earmarked substantial resources amounting to over &#x00A3;11 million for health authorities. I remind the noble Earl that health authorities receive all their money from central government, but that &#x00A3;11 million is earmarked additionally to encourage them to increase their contributions to the voluntary hospice movement where that is necessary.<lb/>
The allocation for 1990&#x2013;91, the current year, as has been said, comprises &#x00A3;8 million for England. My noble friend the Duke of Norfolk mentioned the figure of &#x00A3;6 million. I hope that that was a slip of the tongue. There is &#x00A3;8 million for England, &#x00A3;2.5 million for Scotland and over &#x00A3;500,000 for Northern Ireland. Funding arrangements for Wales remain under consideration; I understand that an announcement is due soon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03566"><member>The Duke of Norfolk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that of the &#x00A3;8 million only &#x00A3;6 million reached the hospice movement because it was hijacked by the regions. I know that that is a small point, but the money is not getting through.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03567"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for explaining what he meant. I shall ensure that his suggestion that part of the &#x00A3;8 million did not arrive where it should have done is investigated thoroughly.<lb/>
That was the first of the Government's responses. Secondly, we have asked health authorities and boards in England and Northern Ireland to work towards a position in which their contribution to the cost of agreed services matches that raised from voluntary giving. This has been the tenor of most of the contributions to our debate this evening. It is already happening in Scotland where hospices have been eligible since 1st April this year for public funding of at least 50 per cent. of their running costs. As for future funding, for the time being authorities in England have been advised to plan on the assumption that funding will continue in 1991&#x2013;92 at a similar level to that in 1990&#x2013;91. In Northern Ireland, as the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, said, a further &#x00A3;200,000 will be set aside next year to support hospices. The Scottish scheme is being monitored and will run until at least 1992&#x2013;93 when a review will be carried out.<lb/>
The Government are monitoring both the expenditure of the additional sums I have mentioned and health authorities' overall plans in the field of palliative care. We will consider carefully the need for any further action in the light of the information we receive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03568"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness permit me to intervene? Did she say that the amount for England in 1991&#x2013;92 would be the same as for 1990&#x2013;91? That means &#x00A3;8 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03569"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not say that. I said that for the time being we are asking health authorities to plan on that assumption. I understand the wish of many noble Lords, not least my noble friend Lady Cox, to pin me down to a timetable for achieving matching funding, particularly in England. I believe it is worth emphasising that the steps we have already taken have gone a considerable way towards providing a firm basis for future planning and partnership, and to alleviating the financial uncertainty experienced by some voluntary projects, to which reference has been made.<lb/>
There are wide variations in the distribution of hospices and in the level of support that health authorities have been able to give. Last year we started with a very wide range of between 0 and 80 per cent. contribution to running costs. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, referred to an example. I think she said that in Sunderland a hospice was fully financially supported by the National Health Service. But whatever the average may turn out to be, it must also he remembered that it will not reflect the fact that a number of hospice units which started life as voluntary projects have since become fully integrated into the National Health Service. Exactly the same is true of hundreds of specialist posts within the hospital and community health services which were initially pump-primed from charitable funds.<lb/>

The arrangements I have mentioned are by no means the only reflection of the attention that we pay to the hospice movement. The Government have also decided this year to support the total cost of the development by the Open University of an open learning package on the care of the dying and their families. This is specifically designed to disseminate the principles and good practice accumulated by the hospice movement to a wide audience of professionals and lay people.<lb/>
Another of this year's changes, for which the hospice movement campaigned very effectively, is the Government's decision to modify the rules on attendance allowance to enable people with a terminal illness to receive this benefit earlier. As from last month, the people affected will be able to receive attendance allowance at the higher rate of &#x00A3;37&#x00B7;50 a week, increasing to &#x00A3;41&#x00B7;65 from next April, without first having to satisfy the normal six months' qualifying period. These provisions will help, we understand an estimated 58,000 people a year, at a cost of &#x00A3;20 million in 1990&#x2013;91.<lb/>
Another social security benefit of interest to the hospice movement is income support. The Government are certainly aware of hospices' concerns about their potential loss of income once income support for residents of nursing homes is abolished. Changes in income support arrangements will not now be implemented before 1993&#x2013;94. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, mentioned that. In the meantime, the Government are gathering information on the extent to which hospices benefit from this source of income, and we will consider the position carefully in the light of that information.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Ryder of Warsaw, referred to difficulties and delays with current arrangements for income support. I should explain that income support is paid to individuals to help them to meet the costs of residential care, and not to the institutions which provide it. Residents of hospices which do not wish to raise charges for board and care are not eligible. Where a hospice has no contractual arrangements with a health authority and does wish to raise such charges, the individual may claim income support up to a maximum of &#x00A3;260 a week&#x2014;&#x00A3;283 in Greater London&#x2014;plus a personal expenses allowance of &#x00A3;10&#x00B7;55. I understand that managers of local social security offices are always pleased to discuss general procedural requirements with organisations which advise claimants. The noble Baroness, Lady Ryder, suggested direct Department of Health funding for hospices. However, it would be wholly against the Government's determination to devolve responsibility for all aspects of local services to local districts to make an exception in respect of hospices.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked whether Department of Social Security funding was being withdrawn because of Department of Health funding. I can assure him that there has been no change in the eligibility for income support of claimants in independent hospices. If an adjudication officer is satisfied that a claimant is not to be regarded as a National Health Service patient, income support will
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0321"/>
<col>563</col>
be the amount of the charge subject to the national limit and the personal allowance. However, if the noble Lord can provide details of specific instances where benefit is being withheld as a result of the allocations made by health departments, I shall be most happy to have them investigated.<lb/>
The hospice movement has also represented that it finds the current arrangements for getting the drugs it needs to be insufficiently flexible. Proposals for a revised scheme have been the subject of wide consultation this year, and, subject to the resolution of some technical queries raised during the process of consultation, an announcement will be made in due course.<lb/>
I was delighted to hear the appreciation of the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, of the input of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale in Northern Ireland. I shall ensure that those remarks are brought to the attention of my noble friend. I was not so delighted to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, refer to the Starred Question raised earlier today about the use of the special AIDS unit at Hammersmith Hospital as she omitted to mention my reply, which was that the unit is to be used for the purpose for which it was built; namely, the care of people suffering from AIDS. The noble Baroness also asked about prisoners. I understand that a Home Office inquiry is currently under way. I shall investigate that matter and write to the noble Baroness in due course.<lb/>
In summary, I believe the Government have acknowledged both the achievements and the concerns of the hospice movement. However, that is not to say that there are not many challenges ahead. The movement has seen a very rapid and often haphazard growth over the past decade; in some cases projects have expanded faster than their ability to generate resources. That is why it is of crucial importance for services to be planned in partnership with the National Health Service. That goes some way to answer the anxiety of the noble Lord, Lord Carter.<lb/>
<col>564</col>
When districts move into the new area of contracting the intention is that they will have to assess the needs of their districts' populations and enter into contracts to meet those needs. In the National Health Service as a whole that process starts, as we all now know, next April. Although it will not apply to hospices in all districts at that stage, there will inevitably be a move in that direction. If there are more hospice facilities in a particular area than are required as a result of assessment or need by the authorities concerned, I do not believe that those authorities can reasonably be expected to pay even 50 per cent. of the cost. It is therefore time for fundraisers to reflect on whether it is reasonable now, as it may once have been, to hurry into putting up a new building and then expect the health authority to commit itself to the long-term running costs. Everyone concerned to spread the concept of hospice care to all those who can benefit from it&#x2014;and I reaffirm the commitment of myself and my colleagues in the Department of Health to that aim&#x2014;must work together to ensure that the total envelope of service, in hospital, hospice and community, is coherent, comprehensive and genuinely matches local needs and priorities.<lb/>
I believe and hope that I have responded to most of the specific points raised in the course of the debate. I must ask those who were anxious to hear a fixed timetable or a large and fixed figure at the end of it to consider carefully what the Government have done and are continuing to do in this important area of health care, in which so many people give so much of themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03570"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, I ask whether she will be surprised to know that all those who care for the hospice movement will feel that she has evaded the main issue raised tonight. They will feel profound disappointment and will continue to press her until they receive a much more satisfactory answer.<lb/>

<title>School Buildings: Condition</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03573"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03574">What is their current estimate of the maintenance backlog of school buildings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03575"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we keep no detailed information on the state of school buildings, which are the responsibility of local education authorities and governors of voluntary aided and grant maintained schools. Plans submitted by LEAs and governing bodies in connection with bids for capital expenditure on schools, to which the DES responds with annual capital guidelines and grants to voluntary-aided schools, provide an indication of needs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03576"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Is she aware of the deep concern among the people involved regarding the deterioration in the fabric of many schools in the public sector? Bearing in mind that the city technology colleges are to receive &#x00A3;31 million in the current financial year for their building programme, would it not be fair and just for the local authorities to be allowed to operate under the same system? Is the Minister aware that if that happened it would substantially reduce the number of schools that require their fabric treating, which would be to the benefit of all?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03577"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure whether or not the noble Lord is suggesting that local authority and maintained schools should operate under the same system; in other words, that they should be allowed to raise substantial sums of money from the private sector. That is what happens with CTCs. Regarding the maintained sector, it is estimated that &#x00A3;2.6 billion was spent between 1986&#x2013;87 and 1989&#x2013;90 against deficiencies identified at &#x00A3;2 billion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03578"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister explain why the Government have abandoned targets that they set in legislation introduced in 1981 to bring schools up to standard by 1991? Is the Minister aware that that condemns many pupils and teachers to work in appalling and squalid conditions in our schools?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03579"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness is, I believe, referring to the premises regulations that were required to be in place by 1991. They are under review for a number of reasons. One reason is that priorities have changed substantially over that time; for example, the building of changing rooms may not be a priority compared with the updating of science laboratories to conform with the national curriculum.
<col>566</col>
It is therefore timely to consider possible extension of the dates and to consider priorities within that extension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03580"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Baroness saying that the Government are not aware of the problem of disrepair in school buildings? From my own knowledge I can say that schools have closed in Birmingham because roofs fell in and because toilets were still located outside in school playgrounds. A whole host of other reasons exist. Even when a school is burnt down through arson there is great difficulty finding the money to replace it. Surely the Government obtain information of that kind. Or are they not aware of the problems that exist throughout the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03581"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are well aware that there are problems regarding the repair of public buildings. However, the rise in expenditure from &#x00A3;352 billion in 1989&#x2013;90 to &#x00A3;485 billion represented a 37 per cent. increase; the rise from 1990&#x2013;91 to the coming year 1991&#x2013;92 is a further 11 per cent.; and the increase per pupil over a period of 10 years has been 16 per cent. in real terms. That is an indication that the Government recognise that more resources are required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03582"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness quotes many figures. Has the Minister actually visited any schools recently? The best evidence is that obtained with our own eyes. Does the noble Bareness not agree that if one visits a large number of schools in our country one sees that they are desperately in need of refurbishment? Is it not also the case that that is an extremely efficient way to invest our resources? If we do not refurbish them they will fall down, and the cost in due course will be that much higher.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03583"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have visited a large number of schools over the past 14 or 15 years. I am aware of a number of matters. One is that the management of maintenance in some authorities is better than in others. There is therefore an issue of management of funds. There is also an issue regarding how those funds that are received are applied. The noble Lord criticises me for quoting statistics. The statistics I used are actual statistics; they represent real moneys going to schools to address this very problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03584"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that in my first question I was attempting to establish the different criteria used for city technology colleges as against local authority education establishments, bearing in mind the distribution of government funds? I was not speaking of the private sector. I was suggesting that if the local authorities were financed in the same way it would go a long way towards helping them reduce the serious and adverse conditions that exist in some schools. Will the Minister plead with the Secretary of State for something to be done in that regard?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03585"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may correct something I said earlier. I believe I used the word "billions" when I should have said "millions". However, the &#x00A3;31 million mentioned by the noble Lord needs to be set against the &#x00A3;538 million which is
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0323"/>
<col>567</col>
the amount put into the maintained sector. The manner in which the Department of Education and Science sympathetically considers the use of 100 per cent. of capital receipts when specific projects are presented to it for consideration should also be taken into account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03586"><member>Lord Annan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the 'fifties, when many schools were built, they were admired by many European countries and educational officers from Europe came to see them. Are those schools in need of maintenance or does the undoubted problem very properly raised this afternoon concern only buildings erected at the beginning of the century?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03587"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are a number of problems, not least those of poorly-designed schools built much later than the beginning of this century&#x2014;that is to say, in the late 1950s, the 1960s and 1970s. There are considerable problems, particularly involving schools with flat roofs. Management resources constitute a very real issue. Some authorities have a very good record of managing resources. Clearly, buildings erected at the beginning of the century and before will be in need of restructuring.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03588"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister really believe that it is acceptable to spend as much as &#x00A3;31 million on buildings and repairs for CTCs, which represent a tiny handful of institutions, compared with only &#x00A3;500 million plus spent on every other school in the country? Does she not agree that that ratio is utterly absurd?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03589"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know where the figure of &#x00A3;500 million comes from. The figure of &#x00A3;538 million incorporates restructuring of buildings and the provision of new buildings besides some refurbishment. The figure of &#x00A3;31 million I have not confirmed or otherwise. I simply accepted it from the noble Lord. It is not a figure that I have to hand. The amount of private money that has gone into setting up CTCs is to be commended. The noble Baroness would support a policy of taking the CTCs out of the system altogether. Where the CTCs have been established they are very popular with the local population. They are highly over-subscribed. My hope is that industry, commerce and the DES will continue to support them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03590"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister confirm that this expenditure lies within the remit of central and not local government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03591"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is not quite correct. The overall allocation is distributed by central government, but the actual deployment of those moneys is very much a matter for local government. The determination of priorities is also a matter for local government.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Transport in London</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03592">2.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03593"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03594">What action is being taken to improve the transport services for travellers in London.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03595"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have authorised substantial investment in all the transport services for London. Over the three years from next April London Transport plans to invest up to &#x00A3;3 billion and British Rail up to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 billion for Network SouthEast. It has also authorised major longer-term projects, including East West Crossrail. There is a substantial programme of road improvements and legislation is being introduced to ease traffic flow on priority routes. We are working with London Transport to see how these and other measures can help to improve bus services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03596"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that excellent reply. Does he not agree that this Government are investing far more in London Underground than the GLC ever did?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03597"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. That is certainly true. Investment over the next three years will be nearly three times the level in real terms that it was under the GLC.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03598"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nevertheless, looking at the most recent statistics produced by London Underground Limited, is it not the case that the number of lifts out of service due to defects is higher than a year ago and that trend is continuing at an unacceptably high level? But having said that, one must recognise that the escalator problem has improved. I congratulate London Underground on that. Nevertheless, is it not true that the lifts are in a totally unacceptable state?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03599"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his acknowledgement that the situation of the escalators has improved. That is a subject of great interest to your Lordships as I remember from previous occasions answering such questions. The target is for 86 per cent. availability by the end of March 1992. The latest figures show that 84 per cent. of escalators are already in service. Clearly, it will be even better when 100 per cent. of the escalators are working full time. It is now up to London Transport to turn its attention to the lifts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03600"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether anything is being done to improve the condition of London Underground and to reduce the enormous number of breakdowns both of vehicles and the signalling system which almost every day causes hardship to the travelling public? Can the Minister say whether anything can be done&#x2014;if necessary, by making fresh appointments&#x2014;to get London Underground on the move?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03601"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said in my original Answer, a very large amount of money is being invested by London Transport at the moment. It is not possible to deal with every line at the same
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0324"/>
<col>569</col>
time. I give as an example the Central line, which will have 85 new trains and a new high technology signalling system costing over &#x00A3;700 million. That should alleviate the problems to which my noble friend has referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03602"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that, notwithstanding what appears to be his encouraging Answer, London Transport is well aware of its shortcomings? It knows what a terrible ordeal it is to travel on the Northern line. London Transport is trying to alleviate the situation in order to prevent people using their cars and clogging up the roads. Does the Minister not agree that only if the Government are prepared to meet the London Transport Executive to try to understand its desperation, and also to increase the finance available, can some of the problems be resolved? Such action will have an immediate effect in reducing the chaos on London's roads and the appalling conditions under which people have to travel on some Underground lines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03603"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that the noble Lord can have heard my original Answer. I made it quite clear that record amounts of money are being spent by London Transport on the Underground. Plans are also in hand for greater expenditure on the system. A very large amount of money is involved. The noble Lord may remember that during the past 10 years or so the number of people travelling by Tube has risen by about 22 per cent. That figure was reached after a long period of declining numbers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03604"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord not agree that this serious social problem, which makes massive demands on the public purse, cannot be solved as long as one neglects a sensible and positive dispersal programme and a regional policy which will permit the better dispersal of industry and other activity throughout the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03605"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we already have a policy which encourages regional development. Indeed, a good many civil servants have moved or are about to move out of central London. However, if this country is to prosper and if London is to remain the financial capital of Europe, it is essential that we continue to invest money in the transport services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03606"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what action, if any, have the Government taken to reduce the incidence of muggings on the Underground?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03607"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have the figures with me at the moment, but not so long ago I answered a Question on the number of British Transport Police on the London Underground system. That number is increasing at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03608"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord suggesting that with the increased investment, which although it is too late we all welcome, the transport system in London will begin to compare with the transport systems in most other European cities? That is certainly not the case today. What do the Government propose to do about the congestion resulting from the use of private cars?</membercontribution></p>
<col>570</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03609"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord said that the investment in London Transport is too late. As I pointed out a few moments ago, investment under this Government is three times what it was under the GLC. I agree that it is better late than never &#x2014;it would probably never have been under the GLC. The noble Lord went on to say that our transport systems in London are not as good as those in some other European capitals. I know that he probably has more experience of Europe than I have, but when I have visited other European capitals I have found congestion almost as bad, if not as bad, as one finds here in London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03610"><member>Lord Birkett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government consider removing all those deeply user-unfriendly automatic ticket barriers and diverting the maintenance of them into lifts and escalators?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03611"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first part of the noble Lord's question is no; but the investment in lifts and escalators will go on despite that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03612"><member>Lord Teviot</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that he has one noble friend who entirely approves of London Transport? Does he agree that ticket barriers have been valuable in detecting fraud and that London Transport could do with a great many more? London Transport is the finest system in the world if one can use a map. In addition, London Buses has an extremely useful network. In the past few years since deregulation (which did not include London) there has been a 2.5 per cent. increase in bus usage. May London Transport, under the London Regional Transport Act passed by this Government, continue and prosper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03613"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his question. I heard what he said about the increased use of buses. That is something which we would wish to encourage and which will be encouraged by the introduction of red routes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03614"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the Minister any comment to make on the report that London Underground had a deficit of around &#x00A3;100 million in the last financial year? Do not the questions asked by noble Lords demonstrate the need for an overall authority for London, which is one of the few cities in Europe that does not have an authority to deal with transport problems over the whole of the city area?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03615"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord appears to be arguing for a return of the GLC to take care of our transport problems. The GLC was abolished about five years ago. Had it been as successful as noble Lords opposite would like to make out, we would not have the problems we have today; nor would my noble friend have needed to ask his Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03616"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is quite wrong. The problems of London Transport began five years ago when the GLC was relieved of its responsibilities. Then started the agony of the Northern line. The inefficiency of London Transport dated from the end of the GLC when transport was taken over by this Government.</membercontribution></p>

<col>571</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03617"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord may well be right that the misery of the Northern line started because the GLC did not invest enough money in the transport system.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Channel Tunnel: Benefits</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03618">2.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03619"><member>The Viscount of Oxfuird</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03620">What measures are planned to ensure that British industry benefits from the opening of the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03621"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is for industry itself to grasp the opportunities which will be offered by the opening of the Channel Tunnel. The Government's role is to facilitate industry's tasks and that is what we are doing. The national motorway and trunk road programme is being expanded to provide for the general increase in traffic which is now forecast. The programme, especially in Kent, takes full account of anticipated growth in cross-Channel traffic, much of which will use the tunnel. And British Rail proposes to invest well over &#x00A3;1 billion in tunnel-related improvements to freight and passenger services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03622"><member>The Viscount of Oxfuird</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his informative reply. Can he confirm that these increased benefits will not be confined solely to the south-eastern region of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03623"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, the tunnel will bring cost savings in carrying goods across the Channel due to greater transport competition. It will offer for the first time the possibility of reliable delivery times of United Kingdom exports to the Continent. The consequent increased levels of trade with our European partners will contribute to economic growth and employment in the whole of the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03624"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that in the South West there is great worry about the fact that the Channel Tunnel will not have any proper links into that part of the country? The freight terminal at Bristol will be the nearest one to Devon and Cornwall. There is great worry that the South West will be left out of the development arising from the Channel Tunnel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03625"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, British Rail proposes to have up to 12 regional freight terminals. They are not all yet identified so I cannot confirm whether Bristol will be the noble Lord's nearest one. It is estimated that up to 70 per cent. of freight transport will emanate from beyond London. That should be encouraging.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03626"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that, although most of us hope that our exports to the remainder of the European Community will be greatly facilitated and speeded up with the opening of the Channel Tunnel, nevertheless there is a two-way traffic and that it will also speed up imports from the Continent to the United Kingdom? We are at the moment running a deficit with the rest of Europe to the tune of &#x00A3;8 billion per annum.</membercontribution></p>
<col>572</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03627"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: Maybe, my Lords; but exports are increasing faster than imports and therefore they will be assisted by the opening of the Channel Tunnel. Of course it will be a two-way trade; so it is at the moment with the use of ships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03628"><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say which points in the northern part of this country will be directly reached by trains through the Channel Tunnel?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03629"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the trains will go so far as Scotland as soon as the Channel Tunnel opens. I have already said that there will be regional freight depots; but the location of those has not yet been finally decided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03630"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord used the word "hope". That is not very good for manufacturing industry north of Watford. It wants something a little more concrete than that. Manufacturing industry is now looking forward to exporting goods through the tunnel. Will the Government tell British Rail to decide quickly on its rail links from the capital to the South East, to the South West, to the North and to the Midlands and Liverpool?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03631"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness should not have too long to wait. I understand that British Rail plans to announce the siting of the freight terminals certainly by the early part of next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03632"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that one of the problems is that we do not have in this country an integrated transport system, and that under this Government there is no sign of one emerging? Is he further aware that notwithstanding the quasi-assurances he has given to the House today, there is deep anxiety not simply in the South West and in the Midlands but throughout the northern part of this country that there are not sufficient&#x2014;nor are there likely to be sufficient&#x2014;freight routes to the Channel Tunnel? That may have serious effects on British industry, particularly as 1992 approaches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03633"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that that is the case. As I said, there will be substantial freight traffic passing through the tunnel. Freight trains will travel at speeds of up to 75 mph which is the same speed as trains running in France and Germany. The noble Lord said that we do not have an integrated transport system. However, no one has ever explained to me exactly what that means; indeed, it means different things to different people. We have a balanced transport system with substantial investment going into both road and rail.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Television Companies: Proposed Merger</title>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03635"><member>Lord Jay</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03636">Whether they will refer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the proposed merger between Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03637"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Hesketh)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the case is
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0326"/>
<col>573</col>
currently being considered by the Office of Fair Trading in the normal way. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will consider whether or not to make a reference to the MMC when he has received advice from the Director General of Fair Trading. Until he announces his decision, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this merger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03638"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do we really have adequate parliamentary authority in these matters when it is apparently possible for one man, who is not even a British subject, to control one-third of the British press and also a large slice of the television network?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03639"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Jay, will not be surprised when I say that I am unable to comment on his allegations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03640"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister tell us when the Government intend to put before Parliament the subordinate legislation promised during the passage of the Broadcasting Bill which would limit newspaper owners' interests in domestic and non-domestic satellite services? The delay is causing the IBA great difficulty in dealing with BSB's breach of contract by its merger with Sky.<lb/>
Further, can the Minister say how the Government intend to protect the leading role taken by BSB in developing the D-MAC technology as the European standard? This provides a much better quality picture and would prevent the domination of European television by Japan.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03641"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as always, I am most interested in the noble Baroness's questions. However, I must point out that her questions, especially the latter one, are wide of the Question on the Order Paper, which specifically refers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03642"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord does not want to answer the second question I shall return to it on another occasion. However, with the greatest respect, the first question is absolutely right and to the point. Is not the subordinate legislation meant to deal with the whole question of cross-media ownership and the monopoly situation? For the Minister not to answer a question on when the subordinate legislation is due to pass through Parliament is in my view somewhat remiss.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03643"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness will not be surprised to learn that I do not have the actual day and specific time in this respect. However, I am reliably informed that it will be within the next 12 months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03644"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister accept what my noble friend said? I was in the studios of BSB on Saturday. We now have a situation where, once again, an entire staff is totally demoralised. The people do not know whether their jobs will last one week or two weeks, or one month or two months. The Government should realise that the BSB employees may well be their voters; and I can assure them that they will need some of those votes. I appeal to the
<col>574</col>
Government: will they move forward as rapidly as possible and deal with the subject matter of the question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03645"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the relationship between the two companies and their employees is a matter for them; it is not a matter for the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03646"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when Mr. Rupert Murdoch met the Prime Minister recently to discuss these matters, did she say that she was in favour of the merger or did she then consult the Home Secretary about the possibility of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03647"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister did not inform the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about her meeting with Mr. Murdoch. On the only occasion that Mr. Murdoch tried to speak to the Secretary of State, he was not available.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03648"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the Minister cannot answer my first Question, can he say whether Mr. Murdoch in his periodical visits to No. 10 Downing Street counts as a family friend?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03649"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a large number of people constantly visit Downing Street.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03650"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry, but I cannot accept the last answer given to me by the Minister. It is absurd to say that the subordinate legislation will be introduced within a year. The IBA is having to delay the decision it must make about BSB and whether it should withdraw the contract. There are many people involved in this matter. Will the noble Lord rethink his answer? A decision is expected to be taken by Parliament within the next few weeks, and certainly before Christmas. Surely he cannot really mean that it will be within a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03651"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I gave that answer in order to be helpful to the noble Baroness. In my first reply to her, I pointed out that her question was wide of that on the Order Paper. I was in receipt of information which I hoped would be or help to her. I can go no further than the original answer I gave.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Natural Heritage (Scotland) Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03654">3.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03655"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office (Lord Strathclyde)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
The Bill has three quite distinct and major parts. First and foremost, it contains provisions for the establishment of Scottish Natural Heritage by merging the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland with the Countryside Commission for Scotland. The Bill also contains provisions to enable river purification authorities to control the abstraction of water within their areas for irrigation purposes and provisions to enable the Secretary of State to make drought orders on application by water authorities and water development boards. Both these parts of the Bill replace existing legislation. However, the Bill has one overriding purpose and that is to ensure that our natural environment in Scotland, and in particular the resources of land and water, are managed in a sustainable way to secure the inheritance of succeeding generations.<lb/>
Our proposals for the establishment of Scottish Natural Heritage were first announced by my right
<col>576</col>
honourable Friend the Secretary of State in another place in July 1989. Since then we have consulted widely by publishing two consultation papers, copies of which are lodged in the Library of your Lordships' House. Our second consultation paper, <i>Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead,</i> set out our aims and aspirations for the future management of our natural heritage in Scotland and the role we expect Scottish Natural Heritage to play. The majority of those responding to our consultation paper are supportive of our proposals to merge the newly created Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland with the existing Countryside Commission for Scotland. This was confirmed by an independent poll recently undertaken in Scotland which showed a three to one majority in favour of our proposals.<lb/>
Our proposals are founded on the important work carried out by the two predecessor organisations. As your Lordships will see in the Bill, all the functions and responsibilities of the predecessor bodies will be continued by Scottish Natural Heritage. I should like at this stage to pay tribute to the work of the two organisations. The dedicated efforts of the Nature Conservancy Council officials have resulted in the conservation of a wide range of habitats and the protection of a great diversity of species, as well as the protection of features of geological and physiographic interest. Their job has not always been easy but they have carried it out with conviction.<lb/>
Let me also pay no less a tribute to the work of the Countryside Commission over its two decades of existence. There is a great deal of evidence in the Scottish countryside of the commission's efforts. I should like to single out the work it has undertaken in improving the environment around our towns and cities, its initiatives in major projects in the central belt of Scotland and, more recently, its reflections and prescriptions for the longer-term management of our mountain areas. We fully intend to build on all this work in the new partnership which we propose to establish.<lb/>
Your Lordships will be aware that we seek an integrated approach to our natural heritage and consider that the merger will bring about a more efficient and more effective organisational structure to achieve that. We believe that the protection of species and habitats, on the one hand, and the protection of landscape, on the other, have many characteristics in common. Perhaps not surprisingly in Scotland, those areas of greatest nature conservation significance are also those with landscapes of the highest aesthetic and amenity value. Rather than see a clash between nature and landscape conservation, therefore, there is a strong concurrence of interest. However, I would not wish to give your Lordships the impression that the new body is concerned only with conservation. Far from it. We also expect Scottish Natural Heritage to improve the appreciation of natural heritage issues by those who live and work in our rural areas as well as those who visit these areas. It will, for example, provide opportunities for greater understanding and improved access to enhance the enjoyment of those areas.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0328"/>
<col>577</col>
There were some who argued that recreational access and enjoyment of the countryside are not compatible with conservation. The Scottish Sports Council has suggested that it should take over the Countryside Commission for Scotland's recreational access and enjoyment functions. The Government stated their case against such an arrangement in the consultation paper. Such fragmentation would undermine the objective of an integrated approach to the management of our natural heritage.<lb/>
Another aspect of our reorganisation proposals by which we set great store is the building up of positive partnerships between Scottish Natural Heritage and the whole range of other interests: local communities, local authorities, owners and occupiers of land, business and industry and voluntary bodies. We are intent on building up those partnerships by having a highly dispersed organisation for Scottish Natural Heritage. That work will continue in designated areas, but we also seek a much greater effort in new designated areas. We intend to build on the existing NCC office network. I fully expect that the great majority of staff in Scottish Natural Heritage will be based in regional and local offices.<lb/>
There are a number of other ingredients required for the success of that operation on the ground. One of them is undoubtedly the support of applied research to increase our understanding of sustainable management and to help in the development of practical demonstration schemes and initiatives. That is why there will be a centrally managed cadre of specialists. In addition, no organisation with a great deal of delegation and dispersal of staff can operate effectively without a coherent set of policies and decision-making frameworks. That is properly the role of staff in the agency's headquarters, but they will also have another vital role; that is, to advise government or any other party on any aspect of policy or activity which they consider has an effect on Scotland's natural heritage. We expect that task to be carried out objectively, with rigour, with integrity, but most of all effectively. I can assure your Lordships' House that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State looks to Scottish Natural Heritage as his adviser on the conservation, understanding and enjoyment of Scotland's natural heritage and the means of bringing that to fruition in a sustainable manner.<lb/>
There were those who criticised our proposals as being unduly parochial. I hope that your Lordships will have set aside any doubts on that front from what I have already said. Scottish Natural Heritage cannot operate without proper regard to national and international considerations. It will, after all, be the responsible body for the identification, notification and protection of sites of special scientific interest, including those sites which in addition might be designated under European directives such as the birds directive and, in the longer term, the species and habitat directive. It will undertake its wider nature conservation responsibilities with its sister agencies in England and Wales, through the Joint Nature
<col>578</col>
Conservation Committees, and it will work within the standards, procedures and protocols agreed by the committee.<lb/>
I turn now to the subject of landscape protection. The Government are committed to the continuing conservation of those of our Scottish landscapes of the highest value. How that should be done in the longer term is a matter of some debate in Scotland at present. The Countryside Commission for Scotland has produced a report on the conservation and management of our mountain areas. It contains many valuable suggestions aimed at securing sustainable use of the land and makes particular suggestions for ways of building partnerships at the local level through the establishment of land management forums. It also proposes that four areas should be designated national parks.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has not come to any conclusion on the commission's recommendations. He is waiting to see the commission's further reflections following a recent consultation exercise. However, the Government wish to move forward on a limited basis to test out the principles of integrated management. That is why my honourable friend the Minister for Horne Affairs and the Environment has announced not just the Government's intention to seek world heritage listing for the Cairngorms, but the establishment of a working party to advise the Secretary of State on the longer-term management of the area. I stress that the Government's desire to move foward on the Cairngorms is in no way meant to pre-empt the possibility of the area becoming a national park.<lb/>
Existing designations are confined either to landscape purposes or to nature conservation purposes. There is at present no integrated designation. A single designation for the benefit of areas of the highest natural heritage interest will be an essential tool if the new body is to approach the management of such areas in a positive and integrated manner. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State intends to bring forward an amendment to the Bill in another place to enable natural heritage areas to be established.<lb/>
We do not intend to give, at least at this stage, any additional responsibilities to Scottish Natural Heritage. We do, however, intend to bring forward an amendment to give to the Red Deer Commission powers for the culling of deer on nature and landscape conservation grounds.<lb/>
I have dwelt at some length on the principles and the expected practice which should come about by the establishment of Scottish Natural Heritage. I shall explain how we expect the Bill to achieve those purposes. Part I provides for the establishment of Scottish Natural Heritage. It will be a body with the full range of powers currently given to the Countryside Commission for Scotland and the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland, but with the wider definition of the natural heritage and the abolition of the concept of countryside it will operate throughout Scotland.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0329"/>
<col>579</col>
I shall underline particularly the general aims and purposes set out in Clause 1. They are: first, to secure the conservation of species and habitats, of areas of geological and physiographic significance and of areas of natural beauty and amenity; secondly, to secure the enhancement of our natural heritage; thirdly, to foster understanding of our natural heritage by increasing the degree of interest and the level of knowledge of everyone who has an interest in the use and management of heritage; fourthly, the agency will have the ability to provide at its own hand or to support others in providing facilities for the enjoyment of Scotland's natural heritage. Included in that important purpose are not merely built facilities but the provision for access. Finally, and of overriding concern in the Government's view, is the duty to ensure that its own actions, and by influencing the actions of others, Scottish Natural Heritage will secure a sustainable natural heritage. Schedule 1 makes provision for the constitution and proceedings of the body.<lb/>
Clause 2 sets out the general functions. Clause 3 identifies a duty to take account of other matters. Clause 4 and Schedule 2 provide for amendments to the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to allow the responsibilities of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland to be undertaken by Scottish Natural Heritage. Clause 5 widens the scope of powers already available to the Countryside Commission for development projects or schemes. Clause 6 deals with powers of entry.<lb/>
Clause 7 gives the Secretary of State power to pay grant to Scottish Natural Heritage and Clause 8 empowers Scottish Natural Heritage to give grants or loans in furtherance of its general aims and purposes. Clause 9 makes provision for the report and accounts of the new agency. Clause 10 enables the Secretary of State to give both specific and general directions. Finally, Clause 11 and Schedule 3 make provision for the dissolution of the predecessor bodies and take care of the transitional matters, including offers of employment to staff of the existing bodies.<lb/>
I should now like to explain the provisions on irrigation. The main purpose of these modest measures is to improve the effectiveness of the present legislation contained in the Spray Irrigation Act 1964 and to widen its scope. Some years ago, a sub-committee of the former Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee was asked to investigate problems arising from water abstraction from surface and underground waters, in the context of both river purification and conservation of water resources. The sub-committee's report was completed in October 1978, following which it was the subject of consultation with interested bodies.<lb/>
The sub-committee concluded that while there was no case for radical change, there was a need to improve the existing legislation. The Government have long accepted the need for such improvements on which agreement to legislate was reached in 1983 and we have since been seeking a suitable opportunity to
<col>580</col>
bring forward new measures. The sub-committee considered that the 1964 Act required revision in three major aspects.<lb/>
First, the sub-committee concluded that procedure under the existing Act should be simplified. Under this procedure river purification authorities are required to notify interested parties of their application to the Secretary of State for an order for irrigation. This procedure has proved to be so cumbersome that only one control order has ever been applied for and made.<lb/>
Secondly, having eased the procedure to make control simpler to introduce, the sub-committee advised that forms of irrigation other than spray irrigation&#x2014;for example, channel, flood and trickle&#x2014;might then become more attractive because they were uncontrolled. They therefore recommended widening the legislation to all forms of irrigation.<lb/>
Thirdly, they found that control should be extended to abstractions from underground sources in areas where such abstractions are likely to reduce significantly the flow of a river or stream.<lb/>
The key purposes of these changes therefore is to meet a longstanding commitment to replace with workable legislation relevant to present-day circumstances a piece of legislation which has been on the statute book for 26 years but has in practice proved difficult to operate. It is, after all, essential that the quality and quantity of the water in our rivers be maintained. The consequences for aquatic life, should a river or stream dry up or be reduced to a trickle, do not need explanation. In addition, where there is over-abstraction, the ability of the river to dilute and absorb pollution can be destroyed with resultant severe effects on the environment and on flora and fauna.<lb/>
Drought has already had an effect in parts of England. Part III of the Bill dealing with the supply of water during drought conditions will replace provisions in the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 with provisions similar to those already available in England and Wales in the 1989 Water Act. The provisions will strengthen the powers of water authorities and water development boards to meet deficiencies in the supply of water in Scotland due to exceptional shortage of rain.<lb/>
I am, of course, aware that the popular image of Scotland is not normally one of a sun-soaked landscape perennially beset with problems of drought. However, your Lordships may well recall the particularly dry spell in 1984. During the months from April to August that year, rainfall was less than 40 per cent. of the average in the period from 1941 to 1970. This had a marked, detrimental effect on rivers and streams and on the fish and plant life which they sustain. River flows were seriously affected and reservoir levels dropped considerably. As it happened, the effects of this drought were not as serious as they might have been owing mainly to the fact that there had been particularly heavy rainfall during the preceding winter months. We have also experienced
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0330"/>
<col>581</col>
localised problems of water shortage from time to time. Indeed, only last year drought orders were made in both the Borders and Fife regions.<lb/>
While it is true that authorities have always managed to handle such situations well, the new provisions will improve water mangement in times of drought by providing a more flexible regime for those who have to deal with the effects of drought. The new provisions will also bring water management in these situations into line with practices elsewhere in Great Britain.<lb/>
Finally, the Bill seeks to make a number of minor amendments to the existing water legislation: first, to make specific provision in relation to control of water pollution to empower the Secretary of State to make regulations giving effect to international and EC obligations, and secondly, to amend the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 to ensure river purification boards are consulted by water authorities in pursuance of some of their responsibilities under that Act. Lastly, provision is also being made to supplement the powers of the Secretary of State to make regulations under the Water (Scotland) Act 1980.<lb/>
The Bill in summary provides a new basis for the management of our natural heritage, building on the work of the Countryside Commission for Scotland and the Nature Conservancy Council. It opens a wide range of opportunities for Scottish Natural Heritage to achieve the general aims and purposes set out. It also provides for the regularisation of responsibilities of water authorities as far as drought and irrigation are concerned. I commend the Bill to the House; I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Strathclyde.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03656">3.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03657"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may first perform a pleasant duty. It is the first time that the noble Lord has introduced a major Bill&#x2014;in fact it is the only Bill this year&#x2014;concerning Scotland. I congratulate him on the thoroughness with which he introduced it. His survey was helpful and comprehensive. It means that our understanding of the Bill is much greater than it was: so much needed more explanation. I welcome the noble Lord who comes from close to my own part of the country.<lb/>
It is not merely a criticism of this Government, although the fault is one to which they are particularly prone, when I say that I cannot understand why there are not two separate Bills. It would have been much easier to proceed on the basis of two Bills, especially as the work of the House regarding Scotland does not appear to be all that heavy. To combine a Bill of this important nature to Scotland with one which is much more technical&#x2014;the repeal of the Spray Irrigation (Scotland) Act 1964&#x2014;complicates matters and makes the work of those who are trying to deal with legislation, particularly the lawyers, more difficult. I have great sympathy for them.<lb/>
<col>582</col>
I suddenly realised that the spray irrigation Act was a measure on which I spoke when it was a Bill in the other place. I have not had the courage to look up what I said way back in 1964.<lb/>
There has been a slow response from outside bodies to the Bill before us. Thankfully, those bodies are becoming more aware that this important Scottish measure starts in your Lordships' House and not the other place. That may have taken them off balance. More information of a specialised nature is beginning to come in. Following the Minister's speech, the groups will know even better the effects of the Bill on their own special interests. I am sure that with the Minister's introduction and subsequent speeches today there will be quickened interest leading to a well informed Committee stage.<lb/>
I wish to thank those bodies that have so far sent me valuable and well informed papers: the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Scottish Crofters Union, the Scottish Sports Council, CoSLA and the Worldwide Fund for Nature. This is not an occasion for dealing with all the points they have raised. I have no doubt that in Committee we shall deal with the nitty gritty and that we shall be able to improve the Bill.<lb/>
The appointment of Mr. Magnus Magnusson as chairman designate of Scottish Natural Heritage seems to have met with general approval throughout Scotland. Although strictly speaking he is a foreigner, there must be few people&#x2014;native or otherwise&#x2014;in Scotland who are as thoroughly identified with all aspects and strata of life in Scotland. To adapt a phrase used in another place, I am sure that except on special occasions Magnus Magnusson will fully pass the football or rugby (Scotland) test. His appointment has been well received and I wish to add my good wishes to him in his work on the new body.<lb/>
The Bill proposes to amalgamate the Nature Conservancy Council in Scotland and the Countryside Commission for Scotland. We all hope that this will result in a more comprehensive approach to promoting the enjoyment of the countryside along with the conservation and protection of the environment. We welcome the Secretary of State's assurance that the resources needed to make the new agency a strong, viable and effective body will be provided. If the new agency is to do its job effectively, proper funding will be essential.<lb/>
Achieving the right balance between conservation and recreation will be a crucial test of the new agency. It will be a miracle if it can achieve 100 per cent. balance and 100 per cent. agreement, but Mr. Magnusson's appointment has given the new body an early credibility which we hope will be buttressed by further wise and independent minded appointees to the board. We shall certainly want to discuss in Committee the kind of people we want to see appointed to the board.<lb/>
The agency must provide to the Secretary of State good objective advice which the Government will feel able and willing to support. We hope they will allow action to be taken on it. The more credible the

composition of the board, the more hopeful we will be that the advice will be taken into account by the Secretary of State.<lb/>
Local authorities in Scotland have expressed support and enthusiasm for the merger and are keen to work with the new agency, especially at local level with the proposed local offices. Local contact and involvement with local authorities will be essential. Given the integrated role of the new body it will be important for it to enable local authorities to pursue and extend the progress that has been made to date in the many innovative schemes for countryside management and protection that have been undertaken. Many important partnerships already exist at local level between authorities and the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council. I hope the Minister is aware of this important co-operation and will wish to see it maintained.<lb/>
I now wish to refer briefly to some specific points that have been brought to my attention. Clause 3 seems to give very wide guidance to Scottish Natural Heritage. The terms of the clause are perhaps too wide in a legal sense and could be improved by suitable amendment. The Minister provided some assistance on that clause in his explanation of it but we shall want to discuss it more fully.<lb/>
We have a number of queries with regard to sites of special scientific interest. While it is recognised that these sites are of great importance, that importance has not in the past been too well explained to local people. The areas of the sites were perhaps drawn a little too widely to enable an understanding of their importance to be conveyed to local people. Therefore we think that those areas have been drawn too widely and that access for local people may not have been as easy as it should have been. I hope the Minister will pay some attention to that point. It is meant to be helpful.<lb/>
I could talk for a long time on the subject of fish farms. They cause much concern to many different groups in Scotland. I know that there is considerable conflict between employment opportunities and the long-term ecological effects of fish farms. The Minister has already referred to the Scottish Sports Council. That council is concerned that the new body may not be as effective as the Countryside Commission in promoting access to the countryside. I hope that that will not be the case. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister on that point.<lb/>
What will be the powers of Scottish Natural Heritage in relation to national parks? Up until now we believed that it was unlikely that national parks would be designated. I was going to suggest that protection should be given to the Cairngorms and perhaps Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. However, I am pleased that the Minister has intimated that the World Heritage listing for the Cairngorms will be pursued. He also spoke about the encroachment of towns on the countryside. This juxtaposition must be sympathetically dealt with.<lb/>
<col>584</col>
Perhaps one of the most difficult concepts in the Bill is that of sustainable development. This matter could be debated at length. The concept has been described to me as a buzz phrase. That conveys the impression that someone had a good idea that was too difficult to verbalise and was thus open to all kinds of opportunistic one-off interpretations. I have my own concept of the matter which we can perhaps debate in Committee. However, I assure the Minister that clarification of the phrase "sustainable development" will be needed.<lb/>
Government commitment to decentralisation is welcome. It will raise public awareness of Scottish Natural Heritage as well as help to establish its credibility. Local offices will, however, need the support and co-operation of local communities so mechanisms need to be developed to ascertain local views. It has been suggested that the headquarters of the new agency should be located in rural Scotland. That suggestion is worth looking at and I have sympathy for it, but I can see great problems in finding a compromise location suitable for the east coast, the west coast, the Highlands and the Islands and the Border areas. We sometimes seem to forget that the Border areas are an important part of the Scottish heritage.<lb/>
With amalgamations there is always the possibility of conflict. I remember someone who always used to talk about a Dover and Chatham railway. It is always difficult to get staff to accept mergers. However, I am sure the Scottish staff will be more flexible. Staff training will be needed to develop their understanding of the new objectives of the integrated agency and to promote as their primary allegiance a commitment to Scottish Natural Heritage notwithstanding their former backgrounds. The Bill is an important Bill for Scotland. We shall welcome the Committee stage, when I hope we shall be able to seek and receive suggestions and clarification on a number of issues. In the course of discussion, perhaps we shall be able to make improvements to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03659"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to join the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, in the congratulations he offered to the Minister. I also wish to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, on his speech. However, I did not altogether follow his razor-sharp mind as regards water, although I understand that he was chiefly concerned with drought. I must confess that among all the evils of this wicked world drought is not high on the list for those in the far north of Scotland.<lb/>
I welcome the amalgamation of the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council. That was obviously a sensible step. I also very much welcome the fact that these bodies will be controlled from Scotland. That too was an eminently sensible step. Will the co-ordinated committee always be centred in Peterborough? I hope that that will not be the case. I hope that it will be a small committee, with a small number of staff, and that it will not become an excuse for re-centralising activities in Peterborough. I
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0332"/>
<col>585</col>
suggest that some of the meetings of the committee should be held in Edinburgh, Cardiff or possibly some other place in England, Wales or Scotland.<lb/>
I particularly welcome the appointment of Magnus Magnusson. As the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, mentioned, he is a foreigner. He is a very good foreigner from the far north and he will bring to the quarrelsome Scots a little Nordic common sense and general calm. That is much needed in some Scottish undertakings. However, am I not right in thinking that Magnus Magnusson has also been appointed to look into the future of the Cairngorms? Has he been appointed to do so in a personal capacity or as the chairman of this new body? How much of his time will be taken up by that activity? When do these various appointments take effect?<lb/>
I much object to the title of the new body. The body is not Scotland's "natural heritage". It is slovenly drafting to set up a body called Scottish Natural Heritage. I know that there are precedents but it is not something that Parliament should do.<lb/>
There are also practical disadvantages. The word "heritage" is overworked and there are already several bodies which include it in their title. Furthermore, before the Bill appeared I received a letter from a member of one of the previous organisations who pointed out that such organisations tended to think that they were God. They tended to believe that there had been no landscape in Scotland until they had been formed. Such a title could encourage that mentality. It is vital that such bodies should not believe that they are God and should not be under the impression that they created the Scottish natural heritage.<lb/>
What is the mischief that we are trying to cure? What is the main thrust that this body should follow? The mischief is threats to the countryside. It is very difficult to get agreement about what the countryside should be and what the threats to it are. But we know that laying down large areas of concrete, building unsuitable roads, cutting down trees and numerous other activities are thought to be detrimental to the countryside.<lb/>
Who are the potential villains? Farmers, landlords, developers, government departments&#x2014;in particular those which design the roads&#x2014;and local authorities, which cut the verges and lay down large areas of concrete in unsuitable places. There are many sectional interests with impeccable intentions which bring about undesirable results. There is the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which is now the largest landowner in Orkney. I very much doubt whether it is a good thing that such an absentee landlord, run by bureaucrats, should own such a large area of Orkney. There is also the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, which is a very reputable body. However, it is about to ruin the environment of the Broch of Gurness by building a car park for more than 100 cars and laying down a tarmac road along what used to be a rather nice piece of unspoilt coast. I could go on.<lb/>
We must also remember that those are the people who made the countryside&#x2014;the landlords, the
<col>586</col>
farmers, you and I, all of Scotland&#x2014;have done an enormous amount to conserve it and so have those bodies. Therefore the new body will have an exceptionally difficult time in laying down what can and cannot be done, even by admirable bodies such as those I have mentioned.<lb/>
I should like to refer to three or four matters which are now in the Scottish eye. There is the question of the new forests in Caithness. The re is violent controversy as to whether fir trees are good or bad. There is violent controversy over Aviemore. In today's <i>Scotsman</i> there is a picture of a track through Glen Feshie, which was probably originally created by the estate of the noble Lord, Lord Dulverton. On the back page of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> there are pictures of enormous quarries in Oxfordshire. In both instances a case can be made for and against the developments. I can see no objection to the track in Glen Feshie and, as to the quarries in Oxfordshire, no doubt we have to build roads and houses, and quarries are necessary. It will be very difficult to set up a body which will be impartial and able to advise the Government on such matters.<lb/>
I believe that the only way in which that can be achieved is for the body to keep its purpose clearly in mind. Its purpose is primarily to conserve. It may also educate people about the natural beauty of Scotland and advise on developments, but it is a conservation body. It is not set up to undertake research or hold conferences. I have no objection to it commissioning research, but research can be undertaken by the universities without a new centre being set up.<lb/>
The new body should be as impartial as possible. Therefore I do not favour it being filled with people who are <i>parti pris</i> and members of some, no doubt, admirable body. I should like to ask whether, when the Bill mentions members coming from various areas of activity, that means geographical areas or areas of different skills such as agriculture or architecture. I can see arguments both ways.<lb/>
One of the most difficult matters in Scotland is tourism. Noble Lords have probably not read the report by the priests of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. It is an extremely good, well written and carefully worked oat report. It concludes that the cathedral has already been ruined from the point of view of worship, which after all was its main purpose, and unless the number of tourists can De reduced it will soon be physically destroyed. It will be physically destroyed as a result of the quantity of vehicles which park outside it and the number of people who tramp through it. We know that the Cairngorms face the problem of people trekking over wild areas.<lb/>
Therefore I believe that this new body should not encourage tourism. We already have a tourist board. The new body should stand apart from tourism. It is splendid that people should visit our natural heritage and sites of natural beauty but a limit may have to be imposed. Other considerations may have to be taken into account.<lb/>
I should also like to say a word about ownership. When I was secretary of the National Trust for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0333"/>
<col>587</col>
Scotland we found that it was of enormous advantage for the former owners to stay in properties. They looked after the property far better than any bureaucrat. They were far cheaper and far more acceptable to local people and the people who visited their properties. Therefore I am in favour of leaving the former owners of properties in charge as far as possible.<lb/>
The difficulty about that is that the former owners become very competitive. When a property is first taken over, the representative of the National Trust is taken on one side by the owner, who says "I don't want people tramping through my house and my bathroom". After a year or two he draws one aside again and says, "Old Colonel Stick-in-the-Mud is getting far more tourists than I am. I don't understand it, my house is much nicer than his. Would you mind putting advertisements in the local newspaper to encourage people to come and see it?" So continuity of ownership does not deal entirely with the problem of tourism, but I believe that as far as possible we should not go back to absentee landlords. They have a very bad reputation. The Nature Conservancy Council became extremely unpopular in Orkney because it sought to behave like an absentee landlord. We got rid of most of them in the last century. If anything is worse than an absentee landlord it is an absentee bureaucrat.<lb/>
When I was at the National Trust for Scotland we entered into covenants with people such as not to shoot on land and to protect this or that. Those covenants were extremely effective.<lb/>
If the Minister ever comes to Orkney I shall take him to a very beautiful historic house which is lived in and looked after by the local district nurse. She keeps it beautifully. Her family assist her and she receives grants for repairs to the roof and so on. She has been collecting furniture which originally came from the house. That relationship can only exist so long as the property does not belong to some bureaucratic body. If properties are taken over, for example, even by the National Trust for Scotland &#x2014;for which I have the highest admiration&#x2014;at once there have to be car parks, lavatories, an information centre and a tea room and it becomes extremely expensive.<lb/>
Now I come to the question of designation. We should take advantage of the Bill to look again at the designation of sites of special scientific interest and so forth. In a way the whole landscape of Scotland, or very nearly all of it, is of interest, as is that of Europe. I remember that when the best moorland of Orkney was designated, I spoke to one of the bureaucrats and he talked of it as being an internationally beautiful place. But so are Provence, Germany and Italy, as well as most of the landscape of Scotland. One has to be very careful about this matter in that some places are more deserving of preservation than others. We might possibly discuss that point when we come to discuss the Bill in more detail.<lb/>
I should like to raise one or two other questions about the Bill. Apart from the Title, to which I object, I notice that in Clause 1(3) it states that:
<col>588</col>
<quote>"For the purposes of this Act, 'the natural heritage of Scotland' includes the flora and fauna of Scotland, its geological and physiographical features, its natural beauty and amenity; and references to 'natural heritage' shall be construed accordingly".</quote>
That shows the dangers of specifying some things and leaving out others. Are fish a part of our natural heritage? I consider salmon to be as much a part of our natural heritage as the grouse. Are reptiles part of our natural heritage?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03660"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will turn to Clause 3, I think that he will see the answers to those questions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03661"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: But my Lords, should there be doubts there? It seems to me that even if those things appear in other places, they should appear at this point also.<lb/>
Again there is the very difficult question of fish farming that was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. I should like to return to the word "sustainable". I do not understand what sustainable means. Does it mean that one can embark on nothing if one cannot keep it going for all time? If that were the test, then Culzean Castle would never have been built. In modern times it is unsustainable except by public funds. Coal should not be mined because coal supplies cannot be sustained for ever. I do not see what "sustainable" means in the Bill. No doubt these are matters which will be discussed in Committee at some length.<lb/>
In conclusion, we meet today on a Monday and I understand that the Committee also will meet on a Monday. For those who occasionally go to the far north of Scotland it is not very convenient to meet on a Monday. I ask the Government to bear that in mind. I know that it also may not be suitable for those who live in the deserts of northern England and some other places. The Government might take into account that Monday is not an ideal day to discuss a Bill which will require a great deal of consideration in Committee.<lb/>
With those reservations I wish the Bill well. I believe that its main recommendations are on the right lines because above all we must ensure that this body is responsible to people in Scotland. Much as we may disapprove of the Secretary of State, he is our own man&#x2014;the Under-Secretary is too. We welcome the return to Scotland of some control over what will be a most important body.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03662">3.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03663"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my congratulations to the Government on bringing forward this Bill. In particular I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, on his admirable presentation. I understand how important and useful the measure will be. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, brought out some very good points and the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, went in for a great deal of detail. I shall not go into any detail at all today because I hope to do so at Committee stage. The Bill is very important. It is a very good moment to bring it forward and I hope that it will receive great support.<lb/>
There are large areas in Scotland which will qualify for special environmental care. This Bill will both
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0334"/>
<col>589</col>
control and help in irrigation&#x2014;a matter in which I am particularly interested. It will ensure that essential water supplies are delivered and protected. Supply in Scotland should be fairly easy since in many areas the annual rainfall is high. Oddly enough a drought in the summer can have a bad effect and if there is no snow in winter the springs in the hills of the area in which I live can dry up.<lb/>
One of the interesting things about the Borders, about which I am speaking, is that the water often comes entirely from springs, as it does on my estate, which is fairly large. So strong are the springs that they also supply the whole, quite sizeable village with water. I have never had to pay any water rates for the simple reason that all the water comes from my own ground. In a way that is rather curious. I do not know whether it happens elsewhere but it is so in that particular area.<lb/>
It is very important, particularly in the less favoured areas of which I am speaking, that we should make sure that irrigation is protected and encouraged. As I read the Bill, it will ensure that areas of doubtful supply are dealt with in one way or another. That will be of great help to agriculture.<lb/>
In the Borders, the River Tweed and the River Teviot are very strong rivers of supply, with many hill streams running into them. They are excellently managed both from the purification point of view and as regards amenities. Regulations protecting the river from careless pollution are very strict indeed. In my experience they work very well.<lb/>
Scotland has 47 per cent. of the sites of special scientific interest and 68 national nature reserves. Under this Bill they will still be protected and encouraged. In some parts of Scotland there are plans for developments of different kinds, but they will all be subject to approval by Scottish Natural Heritage.<lb/>
I have had some experience of the Nature Conservancy Council and the Countryside Commission. I feel confident that working together in one organisation will be very suitable indeed and will prove to be of great help. So often in matters concerned with local government and local areas there is too much competition from different interests. This measure will concentrate interests into one body for natural history under the Natural Heritage Bill, which will be very valuable.<lb/>
I hope that in the course of the Committee stage we shall be able to add to the provisions and improve the Bill. In the meantime I support it wholeheartedly and congratulate the Government on having brought it forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03664">3.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03665"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to offer my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. My only regret is that he does not appear here as the Minister of State to speak on Scottish affairs as it occurs to me that these matters have an importance that would justify that status. I recall very well (as will no doubt the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, behind me) the presence of his grandfather when we entered the Glasgow Town Council together. His
<col>590</col>
grandfather became a distinguished Minister of State at the Scottish Office and answered on Scottish questions in this House. It is a pleasant experience to find the young Lord, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, maintaining the traditions of his distinguished family and handling these matters with such competence.<lb/>
I am delighted to support the Bill in the House today. Noble Lords may recall that there was a fairly passionate debate in this Chamber on nature conservancy being decentralised to become part of the new organisation as described in the Bill. I recall the passionate speeches made by the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh of Haringey and Lord Ross of Newport, in opposition. One cannot get further from the Highlands of Scotland than Haringey and the Isle of Wight. Both noble Lords stirred the House and called a Division in order to frustrate the Bill that is before us now. Therefore I congratulate the Government and their supporters on their success.<lb/>
Now we have the Bill. Now we have the terms on which we shall construct this new enterprise. It will not be easy because the interests&#x2014;some conflicting, some harmonising &#x2014;are difficult to balance. We have had experience of the Nature Conservancy Council and its operations to date in Scotland. One of the reasons that I supported the Bill was to ensure that decisions in connection with the Scottish countryside should be made nearer the ground. In the past NCC powers have been exercised from Peterborough.<lb/>
I hope that the new organisation will be more sensitive to local needs. One of the difficulties from past experience has been that SSSIs were applied without appeal in large areas throughout Scotland. Over a million hectares in Scotland today are under SSSIs. Ten per cent. of the land surface of Scotland is under SSSIs, laid down by the Nature Conservancy Council. Those SSSIs will be maintained in the new Bill. I am not sure that they have always been sensibly and sensitively applied.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, talked about the balance between conservation and recreation. Conservation and recreation come within the province of the Bill but they are not the only interests that are to be affected in the application of the powers of the new organisation. First, there is no appeal against an SSSI. If the Nature Conservancy Council says, "It is a very nice and important place for birds to rest on their way back from South Africa or Iceland, or whatever", then that is so. One Member of this House told me recently that the Nature Conservancy Council said to him, "There is a pool of water on your land to which we think we should apply an SSSI". The noble Lord went with the local representative to look at it. He observed that it was a broken drain. That was about to be designated an SSSI for the birds.<lb/>
There are other considerations in the countryside than simply recreation and conservation. There are the interests of people who live and work in the countryside. I have always thought that one of the great aspects of the countryside was not simply admiring the wilderness areas of the Cairngorms but also to see people earning their living in the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0335"/>
<col>591</col>
countryside, in the saw mills, in forestry and in various other activities by which they choose to earn their living. I hope that the new body will be representative of balanced interests.<lb/>
Much has been said about Magnus Magnusson. He is a folk hero in Scotland. He is highly regarded, sensible and intelligent. However, Magnus Magnusson is the president of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. That is a special interest. I received a letter from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds today. It states:
<quote>"The RSPB expressed concerns at the splitting up of the Nature Conservancy Council",</quote>
and so on. That means that Magnus Magnusson, as president of the RSPB, or his organisation, has been opposed entirely to the Bill. The organisation has lobbied seriously against the Bill. I wonder whether, if I had been appointed chairman of the new body, people would have said, "You cannot appoint Lord Taylor because he is interested in forestry and that would upset the balance". I am not seeking appointment, but I point out that we have to be extremely careful that the body that we set up is balanced and that other interests are well represented.<lb/>
Local authorities&#x2014;the elected representatives of the people&#x2014;have a very important role to play in conservation. The SSSIs that are sprinkled over Scotland have been imposed over Scotland without a right of appeal. I hope that the new body will work closely with the elected representatives of the people. Those people are not elected. They are appointed by the Secretary of State. The local people elect their own representatives. I hope therefore that the land use strategies of the local authorities that have been developed in some parts of Scotland will be heeded when we consider the claims of recreation, conservation and other interests.<lb/>
I notice in today's <i>Glasgow Herald</i> that the Crofters' Union is apprehensive about the powers that have been taken to impose plans. It quotes its experience also of SSSIs. I hope therefore that the Crofters' Union, the local authorities, the Forestry Commission and people of that ilk will be represented on the new body so that we have balanced judgments. Many of the judgments that are made in this field are subjective. We have to be aware that people who have a passion for a particular aspect of conservation are not unduly predominant in decisions that will require to be made by the new body.<lb/>
Having said all that, I wish it well. It is a great exercise in decentralisation of authority which I support. I am sure that we shall benefit from the fact that it is Scottish-based. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, spoke of location. Anyone who has visited the beautiful headquarters of the Countryside Commission in the heart of Perthshire will probably recommend the Countryside Commission headquarters in the middle of Scotland as the appropriate place to locate this new and prestigious organisation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03667"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, was chairman of the Forestry Commission. I have always been prone to planting trees; my family have always planted trees. I also have always been in favour of the Forestry Commission.<lb/>
I shall speak about the Western Highlands and Islands. I know Scotland very well; I could almost speak about the Western Highlands and Islands in my sleep. However, when the Forestry Commission was set up at the end of the 1930s &#x2014;I may have the date wrong&#x2014;it made a mistake. It planted woods for about a mile along the sea shore. By doing so it made the uplands barren in winter because the wildlife&#x2014;the sheep and the deer&#x2014;could not get down to the shore to eat the seaweed which is a very good diet for them.<lb/>
I wish to point out that, although I have great respect for the official bodies, they are not God Almighty. They do not always have the practical experience of landowners whose families will no doubt continue to be landowners for a long time. However, I believe that Scottish Natural Heritage will be a satisfactory organisation.<lb/>
Although the flora and fauna are most important, I wish to raise a point about the natural fertility of the land. During the war, in my part of the Highlands the Government introduced sheep in their thousands to the hills. Whereas there had been a great deal of wildlife and many deer, the sheep came in their thousands. Sheep, especially the Black Face breed, are close grazers. After a few years on the shallow soil of the hills where there is heavy rainfall the sheep cause a great deal of damage to the natural herbage through grazing. The heavy rainfall leaves the soil very thin and that creates a great deal of screeing. I have lived a long time&#x2014;I am in my middle 70s&#x2014;and I can remember parts of the hills which were grass providing good grazing, but are now scree. Such problems must be looked at most carefully.<lb/>
I am happy with Scottish Natural Heritage but I am not happy with the Countryside Commission being amalgamated with that body. I am all for access by the public to beautiful scenery and for them enjoying themselves but I hope that the new Countryside Commission will not pour too many tens of thousands of people into the Western Highlands. In my opinion it is one of the most beautiful parts of the world, and I have travelled all over the world.<lb/>
I have property on the beautiful Isle of Mull which I have tried to preserve. Messrs. David MacBrayne are running a new ferry which can carry about 1,000 people and 400 cars to the Isle of Mull. They run only two boats per day in the winter but six per day during the summer. The ferries are not always full but often they are packed. If 3,000 or 4,000 people per day are being ferried to a beautiful but small island&#x2014;it is not as large as Skye&#x2014;eventually the wildlife will be destroyed or driven away. A great deal of flora and fauna will also be destroyed even though they are protected by SSSIs.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0336"/>
<col>593</col>
I have many SSSIs on my estate because a great deal of it is geologically interesting. Many years ago I invited members of the International Geological Society to visit for about three weeks. It is a geologically important part of the world and I have always allowed learned parties, geologists and so forth to visit at certain times of the year. There are only two or three months when I do not allow this. I have an agreement with several universities and polytechnics. They have behaved well and do not send visitors at times other than the eight or nine months when I welcome them.<lb/>
I wish to point out that much of the press appears to believe that landowners are wicked people. I could never understand the reason for that belief, although perhaps it is true of some of the new landowners who have made a fortune on the Stock Exchange. If it had not been for the old type of landowner a great deal of our heritage would have vanished.<lb/>
I see that my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy is ready to speak but I wish to make one further point. I have a large fish hatchery on my Mull estates. It supplies many of the cages around the west coast of Scotland. As a result of greed, the fish farms which we supply have been almost closed down for about three months. Disease has struck the salmon smolts, especially in the north of Scotland, and it is a serious matter. It is a result of greed because people overstocked the sea cages, did not clean them properly and so forth. I could continue on the subject for hours because I am pretty well informed about it. However, I shall now sit down and allow my betters to speak!</membercontribution></p>

I congratulate the Government on the speed with which they have introduced the Bill following the enactment of the Environmental Protection Bill. I took a special interest in Part VII of what is now the Environmental Protection Act 1990 because it foreshadowed what is now in their Scottish Bill. Towards the end of last year I was co-opted onto the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Science and Technology under the chairmanship of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver. I was very pleased to serve on that committee. I believe that its recommendations greatly assisted the Government in improving their original proposals for reorganisation of the NCC and Countryside Commissions.<lb/>
There is one particular reason why I have supported the principle of that reorganisation as regards Scotland. The lines of responsibility had become tangled and were unclear to members of the public involved. First, let us consider the roles of Ministers. The Secretary of State for the Environment takes no decisions in Scotland. He is the Minister for England, not only on environmental subjects but also on housing, local government&#x2014;for example, the community charge&#x2014;water and everything else which
<col>594</col>
falls in Scotland to the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Scottish Office. That has been so for at least 30 years, before the Welsh Office came into existence and when the Department of the Environment was called the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.<lb/>
The Nature Conservancy Council has had functions in England, Scotland and Wales but has been sponsored by one Minister; namely, the Secretary of State for the Environment. It reported to him. He takes no decisions in Scotland because those are all within the responsibility of the Scottish Secretary. When controversial or difficult issues have arisen in Scotland, that paradox in responsibilities has made matters worse. Furthermore, the field of nature conservation is one in which proposals affecting particular areas need to be discussed with local people and handled with great sensitivity.<lb/>
At Report stage of the Environmental Protection Bill on 17th October, I alluded to anxiety which has been felt in some areas of Scotland about the designation of vast areas as sites of special scientific interest&#x2014;SSSIs. That has been mentioned already in the debate today. The word "site" has lost its meaning when hundreds of thousands of hectares are designated.<lb/>
As I believe noble Lords know, I am in favour of the system. For most of my life I have been known in Scotland as a conservationist and a bird man in particular. My home is in the local authority area of the Highland Regional Council. That council has informed me that no fewer than 380,000 hectares of its area have been designated; that is about 15 per cent. of its area, which is about one-third of the whole area of Scotland.<lb/>
Some residents of the Highland Region have the unfortunate impression that designation has the effect of blight or devaluation of the land. I hope that the reorganisation proposed in this Bill will change all that. Members of the Highland Regional Council are anxious that there should be an improved understanding of the system and the reasons for it.<lb/>
I raised one question on this aspect during that debate on 17th October. My noble friend Lady Blatch was replying but she could not reply to that point at the end of the debate. I wrote to her immediately afterwards and she has now replied to me. The point I was making was about the question of any form of appeal or referral from decisions of the NCC as it then was. With the speedy publication of this Bill, it seems that the answers as regards Scotland should now come from my noble friend Lord Strathclyde in interpreting its provisions.<lb/>
I asked whether Scottish Natural Heritage will be both investigator and final decision maker on its own proposals or whether there will be provision for referral to an independent body or a Minister when, for example, a local authority, reputable organisation or individuals fail to reach agreement with this new body.<lb/>
The Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland, which has just been created by the Act which we
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0337"/>
<col>595</col>
passed, will now have a life of not more than a year or so. Therefore, we must look at this Bill to see what it proposes.<lb/>
I see that powers of compulsory purchase are to be given to the new body, but in that case the authority of the Secretary of State is required. I believe that in Scotland the position is still that any power of compulsory purchase requires, in all statutes, the authority of the Secretary of State for Scotland.<lb/>
Clause 10 provides for the Secretary of State to give general or specific directions. If a dispute unfortunately arises, can the Secretary of State give a specific direction to end it, either in favour of SNH or of the other contender? Will the Secretary of State be able to use the power to call in a decision? That is a power which he can and does use in the town and country planning legislation.<lb/>
Everyone concerned in nature conservation and the countryside will wish the new body good fortune and success. However, there are some who want to know if there is to be any referral or appeal procedure in contested cases arising from the new body's proposals.<lb/>
I was personally delighted to hear that Mr. Magnusson had accepted the chairmanship and was the chairman-designate of the new body. Of course, he would be Sir Magnus were it not for his Icelandic nationality. I believe that he will start with much goodwill and public support in Scotland. I can add to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe. I put a question to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds when it was giving evidence to the sub-committee because Mr. Magnusson's appointment had been announced only a few days beforehand. From the answers I received from the chief executive, who was against the original proposals for this merger of the two bodies, I am satisfied that there is a wide area for different opinions within that society. It has many members and I can quite understand that. The man who has been president of the society for some time is taking on this new job and is therefore accepting the reorganisation. That should be very helpful.<lb/>
On the question of new bodies and new names raised in this Bill, I should like to mention again the subject of names of departments with a view to helping the public to discover what they do. Twenty years ago the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which had no functions in Scotland, was renamed the Department of the Environment. Its duties still include housing and local government and do not extend to Scotland. During the passage of the Environmental Protection Bill earlier this year I pointed out that the word "environment" is not included in the names of any of the departments of the Scottish Office which include other subjects such as home and health, education, agriculture and fisheries.<lb/>
Over 30 years ago a Scottish Office department was created and called simply the Scottish Development Department. It was given that single description largely because it covered so many subjects including housing, local government, roads and electricity. Since
<col>596</col>
then another department&#x2014;Industry Department, Scotland&#x2014;has taken from it most of the subjects affecting industry and development. I believe that it would be much clearer to people in Scotland and, more important, the public outside Scotland that environmental matters should be one of the main concerns of that department. Otherwise, it is thought that it is only in favour of development and gives priority to that. Therefore, I suggest that the name should be changed to the Environment Department of Scotland&#x2014;EDS&#x2014;and not the Scottish Environment Department because that would have the initials SED which are the well known initials of the Scottish Education Department.<lb/>
The department now called the Scottish Development Department has at present the functions which are exercised by the Department of the Environment in England. The new name would therefore help the public to identify its role and perceive that it matched its counterpart south of the Border while working under the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is anomalous that one of the ministers at the Scottish Office now has "environment" in his designation, but no department has. My honourable friend Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is designated the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment.<lb/>
I should remind your Lordships that it was I who introduced the system of designations of Scottish Office Ministers 20 years ago when I was Secretary of State, so I hope your Lordships will not mind my making suggestions about this now. Of course I recognise the inconvenience of changing names and I accept that it should not be done too speedily but over a period in order to save expense. Nevertheless I hope that the Government are seriously considering the suggestion.<lb/>
I have also a question for the Opposition Front Bench which I hope can be answered, because it affects this reorganisation and the proposals in the Bill. In a recent policy statement the Labour Party announced that if it was to form a government it would institute a minister for environmental protection. Opposition spokesmen must have given some thought to how this appointment would operate. I ask: would this new minister have a co-ordinating or supervisory role, or would he have a new department? If there is to be a new department, would it cover Scotland and Wales as well as England? I ask because a similar situation arose in 1964. Before the General Election in that year the Labour manifesto stated that the Labour Party would establish a new ministry for land and natural resources. It was duly established, but it lasted only two years. In 1966 it was dismantled and packed up.<lb/>
When it was being formed in late 1964 and early 1965 I put Questions to the Prime Minister of the day in another place on whether its mandate would include Scotland. The Welsh Office had not come into existence then. The replies at first indicated that this had not yet been decided. Later, when it was decided, the new ministry's mandate did not extend to Scotland.<lb/>
I could understand the dilemma in that proposal because it had been ventilated widely as a new ministry
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0338"/>
<col>597</col>
which would have wide overall responsibility for environmental subjects. For more than one-third of the land and natural resources of Britain not to be included detracted from the concept. On the other hand, to have taken away from the Scottish Office functions which it had possessed for years would have been unpopular with Scots and would have provided ammunition for the Nationalists. I want to point out that this could occur again.<lb/>
One of the main reasons for its abolition only two years after its creation was the difficulty of drawing lines between departments and in particular the complete exclusion of Scotland. I must add that an important casualty was the loss of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Sir Freddie Bishop. He had been promoted to the job at a youthful age but with a high reputation, having been principal private secretary for some time to Prime Ministers. He then departed and went to the City, where, I understand, he has lived happily ever afterwards; but that was a loss to the public service.<lb/>
I note that there is no second speech to come from the Opposition Front Bench, but I shall listen with interest to answers to these questions arising from the present proposals of the official Opposition during later stages of this Bill. In the meantime, I strongly support its principles.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03671"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, and to offer my general support for Scottish Natural Heritage as proposed in this Bill. However, I should like to put down a marker about an initiative which the Countryside Commission for Scotland is planning and which, I suppose, may be taken over by Scottish Natural Heritage in due course.<lb/>
The Countryside Commission for Scotland, or the CCS as I shall call it, has produced a report entitled <i>The Mountain Areas of Scotland: Conservation and Management,</i> which proposes that at least four large national parks should be set up in areas of some of our finest mountain scenery. I must declare an interest, in that I own land which the CCS proposes to include in one of its national parks. I hope your Lordships will not feel that this clouds my judgment too much, because I intend to offer what I trust are some fairly objective criticisms of the CCS report.<lb/>
To start with, their consultation process does not appear to have been as full as your Lordships would expect for a proposal of this importance. For example, I was certainly not consulted in any way, and nor was any other landowner with whom I have been able to discuss the project. We were not sent a copy of the report when it came out, either. The landowners and their representatives have become involved in the consultation process, but only because they went rather aggressively to meet it and not because it came, as I feel it should have done, to meet them.<lb/>
This lack of proper consultation with the landowners is not surprising if one reads the report carefully. It has all the hallmarks of a document whose authors wished to reach a predetermined conclusion
<col>598</col>
and who were not interested in any advice they may have received along the way which did not accord with that conclusion.<lb/>
It is actually quite a disturbing document. I hope I am not being alarmist if I suggest that it is capable of socialist, confiscatory interpretations. For instance, at least part of its inspiration is exposed right at the start. I quote:
<quote>"A sense of injury about land tenure continues in the Highlands today."</quote>
That is a statement which requires examination in the overall context of the Highland heritage and the Highland economy today. There is also a disturbing assumption that somehow local authorities should be very influential in the new national parks. I think that is also an assumption which requires much greater examination.<lb/>
Given that inspiration, it is perhaps not surprising that the national parks are intended to have some truly draconian powers, which are of course to be found lurking in an annex. The new national parks are to have powers. Again I quote:
<quote>"to manage land and co-ordinate other land-controlling organisations; to impose land management orders, as a last resort; to purchase land, compulsorily where necessary; to introduce bye-laws to control nuisances; and to enter into management agreements to secure access."</quote>
This being so, it is not surprising that throughout the report the landowners are assumed to be responsible for everything that is alleged to have gone wrong. There is only one grudging reference to the fact that if this land is as fine as the authors suggest&#x2014;and I believe it may be&#x2014;the landowners themselves must deserve some credit for their management over the past 150 years or so. This grudging reference appears on page 12, when the report admits that, &#x2014;and I quote:
<quote>"Estate management in the mountains has led to slow change, and this has served some aspects of the public interest."</quote>
Also significant is the admission that landowners have taken, and do take, a generally tolerant approach to public access.<lb/>
So of what are the wicked landowners supposed to be guilty, apart from some general undefined lack of management in the public interest? The report identifies three specific areas of concern and, in my view, all of them could be better dealt with by an extension of existing mechanisms and powers than by the creation of national parks. Those concerns are, first, the bulldozing of unsightly hill tracks. If that is a problem&#x2014;and I believe it is&#x2014;it is not confined to the proposed national park areas. It is much more widespread throughout Scotland. Surely that is an activity which could be controlled through an extension of existing planning controls and/or by Scottish Natural Heritage when it takes over. National parks are unnecessary and will not deal with the generality of the problem.<lb/>
The second concern is that there are too many unsightly plantations full of alien trees. That is true. But I fancy the Minister may wish to examine the role
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0339"/>
<col>599</col>
of the Forestry Commission in this regard. I am sure that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.<lb/>
The third accusation is that landowners are not shooting enough red deer, particularly hinds, and these are spoiling the local ecology. That accusation may also be just. However, we do not need a national park authority to show us the solution. The Minister said that the Government intend to give the Red Deer Commission power to shoot more deer. With the greatest respect, I wonder whether even that is the solution. It may need to exist as a background power, but it is not the front line solution. It would be much simpler to alter the season during which deer, particularly hinds, may be shot, by bringing forward the hind shooting season from 20th October, when winter is fast approaching, to, say, 1st September. That change would have many other spin-off advantages for the Highland economy, which I do not have sufficient time to mention now.<lb/>
An overall point I should like to make regarding deer, landowners and the Highland economy is that this is not the right moment to attack the deer interests. The deer, with the money and the employment which they bring to the Highland economy, are vital. We live in a time when the common agricultural policy is in doubt, when the grant on sheep is falling, and we, the deer managers, are struggling on, receiving only one-third of the price we received last year for our venison, without any grant at all from the Government.<lb/>
At the same time, I should have thought some consideration should be given to encourage cattle onto the hill in the summer, balanced with sheep and deer, away from the practices of the past 150 years which have encouraged sheep and deer to take over entirely. Earthworms cannot live under the droppings of sheep and deer. They need cow pats.<lb/>
I hope that that shows how at least some of the more important assumptions and conclusions contained in the report are seriously flawed. Another fundamental error is that the CCS does not appear to have considered&#x2014;or rather I understand it considered but decided to discard&#x2014;the honeypot effect of turning some of our finest landscape into national parks. Such a designation would inevitably bring more people. Large numbers of people, however much we may welcome and want them, do not fit well with delicate wildlife and natural habitats. The parallel experience in other parts of Europe proves that point. Therefore national parks may defeat the object of the exercise, if that object is indeed to preserve our finest natural heritage.<lb/>
If we really want to reconcile the interests of recreation, true nature conservation and the local communities that live in our remote areas, this report is not the way to start. I hope that Scottish Natural Heritage will ignore it and start afresh with itself in the driving seat.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03673"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although I do not have a direct interest, I should possibly declare an indirect interest in the Cairngorms. My husband has a house in that area and my family has an estate. I had not originally intended to speak today but as the debate has proceeded one or two matters have arisen that concern me greatly.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, gave an example of the kind of arrogant disregard for owners of property on the part of the Countryside Commission which many of us have experienced in the past and about which we are worried lest Scottish Natural Heritage repeats such disregard in the future. From reading the Bill it appears that Scottish Natural Heritage is to have draconian powers with no duty to consult either the owners of property or such interested organisations as, for example, the Scottish Landowners' Federation, the Red Deer Commission, the Forestry Commission or, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, said, the representatives of the people. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, would care to comment on that point.<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned in his opening speech the powers that the Government intend to confer on the Red Deer Commission to cull excess deer. Does that mean that the Red Deer Commission will simply walk on to estates and begin shooting? Or does it propose to offer assistance to owners carrying out the cull themselves?<lb/>
It is perhaps not appreciated as widely as it should be that deer forests have a quota of stags and hinds which they should kill each year in order to keep the herd down to such numbers as the forest will support, with or without additional feeding in the winter. That quota is decided by the Red Deer Commission. Well-run estates take trouble to try to achieve the target. In a hard winter weather conditions may make it difficult for the estate staff to kill the necessary numbers before the end of the season.<lb/>
On a well-run estate tenants are obliged to shoot old, sickly or disabled stags with poor heads. They cannot simply shoot any stag they wish; they must shoot the one indicated by the stalker. If the stalker is good and the estate is well run it will be the deformed head, the poor, sickly, aged stag that they will shoot, not the one that they fancied they could take home to Germany or Italy as a fine trophy. That is to allow the best animals to breed and improve the stock. The stalker will bear similar principles in mind when killing hinds later in the season.<lb/>
Perhaps the noble Lord will say what line the Red Deer Commission is proposing to take. Will it be co-operating with the landowner or riding roughshod over him? The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, spoke of the suggestion that certain areas, particularly the Cairngorms, should be designated as national parks. As he said, the very name "national park" acts as a magnet to tourists. The area of the Cairngorms is already approaching saturation point in that regard. Even walkers who stick to the paths, if there are too many of them, eventually erode the paths. I believe
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0340"/>
<col>601</col>
that has happened in parts of the Lake District. When people ride mountain bikes either on paths or, worse still, off them, and indulge in off-piste and sometimes very far off-piste skiing&#x2014;now called cross-country skiing&#x2014;in winter, it does great damage not only to the paths but to the flora and fauna. I do not know how one copes with that situation. It is very serious. Designating large areas as national parks will not help.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, said that he hoped that Scottish Natural Heritage will bear in mind that people live and work in the Cairngorms and in those parts of Scotland it is so anxious to conserve. I hope that it will respect their livelihoods and the quality of life those people have enjoyed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, also suggested that the headquarters of Scottish Natural Heritage should be in Perthshire. I heartily endorse that suggestion. I suggest that it should be in or very near Perth because that is about the only place in Scotland which can be reached in one day from any part of the country.</membercontribution></p>

It is obvious from the quality of discussion this afternoon and from the number of questions and arguments that have arisen that the Bill is very important for Scotland. I look forward to developing some of the arguments and answering, I hope, some of the questions at a later stage.<lb/>
I have one question to put to the Minister. When we were discussing Part VII of the Environmental Protection Bill, which is the parent of this Bill, we were helped to a large extent by at least having some of the names of the people who are to run the new body. My noble friend Lord Carmichael raised the matter in his speech. I make a special plea to the Minister. I hope that he will provide during subsequent stages of the Bill at least some of the names of those who will be on the new body. That will help us to have a flavour of the kind of body it will be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03678"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a sassenach and a townie, I would like to have an answer from either the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, or the noble Lady, on a matter which is of concern to me. The noble Lord referred to the hinds being slaughtered. The word "culled" is just another euphemism. Once again it is the poor old female, and I wonder why. Surely, it is the stag which does the damage. I do not follow that at all.
<col>602</col>
The noble Lady referred to both being slaughtered. Is there such a number of these beautiful creatures that they have to he killed just for the clearance of the woods? That is something which I find extraordinarily difficult to understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03679"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer is yes. If there are too many of them they starve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03680"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may add to what the noble Lady said. The last wolf was shot in Scotland in 1703. There are now no natural enemies of the red deer herd except for man. If those of us who have the responsibility for controlling the number of deer on our ground do not control enough of them, they die an extremely unpleasant death, usually in the late spring. Death is caused not so much through starvation but by eating the fresh grass when it comes through. I shall not trouble your Lordships with the pain and suffering that that causes. It is in those circumstances that the deer wander further and raid crops and cause other damage. It is for this reason that the Red Deer Commission feels that the estates are not shooting &#x2014;I do not much like the word "cull"&#x2014;mough hinds. There is not so much of a problem with the stags because they tend to be shot in September and October when the days are longer. Stags also have a much higher value to the estates, because foreigners and others come in, to the benefit of the Highland economy, and pay considerable sums to shoot them.<lb/>
After 20th October the stalkers, who are the professionals on the estates, tend to be left to get on with the job of shooting sufficient hinds. Because of poor conditions, short days, and for all kinds of other reasons, in recent years the stalkers have not been achieving that sufficiency. That is why I have suggested that it might be sensible to move the season for shooting hinds further forward. That would allow the cull between stags and hinds to be more properly balanced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03682"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not expect to be back in this country in time to speak in the debate. In fact, the job has been much better done by my noble friend Lord Grimond. However, now I am here, I cannot resist saying something. The debate has ranged in various directions. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has given a very full explanation. I suggest that he should fill it out by writing to the noble Baroness so that she can understand what goes on.<lb/>
I can tell her that some Highlanders think that the wolves have been replaced by landlords. That is not true. The foreigners who come to shoot also give good money which is very useful in the "Highlands. I welcome the Bill and the setting up of the body. The time is right to co-ordinate environmental protection in Scotland. Every single body is now looking at this issue. We have no less than two reports which were debated at length in this House the other day, both dealing with matters on the same lines and both concerned with what we can do to preserve and improve the environment.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0341"/>
<col>603</col>
It is admirable that the heritage body is being set up in Scotland to run Scottish affairs. Though the conservationists in England say that conservation is international, the fact is that Scottish affairs and Scottish heritage will be better looked after in Scotland by Scotsmen and Icelanders, however much the English may think they can do it better.<lb/>
Magnus Magnusson is an admirable choice as chairman of the new body. I hope that he will realise that the heritage also includes Scottish people. There is a tendency on the part of some conservationists to put birds before people in the countryside. Such matters have to be taken into account by a Scottish body in order to balance exactly the concerns of the countryside and the people in it besides the wildlife. I believe that those factors will be well looked after by the new body.<lb/>
Agriculture in the Highlands and the uplands needs a new look. We are no longer desperately in need of food because we have great surpluses. We are spending a great deal of money on supporting them. A great deal of that money could go to the different objective of properly balancing the environment. The noble Lord is quite right in saying that there is no question about cattle. It is not clear whether it is better to crop the grass shorter and aerate the ground or whether it is the dung patch itself which encourages the fertility of the soil and with it the worm. The cattle on the hill have to be balanced with the heather. If there is a great deal of heather, more farmers will pay money to shoot grouse. There is a great deal of balancing to be done. I hope that it will be an expert body which will advise the agriculture department on how to make this proper balance in our affairs.<lb/>
I am very glad that the Scots are going to sort out their own affairs and look after the environment in Scotland. I hope and trust that the Government and the Minister, who is new, young and energetic, will see to it that they get enough money to do the job.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03684"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened very carefully to the debate and I have no hesitation in saying that I found it interesting. The quality of the contributions was of a very high standard. I am grateful to all those who spoke. Clearly, a great deal of thought had gone into each of the speeches. There is particular proof of that because in the gap we had three extra speakers. I am not sure whose fault it was although I thought it was that of my noble friend Lord Massereene and Ferrard. That was until the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, said that he had just returned to the country. It was at that stage that I heard that the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, were due to speak. I am very glad that they did.<lb/>
The Government have given a great deal of thought to these proposals before submitting them to the House. While there may be some disagreement on the details there is no fundamental dispute about the merger itself. I was glad to hear the overall congratulations from noble Lords on all sides of the
<col>604</col>
House, particularly from the noble Lords, Lord Carmichael and Lord Taylor of Gryfe, and from my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy. My noble friend was a great battler on the Environmental Protection Act, especially on Part VII, as indeed was the noble Lord, Lord Taylor.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, regretted the fact that the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh of Haringey and Lord Ross of Newport, were not present to listen to the debate. I have to agree with him. It would have been excellent if they had been here to see what has developed out of our debates on Part VII of the Environmental Protection Act and to see the good work that has gone into creating something which I know will be workable.<lb/>
Perhaps I may now turn to some of the detailed points raised during the course of the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, asked why we were having a single Bill rather than two separate Bills. I find myself in a difficult position. I am sure that if I had come to the House with two separate Bills the noble Lord would have asked why, as these matters concern environmental issues, we did not have a single Bill. We are frequently criticised for overloading the legislative programme. The two parts of the Bill&#x2014;water and heritage&#x2014;are both environmental matters and fit in well together.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Carmichael and Lord Grimond, mentioned the word "sustainability" and asked how we would define it. In fact, there was a good deal of discussion about definition. We are the guardians of the heritage of our successors. We can do that properly only if we manage our heritage. In the words of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister:
<quote>"We do not hold a freehold on our world, but only a full repairing lease".</quote>
In addition, the White Paper on the environment said that we should not be sacrificing tomorrow's prospects for largely illusory gains today and that we have a moral duty to look after our planet and to hand it on in good order.<lb/>
These concepts are the essence of sustainability. They do not mean preservation and not allowing things to change, but making sure that when changes occur in the use of land and water resources they do not irretrievably damage the natural environment and impair the heritage that we wish to hand on. That is what we mean by sustainability. No doubt we shall discuss that at greater length when we reach the Committee stage.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, said that the balance between recreation and conservation would be crucial to the operation of SNH. The Government do not expect SNH to solve all of Scotland's environmental problems or to remove all conflict between developers and conservationists and single-handedly move the Scottish economy to a base of sustainable use of resources. Such ambitions are unrealistic. The role of the new agency will be to maintain and extend the work of NCCS and CCS, building on their existing strengths, carrying forward their existing duties and responsibilities and bringing
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0342"/>
<col>605</col>
about changes in attitudes and behaviour towards the conservation and enjoyment of Scotland's natural heritage.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Grimond, asked about the name Scottish Natural Heritage. It has been chosen because it best encapsulates what we are trying to achieve&#x2014;a Scottish body responsible for the conservation and enjoyment of nature's bequest which can influence positively man's use of it so as to hand it on in good heart to future generations. It is a simple, distinct name. It readily identifies the new organisation and sets out its focus of attention. Throughout the process of consultation it has been the Government's preferred option and we have received no better suggestion, though of course it will be open to the noble Lord to bring one forward when we reach the Committee stage. I looked at a list of about 25 alternative names. I felt that none was better than Scottish Natural Heritage.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Grimond, made an excellent speech. He brought together a good many different strands about the countryside, its management and the heritage bodies which currently exist. He asked what the country should be. That is the kind of question which Scottish Natural Heritage will need to answer in real situations. He also said that those organisations tend to act like God, a point echoed by my noble friend Lord Massereene and Ferrard. We have no desire to see SNH turn into that kind of organisation. The major role of the organisation is to advise and to work with landowners and occupiers. That is crucial.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Grimond, also asked whether the areas of expertise for the board would be geographical or academic. Geographical representation will be taken into account and we envisage a series of regional boards. We shall have to wait before we can announce the participants on the board. It is important that there should be some continuity from the existing NCCS boards and the Countryside Commission boards.<lb/>
I am glad to have heard so much said about Magnus Magnusson, the chairman of NCCS. Having met him only recently, I too believe that he is just the right kind of person to take on the very real challenges that SNH will face over the next few years and to create the foundations that such a body will need. A question was asked about his work on the Cairngorms Working Party. He has been appointed to the chairmanship of the Cairngorms Working Party in his capacity as chairman designate of Scottish Natural Heritage. The working party will operate from early 1991 to early 1992. We do not envisage it getting in the way of his work in setting up SNH itself.<lb/>
Many noble Lords referred to the role of SSSIs and said that this was not properly explained, especially to local people. They also pointed out that there is no right of appeal. The noble Lords, Lord Carmichael and Lord Taylor, the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and my noble friend Lord Campbell all mentioned this point. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, spoke of draconian powers. I agree. I can understand the great concern about the SSSI system being seen not entirely
<col>606</col>
to have worked. NCC Scotland has therefore been asked to review its procedures and the procedures it uses within the present statutory framework. Although we do not propose to change the present arrangements, we seek a more positive approach through negotiating positive management agreements between the landowner, the land user and SNH, which will be so greatly concerned with creating a sustainable environment for natural heritage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03685"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has said that the new body will look at the procedures for the application of SSSIs. Will he look at the existing SSSIs, which have been imposed without right of appeal? Are they to stand without review?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03686"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will be up to the new successor organisation itself to see whether an SSSI should remain an SSSI or whether in the future there may be a point in changing it.<lb/>
Several noble Lords referred to the location of Scottish Natural Heritage. We shall be keen not to find an urban location, which I think all noble Lords will appreciate would not be the most appropriate place for an environmental conservation body. But whether it will be just outside Perth, in the Borders or somewhere in the Highlands remains to be decided. I was most grateful to my noble friend Lady Elliot for the support she expressed for the Bill. I am very much looking forward to hearing her when we come to the Committee stage. I know that her many years of involvement in the countryside will be useful to our later deliberations.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Grimond, my noble friend Lord Massereene and Ferrard and to some extent the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, talked about tourism. I believe that we need to look at two major principles in respect of tourism. The first is extending the seasonality and the second is regionalisation. In that way we shall be able to avoid the situation where tourists visit honeypot areas and thereby create the Notre Dame type problems which we have seen in Paris and which have arisen in some areas of Scotland.<lb/>
Visitor management is a concept which is crucial to helping the spread of tourists around Scotland and ensuring that they see as many different parts of it as possible without ruining the environment which they have come to see. The SNH is not a tourism body, but it will have a role to play in increasing the understanding of visitors about the environment so as to prevent any damage to it.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy mentioned the role that he played in designating the names of ministers. I shall read his words most carefully and pass them on to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. However, he made one important point. He referred to the Labour Party proposals for creating a minister for the environment in Scotland. He said that they had not been properly thought out. That came as no surprise to me. One has just to look at the Scottish Labour Party's proposals on the constitutional convention to see that very few of them
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0343"/>
<col>607</col>
have been properly thought out. However, I am sure that the Labour Party never considered talking to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03687"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for referring to what I said. However, as a matter of accuracy, perhaps I should point out that I was asking for information rather than suggesting that the proposals had not been thought out. In fact, I actually said that I presumed that the Opposition spokesmen had thought them out. I shall be interested to hear about this in due course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03688"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to my noble friend for not having listened to him properly in the first place. No doubt at some stage we shall hear from noble Lords opposite exactly what they envisage for the future.<lb/>
My noble friend also asked about the role of the Secretary of State and whether he would act as an arbiter in disputes, as is the current procedure in respect of planning cases. SNH will be the legal adviser to the Secretary of State on all natural heritage matters. It will be for the Secretary of State to decide how to act in the circumstances of a particular dispute and to balance the advice from SNH against all the other factors which will undoubtedly arise.<lb/>
I was very glad that my noble friend Lord Pearson mentioned mountain areas and the consultation exercise which has just been completed with the Countryside Commission. We are awaiting the outcome of that exercise before deciding the way forward. However, perhaps I may emphasise to him the fact that no decisions have been made by government. There is an opportunity for everyone to state their views. I understand that the Scottish Landowners' Federation has responded substantially to the proposals which have been put forward. Obviously the federation's views will be studied carefully, as will those of my noble friend. They will be read with great interest.<lb/>
I am glad that there was mention of deer shooting at the end of the general debate, especially as regards the start date of the hind shooting season. We shall consider a whole range of proposals that have been put forward by the Scottish Landowners' Federation on this important issue.<lb/>
Perhaps I may conclude by saying that the establishment of Scottish Natural Heritage will create better opportunities for positive action in the use and management of Scotland's natural heritage. It will also offer the chance to promote the sustainable use of that heritage. The new body will be a source of co-ordinated advice and guidance to government.<lb/>
I am aware that during the course of the debate I may not have been able to answer every question put to me by noble Lords. However, I shall read <i>Hansard</i> most carefully and perhaps I may write to noble Lords on any issues that were left unanswered.<lb/>
The Bill fulfils the Government's commitment for the creation of an effective, integrated and independent natural heritage agency. Its establishment will
<col>608</col>
mark the beginning of a new era in the management, use and enjoyment of our natural heritage. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Criminal Justice (Confiscation) (Northern<lb/> Ireland) Order 1990</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03689">5.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03690"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Lord Skelmersdale)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 15th October be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03691">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I need hardly remind you of our determination to fight the evil trade in illicit drugs. The anti-drug trafficking measures in this order will bring Northern Ireland into line with Great Britain and will provide the United Kingdom as a whole with strong and effective legislation in this area. Apart from attacking crime domestically&#x2014;as much serious crime is international in nature&#x2014;it will in particular clear the way for UK ratification of the United Nations Convention Against the Illicit Trade in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, known as the Vienna Convention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03692">The order does more than provide that convicted criminals shall be liable to have the proceeds of their crimes confiscated in certain circumstances. The House will recall that the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 was the first such measure. This of course applied solely to the proceeds of drug trafficking. Since then the law has been updated by Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to extend confiscation to other serious crime. This order comprises the provisions of both statutes for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03693">The order will give the Crown Court and, in a few exceptional cases, magistrates' courts, the power to confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences. Where a person is convicted of a drug trafficking offence the Crown Court must make a confiscation order for an amount equal to the full value of his proceeds of drug trafficking unless the defendant's realisable property is assessed to be insufficient to meet that amount. In the case of offences other than drug trafficking offences, the courts will have a discretionary power to order confiscation but only if the proceeds exceed a minimum amount of &#x00A3;10,000.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03694">As the main purpose of the order is to deprive the offender of his illicit gains I am sure that noble Lords will agree that it is important for the courts to have adequate powers to enforce confiscation orders. Accordingly, it is provided that such orders will be enforced in the same manner as fines, with the important exception that terms of imprisonment in default must run consecutively rather than concurrently with any other sentence of imprisonment imposed for the offence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03695">However, to ensure that defendants do not have a choice between paying a confiscation order or opting
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0344"/>
<col>609</col>
to spend additional time in prison in default, the order provides the High Court with powers to freeze the offender's assets to ensure that these are not disposed of before a confiscation order can be enforced. The High Court may appoint a receiver to seize and realise an offender's assets. The order also creates in connection with drug trafficking a number of offences relating to what is commonly known as laundering. These are regarded as serious offences and will carry a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment or a fine, or both.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03696">The order will replicate for Northern Ireland provisions already in force in Great Britain which relate to the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences. I am confident that it will help curb the growth of drug trafficking and other organised crime. While Northern Ireland is fortunate in that the drugs problem has been on a comparatively modest scale, there is no room for complacency. This order will ensure that the Province, together with the rest of the United Kingdom, will play its part in the fight against international crime.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03697">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 15th October be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Skelmersdale.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03698"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like first to thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for his explanation of the order. Although the articles of the order do not have the merit of simplicity, its main underlying objective is simple. It is right in principle, as I am sure your Lordships will agree. That principle is that the offender should be relieved of the profits of his crime so as to remove the financial attractiveness of the offence. That principle has been adopted in recent legislation, as the Minister explained.<lb/>
I am conscious that the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, in paragraphs 17.9 and 17.10 of this year's review of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts 1978 and 1987, drew attention to the powers of courts in England, Wales and Scotland to order the confiscation of property. Those powers are to be found in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 and Part IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.<lb/>
Although the principle is agreed, it has proved difficult in practice to apply it smoothly. The three pieces of legislation to which I have just referred introduce three different confiscation codes, although their provisions sometimes overlap. The Minister has explained that the main effect of the order is to apply to Northern Ireland Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Drugs Trafficking Offences Act, as amended by the 1988 Act. We fully support that objective.<lb/>
I want to ask the Minister one major question: will the order, with its powers of restraint, the power to impose a charge and powers of confiscation, also enable the courts to strike effectively at terrorist racketeering? Is that possible, and is it a likely consequence? The Minister will be aware that that is a matter which greatly troubles many people. The noble Viscount referred to it in his review which was published earlier this year. Does the order, directly or
<col>610</col>
indirectly, help the courts in their fight against terrorism? That is the major question. Other questions pale into insignificance compared to that one.<lb/>
I now come to the few points of detail that I should like to raise with the Minister. First, who is the "proper officer" of the court referred to in Article 18(3)? I have looked up the definition section, but the phrase is not defined. I may have missed the definition, but it would be helpful if the Minister could give us some guidance on that point.<lb/>
Secondly, why should the sum of money payable under Article 18(9)(a) be paid in to the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom rather than in to the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund? It has been suggested that the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund may no longer exist; but I have checked in the Library and I have seen from the Supply Estimates 1990/91 and from the Appropriation Accounts 1988/89 (the last set of Appropriation Accounts that we have) that the fund was at least in existence last March. If it is in existence, why is not the money being paid in to the Northern Ireland fund?<lb/>
Thirdly, why has sequestration been omitted from Article 20(2) (a)? I ask that question because sequestration appears in the parallel provision of the Criminal Justice Act. Fourthly, will the Minister confirm that the words "High Court or otherwise" in Article 23(1)(b), include an order made by a court of summary jurisdiction? As I understand it, a court of summary jurisdiction will also have the power to make the orders. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that that is included. If it is included, it is a pity that it has not been spelt out on the face of the order.<lb/>
Fifthly, will the orders to be made by the Secretary of State under Articles 26(1) and 27(1) be orders made by Her Majesty in Council as is the case under the Criminal Justice Act 1988? Sixthly and finally, why does Part I of Schedule 1 not follow the wording of Schedule 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and include the use of unlicensed cinema premises for exhibition as premises which requires a licence?<lb/>
Those are the few matters that I wanted to raise with the Minister. I regret that I was able to advise him only late in the day that I intended to raise those issues. As I said, they pale into insignificance alongside the major question that I have put to the Minister.<lb/>
We fully support the order's principal objective. We trust that it will work well in practice. It would be encouraging if the Minister could also assure the House that it will provide the courts with additional means to deal with terrorist racketeering, whenever that arises. That must be our principal concern as we give our approval to the order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03699">5.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03700"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I propose to speak briefly. The order is entirely reasonable, dealing as it does with drug trafficking offences and the other serious crimes as defined in the Criminal Justice Act. The only problem, as the Minister will be aware, is that there is considerable anxiety about some aspects of the drug trafficking confiscation procedures in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0345"/>
<col>611</col>
Great Britain. Therefore, it may not be long before we see some proposals from the Government to deal with that matter.<lb/>
The only matter that concerns me relates to the resource implications of the order. How many RUC officers will be involved in the work? Will the RUC receive any increase in establishment to take account of it? The reason I ask that question is that the resource implications of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act were wildly understated when that legislation went through Parliament. There are now several hundred police officers in Great Britain working on that procedure. It is therefore reasonable to ask what are the resource implications for the RUC, and whether it will receive an increase in establishment? That is the only point that I should like to make, and with that I say that we are entirely content with the order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03701"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was impressed by and am grateful to my noble friend for spelling out the provisions of this interesting order. I reiterate everything that has been said by my noble friend and by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, who once again confirmed that it is necessary to take the measures in the order, above all, to help in the fight against terrorism.<lb/>
I thought that much of the contents of the order was to do with drug trafficking. However, I glanced at Article 4 and found that confiscation might cover other offences. I do not believe that my noble friend will be able to answer me today, but perhaps he will write to me regarding the following point of curiosity. If he glances at page 44, he will see one measure relating to the Video Recordings Act 1984 which I should perhaps remember, but I have been unable to see what was said in those far off days. It also mentions the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. Those are three offences under Part I of Schedule 1. They seem to be far removed from the main provisions of the order on drug offences. I suspect that these three offences set out in Part I, Schedule 1, bear on the remarks which were made earlier by my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies. They are necessary in respect of the order. Part I of Schedule 1 should be read in conjunction with Article 4 of the order. I am grateful for the measures set out in the order, and I commend my noble friend for so clearly spelling them out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03702"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the constructive comments made during the brief debate on the order to which I shall endeavour to respond. My noble friend Lord Lyell is quite right. He has slightly bounced me and I shall have a little difficulty in obtaining an answer at the moment. However, I undertake to write to him.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, raised various detailed questions&#x2014;I agree that they need exploring &#x2014;and what he called one major question: will the courts be able to strike effectively at racketeering by terrorists? I say straight away that this matter is not
<col>612</col>
only on the mind of my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross but also of all of us concerned with Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The proposed order provides for confiscation orders to be available in respect of almost all indictable offences and the few profitable summary offences listed in Schedule 1. Offences under Part III of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 are excluded. These offences deal with financial assistance for terrorism and are excluded simply because specific forfeiture measures are included in that Act.<lb/>
The provisions of the order will form part of the general criminal law. As such they will apply to a whole range of offences such as armed robbery, theft, fraud, blackmail and intimidation. It is to be hoped that, as part of the general criminal law, the order will have some impact on these types of crime where it cannot always be proven but where there are strong grounds for suspecting terrorist involvement. In other words, it is not necessary to link these proceeds of crime with terrorism; they can be caught under the order anyway. I believe that this is most important.<lb/>
As concerns the proper officer of the court referred to in Article 18(3), the noble Lord is quite right. The proper officer is not defined in the definitions article of the order. However, if he casts his eye down to paragraph (10) of the same article he will discover that references to the proper officer mean, in the case of a magistrates' court, the clerk of petty sessions and, in the case of a Crown Court, the appropriate officer of the court. He is nominated by, I believe, the Lord Chief Justice in the usual way. I understand that there are nominated officers for various purposes in the Crown Court.<lb/>
As concerns the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, in the conventional sense I understand that there is only one Consolidated Fund in the United Kingdom. This is because, as the noble Lord suggested, since there is no parliament currently in Northern Ireland, it is not appropriate to have a Consolidated Fund. However, I am aware that in some circumstances the Northern Ireland block vote is referred to as a Consolidated Fund. I am not sure that that answer takes us very far. I shall obviously have to devil a lot further in order to satisfy the noble Lord.<lb/>
Two other points that the noble Lord raised concerned purely bankruptcy and company insolvency. Articles 20 to 23 inclusive refer to these matters. Sequestration is a subject of which there is no concept in Northern Ireland law. If a person is declared bankrupt, his property automatically becomes the property of the court, I am advised. The words "or otherwise" in Article 23(1) (b) mean in this peculiar sense the trustees in bankruptcy or such other court officer as may be appointed for that particular purpose, either for bankruptcy or for company insolvency.<lb/>
The noble Lord and I have had discussions on many occasions in the past on the most appropriate method of legislating for Northern Ireland and no doubt we shall again. He asked whether Articles 26(1)
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0346"/>
<col>613</col>
and 27(10) orders will he made by Her Majesty in Council, as is the case in the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The answer is no, these will be statutory rules subject to negative resolution in the normal way. Again, there is a difference between Northern Ireland and England and Wales whereby unlicensed cinema premises for exhibition do not have the equivalent stature, or equivalent opprobrium perhaps I should say, in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales. Therefore, they do not attract an exceptional level of fine. Thus it would not be appropriate for this order as currently drafted, where the proceeds have to be in excess of &#x00A3;10,000.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, asked whether the equivalent legislation in England and Wales had proved to be successful. I am advised that it is too early to assess the effectiveness of the confiscation provisions of Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act. However, since it came into operation in January 1987 the provisions of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act have been closely monitored. The Act is certainly working, I believe quite well. It has resulted in the making of confiscation orders to the value of &#x00A3;1 7 million. However, as with similar provisions, the effectiveness of both these new statutes is kept under constant review.<lb/>
Terrorist crime is already closely monitored by the RUC. The whole point of this draft legislation is that it is a matter for the courts to determine on the facts presented to them. Therefore I do not anticipate any extra facts needing to be collected and collated for this purpose by the RUC. I believe that there will be no significant resource implications in this connection.</membercontribution></p>
<col>614</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03703"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there are no major resource implications, one has to ask how effective this will be on the grounds that in London it started with a staff of three officers. There are now well over 200 officers. I am therefore surprised to hear the noble Lord suggest that there are no resource implications at all. I hope that he will look into this; I seriously question the accuracy of his statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03704"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sometimes feel in your Lordships' House that my honour is being impugned. However, I shall of course make further inquiries and if my statement to the noble Lord and the House has been inaccurate, I shall enter into correspondence with him.<lb/>
As I suggested at the beginning of this speech, I am unable to answer my noble friend Lord Lyell definitively and therefore I shall have to write to him. In drawing the debate on the order to a conclusion I shall repeat some of the comments I made in my opening remarks earlier this evening. The purpose of the order is to remove the financial incentive that underlies so much crime. It is hoped that the order will provide Northern Ireland with modern and effective legislation to combat any spread of drug trafficking. The order will also help to ensure that the United Kingdom as a whole is able to continue its positive role in combating organised crime at international level. Accordingly, I commend the order to the House.<lb/>

<title>Employment Figures</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03707"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03708">How many people in the United Kingdom were in work, employed and self-employed on the most recent date for which figures are available.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03709"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Employment (Viscount Ullswater)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in June 1990 the workforce in employment in the United Kingdom stood at 27,345,000. This includes 23,237,000 employees in employment and 3,380,000 self-employed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03710"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his reply. Is not the total figure that he has given the highest ever recorded, or near to it? Is it not correct to say that the Government hope for an even higher figure with the help of current training schemes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03711"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can confirm that it is a record number of jobs. The figure is over 3,750,000 more than in March 1983 when the upward trend began and nearly 2 million more than during the previous peak in 1979. We shall endeavour to ensure that the figure continues to rise as a result of our training programmes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03712"><member>Lord Mason of Barnsley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister give the percentage figures for those at work in manufacturing industry and those at work in the service sector? Can he also tell the House what the trend is revealing in this period of recession?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03713"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there were 5,222,000 people involved in manufacturing in June 1990. In the service industry there were 16,194,000 employed at the same time. That figure was up by over &#x00BD; million on the previous year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03714"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say whether the figures that he gave in his first Answer include part-time jobs? If they do, can he say what is the number of part-time jobs? Does he not agree that the biggest increase in employment is in part-time and not full-time jobs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03715"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot give the number of part-time jobs involved but part-time jobs are included in the figures that I gave. The number of part-time jobs has been increasing at a great rate, but that is not to say that people who take part-time employment do not seek to do so. For them it is a job, which they prefer to not having a job at all.</membercontribution></p>
<col>616</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03716"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the Minister said that about 5 million people were employed in manufacturing in June this year. Can he say what the number was in 1979?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03717"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have the figure with me. I shall have to find out and write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03718"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister tell the House how many of the people who have become self-employed in small businesses following unemployment have subsequently gone bankrupt; and can he say what steps have been taken to assist them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03719"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, figures have been given in Answers to other Questions that the number of registrations for VAT has far exceeded the number of deregistrations. That is the measure by which the success of small businesses is measured.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03720"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the, Minister not agree that the number of job vacancies is now lower than the number of unemployed people for the first time for some years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03721"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, I have to agree with the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03722"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount agree that it is rather worrying that the number of people employed in manufacturing is only about one-third of those in other work? Does he further agree that the figures published yesterday show an overall reduction in GDP? Does he accept that the reduction in manufacturing capacity has been quite enormous, which augurs ill for the future economy of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03723"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Lord. The figures that I have given indicate that the number of jobs in manufacturing has decreased; I have to agree with that. However, one should bear in mind that some jobs in the manufacturing industry in 1979 were not productive at all. A great many of the manufacturing industries were losing large amounts of money and there was a great loss of jobs when the labour market was shaken out in the next few years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03724"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has my noble friend noticed that all the questions from the Opposition Benches are designed to show that things are worse than they are? Does he not agree that this rising cry of stinking fish is somewhat discreditable?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03725"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for his intervention. It is quite clear that the economy is in better shape to take off when inflation falls. The most important factor is to get inflation down. The Government are taking stringent steps to ensure that that happens.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03726"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, despite what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, has said&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03727"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: Sit down. For once in your life shut up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03728"><member>Baroness Llewelyn-Davies of Hastoe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that most of the answers that the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0348"/>
<col>617</col>
Government give to these questions suggest that matters between 1974 and 1979 were far worse than they really were?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03729"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if manufacturing output dropped between 1974 and 1979, the situation was worse then than it is now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03730"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that in 1979 the levels of unemployment were far lower than they are now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03731"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, that is quite correct, but a record number of jobs has been made available since that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03732"><member>Lord Callaghan of Cardiff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be appropriate if the Minister were to reply to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, with the immortal words of Adlai Stevenson: "If they will stop telling lies about us, we will stop telling the truth about them"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03733"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that that needs a reply.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Road Safety</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03734">2.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03735"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03736">What action is being taken to improve road safety in residential areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03737"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are undertaking a variety of initiatives including lower speed limits, a child safety publicity campaign and we have made local safety schemes eligible for transport supplementary grant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03738"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that very welcome reply. Does he not agree that such measures would further improve Britain's already exemplary road safety record?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03739"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: I hope so, my Lords. We in Britain have one of the best, if not the best, road safety records in Europe. However, we should still like to see it improved. Our target is for a one-third reduction in casualties by the year 2000. That is a tough target. We are at the moment particularly anxious about the increase in deaths of and casualties to children. We need to concentrate our efforts on that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03740"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that drunks wandering around the road after the pubs close at night are a hazard to drivers and to themselves? Has he any good ideas for dealing with them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03741"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree that they are a problem and a hazard both to themselves and to drivers. We are especially anxious about drunk-drivers; but those wandering around the streets drunk are equally a hazard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03742"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that the increasing amount of coach traffic in residential areas, particularly in central London, quite
<col>618</col>
apart from being environmentally undesirable, is an added safety hazard? Can he say what could or should be done about this issue?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03743"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware that coaches are driven more dangerously than motor cars. However, we are in the process of introducing measures on residential areas. They include new road hump schemes and new 20 mph limits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03744"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having regard to the Minister's proper anxiety about drunk-driving, is he aware that the British Medical Association has estimated that about 25,000 casualties last year were directly attributable to drunk-driving? Is there not therefore a very strong case for introducing a system of random breath testing?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03745"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are anxious about drinking and driving. It is and remains the biggest single cause of road accident fatalities&#x2014;almost one-sixth of the total. The announcement in March of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary confirmed that existing police powers to stop and test are extensive and that they strike the right balance between effective enforcement of the law and the freedom of the individual. We shall continue to urge the police to make the fullest possible use of those powers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03746"><member>Viscount Caldecote</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the use of humps in the road&#x2014;so-called sleeping policemen&#x2014;in residential areas has made a useful contribution to reducing the speed of vehicles in those areas and therefore to road safety? Is he prepared to look into the wider use of such sleeping policemen in residential areas and elsewhere in the interests of road safety?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03747"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree that road humps can and do make a considerable contribution. That is why we have recently made new regulations for the use of road humps. They are much simpler than the old regulations and permit even simpler requirements in new 20 mph zones.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03748"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are the Government in any way alarmed about the way in which it is possible to advertise motor cars which are capable of speeds of at least twice the maximum speed limit in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03749"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, advertisements should certainly contain nothing that is likely to bring the law into disrepute; and they should neither condone nor incite violence or anti-social behaviour. That includes speeding. They should not show or advocate dangerous behaviour or unsafe practices.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03750"><member>Lord De Freyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, may be on to a good point? Is he aware that the 30 mph and 40 mph signs have remained the same size for a great number of years? Can they not be made larger so that people can see them; and can they not also be illuminated?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03751"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not heard criticism of the size of the 30 mph or 40 mph signs before. If people cannot see to read that speed limit sign, they should not be on the road.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0349"/>
<col>619</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03752"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, referring back to the noble Lord's reply about the sleeping policemen humps in the road perhaps I may ask this. Is he aware that there is worry in many areas that these so-called sleeping policemen hinder the passage of ambulances and other emergency vehicles? The sleeping policemen are placed only a few feet apart from each other and are a constant hazard in long roads where ambulances have to carry very ill patients. Will he consider that point?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03753"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly do so. Obviously it is not the intention that the sleeping policemen should interfere with the passage of vehicles of the emergency services. The regulations for the laying down of road humps should ensure that that does not happen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03754"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Stallard about sleeping policemen, will the Government also bear in mind the fact that to be effective they must be reasonably numerous and situated close together? If they are spaced too far out, drivers simply accelerate between them thereby increasing noise and air pollution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03755"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; the distances apart at which they can be placed are laid down in regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03756"><member>Lord Craigton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that what really matters is how fat the sleeping policeman is?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03757"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: Yes my Lords; or, indeed, any policeman. The design of sleeping policemen is specified. We have made various changes to the regulations governing their design, including flat-topped humps.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03758"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question on the Order Paper refers to "residential areas". I think the Minister will agree that the figures show that there are more accidents in urban areas than in other areas. Therefore, is not the problem one of enforcement? Further, what discussions are taking place with the various police authorities as regards enforcement? In this connection, I refer especially to rat runs which are a great menace in residential areas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03759"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, enforcement is a matter for the police. I have already mentioned the introduction of 20 mph zones with road humps. The object of those is that they will be self-enforcing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03760"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have given this issue a pretty good run. I suggest, therefore, that we move on to the next Question.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Unemployment Figures</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03761">2.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03762"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03763">What was the average monthly increase, over the last six months, in the total number of unemployed and long-term unemployed persons respectively.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03764"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the six months to October 1990, total unemployment in the United
<col>620</col>
Kingdom increased by an average of 16,000 per month while long-term unemployment fell by an average of 5,300 per month. The latter figure is on the unadjusted basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03765"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not those figures demonstrate more than anything else the fact that the economy is now well and truly in recession, in spite of what the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other senior members of the Government say? Therefore, will the Government confirm that after 11 years of Conservative government the total number of unemployed is now 1.7 million, which is 400,000 more than it was when Labour left office? Even more important, will he also confirm the fact that next year &#x2014;I ask the Minister to deny this&#x2014;it will rise to a figure of 2 million? What do the Government say is the cause of these disastrous figures?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03766"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honour-able friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that a slowdown is occurring in the economy. That is feeding through to unemployment: it is obviously sad for those people who lose their jobs. However, it is important to understand that the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom is very much lower than the EC average; indeed, it is lower than every country in the EC, except Luxembourg and Portugal.<lb/>
I confirm the figure of 1.7 million unemployed mentioned by the noble Lord. However, whether it will rise to approaching 2 million is pure speculation. I am quite certain that when inflation drops next year, the number of jobs will increase and that figure will not be reached.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03767"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount agree with the pronouncements of the Confederation of British Industry, which no one, especially the Government, should ignore, that unemployment and bankruptcy will increase and that the nation could well be in a parlous state within the next 12 months? I understand why the Government do not take too much cognisance of the CBI. Nevertheless, does the Minister not agree that it is a responsible organisation and that its views ought to be taken into consideration?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03768"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the confederation expresses one view, to which the Government certainly pay attention. However, there are government achievements in the reduction of unemployment. Long-term unemployment, which is one of the most important measures, has now dropped to 507,000, the lowest level since the claimant count began in October 1980. The figure is nearly 850,000 lower than it was in April 1986. A fall of nearly 400,000 has been recorded in the past two years. That is a major achievement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03769"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not true that the percentage of our population in work is at its highest? Is it not also true that since the days of Joseph and the Pharaohs boom has been followed by bust and that will continue <i>ad infinitum</i> and to eternity? Minor hiccups must be expected under any government, even as good a government as this one.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0350"/>
<col>621</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03770"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the United Kingdom's jobs growth record is very impressive. The workforce in employment has been rising for over seven years. The latest comparable data shows that the rate of growth in employment has been greater than that of our major European partners and also of Japan. I can confirm that the UK proportion of the population of working age in employment of 71 per cent. is much higher than the EC average of 58 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03771"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Viscount aware that in the days of the Pharaohs the boom and bust was caused by the weather and not by the government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03772"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am tempted to say that one should not believe everything that one reads. However, I am now at pains to know how to continue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03773"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Viscount aware that one of the achievements of the Government in the field of unemployment is to fiddle the unemployment figures which are now understated by 700,000?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03774"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, obviously the noble Lord feels rather passionately about the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03775"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I do!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03776"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: The figures have not been fiddled. They show those who are unemployed and who are actively seeking work. I should add that over one-third of a million unemployed leave the count every month; over one quarter of those who become unemployed leave within the first month; and 57 per cent. leave within the first three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03777"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the rate of increase of wages has a lot to do with the number of unemployed, bearing in mind the remark made by the late leader of the Labour Party when he said that one man's pay rise was another man's job loss?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03778"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the pressure on the economy is putting pressure on margins. If further pressure is put on them by an increase in wages, I am afraid that unemployment will occur.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03779"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the noble Viscount seen the newspaper account this morning of a new report which shows that a large number of people in the workforce&#x2014;some millions in fact&#x2014;spend their whole working lives in work for a few months and then out of work for a few months? So far as I know, this is the first time that the problem has been highlighted. Does the noble Viscount have anything to say on the matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03780"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe I answered that question to a certain extent. I said that about one-third of a million of unemployed people leave the count each month. This would indicate that, because the unemployment figures do not increase by that amount each month, many people are moving in and out of employment. As one would expect in a vibrant economy, people leave jobs and obtain other jobs just as quickly.</membercontribution></p>
<col>622</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03781"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount agree that the employment situation has everything to do with the general economic situation and very little to do with policies of deregulation and absence of employee benefits?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03782"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is indeed a reflection of the current situation. A slowdown is taking place in the economy which is now reflected in the number of unemployed. However, as I said in answer to a previous question, the economy is in good shape and when inflation drops the number of jobs will rapidly increase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03783"><member>Lord Donoughue</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I may not have heard clearly the Minister's reply to my noble friend Lord Dormand. Did he deny the statement that unemployment next year would reach 2 million?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03784"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that that was purely speculation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03785"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the Minister considers that 507,000 long-term unem-ployed are worth mentioning, that just goes to show how little compassion the Government have for the unemployed. Will he confirm that there are now 33 per cent. fewer vacancies than there were this time last year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03786"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I answered the last part of that question when replying to a previous question. The figures need to be put into perspective. I mentioned that there were 500,000 long-term unemployed. There are difficulties in obtaining work when one has been unemployed for over a year. The work done by the Department of Employment with its training programmes, which have reduced the number of long-term unemployed from the figure that I gave to 500,000, has been a success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03787"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the unemployment position in Wales is especially serious and is worsening from month to month? For example, in Laura Ashley, P. B. Electronics, Brymbo Steelworks, Inmos and other industries a large number of redundancies has been created. In those circumstances, how does the Minister justify the Government cutting the training budget by &#x00A3;300 million over the next two years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03788"><member>Viscount Ullswater</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the alteration in training budget direction of spend is merited by the figures for the drop in the number of long-term unemployed that I have just given. If the noble Lord looks at the figure for youth training, he will see that that has increased by &#x00A3;38 million, and that is just as important.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BT: Directory Inquiry Service</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03789">3.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03790"><member>Lord Monson</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03791">Whether they will use their best endeavours to ensure that charges for directory inquiries are not imposed until such time as up-to-date telephone directories are issued free of charge annually to every subscriber.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0351"/>
<col>623</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03792"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, British Telecom's introduction of charges for its directory inquiry service from April 1991 is primarily a matter for Sir Bryan Carsberg, the Director General of Telecommunications. However, I understand that he is satisfied that BT's proposals are consistent with its licence obligations. British Telecom will continue to supply a free telephone directory regularly to every residential and business subscriber covering the local telephone area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03793"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount for his reply, although I venture to suggest that all monopolies, even when privatised, must to a considerable extent remain the responsibility of government. Does he agree, first, that while it is reasonable to charge for directory inquiry calls people who are too lazy to look up the correct number themselves, it is unreasonable to do so if they have not first been supplied with an up-to-date telephone directory in which to look up the correct number? Secondly, does he agree that the new scheme discriminates against the elderly and those with knee injuries, for example, who, unlike younger or fitter people, cannot walk several hundred yards to a public telephone box to obtain directory inquiries free of charge?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03794"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, British Telecom is not obliged to supply telephone directories under the terms of its PTO licence, which requires only the provision of a directory inquiry facility. However, new telephone directories are supplied to subscribers approximately every 18 months. British Telecom's research has shown that approximately 10 per cent. of the population is on the move at any one time. The 18-month cycle for producing and distributing revised directories is considered the best period to reflect the population movement. As regards the second part of the noble Lord's question, directory inquiry calls by blind and disabled people will remain free, as will calls from pay phones.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03795"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the Government may not have power to instruct BT, could they not advise it along the lines of the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, which seems to have a great deal in its favour as being the fair way to deal with the transitional period?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03796"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the benefit of the new system is that calls will be cheaper as a result of the introduction of the charges. It will not lead to any increase in BT's revenue. The average domestic subscriber will save &#x00A3;4 on calls. Those who use the directory inquiry service will now have to pay for it. Marketing companies which now make most use of the service will have to pay, and residential customers who generally make few directory inquiry calls will be better off, saving 4.5 per cent. on the unit charge and an average of 7.3 per cent. on trunk calls.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03797"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Viscount aware that the House was told that what is now happening could never occur? Who now is in charge &#x2014;the British Government or British Telecom? Will the Minister draw this debate to BT's attention, and
<col>624</col>
will he ensure that when people ask for a telephone number over the telephone they will not be charged, because they never were in the past?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03798"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the running of BT is primarily the responsibility of the company. However, I will make the noble Lord's views known to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03799"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Viscount ensure that after the new charge is introduced, when one gives the girl with the computer more information than she gives when she fails to turn up a number, there is a girl in the background with a set of directories who can look up the number?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03800"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, BT's latest quality of service report published on 5th November showed that about 90 per cent. of directory inquiry calls get through on the first attempt, and seven out of eight of those calls are answered within 15 seconds. The quality of the service has improved over the past 12 months, despite a 20 per cent. increase in the use of the service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03801"><member>Lord Teviot</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps my noble friend will allow me to congratulate him on answering his maiden Question, and to tell him that he has picked up a complete banana. Is he aware that your Lordships are privileged in that we have two sets of telephone directories because the present computerised directory inquiries system is inadequate? Perhaps through my noble friend I can ask the noble Lord, Lord Monson, to put this forward in an Unstarred Question so that we can go into it thoroughly before BT introduces the charges.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03802"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his kind remarks. I note what he said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03803"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the Government use their best endeavours and discuss free calls, will they include in that discussion the possibility of providing free calls for servicemen serving in the Gulf when making calls to their loved ones at home, in line with facilities allowed to their counterparts serving in similar forces?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03804"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that question is rather different from the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<title>New Roads and Street Works Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03812">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03813"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
This Session of Parliament will long be remembered as the transport Session. The House will remember that the gracious Speech promised no fewer than four Bills with a transport theme. I am proud to be able today to move the second reading of the first of these Bills. It has two separate subjects but its unifying theme is the reduction of congestion. The new roads part of the Bill does this by encouraging the provision of new infrastructure responsive to the demands of the road user while the street works part does it by bringing discipline into that potent cause of urban congestion, holes in the road.<lb/>
A theme which has run through the policies of Her Majesty's Government since 1979 is that where possible infrastructure and services should be provided by the private sector. Of course the state has an essential role in regulating in the interests of safety and to encourage competition; and it often, though far from always, has a role in subsidising to meet particular and well defined purposes. But the market is in general the better way of ensuring that the demands of consumers are met and most importantly that costs are kept down. The best incentive to accurate estimating and keeping to one's estimate is the knowledge that failure to do so will hit one's pocket directly.<lb/>
The first section of the Bill is inspired by this thinking. We are not saying that all transport infrastructure can or should be provided by the private sector. Far from it. But the role of the private sector can be increased; and we should move that boundary. This approach first emerged with the
<col>626</col>
decision that the Channel Tunnel should be privately financed. That was followed by the new Dartford crossing, initiated by my right honourable friend the former Secretary of State for Transport, Mr. Nicholas Ridley.<lb/>
This pioneering initiative was followed up by his successor, my right honourable friend Mr. Paul Channon, who launched a competition for the private financing of the second Severn crossing and the Green Paper, <i>New Roads by New Means,</i> issued in May last year. I am happy to tell your Lordships that the initiative is going well. The second Severn concession agreement has been signed and a Bill will be introduced in another place very soon to authorise its construction.<lb/>
Three serious tenders for the building of the Birmingham northern relief road have been received and are being evaluated. The expressions of interest in the Birmingham-Manchester corridor and six new possible candidates for private finance that we announced in April are being studied. In Scotland tenders have been received for a privately-financed bridge to Skye and are currently being evaluated by the Scottish Development Department. In addition there is continued interest being shown in the concept of a privately-financed fast link between the M.74 and M.8 motorways.<lb/>
This all adds up to a dynamic and encouraging initiative. The Bill will give it a new impetus, since no longer will all cases have to be dealt with through the unusual and not entirely satisfactory procedure of a hybrid Bill. Instead there will be a legal framework through which privately financed toll roads can be authorised in the same way as traditional trunk roads. I envisage that the Birmingham northern relief road and subsequent schemes will be authorised in this way.<lb/>
There are a few general points I would make. First, the rights of people affected to object will be the same with privately financed roads as with traditional ones. Secondly, the environmental appraisal will be the same; no less rigorous standards will be required of privately financed roads than of others. Thirdly, this initiative will mean that more badly needed roads will be provided&#x2014;we shall not subtract privately financed roads from public sector provision on a scheme by scheme basis&#x2014;and they should be built more quickly, since private sector consortia dedicated to the planning, design and construction of a specific road should be able to complete it more quickly than a department with much else to do.<lb/>
Fourthly, this is not an initiative for the Government alone. All highway and roads authorities &#x2014;county councils and metropolitan district councils in England and Wales and regional councils in Scotland&#x2014;will be able to sponsor privately financed roads to meet more local needs. I hope they will look seriously at this. Fifthly, the Bill, as your Lordships will realise, does not restrict tolling powers to privately financed roads. It will still be possible for something like the Tyne tunnels and the Erskine bridge to be built by the Government or a local highway authority and tolled by them. Sixthly, and unconnected with tolling, the Bill will remove some of the difficulties in the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0353"/>
<col>627</col>
present law in England and Wales in the way of agreements between developers and the Secretary of State under which the developer pays for and the relevant department builds or improves a stretch of trunk road or a junction.<lb/>
Parts III and IV of the Bill will reform the law on utilities' street works in England and Wales and in Scotland. This fulfils the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations of the Horne Report on the review of the Public Utilities Street Works Act 1950. It will replace an exceptionally complex and out-of-date statute with a more flexible modern one. Most of the detailed requirements spelt out at such length in the 1950 Act will in future be prescribed in regulations which can be adapted to meet changing circumstances far more easily.<lb/>
The main purpose of these parts of the Bill is to sort out the present confused responsibility for utility street works. Both the utilities and the highway authorities find the present arrangements unsatisfactory. The utilities would like to assume full responsibility to manage their street works more efficiently, while the highway authorities have to cope with a system of administration which is incapable of managing the massive increase in street work activity. The public are fed up with haphazard and seemingly unplanned street works and poorly reinstated roads.<lb/>
It is now 40 years since your Lordships had an opportunity to consider general legislation on utility street works. Since the 1950 Act we have seen massive increases in the demand for utility services and in the amount of road traffic. The cumbersome and outdated procedures prescribed by the 1950 Act no longer serve their purpose.<lb/>
To take one example, the requirement to serve notices in writing on all the authorities involved before starting works results in unnecessary bureaucracy with some 4 million holes each year subject to the requirements of the 1950 Act. The paper-based system fails to distinguish the important advance notifications from the routine. There are 18 different forms of statutory notice for use by the utilities and a further 21 for use by other authorities. The highway authority has little opportunity to make adequate arrangements for traffic management, still less to co-ordinate works between the various utilities. The possibilities for simplification and efficiency gains offered by information technology are ruled out by the statutory requirements for paper notices.<lb/>
The present framework is also seriously inadequate when it comes to the state of repair of roads. The 1950 Act allows highway authorities to elect to do the permanent reinstatement of the upper levels of the roads themselves at the utility's expense. There is no time limit laid down for the highway authority to carry out the reinstatement in those cases. As a result, temporary reinstatements done by utilities are often left for far too long in a totally unsatisfactory condition, and in those cases where the utility is allowed to do the permanent reinstatement itself there is a wide variety of permitted standards and a weak system of enforcement.<lb/>
<col>628</col>
Recognising problems such as those, the Government invited Professor Home in 1984 to chair a committee to review all aspects of the 1950 Act. The report of his committee is entitled <i>Roads and the Utilities.</i> It was published in November 1985 and provided a series of recommendations for action that commanded a wide degree of support.<lb/>
Over the past four years much work has been done by representatives of the utilities and the local highway authorities in association with the Department of Transport to work up the detail of the new arrangements to replace the 1950 Act. I am pleased to pay tribute to the voluntary effort put in by scores of local authority and utility representatives. This essential work should provide a strong foundation on which to build the framework contained in the Bill before your Lordships today. That gives a brief overview of the Bill and the thinking behind it. I shall now go into more detail.<lb/>
Clauses 1 to 5 establish the framework for privately funded toll roads in England and Wales. These roads will be financed, built and operated under concession from the highway authority, either the Secretary of State or a local highway authority. During the period of the concession the concessionaire will be empowered to exercise various functions that normally fall to the highway authority although the highway authority will retain some reserve powers.<lb/>
The existing authorisation procedure for public roads will in broad terms apply to these new roads. If following a public inquiry it is decided riot to proceed with the scheme, the promoter will be able to receive compensation from the highway authority in respect of costs incurred in working up the scheme, as determined under the concession agreement. If the concession agreement terminates prematurely (if, for example, the concessionaire goes bankrupt) the highway authority will be obliged where practical to "sell" the concession on to a new private sector promoter. These arrangements for termination of the concession are clarified in Schedule 1.<lb/>
Clauses 6 to 16 concern tolls. The charging of tolls either by a highway authority or a concessionaire will be undertaken by means of an order. The, Secretary of State will make the order for schemes where he is the highway authority; where a local highway authority is making the toll order, the Secretary of State will confirm it. The procedure for making the toll order will be taken together with that for authorising the road scheme itself. The fate of one will depend on the fate of the other; if one falls then they will both fall. The detailed procedures are set out in Schedule 2.<lb/>
Our objective has been to make the provisions as flexible as possible. The tolling period will have a limited life but the toll order will be able to specify the circumstances in which this period will end. This may be after the achievement of a specific financial objective, for example, or the passage of a certain number of vehicles over the road, or simply after a period of years.<lb/>
Clauses 8 and 9 govern the level of toll which the road operator may charge. As a protection to the road
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0354"/>
<col>629</col>
user, where the toll is charged by a highway authority the toll order will be required to specify a maximum toll level. Similarly a maximum will be imposed on estuarial crossings subject to a concession where the route in question will constitute a monopoly. In other cases there will be no statutory limits, but Clause 10 will ensure that all privately funded roads will be subject to competition legislation. There is no reason in the Government's view for the provision of roads to be any different from the provision of any other service. If an operator charged an unreasonably high toll he would lose business.<lb/>
Flexibility is also the key to Clause 12, which allows the operator to suspend or vary tolls and to charge different tolls according to the distance a road user has travelled, the time of day or the type of traffic. We are very keen to encourage the private sector to use its innovative skills in this area to ensure that promoters can maximise the revenue potential of their projects by meeting the precise demands of customers.<lb/>
Clauses 15 and 16 remove two areas of uncertainty for prospective toll operators. Clause 15 allows the highway authority to acquire land, if necessary by compulsory purchase, for the provision of tolling facilities and buildings on or adjoining the road which will not need separate planning permission. Clause 16 prevents the building of public or private accesses to a toll road without the consent of the highway authority and the concessionaire. This will protect the financial viability of the tolling business and prevent free rider developers taking advantage of the investment in the road.<lb/>
Clauses 17 to 21 make various amendments to existing legislation so as to facilitate the provision of new roads more generally. We are aiming here to encourage private sector finance for conventional roads which are built by the highway authority and are free to users. Such roads are most commonly linked with developments which may not otherwise be acceptable in planning terms. Under Clause 19 the developer would build the road and make an agreement for the Secretary of State to adopt it as a trunk road. At present only local highway authorities can adopt roads by agreement. Clause 20 replaces Section 278 of the Highways Act 1980 which allows a highway authority to take a contribution from a developer for building a road in a particular manner or by a particular date. The new powers are much wider. They are not limited to schemes which the highway authority is already authorised to build and they do not rule out compulsory purchase of any additional land needed for the scheme. Clause 22 applies certain general provisions of the Highways Act 1980 to Part I of the Bill and Clause 23 contains definitions.<lb/>
Part II of the Bill relates to Scotland. The Scottish provisions have the same objective as those relating to England and Wales but there is a slightly different legal basis. In Scotland the right to toll will initially lie with the roads authority, which will then be able to confer the right to toll on a concessionaire. Moreover, the existing law in Scotland is adequate with regard to
<col>630</col>
developer funded roads, so not all the England and Wales provisions need to be duplicated. Part III of the Bill deals with street works in England and Wales, while Part IV contains the corresponding provisions for Scotland.<lb/>
Clauses 42 to 46 and Schedule 3 are introductory provisions setting out the definitions of streets, works, undertakers and relevant authorities affected by the provisions of this part of the Bill. They include new provisions for the granting of street works licences to permit persons other than those with a statutory right to place and maintain apparatus in streets. Any person doing works in the street, whether in pursuance of a statutory right or under a licence from the highway authority, will have to conform to the same standards unless specific exceptions are made. Clause 46 in particular introduces a new definition of the term "emergency works". This has been an area of much misunderstanding under the 1950 Act and so the definition here is drawn tightly to include only genuine emergencies.<lb/>
Planning and co-ordination of works, the subject of Clauses 47 to 53, is one of the most important aspects of the new arrangements. Each street authority will be required to keep a register of street works in its area and to give advance notification of proposed works. There will be powers for street authorities to direct the times of working and, where works would cause the greatest disruption to traffic, impose restrictions on works following substantial road works. An important new general duty is placed on street authorities to co-ordinate the execution of works of all kinds in the streets for which they are responsible.<lb/>
The responsibility for carrying out excavation and reinstatement of the street is to be firmly placed on the utilities. In some circumstances specific safeguards for the highway authority and other parties will be required. Clauses 54 to 57 and Schedule 4 allow for the designation by street authorities of streets which are to be subject to special controls. They include provision for protected streets in which the placing of apparatus by undertakers is allowed only with the consent of the street authority; streets with special engineering difficulties in which undertakers' works may not be executed until a plan and section has been settled by agreement with the relevant authorities; and traffic-sensitive streets in which special requirements as to advance notice will apply.<lb/>
The next group of clauses deal with work in progress. That is the time at which as users of streets we are most aware of the activities of the utilities. Clauses 58 to 62 include provision for the proper guarding, lighting and signing of works in progress and the avoidance of unnecessary obstruction of the street. They impose requirements on undertakers executing street works to employ properly qualified supervisors and operatives, to afford facilities to street authorities to inspect works and to inform others whose apparatus in the street may be affected by the works.<lb/>
Clauses 63 to 66 deal with the reinstatement of streets by undertakers following the completion of their works. They set out the duties of undertakers as
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0355"/>
<col>631</col>
to reinstatement and in particular requirements as to the materials to be used, standards of workmanship and the performance of reinstatements. As the street authority will no longer have the right to carry out permanent reinstatement work, the major source of the present disputes over cost will be resolved by the Bill. Other financial provisions will still be required. Clauses 67 to 71 cover the various fees and contributions payable by undertakers. Fees may be prescribed for the occupation of maintainable highways by undertakers executing works, for the inspection of works by street authorities and contributions to the costs of a street authority in making good long-term damage attributable to undertaker's works.<lb/>
Clauses 72 to 75 set out the duties and liabilities of undertakers with respect to their apparatus in streets. Liability for damage or loss caused by works, bursts or explosions etc. in particular has been the cause of contention in recent years, and the proposal in Clause 75 will be more straightforward, fair and workable than the present provision.<lb/>
Clauses 76 to 77 deal with measures, commonly known as diversionary works, required to be taken by undertakers as a result of certain highways works, bridge works or transport works. They allow for arrangements to be introduced to avoid undue delay to such works and for the costs of taking necessary measures to be shared between the authority promoting the works and the undertakers whose apparatus is affected by them.<lb/>
The next group of clauses, Clauses 78 to 85, include definitions, a procedure for the treatment of streets likely to become maintainable highways, requirements on undertakers executing works which affect bridges or sewers and special precautions to be taken when carrying out work at level crossings or in the vicinity of transport undertakings.<lb/>
The final clauses in that part of the Bill, Clauses 86 to 96, together with Schedule 5, are supplementary provisions setting out the treatment of offences, the basis for recovery of costs and expenses, the method of service of notices and other documents and the manner of reckoning periods and providing for the determination of disputes by arbitration.<lb/>
Part IV of the Bill, covering Clauses 97 to 150, is essentially a repetition of the preceding part to apply similar provisions to utility works in Scotland. It reflects the different terminology used in the Roads (Scotland) Act. The only difference of substance between Parts III and IV is that there is no Scottish equivalent to Clause 44, which provides for the placing and maintenance of apparatus given under a street works licence. Such licences do not exist in Scotland as they do at present in England and Wales; those other than undertakers seeking to place apparatus in Scotland do so under the conditions placed on them by roads authorities under current legislation.<lb/>
Part V of the Bill is general, relating to Parts I to IV of the Bill. It deals with offences by bodies corporate
<col>632</col>
or Scottish partnerships and the application of the Bill to Crown land. It also contains certain minor and consequential amendments and repeals.<lb/>
Given the variety of issues which the Bill touches on, I hope that I have given them full justice but not lingered too long on some of the detail. However, I believe that the time is well spent. The provisions in this Bill promise benefits to all. New roads will offer the road user new services, while others will benefit from the reduced congestion on existing roads. At the same time the private sector will see new business opportunities open up. The new framework established by the other parts of the Bill will allow utilities to carry out their street works more efficiently to the advantage of pedestrians, commerce and the motorist, while cutting costs for highway authorities to the advantage of their charge payers. I commend the Bill to the House.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time. &#x2014;(<i>Lord Brabazon of Tara.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03814">3.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03815"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his very careful exposition of the Bill, and in particular of Part III rather than Part I of the Bill. It is extraordinary that today of all days this particular Government, at this time in their history, should have opted to debate a Bill about holes. I wonder whether that is a coincidence or a Freudian landslide.<lb/>
The Government have unwisely and very imprudently decided to introduce, into what would otherwise have been an uncontroversial and useful Bill, provisions in Parts I and II which are highly controversial. I shall explain why the Opposition cannot support those parts of the Bill. Our attitude towards Parts III and IV is that the Bill is capable of improvement; but we recognise that it represents a package of measures which should not be unravelled. We shall take that into account when we come to later stages when proposing any amendments that we consider appropriate to improve the Bill.<lb/>
When the Government decided to embark on their policy for dealing with privately financed roads, I wonder what experience they drew on. What profound consultations or real research were undertaken? It is true that there was a Green Paper, but what real research was undertaken to determine whether that policy was viable? The Birmingham northern relief road is hardly a shining example to encourage the Government to embark upon a wider application of that policy. I contend that Part I&#x2014;and Part II relating to Scotland&#x2014;has little or no relevance to the solution of the grave transport crisis which confronts our nation today.<lb/>
I cannot for one moment accept the Government's assertion&#x2014;an assertion which I suspect is based on blind faith rather than on careful research&#x2014;that toll roads have any relevance to the promotion of a sensible overall transport policy or to the environmental objectives which the Government have been at pains to set out in their recent White Paper.<lb/>
I do not believe that the Minister applied himself to these points. Surely when considering such a measure
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0356"/>
<col>633</col>
one ought to apply certain tests: what impact will the proposals have on the quality of life? How will the measures help to reduce pollution and improve energy efficiency? How will public transport which, despite the statistics which are trotted out by the Government, has suffered the most appalling neglect over the past 11&#x00BD; years be positively assisted by the Government measure?<lb/>
I claim that on each of the tests that I have put forward Part I of the Bill fails. It represents a superficial, piecemeal approach to the problem. It fails altogether to recognise that it is critical to plan all modes of transport together, so far as that is possible, to make each complement the other in order to enable all regions to work together and take advantage of the European single market, because transport is critical in that respect. In my submission, new roads have to be seen as part of a much more comprehensive approach to transport policy than has been revealed by the Government.<lb/>
Yesterday the Minister asserted, somewhat astonishingly, that he was totally unaware of what an integrated transport policy is all about. That is a strange admission from a Transport Minister; but I hope that I have in a few sentences given him some idea of what we think an integrated transport policy means.<lb/>
The preoccupation of the first two parts of the Bill is with the financial aspects of privately financed roads. It is concerned with providing financial security to firms investing or likely to invest in toll roads rather than in broader interests or the interests of those areas through which the toll roads may pass. It is, in effect, a distraction from the real problems that confront this country. I suspect that the policy is based rather more on ideology than on any practical concepts.<lb/>
It is a happy fact that the Government seem to have abandoned some of the more scatty ideas that were advanced quite recently. The Prime Minister put forward the idea that there should be lorry-only motorways. So far as I can recall, the Conservative Party disclaimed any knowledge of that proposal. The Department of Transport said that it had no knowledge of it either and that if indeed it was an idea it was only one for the Conservative Party manifesto. All industry decided that that was a wholly untenable proposition. When winding up will the Minister indicate whether the Government have totally abandoned that sort of strange notion?<lb/>
Our objections to the private financing of roads as set out in the Bill are, first, that private funding represents a gross misunderstanding of the significance of transport infrastructure in the social and economic life of our community. The Government are extremely vague about the extent of their ideas. How many schemes do they have in mind? Where are they? If there are only three, four, five or six, why waste time on introducing this part of the measure at all? If it has wider application, I believe that the real risk, quite apart from the unnecessary diversion of resources, is that first-class and second-class road systems will emerge, with public roads increasingly likely to be
<col>634</col>
neglected. That is the risk if&#x2014;it is a big if&#x2014;private funds can be secured for the pursuit of the Government's idea.<lb/>
As regards congestion and the environment, there is absolutely no evidence at all that building new roads on the scale envisaged more generally by the Government is likely to ease congestion. We understand that environmental considerations are to the forefront of the Government's mind. So they should be. But one of the main principles of environmental thinking is to tackle pollution at source. In their policies on roads the Government wholly ignore that proposition.<lb/>
I should like now to raise some specific questions which perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to address at the end of this debate. How do Part I and the transport policies generally of the Government fit in with their environmental policy? The Department of Transport predicts an increase in traffic of between 83 per cent. and 142 per cent. over the next 35 years, or 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. over the next 15 years. The Government are committed to stabilising carbon dioxide emissions, 18 per cent. of which come from transport. Emissions from motor transport could double by the year 2020. So that is an important question.<lb/>
So far as concerns congestion, Transport 2000 raised some extremely interesting points. In letters to noble Lords and others it asserts that communities affected by heavy traffic will secure little relief from congestion or from environmental degradation because traffic will simply continue to use the existing roads rather than pay tolls. The Government are duty bound to answer that very important point. How does the policy encourage the movement of freight by rail? After all, the railway system is infinitely more environmentally friendly than the motorways or other roads.<lb/>
There is also the question of additionality. A number of anxieties have been expressed by organisations such as the Automobile Association, the Freight Transport Association, and so on. They ask whether new toll roads will be clearly additional to the Government's published road programme. If there is a clear need for a road to be built in the national interest, I suggest that it should be built by government funding and not subordinated to a dependence on private profit.<lb/>
The Government's case has not been helped today by the Minister; nor was it helped by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, when she referred to this issue in the debate on the Address (reported in <i>Hansard</i> on 12th November). The Government's consultation paper said at paragraph 44:
<quote>"There has been much misunderstanding about additionality. Many have claimed that privately funded schemes must be additional to those funded by the Exchequer if private finance is to attract the construction industry (which would wish to see an increase in its business overall) or the road user (who wants more roads, not just differently financed ones). But the annual level of expenditure on the road programme is determined by the Government in the light of the economy generally and the needs of that programme; a different method of financing it does not make more resources available".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0357"/>
<col>635</col>
In answer to a point raised by my noble friend Lord Underhill, the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said:
<quote>"The expenditure on toll roads will be additional expenditure to the roads programme".&#x2014;(<i>Official Report,</i> 12/11/90; col. 189.)</quote>
The House is entitled to have that confused situation resolved today in this debate. I hope that the Minister will do so in his winding up.<lb/>
As regards the cost of tolls, is it right that tolls will have to pay for capital costs as well as for the maintenance of roads? if so, is it not likely to make tolls extremely expensive? The Secretary of State said that so long as a new road is not in a monopolistic position, such as an estuarial crossing, operators will be at liberty to set whatever tolls they wish. A study carried out by North London Polytechnic's Business School forecast that tolls on a double-decked M.25 would be as much as &#x00A3;21 per journey, based on a level of 60,000 vehicles a clay. That is a very costly proposition. How will road builders assess the level of tolls when it is difficult to know in advance what will be the likely demand for new roads?<lb/>
I turn to important questions that have been raised on behalf of the disabled. RADAR, the organisation which represents disabled people, has asked that orange badge holders&#x2014;disabled drivers&#x2014;should be exempt from paying tolls on the new roads on the grounds that they do not currently have to pay tolls on a number of roads and that the option of cheaper public transport is not always available. In addition, they want an assurance (to which I think they are entitled) that they will not be wheel-clamped on private roads in circumstances in which they would be exempt from any such provision on public roads.<lb/>
I turn to the transfer or termination of concessions. The provisions in the Bill relate to potential maintenance liabilities. If a concession agreement is to last for 30 years, is there not a likelihood that in the last period of that term&#x2014;perhaps in the last 10 years &#x2014;the concessionaire will apply short-term rather than long-term considerations in regard to maintenance? The effect might easily be to leave a substantial backlog of long-term structural maintenance. Does the Minister contemplate that as a reasonable possibility? If so, what do the Government propose to do about it? The implications are very serious indeed. If the agreement is with the Department of Transport, there would be clear implications for the trunk road maintenance programme, quite possibly during a period in which a different government are in office.<lb/>
Then one must consider the balance of the overall national maintenance programme, which could so easily be affected. That would leave fewer resources available for local roads. If the agreement were with a local highway authority, similar problems could easily arise locally. Of course I appreciate that the Minister may say in reply, "Maintenance conditions could be introduced into the agreement"; and that is certainly true. But will he not concede that they are likely to be extremely difficult to enforce?<lb/>
I turn from that to one other question in relation to this part of the Bill. It is whether the Government have been in consultation with the Commission of the
<col>636</col>
European Community with regard to toll roads. I realise that it is a matter that is left to the discretion of member states when such schemes are introduced. However, I remember a great deal of hostility being raised by Her Majesty's Government to toll systems in other member states of the Community. They alleged that such systems unfairly affected our road haulage industry which had to pay levies twice over&#x2014;domestic licence fees and toll charges. One is therefore entitled to ask what has caused the change in the Government's thinking.<lb/>
In conclusion on this part of the Bill, I ask these questions of the Government. What will be the methods of collection? Will they be manual or through some other means? If they are to be manual, is there not a great likelihood that there will be a considerable amount of congestion, with long queues of motorists aggravating a position that already exists?<lb/>
These are a badly devised set of proposals. They are piecemeal in approach. They make no provision for the protection of the countryside, for the problem of air pollution or for environmental assessment. They are replete with complexities and practical problems. The provisions suffer from a substantial lack of public accountability.<lb/>
I turn shortly&#x2014;because this part of the Bill is relatively uncontroversial&#x2014;to Parts III and IV. I join the Minister in applauding those who have engaged in lengthy consultation. We support the need to minimise the huge disruptions that have been caused by failure to co-ordinate the actions of highway authorities and utilities. It is extremely important that the public should have roads which free of holes and unnecessary obstructions. They are entitled to have uninterrupted supplies of water, power and telecommunications. In so far as the Bill will help with that, it is to be applauded. However, we are not wholly satisfied because the public utilities and the highway authorities, through the local government organisations, appear to be uncertain as to whether the benefits which are conferred in theory by the Bill will come to pass.<lb/>
There is a need for many improvements, in particular with regard to the accountability of senior management on safety and efficiency matters rather than leaving those responsibilities at the level of contractors and those who are working on the streets. Some improvement is necessary in the drafting in that respect.<lb/>
Again the needs of the blind and the disabled have to be fully respected in carrying out roadworks. The Home recommendations on that issue do not appear to be fully reflected in the Bill in a number of ways. There should be verbal, recorded warnings that there are holes in the road. Solid barriers should be erected around excavations. Organisations representing blind and disabled people need to be consulted in drawing up traffic signal mannings. They should be given advance notice of street works. Pedestrians' interests too need to be taken fully into account when
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0358"/>
<col>637</col>
traffic-sensitive streets are designated. Those are matters that we shall explore in the later stages of the Bill.<lb/>
There appear to be some gaps in the Bill with regard to the register. Who is to contribute to the operating costs of the register? Is it to be both the public utilities and highway authorities? Will the Minister include information on access for and safety of the disabled in the register? The Government should explain why it has been necessary to make provision for Scotland by a huge number of additional clauses. Is it simply the absence of a Scottish equivalent of a street works licence for non-utility excavations that has led to those provisions?<lb/>
I again thank the Minister for his exposition of the Bill. It has certainly made it easier to understand many of the complex provisions. However, once again I conclude by saying that, whereas Parts III and IV are to be warmly applauded and we fully support them, the burden that the Government have imposed on Parliament by introducing Parts I and II was wholly unnecessary and is contrary to the best interests of the passage of the Bill with regard to Parts III and IV.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03816">3.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03817"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, for his very clear exposition of the Bill. I should like also to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, to the Dispatch Box on a transport Bill for the first time. It is a very select club, as he will know, to which not many people are admitted&#x2014;or not many people attempt to admit themselves. He is welcome; and his speech at the Dispatch Box today was a very good start indeed.<lb/>
From these Benches, we are enthusiastic about the street works part of the Bill. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, we regret that the part relating to new roads has been added to the Bill. First, we regret the provision in its own right. Secondly, we regret it cluttering up what is otherwise a very good Bill. I am sure that the Bill would have gone through all its stages in both Houses very quickly. When one considers some of the events that are happening in a Committee room upstairs in another place one wonders whether there will be time to get the Bill through all its stages. I hope that the Government would have the good sense to drop the first part of the Bill and to push the remainder through all its stages in the event of a general election being called.<lb/>
Let me deal first with Parts III and IV of the Bill. I have given up all pretence of having any competence to speak about Scottish matters since I had a little difficulty with the Scottish law reform legislation in another place. Part III, as I have just said and as I indicated in my speech on the humble Address to the gracious Speech, has our unqualified welcome. As has been said, it is an excellent example of what can be achieved when the Government, local authorities, national utility organisations, motoring organisations and many others have co-operated so well. It is a very positive step forward. They are to be congratulated. It
<col>638</col>
has not been easy for many of them. We now have a very comprehensive Bill which we wish to see on the statute book.<lb/>
I wish to urge upon noble Lords today that we should not tinker with that part of the Bill to any great extent. I have no doubt that there will be matters that need to be probed in Committee and on Report. However, we should be unwise to attempt to make major changes to Parts III and IV of the Bill for fear of upsetting the delicate balance that has been achieved.<lb/>
There are three specific points of concern in Part III to which I should like to draw attention. One is the restoration of supplies under Clause 46. I quote from a letter that I received from the National Joint Utilities Group. It states:
<quote>"The definition as proposed appears to allow for the restoration of customer's supplies only if associated with a public emergency, such as an escape of gas etc. Last year's proposals published by the DTp included the restoration of all supplies cut off for any reason, but this now seems to have been removed.</quote>
<quote>"All Utilities are under statutory obligation to restore customer's supplies within fixed periods and will be in breach of those obligations if their emergency powers are restricted. Under this proposal a customer could have to wait 7 days while a statutory notice of planned work runs its course".</quote>
I hope the Government are aware of the problem. If they are unable to reply today I hope that they will be prepared to do so at a later stage.<lb/>
The second matter I wish to raise is the prohibition after substantial road works as dealt with in Clause 52. It is true that most of the problems that arise are ironed out in Clause 53; for example, emergency works can be presumed to be covered by Clause 53. However, what will happen if there are genuinely new circumstances after there has been a reinstatement? For instance, will new customers requesting services be told that they must wait for 12 months? Is it possible to provide that the highway authority or the utility must give information to potential customers when a notice is issued under Clause 52(4)? In other words, if people wish to have a new supply connected should they not be given a warning that they should speak now or hold their peace for 12 months?<lb/>
The third matter that I wish to mention which arises from my discussion with the National Joint Utilities Group relates to Clause 67 dealing with fees payable by undertakers. The use of the word "undertakers" in this connection reminds me of the old student song, "We are digging up father's grave to build a sewer". The proposals for fees are attractive at first sight but I wonder about their purpose. Is it to discipline the undertakers to dig fewer holes? Is it to discipline the undertakers to take less time to dig those holes? I see the Minister nod, and I can understand that. However, is it not the case that pressure from the street authorities in granting the street works licence in the first place is already adequate to control that? Are not powers to give directions under Clause 50 enough to cover the situation?<lb/>
I wonder also whether the fees achieve their intended purpose because in reality the cost will be passed on to the customer of the utility and the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0359"/>
<col>639</col>
proceeds will go to the Exchequer via the local authority. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, shakes his head. I shall be glad if, when he speaks, he explains why that is not the case. I understand that the proceeds will go to the local authority and then to the Exchequer, because in the grants made by the Exchequer to local authorities that will be taken care of. Therefore nothing has been achieved.<lb/>
Considering the difficulties that housing associations are already experiencing as regards the cost of connection of public utilities it is not wise to add to the cost of public utilities unless that achieves the purpose for which it is intended. I suggest that it is already covered in other directions. Perhaps a solution would be to reserve some power to penalise those who abuse codes of practice under the Bill. In any event, charges in emergency cases are a mistake and I hope that the Government will reconsider that. What is their view on attempts made by local authorities to charge utilities for the loss of revenue from parking meters? That appears to be a draconian action which is now being taken in a number of areas.<lb/>
I have made those three separate points and I hope that we shall become involved in the minimum of tinkering. I undertake a self-denying ordinance in that direction. This part of the Bill will improve the situation in our towns and cities. It will speed traffic, reduce pollution and reduce the irritation felt by road users which leads to more accidents. The proper reinstatement provisions will help everyone but in particular they will help the visually handicapped, the disabled, those on two wheels and those on foot. Those are matters to which my noble friend Lord Falkland will refer later in the debate.<lb/>
I turn to our objections to Parts I and II. It is not anti-privatisation dogma that makes us believe that the provisions in the Bill are a mistake. We are baffled by the Government's proposals. As the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and I have said on a number of occasions, it is the kind of provision which illustrates the lack of a genuine transport strategy on the part of the Government. Once more market forces appear to be the governing principle. We know that market forces can be useful in their proper place. We know that competitive activity can produce increased efficiency. However, we are a small country and we have finite resources which must be deployed most efficiently. For the Government to argue that may be all right up to a point, but the market only looks at certain parameters and ignores others. It may be that allowing some people freedom of choice in driving about the country ignores the rights of the rest.<lb/>
The building of private roads with tolls may occur where maximum demand is present, but in satisfying that demand damage may be caused in other directions. Indeed, it may create demand which will cause an increase in environmental damage. The environmental White Paper acknowledges the contribution of road vehicle emissions, air pollution and global warming. The Government cannot have it both ways. Either they believe what they say in the White Paper or they do not. If they do, they must do
<col>640</col>
everything that they can to ensure that the increase in private motoring in particular is brought under control.<lb/>
The Government have argued that all the planning requirements are met within the terms of the Bill and presumably within the terms of the 1980 Act, to which the Bill refers. I understand that. However, there has been no proper, full cost-benefit analysis nor a real environmental impact analysis. I fear that severe damage is bound to be done. It has been argued that private roads may bring additional money into the transport infrastructure. However, the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, has shown that the Government are speaking on the subject in two directions. I too wish to hear what they have to say about the matter this evening.<lb/>
Can the Government ensure additionality, because without that the whole basis of their policy in these parts of the Bill is unsound? If new money is available it should go to improving public transport in a co-ordinated way. I use the word "co-ordinated" rather than "integrated", which appears to indicate a degree of overcentralised planning. I mean coordinating and bringing together the various parts of public transport at whatever level is proper for the problems to be solved.<lb/>
It is my intention to probe the question of maximum tolls during later stages of the Bill. It should not be possible to charge unlimited fees where even a near monopoly exists. At present the scheme is limited in the number of cases with which it deals. It is entirely restricted to estuarial crossings. I believe that it should go further and I intend to probe the matter in Committee.<lb/>
Under Clause 7 it is difficult to understand what criteria will be used to set the level of tolls. We run into the strange dilemma that if the tolls are low, the pay-off will be enormously long. If our estuarial crossings are anything to go by, it will be infinite. There is hardly an estuarial crossing in the country of which I am aware where the amount of money outstanding is not greater than it was when the crossing was first constructed. I am not sure how the Government will square that with the new system.<lb/>
If the cost of the tolls is very high, the situation will become as it is in France. There, if you are prepared to spend money, it is possible to be on some very quiet roads indeed. Presumably that is not what the Government intend by allowing the roads to be built in the first place. I presume that they are intended to reduce congestion on other roads. Once again, there is the danger of private affluence and public squalor. As the AMA said, this part of the Bill is at best a distraction from the major transport problems of the country.<lb/>
If the Government really believe in tolls, they must rethink this part of the Bill. I doubt whether tolls will do anything for public transport which is where the emphasis should be if we are to sort out our transport problems. If the Government are going into road pricing in a serious way, then we should have a debate on that. However, my impression was that the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0360"/>
<col>641</col>
Government had turned their back on road pricing. This is minimalist road pricing which will do a minimalist job. Comprehensive road pricing in our cities and towns would be a way of raising funds for proper bus services and light rapid transport systems. The piecemeal approach that is proposed will get us nowhere. It may increase the profit levels of certain construction companies which are always generous in their support of a certain political party, but I am sure that that is not what is behind the Bill.<lb/>
The Bill will not improve the transport situation for industry or for the private individual. We enthusiastically support Parts III and IV but totally reject Parts I and II.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03818">4.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03819"><member>Lord St. John of Bletso</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like other noble Lords who have spoken, I welcome the Bill. It can only be described as long overdue. As a motorcyclist like the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, weather conditions permitting, I have not had to endure the continuous frustration of traffic congestion in and around London.<lb/>
There are obviously numerous reasons for the traffic problems around the country. One only needs to travel with a London taxi driver to gain a lucid description of some of the causes and obvious remedies for traffic snarl-ups. I strongly support Parts III and IV of the Bill which address the anxieties of the Home Report and others on streetworks and utilities. My anxieties are primarily directed towards the issue of road safety and the co-ordination and quality control of road works conducted on behalf of utility groups.<lb/>
However, before dealing with those issues I should like to touch briefly on the subject of toll roads. The past year has seen a fair amount of activity on that front as government proposals have been aired and revised, leading to the subject being regulated in Parts I and II of the Bill. The press has related the development of those ideas in some detail. It is apparent that the proposals have not always received support from those sections of the private sector which might be expected to finance, construct and manage such roads.<lb/>
Of note in that regard was the dismal response to the call for tenders for the construction and management of the 33-mile long toll road between the M.42 and M.52 outside Birmingham, a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. By June of this year, only three consortia had registered bids. Of those, one was considering withdrawing while another was reviewing its position. Given that the Department of Transport was, to quote <i>The Times</i> on 30th October 1989,
<quote>"confidently expecting over a dozen bids",</quote>
there seems to have been a poor turn-out.<lb/>
I should now like to turn to Parts III and IV of the Bill. I note that almost all noble Lords who spoke on the Unstarred Question of the noble Lord, Lord Nugent of Guildford, in February of this year on traffic obstruction and public utility works are
<col>642</col>
speaking again today. I am concerned about three issues in this part of the Bill. The first is the adoption of new technologies for the installation and maintenance of utility conduits under road surfaces, a point which I am sure will be raised by the noble Lord, Lord Nugent. For example, the trenchless digging techniques of British Gas have not just expedited the laying of pipes but have resulted also in substantial cost savings.<lb/>
I am sure that the National Joint Utilities Group will balk at Clause 67 which proposes a highway occupation fee. I personally support the clause. I believe that it will not only expedite road works, thus alleviating traffic congestion, but that it will also force utility companies using antiquated methods of road digging to follow the example of British Gas and, it is to be hoped, adopt new technologies.<lb/>
I support also the calls of those noble Lords who seek a greater degree of co-ordination between the utility groups. Clauses 47 to 53 address that point by obliging the utility groups undertaking road works and the street authorities to co-ordinate their activities. That should adequately provide an impetus for the adoption of more efficient management techniques all round.<lb/>
Just as anxieties have been expressed on the possibility of road accidents due to road works, so helping drivers to cope with hazardous situations successfully and safely is most important. The recent fog warning system on the M.25 and moves to fit pelican crossings with so-called magic eyes are to be welcomed.<lb/>
In May this year it was shown in findings of government sponsored experiments in Reading, Bristol, Sheffield, Bradford and Nelson that about 200 lives could be saved and 15,000 accidents avoided every year by simple alterations to roads. The changes adopted included a combination of mini-roundabouts, banned turns, closure of some roads, speed bumps, road narrowing and special parking arrangements. These were found to cut down instances of rat running&#x2014;the name given to traffic dodging through residential areas to bypass traffic jams on main roads.<lb/>
If the Bill succeeds in its objective of reducing traffic congestion through proper co-ordination of road works, it will reap considerable savings not just in lost man hours and direct cost to commerce and industry but also in indirect savings to the environment and increased safety on main roads and surrounding areas. For those reasons, despite my reservations about Parts I and II, I warmly support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03820">4.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03821"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by quoting two short extracts from a parliamentary briefing sent to me by British Telecom which I received this morning. The first reads:
<quote>"The New Roads and Street Works Bill &#x2026; provides a sound basis for legislation, but only if it is recognised that public highways are not solely for the benefit of travellers. It has for long been recognised that highways must also be used to provide all those services essential to community life".</quote>
The second extract reads:
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0361"/>
<col>643</col>
<quote>"The New Roads and Street Works Bill appears to have been constructed very much with the convenience of surface users in mind".</quote>
I have checked back. In Roman times the Romans actually stated that roads were not just for the passage of people and goods but also for use in communications. However, in those days communications were by means of a message carried in a cleft stick and the carriers ran along the roads. Later on there were runners and horses and then coaches and horses. For British Telecom to say that the roads are there not just for road users but for those who install facilities under the roads is an absolute cheek.<lb/>
If the roads did not exist the providers of facilities would have to dig their tunnels and install their services somewhere else. Therefore, I hope that the Government agree that the primary use of roads is for the transportation of passengers and goods. I felt it worth while to put that on record. I should perhaps add that I hold shares in BT and that I am having a second line installed at home. Doubtless there will now be some hiccups!<lb/>
I fear that the Bill is not clear and simple. It is also over long. There are six different categories of highways and one operation may well involve routes through three or more categories. That will make life rather complicated for many of the people working on the highways.<lb/>
The Secretary of State is to be given wide powers. However, the Bill does not provide for adequate consultation between him and the service organisations before regulations are altered or approved. It seems to me that before the Secretary of State issues edicts of one kind or another it is vital for him to discuss the proposals with the various organisations responsible for installing gas pipes, sewers, electricity cables, and so on, under our roads; otherwise there will be considerable trouble. It is pointless for the industry to set up a joint organisation to make sure that once a hole is dug in a road all the various services should use it when they can when it is also provided that the Secretary of State may do his own thing.<lb/>
There are 55 clauses in Part III. These contain powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations or approve codes of practice. Some clauses provide for seven different rule-making powers. Again, I believe that that will complicate matters. In his opening address, which I agree was both clear and concise, the Minister gave the impression that the Bill will make life very much easier for all concerned. I am not sure that that will be the case if it is unamended.<lb/>
Clause 67 deals with fees for the occupation of highways. That is likely to be unfair because certain utilities have statutory duties and therefore must carry out essential repairs. To do so they will have to pay for the privilege. I believe that that is wrong. Instead of the powers being mandatory I should prefer that they are used only if the codes of practice are abused.<lb/>
Clause 52 deals with the restriction on works following substantial road works. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has already spoken eloquently on the subject. Clearly it would be ridiculous for a person moving home to have to wait 12 months before having
<col>644</col>
gas, electricity or a telephone installed. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has also dealt with Clause 46 and the restoration of supplies. It does not seem right that one should have to wait for seven days to be reconnected to vital services.<lb/>
Basically I agree with private funding but I have certain hesitations because nowadays most public utilities are privately owned. Therefore, there is a dichotomy in that, on the one hand, there is the public interest&#x2014;certainly in the old days&#x2014;and, on the other, the fact that private undertakings are solely concerned with making a profit and paying their shareholders.<lb/>
The new privately funded roads will be toll roads. On that I have one simple question to ask: what is the position in regard to the movement of large numbers of military vehicles? For example, after another mishap in the Middle East we had convoys carrying tanks, ammunition and troops. Will such movements have to pay the tolls? If so, once more the taxpayer will have to pay; or will such movements be given dispensation? I hope that the latter is the case.<lb/>
I was sorry to hear the Minister state, as if relieving his anxieties, that the existing position in regard to public inquiries on new roads would be retained. I was hoping that some of the stupidness which exists in the present system would be swept away. There is the well-known case of an old lady who objected to a by-pass going round a town and kept up her objections for years and years. She did not live in the county, had never travelled on the existing roads and had never visited the town. She objected only on principle. The more objections that arc put forward, the more time is wasted. I am perfectly happy to accept that people who are directly affected should be allowed to attend public hearings but I believe that people who are not affected should not be allowed to do so.<lb/>
I have spoken long enough to put over the few small points that concern me. It may not have sounded like it, but I am basically in favour of the Bill. I am sure that our concerns will be ironed out during the Bill's passage through this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03822">4.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03823"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by thanking my noble friend Lord Brabazon for his introduction on this long and complicated Bill. He made clear the many technical clauses and has given us a useful start. I also thank the parliamentary draughtsman. Clauses 96 and 150 contain indices of the expressions used. I have not previously seen that in a Bill. My noble and learned friend on the Cross Benches drew my attention to that. It is a good idea and I am sure that all noble Lords who are interested in the Bill will be thankful, before we have finished, that we have these indices of all the many technical expressions used in this long Bill.<lb/>
I start with the first part of the Bill concerning new roads which received such a blasting from the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. I am bound to, say that I have yet to see a government with enough money to do everything necessary for the improvement or our roads. It seems to me, therefore, that we should endeavour to get
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0362"/>
<col>645</col>
private contractors to put up the money, without cost to the taxpayers, in order to build much needed roads. I would welcome that. Where there is a monopoly, as in the Dartford-Purfleet bridge which duplicates the tunnel, the tolls will be statutorily controlled. Where a public road system exists as an alternative, the private contractor can be left to set his tolls at a level which he believes will pay him best. If people find that the cost is too much they will not use the roads. So that is a perfectly good safeguard. However the present Government's record on road building is very good. Its programme for the future is also tremendously good. As this will be, not instead of, but as well as public services the Bill has my warm welcome.<lb/>
I want to say something about the street works section, Parts III and IV, of the Bill. I rather suspect from what the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, had to say that we might be hearing quite a bit about private sector road building at the Committee stage. I congratulate my noble friend on achieving what no other government have done for 40 years in bringing forward legislation. It really is epoch making. I offer him my warm congratulations. I should also like to thank Professor Horne. He did a great job with his working party's report in 1985, which recommended a range of improvements. Along with Professor Home, I should like to congratulate and thank the National Joint Utilities Group, which has given so much valuable help in the drafting of the many technical matters in the Bill. It is most valuable. I notice that it has reservations on three points; no doubt there will be some discussion of those at Committee stage. In the main, however, it evidently approves and that gives the Bill a very good send-off.<lb/>
Here in Parliament we have to find the right balance between the needs of the public utilities and the highway needs of traffic. This is something which the 1950 Act ignored. The Act simply provided for the public utilities. In those days, traffic was nothing like it is today. Today, when our constant concern is to try to find means to keep traffic moving in urban areas, it is a vital point.<lb/>
That is why I see the Bill as being so important. It attempts for the first time, especially in Clause 67, which has already come in for a certain amount of beating, to make a charge for the space occupied on the highway and the time during which it is occupied. Here we are to be asked to try to find the right balance on a crucially important issue &#x2014;that of achieving the free and safe passage of both traffic and pedestrians. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, that many obstructions on pavements are extremely dangerous, not only for the disabled and unsighted, but also for healthy people. I have had more than one tumble recently. Anyhow, the great moment has arrived.<lb/>
I turn to the fee to be charged for occupation of the highway. Curiously enough, Professor Home's report did not recommend this. However, with four million road openings a year this is an activity that has a significant measure of traffic obstruction to its discredit. The total increased cost to those transporting freight
<col>646</col>
and driving private cars must run into billions of pounds a year on account of road openings. If the Bill had omitted all reference to this huge consequential cost, and if a fair assessment of each job's contribution had not been mentioned in the Bill, it would have been a very serious omission. Anyhow, Clause 67 is there: we shall be able to deal with the matter.<lb/>
There is a vital practical implication in charging an occupation fee. It gives the contractor the maximum incentive to use technology which will make the minimum disturbance to the highway and for the shortest time. I come here to the interesting new technology of trenchless digging. I have developed a personal interest in it as vice-president of the International Society for Trenchless Digging. This involves boring channels under the surface rather than digging up the road.<lb/>
Curiously enough, the technology was invented in this country some years ago. But, as so often happens, the technology was then taken abroad and developed on a very large scale over very great distances in Japan, Germany and the United States. At last, however, it has come back here. As the noble Lord, Lord St.John of Bletso, rightly said, British Gas has been a splendid pioneer in using the technology for literally thousands of miles of cable that it has laid. British Gas carried out a good deal of expensive research beforehand. It saw that the technology would be beneficial to traffic but primarily took it up because it was cost-effective. There is so much less work involved. British Gas has been most successful. Some of the water companies have also used the technology.<lb/>
In the main, however, contractors, especially highway authorities, have not made the major move to acquire the new machinery and train staff to use it. They continue to use the good old pick and shovel brigade. It is a big move to change; but that is what it is all about.<lb/>
The National Joint Utilities Group says that it thinks that charging a fee will increase the public utility price to consumers. It may do so marginally, but what we are trying to find is a balance between the consumer's interests and the interests of the traffic moving on the highway. That is a point which I feel certain noble Lords on all sides will be taking into account. There is no doubt that if contractors go over to using the trenchless technology, they will be able to reduce their occupation of the highway very substantially both in time and in space, to the great benefit of traffic.<lb/>
I congratulate my noble friend Lord Brabazon and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport for bringing in the Bill. Obviously, we shall have some interesting discussions. I am eager to hear what my noble friend has in mind in the way of fees to be charged and how he will draw them up. They are to be introduced by regulations; this will be a point of critical interest at Committee stage.<lb/>
I should like to mention another interesting point. Clause 72 deals with the obligation of an undertaker to record the location of any new pipe or cable which he installs in the highway. This is to be charted on a
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0363"/>
<col>647</col>
register to be maintained by the highway authority. I understand that the register is to be funded by the Government, which is admirable. And so it should be in order to get the thing going.<lb/>
It will take many years before we have a register that is really worth much. It will take account only of the new services and repairs that have been put down. What we really need is a register of all the services in the cat's cradle of services under our roads, so that with reasonable safety new work can be done without someone putting a pick through an electricity cable and blowing up the whole community. This is a point that I ask my noble friend to take note of.<lb/>
The new technology of ground probing radar is being developed, especially in Japan where the need for it was recognised and great effort put into it. Without a doubt, with their resources and ingenuity, the Japanese will find the answer in a very few years. I ask my noble friend to make sure that the Bill provides for the possibility when the technology is available, of using the ground probing radar to chart all the existing services. When that is achieved, the register will be most valuable.<lb/>
There are many interesting points in the Bill. I am looking forward to the discussions about the three special categories of streets which my noble friend has put into it. We must reserve those discussions for the Committee stage. I commend the Bill and have great pleasure in supporting it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03825"><member>Baroness Platt of Writtle</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to welcome this Bill and to congratulate my noble friend the Minister on its introduction. Roads are of vital importance to us in our crowded island. People and goods can travel by rail, but normally that involves journeys by road at either end if they are to arrive at their final destination. Eighty-six per cent. of freight journeys are of less than 50 miles duration, to which railways can contribute little. Roads will always form the lifeblood of our industrial and commercial life, and contribute greatly to the convenience of people's domestic transport.<lb/>
With the constant increase in both commercial and domestic traffic, we need new roads. The Department of Transport estimates that road usage will increase by between 25 and 40 per cent. by the end of the century and by up to 100 per cent. by the year 2020. In my own village of Writtle we waited many years for our bypass. That has made a great difference to life in our village community, allowing children and old people to cross the road more safely. We shall continue to need new major highways. If the private sector can provide some of those, supplementing government infrastructure provision to the advantage of our commercial, industrial and domestic life, congestion will be reduced. That will be beneficial to the community as a whole in terms of the costs of both goods and services, and to the greenhouse effect. Traffic jams cost money, are energy-inefficient and emit unnecessary exhaust gases.<lb/>
As well as needing new roads it is our bounden duty also to use existing roads, especially in urban and
<col>648</col>
metropolitan areas, as efficiently as possible. A few years ago in Chelmsford our highways authorities got together to plan and put into effect "Chelmsford move" to reduce traffic congestion. By clearly marked white-lining, double traffic lanes could be created in many places, road capacity substantially increased and congestion reduced.<lb/>
The purpose of Part III of the Bill is also to reduce road congestion and improve existing road utilisation. I must declare an interest as a non-executive director of British Gas. British Gas is a member of the National Joint Utilities Group established in 1977 to promote collaboration between the utilities that install plant in the highways. The group fully supports the Home recommendations and welcomes the Bill, which it believes will result in fewer holes in the road and better road surfaces. When the Government published their response to the Home report in 1986, Peter Bottomley, the Minister then responsible for roads, asked the group to work with the highways authorities to develop codes of practice, technical specifications and collaborative administrative procedures.<lb/>
This they have done. I am pleased that my noble friends the Minister and Lord Nugent paid tribute to that collaboration today. The bodies concerned will continue that collaboration. The results will then possibly be put into practice when the Bill is enacted next year. As mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, and my noble friend Lord Nugent, over the years British Gas has utilised new technology wherever possible to reduce the necessity for digging up the roads. Plastic pipes do not corrode like cast iron and are used widely in distribution systems. Where cast iron has corroded, innovative procedures have been designed to line them with plastic pipes instead of digging them up. This enables pipes to be laid with the minimum of excavation. Where it is absolutely necessary, trenching is now much narrower than it was in years gone by. Over the past 12 months, in the city of Westminster, 90 kilometres of main were replaced, of which 75 kilometres were renewed without trenching, using the foregoing methods.<lb/>
Over &#x00A3;6 million has been invested by British Gas Engineering Research during the past decade. That is a substantial sum of money which has meant that British Gas has become a world leader in these fields of work. In the 1970s, when I was involved in local government, trench reinstatement was a permanent problem, taking place months after the initial work was completed, leaving bumpy roads to everybody's irritation. It is now becoming possible to reinstate permanently on completion of the work by the use of thermostatically controlled insulated hot boxes to keep bitumen in good condition for immediate use. Also, foamed concrete is now being used for the speedy reinstatement of trenches. These methods will continue to be developed throughout the country. British Gas welcomes the co-operation of local highway authorities in developing improved new techniques to increase efficiency.<lb/>
The National Joint Utilities Group has acquired great experience in this area over many years and wishes to see this legislation as capable of being
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0364"/>
<col>649</col>
carried out in a realistic and practical way. The group is anxious in regard to three fields of this Bill which have been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, who spoke before me. They feel that the definition of emergency works in Clause 46 is too narrowly drawn, as it is only associated with a public emergency such as an escape of gas. Originally it was proposed to allow the restoration of all supplies cut off. All utilities are under statutory obligations to restore customers' supplies. That could be breached by the new, narrower definition. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will be able to look at this definition again.<lb/>
In Clause 52 there is a prohibition against digging up new roads for 12 months. Emergency works are sensibly excluded, but new customers are not exempt and could have to wait up to 12 months for utility supplies. Indeed, subsection (7) goes so far as to remove the statutory duty of utilities to supply in these circumstances. This could cause substantial hardship to potential customers. I hope that my noble friend can look at the drafting of this clause again.<lb/>
Under Clause 69 the utility will be charged for the use of the highway by the highway authority. I can understand the purpose of this clause, which is to press undertakers to work as fast as possible. As one drives along motorway contraflows for mile after mile, which one knows is hazardous, one has great sympathy for this clause. At times one cannot see any constructional activity at all on the empty road. These works must be completed as soon as possible in the interests of road safety and better utilisation.<lb/>
However, originally I understood that emergency works were to be exempt from these charges and the Home report rejected them because there could be a dilution of safety standards. That could be particularly important in urban situations as distinct from motorways. I hope that my noble friend can also look at that clause again.<lb/>
Finally, in looking at the problem of road congestion I should like to make a further suggestion. We all know the utter frustration of arriving at a traffic jam on a motorway and crawling captive to the next junction. Could a digital display board be erected at the entry to all slip roads both entering and leaving motorways? On seeing a notice that the next motorway section is blocked, traffic could leave the motorway, or not join it at all, until the blockage had been cleared. I believe that would be a great advantage. I hope that the Bill, when enacted and amended in the ways I have suggested, will make a major contribution to the reduction of road congestion and thereby maximise the use of existing roads, which will be to everybody's advantage in many important and cost-effective ways.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03826">4.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03827"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a good Bill to do two good things. First, it is to help to bring forward a programme of toll roads, and, secondly, to regulate those who dig up existing roads for no doubt worthy and responsible purposes. I wish I could say
<col>650</col>
the same of the drafting of the Bill. I simply do not believe that in order to enact those two good things it is really necessary to have a Bill with 156 clauses and nine schedules. It is part of the modern and, I think, deplorable technique of the parliamentary draftsman of not only dotting every "i" but putting about half a dozen dots on every "i" and crossing every "t" several times over.<lb/>
I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is not in his place because he has done his best with his committee to fight this tendency. I am sorry that Ministers have not been firmer with their advisers and have not insisted that Bills should not be drafted at this enormous length. I am sure that we are greatly indebted to my noble friend Lord Brabazon for his introductory speech in which he took us through most of the clauses, but he must himself feel that this was largely an unnecessary labour and that stricter control of drafting, which used in my days in government to be undertaken by the legislation committee of the Cabinet, could indeed restrain and restrict the zeal of the parliamentary draftsman to deal with all possible and most impossible contingencies.<lb/>
I shall say only a few words about toll roads. I am sure that it is a good thing to seek to develop toll roads. I do not know, and I suspect my noble friend the Minister does not know, how many will actually be built or where. But whatever number is built, they will be an addition to the existing programmes and therefore an additional provision, without recourse to public funds, of the road structure of this country. That must be an extremely good thing. I wonder whether, when he comes to reply, my noble friend can give us a clearer idea both as to how many of these roads it is expected will be built in the next few years and where. It would, for example, be an enormous advantage, though I for one fully realise the difficulties, if one or two roads could be built to improve access to central London from the motorways.<lb/>
Almost the weakest point in our road system at the moment is the hold-ups in the approaches to central London. It is obvious that roads in such areas would be expensive and therefore possibly a suitable subject for toll roads. In any event I hope that my noble friend will be able to give noble Lords, who are very interested indeed as the debate has so far shown, some indication of how many such roads will be built over the next few years.<lb/>
I now turn to the question of control of those who seek to dig up existing roads. In this respect I ought to declare perhaps paternity or even grand-paternity in the matter. If my noble friend looks at the back papers of his department, unless they have gone to the Public Record Office, he will see that 35 years ago in the autumn of 1955 I as Minister of Transport put forward proposals to give control over the digging up of public roads by public utilities. As it so happened, in December of that year the Prime Minister of the day in his wisdom transferred me to another department and my successor&#x2014;I shall not say "in his wisdom" &#x2014;declined to take up this cause. The matter has lain in desuetude for 35 years.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0365"/>
<col>651</col>
That is perhaps an encouraging aspect inasmuch as it indicates that, if one waits long enough in public life, sooner or later things happen. I would say that no one can accuse Her Majesty's Government of indecent haste. It is a particular pleasure obviously that, having felt strongly about the matter 35 years ago and done my best to bring legislation forward before my translation to the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, action is now being taken.<lb/>
The action looks to be thoughtful and intelligent. I like very much the proposal that, where a public utility digs up a road and causes expense to the highway authority in the operation of other roads&#x2014;heavy wear and tear, improvements and so on&#x2014;the public utility responsible shall be made to indemnify the highway authority. That is absolutely right because the cause of the trouble and of the expense is the work of the public utility and therefore seems to be properly chargeable to it. That is an aspect of the proposal which seems to have considerable value.<lb/>
The nub of the matter is that there should be control of the right to dig up public roads. We have all experienced on roads we use regularly the situation in which one public utility digs it up and then rather badly refurbishes it. A few weeks later another public authority comes along, digs it up, obstructs traffic and then puts it back in perhaps a rather worse state. A third public utility then comes along to dig it up, no doubt with the best of intentions but concerned only with the provision of its own services, and as a result traffic is made extremely difficult. As one noble Lord said earlier in the debate, back in the 1950s traffic was nothing like as heavy as it is at present and the problem therefore was not as serious. Today the problem is desperately serious. I am delighted that the Government are coming forward with what seem on the whole to be well calculated methods of dealing with it.<lb/>
I wish, however, that they could go a little further and secure not only the co-ordination of work by public utilities but the co-ordination of the work of highway authorities themselves. I do not know whether my noble friend is aware of the fact that in October comparable lengths of the M.3 and the M.4 were dug up at the same time in order to be resurfaced. The timing meant that it was useless for traffic serving common areas to divert from one to the other. If traffic diverted from the M.3 it found the position just as bad on the M.4 and vice versa. The highway authorities ought to co-ordinate with each other and secure that when major roadworks are being undertaken by them they take place, first, at a time of relatively low traffic movement, and, secondly, not simultaneously with work on roads&#x2014;in this case, motorways&#x2014;which also serve the same areas. They should be staggered in point of time. It is up to the highway authorities to do that. If they fail to do so it is for my noble friend and his right honourable friend the Minister to knock their heads together and make sure that they do.<lb/>
My noble friend may be aware of the fact that for some reason it was decided that the railings on the Hammersmith flyover, which serves both the M.3 and
<col>652</col>
the M.4, required to be painted. I do not know why. Aesthetically they look awful anyhow and they look awful now that they have been painted. We were told that the work would take seven weeks. When one drove along the one remaining line of route one could often see one man, and sometimes even two men, solemnly painting the railings. It was not a question of spraying them or anything of that kind. They were gently painting them. On another occasion I saw a happy group of four men, one of whom was making a cup of tea, one of whom was eating a sandwich, one of whom was getting a paint tin out and the fourth of whom was actually painting. There was an appalling delay while traffic piled up on that crucial route into London.<lb/>
If we are to control, as the Bill proposes, and as I hope indeed it will, the public utilities which from time to time in their zeal to perform their own service obstruct the highway, the highway authorities themselves require supervision from the Minister and examples such as the simultaneous digging up of the M.3 and M.4 and the ridiculous affair of the railings on the Hammersmith flyover must command the attention of the Minister for Transport, if he is to be in truth a Minister for Transport.<lb/>
I do not think that that necessarily falls within the scope of the Bill, but it certainly conies very much within the scope of the department of my noble friend and my right honourable friend. I hope that they will realise not only the hardship and discomfort caused to the public but also the economic loss and damage which these long delays resulting from such operations cause to our community. If they deal with that, they will be doing good work in addition to that which the Bill seeks to achieve. I wish the Bill well and I hope that it will soon become law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03828">5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03829"><member>Lord Broadbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to speak solely to the street works section of the Bill as outlined in Parts III and IV. Every Bill tends to get a vernacular title and, as it were, a Short Title. Perhaps not surprisingly, this one seems to have had the name "the potholes Bill" settled upon it, despite its new roads content. Although it is in some circumstances more agreeable to travel than to arrive, it is at present certainly safer to do the latter mainly because of the holes in our roads. Current diggings are at a level of about 3 million a year, although the Minister mentioned the figure of 4 million a year. As he is the revealer of truth, I must accept his higher figure. In fact, it makes the situation worse.<lb/>
The street works part of the Bill has been long awaited by many hopeful parties. It is excellent to see it make such an early start in the Session and also in your Lordships' House. It is "long awaited" because it is now 40 years since the Public Utilities Street Works Act received Royal Assent against a very different background. Today there is four times as much motor traffic which, with other users such as pedestrians and pedal and motor cyclists, has to fight a way through, over and around a dramatic increase in the number of street works. It is seven years since the House of Commons Transport Committee recommended new
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0366"/>
<col>653</col>
legislation, four years since the Government accepted that need, five years since Professor Home recommended new legislation and over 12 months since the Government outlined their new legislative proposals. As the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, said, we are most grateful for what is happening, although it has taken a measure of time to arrive.<lb/>
There has for once been much preparation in the background by those involved in anticipation of the Bill's arrival. Following the publication of the Home Report, the national and local highway authorities and the utilities which dig most of the 3 million or 4 million holes came together to form HAUC, the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee. Codes of practice were developed and agreed with the Department of Transport and HAUC led a campaign for this Bill which received the enthusiastic support of some 15 leading organisations ranging from the AA and the RAC to Friends of the Earth and the TUC, and, significantly, including the Joint Committee on Mobility of Blind and Partially Sighted People.<lb/>
Second Readings of Bills are usually the occasion for the unveiling of startling statistics. But if the CBI's calculation that road congestion is currently costing each household about &#x00A3;10 a week were only half right, that would still be &#x00A3;250 a year in economic terms, quite apart from all the human misery experienced in wrestling with congestion, losing road grip and direction, tripping over, being thrown off bicycles and then run over, submerging our feet in cold muddy water, and so on. The list is endless and often leads to damage, injury or death.<lb/>
Even during a Second Reading debate it would be laborious to mention all the hoped for main elements in a new street works Bill. Therefore, I shall restrict myself to one, perhaps the most significant, which is to allow the utilities&#x2014;water, gas, electricity, BT and Mercury telecommunications&#x2014;to repair their own holes. Under the 1950 Act, I understand that local authority direct labour is charged with this responsibility. But the sheer number of holes in existence today, and in many cases the diminution in size of local authority direct labour resources for separate reasons, has made this an unrealistic course. The requirement has outlived its appropriateness in the face of the sheer numbers of roadworks and the complexity of the total scene.<lb/>
"Let him who digs repair" seems an entirely sensible solution for the future and one for which HAUC&#x2014;which includes local authorities&#x2014;has been preparing its members for several years by the preparation of a computerised street works register into which notification of all roadworks will be fed. The computerised register will be used, first, to co-ordinate works in absolute terms; secondly, to co-ordinate them in such terms as they relate to other utilities works; thirdly, to relate hours, conditions and prior notice of working according to the traffic sensitivities of the route; and, fourthly, through a national roadworks quality specification and use of
<col>654</col>
appropriately trained operators and supervisors to ensure that the matter is completed correctly and on time.<lb/>
That last point on training can in the almost literal sense be vital because there is one thing almost as dangerous as the hole and that is the hump. All of us have to travel on the presumption of a level surface ahead and a post-works hump can be almost as disorienting as the unexpected hole. Perhaps too much emphasis is placed upon the hole. We are all probably familiar with the doggerel:
<quote>"Dr. Foster Went to Gloucester In a shower of rain He fell in a puddle Up to his middle And never went there again".</quote>
It will be seen that is is even bad for the tourist trade. However, on a more serious note, I travelled to your Lordships' House on a bicycle for some time during the not too distant Tube troubles. I formed a rapid and rather painful view of the hump, a menace which might be considered to be wasted work&#x2014;expensive wasted work.<lb/>
I have read the shopping list, so to speak, of HAUC's requirement of a Bill. I formed a list of my own and I have carefully read Parts III and IV of the proposed Bill which is before us this afternoon. In this light, and on a Second Reading day when we consider a Bill's basic structure and principles, I find the proposed Bill most satisfyingly comprehensive and apparently realistic. I believe that in all its main parts it is on the right lines. It will do enormous good.<lb/>
It is all too commonly the experience of Parliament when seeking to regulate some area of human activity that the target vigorously resists even the principle of regulation as well as its detail. Here, for once, I believe that the Minister is sitting under a tree containing an enormous ripe plum which is waiting and which is more than usually prepared to be shaken off. I wish the Minister strength to his arm and both in this and subsequent travels in your Lordships' House a puncture-free journey.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03831"><member>Lord Swinfen</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while listening to the debate, it came to my notice that as the general public will have to pay to use these new toll roads, they cannot be public highways. As I understand it, a public highway is open to anyone without any fee or charge being incurred. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us in his concluding speech whether there will be any diminution in the power of the police and whether the concessionaires will be able to make their own traffic regulations or whether they will have to be approved by the police, by Parliament or by someone else. Will they be able to form their own private police forces to police the traffic? I have not noticed anything in the Bill to deal with that point. I may be wrong, and I shall be interested to learn.<lb/>
I had not intended to speak on that subject, but when the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, spoke he acted as an extremely good traffic warden, effectively wheel-clamping me by saying nearly everything that I had intended to say, especially about disabled people. He has been ably supported by others of your Lordships, and I too shall say a few words in support.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0367"/>
<col>655</col>
One of the reasons given for the introduction of privately-financed roads is that they would encourage the public to use public transport. Unfortunately, because of their disabilities, many disabled people cannot use public transport. Therefore, provided that they have an orange badge on their vehicle, they should be able to use the new toll roads for nothing. At present, places such as the Severn Bridge, the Erskine Bridge, the Forth Bridge and the Dartford Tunnel are open to them free of charge. That facility should be extended to the new roads proposed in the Bill. In addition, under Section 105 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, it is illegal to clamp a vehicle with an orange badge. That provision must apply also to orange-badged vehicles using the new toll roads. We must bear in mind that a disabled person is probably unable to go to the local police station to arrange for his vehicle to be unclamped and is therefore stuck and unable to obtain help.<lb/>
It has also been said by many of your Lordships that there must be proper barriers around holes in roads while repairs are carried out. Provision is made for that in the Bill; but there should also be audible warnings for blind people or those with poor sight. I understand that a simple warning device that can give a verbal message costs about &#x00A3;50 at present. If there is a general requirement for such devices and there is some form of mass production, a verbal or audible warning device will be produced at a very much lower price. We already have flashing orange lamps around road works. I doubt whether they cost &#x00A3;50. A similar device emitting an audible warning would be extremely useful.<lb/>
As well as a barrier to prevent people falling into a hole, there should be a rail at what I would call stick-tapping height for those who use a white cane so that they can feel the barrier. It is no use having a waist-high barrier. If a blind person with a stick comes along, the stick goes under the barrier and before that person knows where he is he is in the hole, because he is right on the barrier before he is aware of it. There should also be a proper space with an even path around road works for people in wheelchairs. A rough surface to a wheelchair can be not just uncomfortable, it can increase the disability, and no one wants that.<lb/>
In addition, in areas where roadworks are taking place and where there are organisations for disabled people, they should be advised of the roadworks so that they can warn their members of where the works are and give them alternative routes. I welcome the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03832">5.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03833"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I give the Bill a general welcome and congratulate my noble friend on having, as my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter said, after so many years brought forward a Bill to deal with the problem.<lb/>
In any consideration of Parts I and II we must never lose sight of the imperative need for the Government to deliver the improved and expanded road network which was set out in the May 1989 White Paper entitled <i>Roads for Prosperity.</i> The
<col>656</col>
programme contained in that White Paper should be publicly funded. It should not be hived off piecemeal to the private sector. My noble friend the Minister referred to the Birmingham north relief road. That is an example of what I mean. It is an essential part of the principal network. That kind of toll road should not be excluded from the national network in the way proposed.<lb/>
Road users contribute directly some &#x00A3;17 billion per annum to the Exchequer by way of road taxation. Less than one-quarter of that is returned. It is difficult to accept that an additional tax&#x2014;whether it is called tolling or anything else&#x2014;is necessary to achieve a better service. Having said that, I am not against a toll road system where there is a proper and reasonable free alternative; where toll roads are built only where there is a special and particular need that cannot be met through the national highway system; and where any private sector toll road is additional to the national programme.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Tordoff, and my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter stressed additionality. Your Lordships' Select Committee on Transport Infrastructure, reporting in, I think, November last year, had some trenchant remarks to make about additionality. Paragraph 44 of the consultative document entitled <i>New Roads by New Means</i> again attempts to express the Government's view of additionality. None of those concerned with road matters has been totally satisfied about additionality for the past 20 or 30 years. I hope that when we set up the toll roads the additionality will be made abundantly clear and that the costings will be transparent so that all can see them.<lb/>
I suppose that in that part of the Bill I shall be looking for&#x2014;optimistically of course but with little hope of contentment&#x2014;an irrevocable assurance from my noble friend the Minister that the existing motorway and trunk road system will continue to be improved, upgraded and maintained with freedom of access, as a national and publicly-funded priority, regarded as a national asset and nurtured as such, rather than be for the use of a special group of people.<lb/>
I turn to Parts II and III, which I welcome enormously. I noticed that in the Department of Transport's press release of 9th November, press notice No. 401, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport stated:
<quote>"The main proposals will"&#x2014;</quote>
he listed a number, one of which I select for this evening's debate&#x2014;
<quote>"require the training and certification of workmen and supervisors to nationally agreed standards".</quote>
That was in connection with the repair of roads.<lb/>
The Bill lacks a clear framework for management accountability for the safety and efficiency of road works being undertaken. It is not good enough to provide a certification system that in practice devolves the responsibility upon a workman or a supervisor on the site, negativing the principal management
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0368"/>
<col>657</col>
responsibility for its duties under the Act. As we go through the Bill, I should like to see some provision in this area.<lb/>
I touch briefly on the three clauses of concern to the NJUG and merely add on Clause 46, in regard to the emergency works point which the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, mentioned in his speech, that the Bill's proposal for a customer having to wait seven days while the statutory notice runs its course seems to be totally unreasonable. In today's climate, it is not even necessary. He and other noble Lords spoke on another point of concern, the Clause 52 restriction on works.<lb/>
I do not disagree with anyone who has spoken of his concern. I just add another somewhat more cynical comment. Some may say it is a little unfair. If I painted the worst scenario that I could, it would run something like this: a utility or highway authority may undertake works, frustrating or purposely to frustrate a new entrant with a new service for 12 months&#x2014;a cable service, telecommunications or whatever it may be. This seems to me to be essentially wrong.<lb/>
On the Clause 67 point&#x2014;fees&#x2014;I noticed what my noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford said. I think it was he, but he will forgive me if it was not. He talked about it only being right that the utilities should have to pay. He admitted that it might marginally increase the cost of the services underground to the consumer, but a balance had to be struck. I disagree fundamentally with him. I believe that the costs to the consumer will go up enormously. It is not necessarily a balance that has to be struck between the road user and the consumer of the services underneath the road. To an extent they are already paying for the &#x00A3;15 billion a year congestion. It is the highway authority that will be the net beneficiary.<lb/>
I return to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, made about fees. He will know that in the national road maintenance condition survey the condition of local authority roads in 1989 was worse than it was in 1977. Here is a splendid opportunity for a local highway authority&#x2014;that is really the local authority&#x2014;imposing charges that are not necessarily proportionate to the amount of damage done or the cost of restoration to enhance its own maintenance and repair budget. I have always had a marked distrust of local authorities' powers to charge, whether it is for the collection of trolleys, the erection of signs on street furniture, or for this matter. I believe that, hard pressed though they be, much of the money is diverted. I wish to examine Clause 67 with other noble Lords when we reach it.<lb/>
I finish on a rather different note which concerns Crown immunity. I believe it comes under Clause 152. It is my understanding that the traffic control systems unit, which controls 3,000 traffic light junctions in Central and Greater London, carried out its functions originally under the order of the Corporation of London. On the abolition of the GLC when the department could find no local authorities willing to accept responsibility for traffic control in this area, the unit was set up as an agent of the Department of Transport. I understand that should any public utility,
<col>658</col>
in undertaking ground works, damage the detectors or loop systems the traffic control systems unit can sue the utility concerned for damage. However, as I understand Clause 152, were the traffic control systems unit, in putting down its detectors or loop systems, to damage any other utility, it is immune from being sued under Crown immunity. That does not seem to me to be an equitable arrangement. It seems to me that we need clarification as to the responsibilities of an agency of a government department in relation to the other responsibilities which are to be placed on other utilities.<lb/>
I believe that we shall have a fairly interesting debate. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, that it should be a short Committee stage, because the sooner we send the Bill to another place with as few amendments as possible&#x2014;amendments to which it can agree quickly&#x2014;the better.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03835"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as twelfth man in the debate there is little left for me to say, so I have been able to reduce my speech somewhat. Like other noble Lords, I warmly welcome the Bill, first, because we in the country are dependent on the provision and maintenance of a first class national road system. The provisions in the Bill will go a long way towards giving motorists the benefit of increased choice and we hope that there will be less congestion on our existing roads.<lb/>
Part III of the Bill is warmly welcomed by everyone, as has been said many times in the debate. It introduces new controls on work in progress to improve road safety at the site of any works. A couple of aspects may not be properly covered and I wish to raise them. It may well be that they are dealt with and perhaps my noble friend, when he comes to wind up, will tell me if that is so.<lb/>
Clause 44 deals with the granting of a licence. Presumably licences will be granted subject to the proviso that any and all items of equipment such as pillar boxes, telephone kiosks, etc. are placed in accordance with normal safety audit procedures as set out in the guidelines issued by the Institution of Highways and Transportation and approved and endorsed by the Department of Transport. Sight lines may be obstructed and road accidents may be caused by the inappropriate placement of such equipment. It would be unfortunate if this occasion were not taken to ensure that such basic safety precautions were embodied in the Bill at this stage in order to reduce the likelihood of further difficulties. If there is no intention of including those precautions in the Bill, it may be worthwhile looking at the period of notice provided by the undertaker to the highway authority in conjunction with its responsibility to ensure the safety of the highway. Too short a notice period may not allow time for the proposed site to be safely audited.<lb/>
I have a further anxiety in connection with Clause 58. I am anxious that any street works should take proper account of the needs of pedestrians, the very young, the elderly and the disabled, and that where appropriate guard railing should be provided between
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0369"/>
<col>659</col>
the works and the footway, and between the footway and passing traffic. I am anxious that appropriate signs should be provided. However, this matter may well be covered by Chapter 8 of the traffic signs manual. I also have anxieties as regards Clauses 46, 52 and 67 but these have been dealt with by other noble Lords. They have spoken about them far better than I could have done. However, I wish to add my support to the anxieties they have expressed.<lb/>
The Bill refers to the codes of practice. I believe that these codes of practice were suggested by the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee. I know that the body concerned with the public utilities hopes that these codes of practice will be published before the Bill reaches its final stages as it may decide that more specific safeguards should be written into the Bill.<lb/>
This measure is welcomed by all parties. It should stop congestion on our city roads and result in fewer holes and better road surfaces. The opportunity to construct an agreed and durable set of rules that do not lead to confusion in order to achieve a balance between the utilities and the road user is within our sights. I warmly support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03837"><member>The Viscount of Falkland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the previous speaker remarked, nearly everything has been said on this matter. I decided to listen to your Lordships' debate rather than prepare anything. I agree with most of what has been said in praise of the Bill. I confirm that I am entirely in agreement with my noble friend Lord Tordoff and others in supporting almost entirely Parts III and IV of the Bill.<lb/>
Those of us who use the roads in London know the situation is intolerable. I do not believe that any speaker has used the word "intolerable" yet, but that is an apt description of the position. I probably use the roads more than most people although I cannot think why. Nowadays I use two motorised wheels more often than I use my car. I believe the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, referred to this matter. I probably travel about 8,000 miles a year on a motorcycle and about 10,000 miles in a car. Much of that travel is done in the South and the South West of England. I have been travelling in those areas for some time. I use the motorcycle as it enables me to travel around much more quickly. I thus avoid many of the frustrations caused by the congestion on the roads and by the holes in the road surface and the repairs carried out by the public utilities which are the subject of this debate.<lb/>
When one rides a motorcycle, one views this matter in a slightly different way to the car user. One goes to places that one might not go to in a car. The situation off the main roads is as bad as that on the main roads. I shall give just one example of the madness which attaches to the repairing of holes in the road. One of the utilities&#x2014;I shall not mention which one unless I have a problem with it personally&#x2014;was carrying out large-scale works on the road approaching from the west towards Nine Elms. The road was up for a considerable period. At night the utility involved saw fit to erect a kind of rudimentary fencing round the holes that it had dug. However, as the fencing was ill
<col>660</col>
lit, the next morning the road was littered with pieces of tin, wood, broken lights, pieces of red Bakelite and other such materials. That litter represented a great hazard to road users, particularly those on two wheels. It was quite clear that no proper thought or planning had been given to that site. It was clear also that no thought had been given to the possible consequences of the low level of protection that was afforded to road users while the site was left unattended during the night. This kind of slapdash, ill thought out behaviour on the part of utility companies is one of the features of life around the roads in Britain.<lb/>
I must say that I was surprised by the equanimity with which some noble Lords greeted the forecasts of future road traffic levels. Those forecasts terrified me. I cannot believe that they were accepted with such equanimity. This morning for the first time in a long while I travelled on a commuter train during the rush hour. I was heartened by that trip. I found the train to be clean and it arrived on time. The journey was pleasant and the windows were clear so I could see what was going on outside. I noticed that the roads were chock-a-block at that time. In some places they were jammed solid. It appears to me that the railways are beginning to put their house in order. I wondered why people were not transferring from the roads to the trains. Perhaps they have not heard about the improvement that has taken place, at least on the line on which I travelled.<lb/>
I now wish to jump in rather a butterfly fashion to what I considered was a rather passionate speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. He presaged his remarks by saying that he welcomed two good measures. I was rather doubtful about those two so-called good measures. I knew that one of them was a good measure, but I was not too sure about toll roads. I am still not convinced about them. However, the noble Lord made a good point in their favour. I am partially convinced that there is a role for toll roads in one instance. I was convinced of that when the noble Lord spoke about the possibility of the outer main roads into London becoming toll roads. I heartily agree with that concept because toll roads could be used to discourage people from using roads unreasonably rather than travelling by public transport. As I have said, I believe that public transport may have improved in some respects over the past few years.<lb/>
Noble Lords have mentioned the problems which they foresee as regards the level of tolls; how long we shall have to wait before they are implemented; how many there will be; and how much money will be invested in them. All of those points give rise to uncertainty. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, said, there is a strong argument for introducing toll roads in areas where one wishes to discourage people from travelling into city centres by private transport.<lb/>
I very much enjoyed the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. I feel that it is extraordinary that it is only now that a Bill is being introduced which deals with the problems of the utility companies, the roads, the Government and road users. However, the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0370"/>
<col>661</col>
noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, revealed that when he was the Minister responsible for transport some 35 years ago he wished to introduce this kind of measure. The noble Lord was tactful enough not to say who his successor was who let that measure drop. I must say that the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, was very far-sighted because 35 years ago the volume of traffic was much less than it is today and the kind of problems which we are facing now would have been much more difficult to foresee. The noble Lord must at that stage have had some inkling&#x2014;perhaps he had a dream&#x2014;of the nightmare that we face today and which the Government are rightly confronting with this legislation. We support that legislation.<lb/>
Although I agree that the Bill is long-winded, for a change it is a Bill which is easy to read. When I read it on my train journey this morning, I understood it. I felt that perhaps too many days had been allowed for the Committee stage and wondered how we could spin out the time. No doubt we shall find a way.<lb/>
I hope that I may be excused for saying a few words about the benefits of two-wheeled transport; namely, motor cycles and pedal cycles. That applies generally to the use of tolls, charges to road users and also to the state of the roads. I travel on my motor bicycle for pleasure purposes, and it is indeed still a pleasure even in this country. It is certainly a pleasure in the other countries of Europe. How differently the motor cyclist is viewed in Europe.<lb/>
It is recognised in the other countries of Europe&#x2014;and in the United States&#x2014;that the motor cycle is an environmentally friendly means of transport. The motor cycle makes significantly less impact on the surface of the road. That is at the opposite extreme to the very alarming picture which the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, painted of tanks and military vehicles chewing up the roads. The motor cycle does very little damage to the road. It is environmentally friendly. It is calculated that it causes one-tenth of the damage to the environment caused by the average motor car.<lb/>
In case I am picked up on the point, I do not say that motor cycling is a pastime which prolongs life. The insurance companies have figures which show that over the age of 24&#x2014;after the period of most danger&#x2014;one's chances of having an accident are considerably less. I am afraid that we all have to go through the period of learning to face the hazards of motor-cycling. However, if one uses the machines sensibly they are extremely agreeable. They are well-equipped and safe. They give one an enormous amount of enjoyment.<lb/>
One of the great joys of motor-cycling is that when one overtakes a motor car&#x2014;and one tries to do it legally&#x2014;one notices the expression on the driver's face. The expression on people's faces in this country, particularly in the South of England, is quite different from the expressions on the faces of drivers in France, Germany, Holland or Italy. In the South of England in the rush hour most motorists have an expression of venom on their faces, as though they were going out physically to destroy the neighbour's cat. Driving is a strain and a stress.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03838"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not want to interrupt the noble Viscount while he was in full flow; but it was not I who mentioned motor cars chewing up the road. I do not know who it was but it was not me.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03841"><member>The Viscount of Falkland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was the image of military vehicles on our roads which alarmed me.<lb/>
The debate has been interesting but perhaps a little lacking in passion. A great deal more indignation is required about the situation on our roads. Undoubtedly, the Government's proposed legislation regarding the utilities, local authorities and road users will improve matters. However, no doubt we shall return to those issues in due course in other debates because it will be a long time before we achieve a satisfactory state of affairs.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03845"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like other noble Lords, I should like to thank the Minister for his opening address. I am sure that when we read it in <i>Hansard</i> we shall find it very helpful for the next stages of the Bill. I hope that I am not giving away any secrets if I say that I understand that the Minister has promised that after the Second Reading we shall have Notes on Clauses. As one noble Lord stressed, there are 157 clauses and nine schedules in the Bill, and that will be vital when we come to the Committee stage.<lb/>
It may be recalled that during the debate on the humble Address I stressed that the Labour Party had no polemical objection to joint projects with both private and public sector finance. However, as my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis and the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, said, we have before us, in the provisions in Part I of the Bill for new private roads, another example of the piecemeal approach to transport with no consideration being given to overall transport or environmental needs. From this Dispatch Box I urge that account is taken of national and local transportation needs.<lb/>
As has already been mentioned, during my speech on the humble Address I asked whether expenditure on new roads would be in addition to the Government's road programme. I was delighted to hear the Minister say so definitely that the money will be additional.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0371"/>
<col>663</col>
Having said that, as my noble friend mentioned, since the debate on the Address many organisations have been in touch with me and other noble Lords and raised the question of additionality. The two motoring organisations, the AA and the RAC, are most concerned about the matter. The CBI, although welcoming the proposal in the Bill, stated that the contribution of the new roads will be marginal and that the Government must retain their responsibility for funding infrastructure improvements. In a note which I received today the Retail Consortium has expressed a similar view.<lb/>
That view was also expressed by the very influential Freight Transport Association. That makes it clear that the road programme must be publicly funded and not hived off piecemeal to the private sector. The association drew attention to the point raised by my noble friend, and mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, concerning the Birmingham northern relief road. The Freight Transport Association is of the opinion that any such policy would delay vitally needed road schemes and undermine the industry's confidence in the Government's commitment to their road programme.<lb/>
Clause 6 relates to the making of toll orders. Subsection (6) of the clause states that that power will be exercised by statutory instrument. However, there is no reference to whether the negative or affirmative procedure will apply. It would be helpful if, before we reach the next stage, the Minister would indicate what procedure is envisaged.<lb/>
Moreover, what consultation will there be, and with whom, for setting or increasing any toll? In connection with these toll roads, in Clause 7(3) provision is made that the highway authority (which in most cases will be the Secretary of State) will in effect determine the date on which the toll period ends. It would be helpful if the Minister can give some indication of what the Government have in mind as a possible period of a toll.<lb/>
No doubt it will be unlikely that private promoters will undertake projects which are of only local importance in urban areas. In a note today we are reminded by the Association of County Councils that local authority roads take in 96 per cent. of the national road network. Where a promoter should deal with local roads, surely the local highway authority rather than the Secretary of State should approve any proposals for roads of local importance. If that position is endorsed by the Government, will it be put into the Bill? Where the Secretary of State is not the highway authority will he have power to overrule any decision by a highway authority on a proposed concession agreement?<lb/>
What will be the degree of accountability in connection with these new roads? I suggest that highway and planning authorities&#x2014;and, where we have them, the public transport authorities&#x2014;should be consulted. They should also have a right to object to any proposal on the basis of conflict with the local transportation policies. Such a provision should be written into the Bill.<lb/>
<col>664</col>
My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis referred to the position of orange badge holders. He was strongly supported by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. Reference was made to the position of orange badge holders&#x2014;the disabled&#x2014;not only in connection with the proposed new roads but also as regards street works. I should like simply to hear from the Government&#x2014;I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance today&#x2014;that provisions in respect of the points raised by RADAR will be inserted in the Bill. It is very important that that should be done.<lb/>
Like other noble Lords, I welcome in general Parts III and IV of the Bill. I say welcome them. I could use stronger language. We waited a devil of a time for this part of the Bill to come forward. We are glad that at long last we have such legislation.<lb/>
The Minister referred to the work of the highway authorities and the utilities through the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee (which I shall refer to as the HAUC). That body, with its six working parties, has done extremely valuable work. I was pleased that the Minister praised the work not only of those who sat on the central body representing the utilities and the local authorities, but also of those who sat on the sub-committees. As president of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, I have had the privilege of seeing a number of the reports of the HAUC. I have seen only too well the amount of attention that has been given to these matters. There has also been a great degree of consensus achieved between the local authorities and the utilities. That is an important point stressed also by other noble Lords.<lb/>
The balance between road users and the utilities is a vital and critical one. Both have to be accommodated. As has been stressed in various documents and reports, the public are not only road users but also consumers of utility services. Similarly, the utilities require access to the highways in order to provide a quality service for consumers. Both the utilities and the highway authorities take the view that these parts of the Bill follow the line of the consensus achieved in their deliberations. They emphasise that the agreed package should represent a balance between the interests of the highway authorities and the utilities.<lb/>
For that reason both the utilities and the highway authorities are concerned about the provisions in Clause 67 (which appears as Clause 121 in Part IV relating to Scotland). At least I managed to find that part in the Scottish section. As one Scottish Peer said, "Why does practically the whole Bill, nearly all the clauses, have to be repeated for Scotland when one simple clause might have drawn some attention to the difference of terminology in Scottish compared with English law?". Clause 67 enables the Secretary of State to introduce a system which requires utilities to pay for occupation of the highway. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, in particular, referred to that clause.<lb/>
The Department of Transport, which generally has been helpful in all the discussions on these matters with the utilities and the highway authorities, included that suggestion in the consultation paper. It met with strong criticism from both sides on the grounds that it
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0372"/>
<col>665</col>
would upset the balance that had been achieved at the HAUC. Both the utilities and the local authorities have asked for the Bill to be amended to ensure that the provision for charging, even though it may look right in principle, as it would affect the balance achieved between the utilities and the highway authorities should be implemented only if other aspects of the Bill aimed at dealing with congestion are shown not to be working.<lb/>
We have been reminded by recent statements that the Secretary of State set up some time ago a street works advisory committee, and recently revised its composition. That committee is to advise the Secretary of State on legislation including:
<quote>"measures for subordinate legislation and codes of practice".</quote>
It is imperative that the codes of practice are in accordance with the agreed package. Clause 53 of the Bill deals with codes of practice. I hope that when the Minister replies he will confirm that before any regulations are made to deal with codes of practice or before any codes of practice are determined there will be the fullest consultation with the highway authorities and the utilities through the HAUC. It would be a tragedy if, having achieved agreement, the codes of practice should eventually vary from it.<lb/>
I was pleased to note that in his opening remarks the Minister referred to the proposed computerised street works register. The noble Lord, Lord Broadbridge, and one or two other noble Lords, referred to this matter. An important point which arises is that after a great deal of pressure, the Department of Transport agreed to finance the next stage of this important development. One can understand that the Government wish to recoup the cost. It is proposed that they do so by payments for use of the system as laid down in Clause 47(5). That provides:
<quote>"If such arrangements are made the Secretary of State may require street authorities to &#x2026; make contributions towards the cost".</quote>
I ask the Minister to confirm that both highway authorities and the utilities will be required to contribute to the cost of operating the register. The register is the crucial part of the proposals on the revision of street works. I hope that the Government will agree to amend the clause in the way that I have suggested.<lb/>
The Bill introduces provisions relating to traffic-sensitive streets. Clause 57 states that the criteria may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. Perhaps we may have some idea of the criteria to be laid down. We need a definition of a traffic-sensitive street. I gather that such streets will be designated by the street authorities. However, if the criteria are to be determined by the Secretary of State, there must be the fullest possible consultation with those concerned beforehand. If we are to have&#x2014;as I hope we shall have&#x2014;designated traffic-sensitive streets, there should be provision in the Bill also for pedestrian-sensitive streets. They are equally important for reasons that noble Lords have given.<lb/>
<col>666</col>
I hope that the Bill will be amended with regard to one other aspect. During the debate on the gracious Speech, I raised the question of direct labour organisations of highway authorities. The transfer of responsibility for reinstatement has considerable implications for the highway authority's DLOs. Noble Lords will agree that DLOs have considerable experience in reinstatement work. The local authorities have stated that the Government said that the law would be changed to enable them to tender for utility reinstatement work. If that statement is correct&#x2014;as I am sure it is&#x2014;will such provision be made in the Bill? Under the Public Utilities Street Works Act 1950, street works legislation, it was possible for highway DLOs to tender for utility work. We hope that the Bill will make such provision.<lb/>
A number of other points will arise at Committee stage. I have endeavoured to raise some of the major points. We are very critical of Part I of the Bill. We cannot see why it should be attached to the other part of the Bill on which there is general consensus. Although there is general consensus on the part relating to street works, I have raised points with which we shall wish to deal at Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03847"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have found today's debate both stimulating and instructive. The interchange of views on these two very different, but important, areas of transport policy is most welcome. I am grateful to those noble Lords who have taken the opportunity to raise so many helpful and pertinent points&#x2014;others have raised less helpful points.<lb/>
In a moment, I shall try to come back on the main points that have been made and expand a little on the Government's position. Your Lordships have also made many detailed points. I cannot guarantee to answer them all today. However, I am sure that some will arise at Committee stage.<lb/>
Noble Lords will wish to know&#x2014;I can confirm it to the noble Lord, Lord Underhill&#x2014;that full Notes on Clauses will be available in the next few days which I hope will go towards answering some of the questions that were raised today.<lb/>
Perhaps I may take the opportunity this afternoon of welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, to the Opposition Front Bench. It was his first contribution from the Front Bench other than at Question Time. I wish him many years of happiness on the Opposition Front Bench.<lb/>
The noble Lord attacked, in I thought rather intemperate style, Parts I and II of the Bill. He attacked them because they did not contribute to a so-called integrated transport policy. That is a well known shibboleth of the Labour Party. That part of the Bill is inspired by a quite different philosophy: a belief that in encouraging the provision of transport facilities by the private sector in competitive conditions it is more likely to meet the real needs of the public than an attempt to plan everything overall by government departments. It does not claim to be the total solution of our transport problems. However, it claims to contribute by harnessing the entrepreneurial
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0373"/>
<col>667</col>
and management skills of the private sector&#x2014;a concept which, until I heard the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, I thought that the new model Labour Party favoured.<lb/>
One approach that we do not need is a so-called integrated transport policy&#x2014;meaning, I suppose, a system by which the Government decide what transport services are to be provided, at what price, and what investments are to be undertaken; a system by which the Government determine what transport users need, or what the Government think they ought to need. Proponents of the integrated approach seem to consider that it will deliver trains and buses that all run on time, and so on. Plans do not make transport run to time; efficient managers do. That does not mean that we should not pursue a balanced policy between road and rail. There are many sterile arguments about favouring one or the other. Both of them have strengths and important contributions to make. I remind noble Lords only of the substantial investment that the Government are putting into the railway system which I announced in the debate on the Queen's Speech&#x2014;the largest programme for 30 years.<lb/>
I was amazed to hear the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, say that Parts I and II of the Bill were intended to give a financial bonus to firms of private contractors. They are intended to transfer to them the risk in exchange for the prospect of profit. It is now all too often the taxpayer who bears all the risk.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis, and Lord Tordoff, were not convinced that the environment was not safe in the private sector's hands. However, the same high standards will be required for private sector schemes as for public schemes. The law will require full environmental impact assessments. Moreover, the promoter will have a strong interest in making his scheme acceptable to the public. The Secretary of State, in considering the total scale of road provision, both public and private, will take full account of environmental considerations. It will be possible for environmental issues to be considered at inquiries just as it is for public roads. A formal environmental impact assessment will be required. Nothing less than the high requirement for a public scheme will be accepted. One of the aspects that the Secretary of State will consider in any competition held for a concession will be the environmental standard of the tenderer's proposals.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, asked whether we had consulted the European Community Commission on the proposals. We sent it the Green Paper, <i>New Roads by New Means.</i> It expressed its satisfaction that in accordance with Community law we would require open competition advertised in the EC official journal before letting concessions. As the noble Lord will know, there is much experience of toll road concessions in several European countries. He may also be interested to know that considerable interest has been shown by European firms as part of a consortia in competing for these concessions.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, my noble friend Lord Lucas of Chilworth, and the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, and others, mentioned the subject of
<col>668</col>
additionality. As I made clear, I hope, in my opening speech, privately financed roads will not be subtracted from the public programme on a scheme-by-scheme basis. However, it would not be practical for us to give an open-ended commitment to maintain the public programme at its present level or any given level. In practice private schemes will provide the opportunity for more roads than would otherwise have been built. My noble friend Lady Blatch stated that more briefly in her concluding remarks the other day.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said that tolling might be impractical. However, experience in France and elsewhere, and on estuarial crossings in this country, give the lie to the idea that tolling is impractical. I am pretty confident that automatic systems will develop to eliminate queues entirely, in particular since the private sector will have a financial incentive to do so.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Underhill, and my noble friend Lord Swinfen raised the issue of orange badge holders being exempt from paying tolls on proposed toll roads. Clause 12 provides for toll orders to exempt a class of traffic from paying tolls. That would cover the issue raised by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, about military vehicles. The operator can make further exemptions. However, I must admit that it is not self-evider t that orange badge holders should be exempt from tolls on all privately-financed roads, especially when an alternative free road is available. The example quoted by my noble friend was that of the estuarial crossings, which are different.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, talked of a two-tier system of public and toll roads. The Government will continue to maintain all existing trunk roads to their current high standards, irrespective of the proximity of a privately-financed road. Publicly-funded free trunk roads will not be allowed to deteriorate. Where a scheme to improve a publicly-financed motorway or all-purpose trunk road is already in the programme, work on that scheme will continue and will not be suspended just because a privately-financed proposal is being worked up in the vicinity. If a scheme in the programme is replaced by a privately-financed scheme, as with the Birmingham northern relief road, the resources released by that decision will be available to take forward other schemes in the public sector road programme.<lb/>
In deciding in future reviews of the road programme whether a new scheme not currently in the programme should be added to it the Government will take account of the extent to which the traffic will be catered for by any proposed privately-financed scheme. As we know, public sector resources for road improvements are not infinite. It is not unreasonable to expect road users to pay for the additional infrastructure by toll.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Tordoff and Lord Clinton-Davis, suggested that tolls on near monopoly roads should be regulated. But the concept of a near monopoly, other than an estuarial crossing, would be impossible to define. That is why the Bill only seeks to define monopolies and restricts them to estuarial
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0374"/>
<col>669</col>
crossings. We do not believe that in practice overland routes will constitute monopolies. In any case, the aim of the initiative is to bring market forces to bear on roads provision. The regulation of tolls would unnecessarily hamper the operation of privately-financed toll roads and could deter potential promoters. The Government have removed price control elsewhere in the economy. Why should they introduce it here? The competitive pressure of alternative routes will adequately protect the road user. If a toll operator attempted to charge too high a toll for a road, nobody would use it.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, referred to the length of time taken by public inquiries into road proposals. I sympathise with his frustration about especially prolonged inquiries after the important points have been covered. But to restrict the opportunity that citizens of this country have to probe and argue about the routes taken by roads would be unacceptable. I do not believe that it would be acceptable to require objectors to prove some direct interest in the proposal; nor would it greatly speed things up. To challenge the locus would add to the acrimony.<lb/>
I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, in particular for his reminiscences as Minister of Transport some 35 years ago. He asked where further toll concessionary roads might be. The Dartford bridge is now under construction and on time for opening next year. The hybrid Bill for the second Severn crossing will be introduced in another place shortly. Competition for the Birmingham northern relief road and the Birmingham-Manchester corridor is under way. If all goes according to plan in Scotland a privately-financed bridge could be opened to traffic during 1994.<lb/>
My right honourable friend consulted the private sector and others about six further possibilities, including three estuarial crossings and two roads in Essex. In Scotland, consultations on a fast link between the M.8 and the M.74 are continuing. I hope that when Parliament gives the green light to the Bill the private sector will produce more ideas at which we can look carefully. The two ideas that we have floated for roads in Essex will help commuters. However, at present we are not considering privately-financed roads or any other major new road construction to encourage cars to go into central London.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter criticised the length of the Bill and the style of the drafting. I believe that he was a little unfair to the draftsmen. Separate provision applies to Scotland; of the 156 clauses, 70 refer to Scotland. Unfortunately, its law is slightly different and requires a separate part of the Bill and therefore a number of extra clauses were necessary. However, the street works provisions in Part III do considerably more than replace the 1950 Act, and at shorter length than that Act.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Swinfen asked whether toll roads could be described as public highways. There is ample precedent for toll roads being regarded in law as public highways from the days of the turnpikes onwards. The major estuarial crossings are all
<col>670</col>
highways, and roads authorised by this Bill in England and Wales will be highways and in Scotland public roads, which are similar. The police will have exactly the same powers on those roads as on any others.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, asked about statutory instruments. Clause 6(6) provides that schemes should be made or confirmed by statutory instrument; there is no parliamentary procedure. That corresponds to the provision of the Highways Act 1980. Parliamentary scrutiny is not usual for local orders since it would duplicate the intense scrutiny of the public inquiry.<lb/>
If the private sector responds to the opportunities which the first part of the Bill offers we can look forward to a better deal for the road user; urgently-needed infrastructure produced more quickly and more responsibly. I am not surprised that the welcome given to that part of the Bill is more hesitant. Many of the private sector bodies to which my right honourable friend the Minister for Roads and Traffic was talking are saying that private finance is a good idea but if it is to succeed the Government must grant exclusive rights, allow shadow tolls or provide Exchequer grants. We listen carefully to what they say and remain of the view that none of those ideas is desirable or necessary. All would detract from the prime purpose of the initiative, which is, in the words of the Green Paper <i>New Roads by New Means,</i> to harness the entrepreneurial, financial and management skills of the private sector to the provision of roads and to see genuine private sector ventures with appropriate risks and rewards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03848"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister moves to the second part of the Bill can he reply to the second part of my question? I asked about the criteria under which the payback time for roads would be determined. In other words, how will it be determined when a licence must finish?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03849"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the case of estuarial crossings or monopoly situations, that would be up to the potential concessionaire to consider when coming forward with his proposals. If there were a competition among different potential concessionaires for a particular proposal, that would be one of the aspects taken into account. Although not a precise comparison, the Channel Tunnel has a concession period of 55 years.<lb/>
I turn now to the street work provisions. I believe that they will be well received by the country as well as your Lordships. New standards for the training of workmen, the signing and guarding of works in progress and the quality of the reinstatement of roads by utilities are all long overdue, as noble Lords have said.<lb/>
The Bill will provide a framework under which better co-ordination and improved standards can be achieved in practice. If the utilities and local highway authorities respond as positively to the challenge of the Bill as they have to the development of the proposals in the Horne Report, we may look forward to a real improvement in the service which they offer to the public. That must be good news for the road
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0375"/>
<col>671</col>
user, whether he be on foot, on two or four wheels; for the utilities and their customers; and for the highway authorities and their charge payers.<lb/>
Perhaps the most controversial issue in this part of the Bill&#x2014;and one which has been referred to by a number of noble Lords including the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, who was very much supported by my noble friend Lord Nugent&#x2014;is the inclusion of Clause 67. Utility street works and building works undoubtedly impose costly delays upon traffic. Although much of that disruption is unavoidable and as customers of the utilities we often benefit from the work which caused it, unnecessarily long or frequent disruption to road users can and must be avoided. For that reason we have included in Clause 67 a requirement for undertakers of works to pay a prescribed fee for their occupation of the highway to the highway authority.<lb/>
The Secretary of State would only prescribe a charging scheme if he was satisfied that such a financial incentive was necessary to reduce the amount of disruption caused by utility works on the most traffic-sensitive streets. A scheme could be structured so that the great majority of works not causing any more obstruction than was reasonably necessary would escape charges altogether.<lb/>
As regards the lost revenue from parking meters, I assure the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, that there is no proposal to provide for compensation in such cases.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Underhill, and my noble friends Lord Swinfen and Lord Brougham and Vaux referred to the needs of the blind and the disabled in this part of the Bill. The new framework for street works will mean substantial reductions in the dangers which arise in the carrying out of works and as a result of poor reinstatements. I believe that that will be especially welcome to more vulnerable road users, including disabled people. I draw particular attention to the improved standards for the signing and guarding of works to be prescribed under Clause 58 and the new performance standards for reinstatement to be prescribed under Clause 64. Groups representing disabled people have been consulted on the development of detailed proposals in those areas and their views will be taken fully into account when the relevant standards are eventually prescribed.<lb/>
I agree with noble Lords that the street works register should be a most useful new source of information to road users with mobility difficulties. We shall certainly explore how best the information can be put to use.<lb/>
I was most grateful for the warm welcome from my noble friend Lord Nugent to the Bill as a whole and in particular to this part of the Bill. I know of the great interest which he has taken in this particular subject for many years. I welcome his interest in the development of a reliable and comprehensive record of utilities apparatus. We shall certainly encourage the use of new technology to facilitate that. However, as my noble friend acknowledged, it will take several years to build up a complete record. A street works
<col>672</col>
register is not dependent on map-based data and we should have an effective computerised register in place in time for the implementation of the Bill's provisions.<lb/>
A number of noble Lords referred to the definition of emergency works as being too restrictive and to the statutory duty on utilities to restore supply of their services. We recognise the anxiety expressed by some utilities that the new definition of emergency works in Clause 46 could be so tightly drawn that the requirement to serve advance notice for other non-emergency works would result in a substantial loss to the utility or breach of a service obligation. Inevitably there will be some utility works where it will not be reasonable to expect that seven working days' notice given before beginning works as required under Clause 49. It is proposed to deal with cases which fall short of being immediate emergencies by prescribing appropriate lesser periods of advance notice or making exemptions from notice requirements and regulations.<lb/>
Similarly, as regards the restriction in Clause 52 on works for 12 months, provision can be made either with the agreement of the highway authority or by regulations to allow suitable exemptions to be made. Customers will not have to wait months for supplies.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Platt of Writtle referred to the need for better information for drivers on delays and disruption. The Bill will provide for better signs and information about street works but not about more general road works or other sources of delay. However, the Government attach great importance to the improvement of the quality and timeliness of information about road conditions and are working on that directly and in association with other providers of information.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Nugent and the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, were particularly interested to encourage the use of the no-dig trenchless technology. We shall continue to encourage the use of so-called trenchless methods of construction and maintenance. Various techniques now available to bore under roads cause far less disruption to traffic and less damage to the road surface than conventional trenching. Noble Lords have paid tribute to the efforts of British Gas in particular in that field. I endorse that.<lb/>
As the technology becomes more reliable and cost-effective, we may expect it to be: increasingly preferred by the utilities. The measures in this Bill, in particular restrictions on the time and place of utility works, should increase the incentive to employ trenchless options where the benefits are greatest. As noble Lords pointed out, Clause 67, in imposing charges for the occupation of road space, would introduce a further incentive to adopt techniques which involve less disruption.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked that highway authorities should co-ordinate their own works. I am pleased to confirm that the new duty on highway authorities to co-ordinate works applies to works of all kinds on roads for which they are
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0376"/>
<col>673</col>
responsible. It extends also explicitly to co-ordination with other highway authorities where work on one authority's roads affects those of another.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Broadbridge, talked about the needs of cyclists. I am grateful to him for his wishes that I should have a puncture-free journey. The Government accepted the recommendation of the Horne Report that the performance standard for reinstatements should take full account of the safety needs of cyclists following reinstatements, and that in particular potholes, ridges and sharp edges are potentially very dangerous for cyclists. In prescribing new standards under Clause 64, attention will be given to the special needs of road users on two wheels. That applies also to motorised two-wheelers which were referred to by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Lucas asked about management accountability for street works. The Bill will make the consequences of the undertaker's responsibilities in the promotion of his works much clearer than it is now. A series of criminal sanctions have been included tied to breach of duty on the part of the undertaker. Clause 151 on offences sets out the circumstances in which directors, managers or officers of corporate bodies can be personally proceeded against and punished accordingly.<lb/>
My noble friend asked also about Crown immunity and Clause 152. That is a standard provision included in Bills of this kind. In practice there will be no question of different rules applying on trunk roads for which the Secretary of State is the highway authority
<col>674</col>
to those applying on local roads. I am not sure if that completely answers the point raised by my noble friend, but I shall look at what he said in more detail.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, talked about the agreed package. I am happy to confirm that there will be full consultation with representatives of the utilities and highway authorities before the various regulations and codes of practice are made or approved.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked also about the street works register. I am happy to confirm that those who use the register will pay, by way of fees on transactions, to meet the costs of operating that register.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked finally about direct labour organisations being allowed to tender for the work. In their original response to the Horne Report, the Government accepted that although local authorities would no longer have the statutory right to supervise utility works or carry out the permanent reinstatement, they would continue to be able to tender for utility reinstatement works if they wished. That remains the position, and suitable provision will be made.<lb/>
I trust that I have answered most of the anxieties expressed by noble Lords. I appreciate that in the time available I have not been able to go through every single point raised. As I said, we shall come back to many of them in Committee and I trust that your Lordships will therefore agree to give the Bill a Second Reading.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.<lb/>
House adjourned at half past six o'clock.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Eastern Europe: Trade</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03852"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03853">What further encouragement they are giving to British firms to increase business with Eastern Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03854"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office (Lord Strathclyde)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government seek to help British companies to explore opportunities in Eastern Europe by including businessmen in ministerial visits; by providing advice on changing trading conditions and legislation; and, where possible, information on specific opportunities. The most recent initiative was the publication earlier this month of a free introductory guide on trading with Central and Eastern Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03855"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that reply. Are the Government satisfied that Britain is doing as much as other western countries with the objects, first, of giving crucial support to the economies of certain Eastern European countries, and, secondly, of increasing our international trade?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03856"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the promotion of exports we can never afford to be totally confident that we are doing enough. The Government are doing their bit. They are continually reviewing the support which they offer to exporters and they believe that in the long term the future will be good.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03857"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the revised arrangements for the Export Credits Guarantee Department, which were announced in the gracious Speech, place British firms at no disadvantage in relation to their competitors in this market?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03858"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03859"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister be kind enough to confirm that British companies are very badly placed and are seriously lagging behind our industrial competitors in regard to trade with Eastern Europe at the present time? In order to remedy that situation, are the Government taking a positive attitude towards recent European Commission initiatives to stimulate the European Community's reinsurance pool to assist export credit insurance and other initiatives that have been taken to stimulate investment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03860"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the question of money from the European Community, we play a full part in the PHARE programme which is currently worth some 500 million ecus. On the know-how fund,
<col>676</col>
we have a good record of increasing the amount of finance going to Eastern Europe. The noble Lord asks about exports. Over the past year exports to the USSR have increased by 30 per cent. and are up by 22 per cent. in the first seven months of this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03861"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that if someone suggests that British industry is lagging behind its competitors he ought to produce evidence to show that that is so? My noble friend's figures seem to give the opposite message.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03862"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is typical of the Opposition to talk down British industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03863"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, far from talking down British industry, which was a rather trite and cheap comment, is it not a fact that we all have an interest in seeking to stimulate British industry? Is it not a fact that, as concerns trade with Ea stern Europe, British companies are lagging in eighth place compared with other Western European countries? Will the Minister reply specifically to the question that I asked? The European Commission has recently proposed a number of valuable initiatives which deal with export credit and investment. What is the Government's attitude with regard to those initiatives?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03864"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord did not hear what I said in my original answer to him. The European Community has the PHARE programme in which we play a full part.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03865"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to the question of my noble friend Lord Harmar-Nicholls, can my noble friend confirm that there is no evidence that we are lagging behind our competitors in this regard? With respect to the noble Lord opposite, that is a wanton allegation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03866"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with my noble friend. Exporters can always do more to increase their exports. This Government are involved in trying to provide the right economic conditions in this country so that they can do so. But all European countries have difficulties in exporting to Eastern Europe, mainly because Eastern European countries have little hard currency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03867"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the Commission has made a number of specific proposals which were published on 16th November? It would not be proper for me to go into them in detail, which I could do. I am quite prepared to pass them to the Minister. Will he answer the question put by my noble friend? Do the Government subscribe to these proposals, and are they cooperating within the Commission to make sure that they are implemented?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03868"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a whole range of trade and economic co-operation agreements have been signed with each individual country of Eastern Europe. They provide for greater access to the Common Market. We support the proposals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03869"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord give any detail of how we are encouraging the teaching of English where we are pushing at an open door? Is that not a marked way of increasing British exports?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0378"/>
<col>677</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03870"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Viscount. The United Kingdom was the first to announce bilateral assistance with the establishment of &#x00A3;75 million in the know-how fund. That is specifically aimed at helping Eastern European countries to help themselves in respect of marketing initiatives, learning the language and building up business skills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03871"><member>Lord Kearton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware of the excellent work being done by the Eastern European Trade Council under the chairmanship of Dr. Norman Wooding?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03872"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that that organisation and the gentleman to whom the noble Lord has referred are well known to the Department of Trade and Industry.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Primary Schools: Grant-maintained Status</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03873">2.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03874"><member>Lord Stallard</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03875">Whether they will ensure that any publicity that they publish advising primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils of their right to seek grant-maintained status will be balanced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03876"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science wrote to all primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils last month letting them know that they are now eligible to apply for grant-maintained status. The letter made clear that each application received by the Secretary of State will be decided on its merits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03877"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. However, does she recall the concern expressed by the secretary of the Conservative-controlled Association of County Councils about the Government's booklet on grant-maintained schools entitled <i>Questions Parents Ask?</i> The booklet does not appear to present a balanced account of the pros and cons of grant-maintained schools. It almost strays beyond the proper domain of explanation and information and into the realms of value judgment. Is she also aware that the letter which she mentioned, and which I have read, does nothing to mollify those concerns? What is needed now is an unbiased, revised version of the booklet and another such booklet dealing with schools which are maintained by local authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03878"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I speak from the Dispatch Box in order to defend the Government on such matters, not to defend individuals on the basis of hearsay or statements made outside this Chamber. There is a great deal of biased literature in this matter which does not emanate from the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03879"><member>Lord Gainford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend join me in congratulating the parents, teachers and staff of the Cwmcarn School, which is the first school in Wales to gain grant-maintained status? Is she aware that this
<col>678</col>
school is situated in the constituency of the right honourable Member for Islwyn, whose party seems to be bent on abolishing grant-maintained status?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03880"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of the details of the school. But I know that the policy of that party is to abolish grant-maintained status. We believe that grant-maintained status extends choice and it has certainly improved satisfaction with those schools; indeed, they are oversubscribed. We believe that the number of grant-maintained schools is growing sufficiently for it to be a very adverse policy if the Labour Party should ever consider its abolition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03881"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say how many eligible primary schools&#x2014;that is, those with more than 300 pupils&#x2014;have asked to become grant-maintained?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03882"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we know that primary schools have applied for details about becoming grant-maintained but we do not know of any particular primary school which has had a ballot on the prospect of becoming grant-maintained. However, that is no reason why they should not be granted the right under the law to be considered along with any other application should they wish to apply for grant-maintained status.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03883"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the Minister is saying that not a single primary school out of the 3,000 with over 300 pupils has applied for or been granted grant-maintained status. If that is the case, how can she possibly claim that applying for grant-maintained status and obtaining it is so popular among governing bodies, head teachers and parents in primary schools?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03884"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that where grant-maintained status has been granted it has proved to be very popular&#x2014;so popular in fact that all grant-maintained schools are oversubscribed. I was not specifically relating my remarks to primary schools. We do not see any reason why primary schools, should they wish to apply, should not be free to do so. They will be given serious consideration should we receive an application.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03885"><member>The Earl of Shrewsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend condemn the actions of Bolton Metropolitan Council, which has banned pupils from the grant-maintained St.James's School from using the council's swimming baths?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03886"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly join my noble friend in condemning any action which either thwarts the application for grant-maintained status or applies a vindictive policy against a school that wishes to become grant-maintained. We know of many such examples, and that is only one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03887"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness kindly inform the House what possible relevance that has to the Question on the Order Paper?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03888"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the grant-maintained scheme is one of the biggest pieces of nonsense introduced by this Government? It makes utter nonsense of the local authority system. Further, will she make quite clear to these schools that they will all be returned to the local
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0379"/>
<col>679</col>
authority system after the next election? There will certainly be a change of Government because the country is fed up with this one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03889"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I profoundly disagree with the noble Lord's views about grant-maintained status. Grant-maintained status improves choice for both children and parents. It makes better use of central funds, it frees local schools and it allows them to make decisions at a local level. Where schools have been awarded grant-maintained status, they are highly popular with parents and students. Where they have been established, they are oversubscribed in every single case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03890"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that she is referring to secondary schools, whereas the Question refers to primary schools? I understand from what she said that no primary school has achieved grant-maintained status as yet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03891"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only repeat that, because this has proved to be so popular in the secondary sector, we see no reason to restrict the freedom of a primary school should it wish to apply. Noble Lords opposite would not only restrict primary schools from becoming grant-maintained; they would also abolish the secondary schools which have already achieved grant-maintained status. We are simply saying that we believe that the maximum amount of freedom should be allowed under the law. We will support any primary school application which comes before the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Bophuthatswana</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03892">2.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03893"><member>Lord Gisborough</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03894">How many tribal murders have been reported in South Africa in the last three years and, of those, how many were in Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03895"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there have been about 5,700 deaths in South Africa between January 1987 and September 1990 as a result of communal unrest of all kinds, including some 65 deaths in Bophuthatswana.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03896"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Does it not indicate the benefit of the one-tribe state where inhabitants can live without the constant fear of inter-tribal riot and murder? Will he do all that he can to ensure that the views of the democratically elected Government of Bophuthatswana are taken fully into account in the constitutional talks, and that a deal affecting Bophuthatswana is not concluded by de Klerk and Mandela over their heads?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03897"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not say that Bophuthatswana was noticeably more peaceful than South Africa. A state of emergency is still in force in Bophuthatswana, whereas it has been lifted elsewhere in South Africa. There have been many recent detentions without trial and political demonstrators were killed earlier this year. With regard to the second half of my noble friend's question, we hope that the people of Bophuthatswana will have the opportunity
<col>680</col>
to make their views known during the negotiations on South Africa's future. President Mangope has already requested talks with Nelson Mandela and has spoken of participating in wider constitutional negotiations. That is a positive development.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03898"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that political violence in South Africa is damaging the prospects of a settlement between the ANC and the South African Government, and that the evidence shows that it is wrong to seek to lay the blame on the ANC? Were those matters discussed in the talks between the Prime Minister and Chief Buthelezi a few days ago? If so, what recommendations or advice did the right honourable Lady proffer to the Chief?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03899"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we deplore the tragic deaths and violence that have occurred, whatever their source. There is a heavy responsibility on all sides to show restraint and to maintain peaceful progress towards negotiations. The meeting between my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and Chief Buthelezi in London on 15th November was part of an ongoing dialogue. It was agreed that there is an urgent need to end violence and to maintain momentum towards constitutional negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03900"><member>Lord St. John of Bletso</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while most of us oppose the separate development and homeland policy in South Africa, does the Minister agree that, when a constitution for all South Africans is negotiated, all political leaders, including the homeland leaders, should be included in those talks?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03901"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we believe that all genuine political leaders should be involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03902"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although Her Majesty's Government must be wary of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries&#x2014;far too common a vice nowadays&#x2014;does the Minister nevertheless agree that where there is a mixture of tribes, races, languages and culture, a loose federal structure with maximum local self-determination is greatly preferable to a tightly knit unitary structure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03903"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not up to the Government to prescribe what should be the solution in South Africa. The details should be decided by the South Africans themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03904"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend said the population of Bophuthatswana would be consulted, but then he went on to talk about genuine leaders as if Mr. Mangope was not a genuine leader. Does he consider that the ANC leaders, who have never been elected, are more representative of their tribe than is Mangope, who was democratically elected in Bophuthatswana?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03905"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that I could give no assurance, but that we hoped that the people of Bophuthatswana would have the opportunity to make their views known. The democratic process in Bophuthatswana is open to some question. For example, at present all opposition parties are banned. As regards the ANC, I can say only that the ANC is

<col>681</col>
the principal focus for black opinion in South Africa, but of course it is not the only one and a settlement will have to take account of the views of others.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03906"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to the Minister's reply to his noble friend, does he agree that the chief objective is to have free and fair elections in South Africa in which ANC members can have an opportunity to stand?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Forestry Planting</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03908">2.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03909"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03910">What are the latest figures of forestry planting, both private and public, including the farm woodlands scheme; and how they compare with government targets.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03911"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some 19,500 hectares of new planting were recorded in the year to 31st March 1990. That included 2,600 hectares of planting under the farm woodland scheme and 4,100 hectares of planting by the commission. That compares with a general government aim of 33,000 hectares of new planting a year. In addition, we allowed for the planting of a total of 33,000 hectares in Great Britain under the experimental farm woodland scheme over a three-year period from October 1988.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03912"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. May I bring him up to date with the planting figures to September 1990? The figures for the private sector are 12,000 hectares and for the Forestry Commission 4,000 hectares, making a total of 16,000 hectares, as against the Government's target of 33,000 hectares. As the Minister responsible for trade as well as forestry&#x2014;I congratulate him upon his versatility&#x2014;does he accept that reducing imports is as important as encouraging exports? Does he also accept that the figure for timber imports this year is approaching &#x00A3;7 billion? Encouraging domestic forestry could make a sizeable contribution to the balance of payments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03913"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are not in the business of closing off a perfectly free market. Perhaps I may remind noble Lords that over the past 10 years we have seen 250,000 hectares of new planting undertaken in Great Britain. That is probably more than has been done by any other country in relation to its size to expand its forestry contribution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03914"><member>Lord Stodart of Leaston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware of the statement made on Friday by the chairman of the Scottish Landowners' Confederation to the effect that he had had to pay off five employees at Kinloch Laggan as a result of the squeeze imposed by the Government's revamped forestry policy? In view of the grave effect that this will have on the rural economy will he endeavour to have that policy revamped?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03915"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said, our record over the past 10 years in expanding forestry has
<col>682</col>
been good. There is currently a hiccup affecting the increase in new tree planting, but we hope that this activity will continue to provide a long-term and viable contribution to the rural economy across the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03916"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that between 1970 and 1979 average private planting in this country amounted to 18,000 or 19,000 hectares, and that this was matched by the Forestry Commission which planted 18,500 hectares? To say that the Government have increased wood production is absolute nonsense. Will the noble Lord consider stopping the dramatic curtailment of the Forestry Commission's affairs in relation to wood production and the selling of trees and land? That took place in 1979 when the Government came into office. If they would stop that policy and let the Forestry Commission have its head again the Government might have some hope of reaching their target.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03917"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord talks about the planting record of the 1970s. We changed the tax regime in 1988 because trees were seen as a tax haven rather than as providing a viable economic future for the countryside. We gave the Forestry Commission a free rein to look after its own affairs. However, the commission is not there for its own sake, to be subsidised to a huge extent by the taxpayer. It has to be viable, like any other industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03918"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the regime of 1988 dictated that the only trees worth planting now are sitka spruce which do not require further maintenance? Is he satisfied that the later rules will give some chance to grow the hardwoods which are demanded by the greens and to carry out all the management necessary to keep them in good condition?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03919"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. I am glad to say that since the tax regime was changed we have seen a tremendous upswing in the amount of broadleaved planting. Last year more than 5,000 hectares were planted. That is a tenfold increase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03920"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do the Government propose to reinstate maintenance grants and, if so, when?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03921"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes. We are introducing management grants from 1992. We will keep the grant levels under review.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03922"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has given figures for planting over the past two decades. Can he give some idea of how employment has fared in the forestry industry over that period? His noble friend Lord Stodart mentioned that five jobs were lost in a certain area. Knowing some of these areas, I believe that five jobs are important. It would be interesting to compare the figures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03923"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not brought any figures for employment in the forestry industry in Scotland. However, it is common knowledge that the industry plays a great part in the economy of rural areas. The loss of jobs is not desirable. That is why in the long term we hope to see a recovery in the price of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0381"/>
<col>683</col>
timber. There has been tremendous investment in down-the-line production in the past few years. That will he useful in providing a long-term future for the rural economy, particularly in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03924"><member>Lord Dulverton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend in possession of the comparative costs to the Exchequer of the tax which private foresters would have been able to reclaim when that incentive to forestry was in operation and the costs of the increased planting and management grants under the present system? The system is not proving a success in terms of reaching the Government's target for new planting. Is it possible to produce such figures applicable to last year's planting which I understood amounted to 14,000 hectares against the Government's hoped for 33,000 hectares?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03925"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I shall be able to give the noble Lord a substantive reply by way of letter, a copy of which will be placed in the Library. Very roughly, in the past year available tax relief was equivalent to &#x00A3;10 million: planting of 28,000 hectares would give a grant figure also of about &#x00A3;10 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03926"><member>Lord Moore of Wolvercote</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that in south east England there are still large areas of woodland uncleared following the devastation of the hurricane of October 1987? This is due to the high cost of clearance. Will the Government consider helping woodland owners with the clearance costs so that the lovely woods in Kent and Sussex can be replanted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03927"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all well aware of the dreadful devastation that took place in October 1987. Immediately afterwards, the Government gave careful consideration to the help that would be most appropriate to those who had suffered. The conclusion reached was that priority had to be given to the replacement of trees that had been blown down. A considerable extra grant&#x2014;an increase of 60 per cent. on the normal planting grant&#x2014;was handed out. I believe that the Government have been fair in respect of those people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03928"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister explain&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03929"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how can the Minister&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03930"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that both noble Lords can ask a question at the same time. We have had a good run round this course and I suggest that one of the two noble Lords asks a question. As the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, has already done so, perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, might put the last question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03931"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how can the Minister be so complacent in saying, as his predecessor said, that the target is 33,000 hectares when last year total planting was 17,000 hectares? Is he aware that this was believed by only two groups: first, the nursery men who thought that they had a market but had to destroy over 50 million young trees last year because of the decline in the planting programme; and secondly, the processors who invested &#x00A3;1 billion in the wood processing industries
<col>684</col>
on the assumption that domestic supplies would be available? They will not be available as long as our targets are not met.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03932"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not the least bit complacent. I have admitted that there has been a temporary downturn in the amount of planting. We are always prepared to listen to the industry; we talk regularly, not just to the Forestry Commission but to representatives of the private sector as well. The introduction of management grants in April 1992 will make a considerable difference. We shall see a return to the high levels of planting seen in the past.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Investment in Education</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03934">3.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03935"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member> rose to call attention to the case for increased investment in education and higher quality provision at all stages in the education system; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03936">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, perhaps I may begin by saying how much we look forward to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior. I believe there are no other vets in the House, and a House which has a strong interest not just in dogs but in other animals will surely benefit greatly from his expertise over the years to come.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03937">The Opposition has chosen to make education the subject of the first Labour debate of the Session because of the growing public concern about the lack of investment in this vitally important service and concern about the quality of much of today's provision. There can be no doubt that education is very high on the political agenda. There can also be no doubt that the Government's own attempts at reform are in a shambles. Government policies on education are ill thought out, incoherent, inconsistent and in many respects impossible to implement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03938">Only last week we saw the scrapping of one of the Government's most cherished schemes&#x2014;a scheme which we on the Labour side said was both daft and damaging from the beginning; that is, privately funded city technology colleges. Only a couple of weeks ago the universities learnt that the bidding system for funds, invented by the Government but implemented by the Universities Funding Council, was collapsing. A couple of months ago the then Secretary of State had to announce a retreat from the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0382"/>
<col>685</col>
Government's targets on the testing of seven year-olds. Hardly a week goes by without some new climb-down.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03939">The future of a generation of children and young people is being threatened by the Government's mismanagement of education and their failure to provide the necessary resources. We are falling behind our European neighbours and the United States and Japan. This cannot go on without jeopardising our future prosperity. It cannot go on without wasting talent and leaving hundreds of thousands of people feeling frustrated and unfulfilled because the education system has failed them. There is only one way out of the morass we are now in. That is the election of a Labour Government&#x2014;we shall not have to wait too long for one&#x2014;who will sweep away the gimmicks of the last but one Secretary of State for Education and replace them with a coherent programme to expand opportunities and raise standards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03940">I wish to start with the Government's failure to invest in education. In a period in which the windfall of oil revenues provided the Government with a unique opportunity which no other government have had, spending on education fell from 5.5 per cent. of GDP to 4.8 per cent. To say that rolls are falling will not do. We threw away a golden opportunity to expand and improve the education service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03941">The Government will no doubt say that per capita spending on pupils went up over the period by over 40 per cent. However, that will not do either. That figure largely represents higher average costs due to falling rolls and a failure to take surplus places out of the system. It does not represent higher spending on books, equipment, facilities, the maintenance of buildings or extracurricular activities. In all those areas, as many parents will confirm, provision has become worse. But the Government's claim will not do for another reason. It is a measure of spending on those in the system but it masks the failure to invest in nursery education, further education for 16 to 19 year-olds or higher education so that those who are currently outside the system without places can get into it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03942">The Government may also try to excuse their past failures with claims that the latest expenditure plans represent a substantial increase in spending on education. However, that will not do either. To catch up on the lack of investment over the past decade will require the investment of much more money sustained over a number of years. In any case the few additional morsels that Mr. MacGregor extracted from the Treasury as his final contribution to education before being moved on do not add up to very much.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03943">First, the extra &#x00A3;670 million may well be eaten up by inflation. The Government predict that inflation will fall to a level of 5.5 per cent. by the end of 1991. Even if we accept that somewhat optimistic prediction, the average level of inflation for next year could not be much less than 7 per cent. If it is much more than that, any volume increase will soon be whittled away. In any case little of the extra money
<col>686</col>
will be used in day-to-day spending on schools and colleges. Many will face no-growth budgets next year. Some money will go into higher education and some will go into capital spending on schools but both those items require far more investment. The sums available this year will not even scratch the surface of the &#x00A3;4 billion backlog on buildings and their repair. The extra money for higher education is quite insufficient to expand student numbers and maintain quality.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03944">I shall now turn to the most important resource in education, which is our teachers. Here the situation is little short of disastrous. Some one in three teachers who start training have left the profession five years after qualification, yet we hear the Minister of State responsible for schools talking about the importance he attaches to getting bad teachers out of the schools. It might make more sense if he focused his attention first on how to keep good teachers in the schools. Unless we achieve that we shall never get rid of the bad ones because every pair of hands, however feeble, will be needed to keep the system going.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03945">The number of vacant posts in both primary and secondary schools has gone up substantially over the past three years. Department of Education and Science figures for 1990 revealed 6,500 vacancies. Moreover, in key subjects such as science, mathematics and modern languages, teachers who are not qualified in those subjects have been drafted in to teach them. There can be no disagreement that this is bound to lead to a decline in quality. It is an appalling indictment that more than half of mathematics and physics teachers do not have a post A-level qualification in those subjects.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03946">If drastic action is not taken, the crisis in teacher supply seems likely to get worse. How many of us can claim that we know talented, able young people who want to be teachers? I suspect that few of us know such people. Young people perceive the job as demanding yet poorly paid and lacking in status. We must devise measures to raise the status of the profession and attract more able recruits. It is also urgent to find ways to stem the flow of young teachers out of the profession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03947">In the past 11 years there has been far too much criticism of teachers from the Government side and far too little constructive thinking about how to create a stable and high quality profession. What is tragic about that failure is that it is the most disadvantaged pupils in our inner cities who suffer most from teacher shortages and high turnover as their schools rely most on young teachers. No Tory Minister would want his children taught by temporary or unqualified staff. However, such people always buy their way out of the system into private schools. Mr. Clarke, the new Secretary of State for Education, says that he is committed to our public services. That may be the case but he is not committed enough to use the state schools for his own children.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03948">The state of our school buildings is another blatant example of the Government's failure to invest. Buildings with leaking roofs and crumbling paint create a miserable environment in which to work for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0383"/>
<col>687</col>
both pupils and teachers. It is shocking to read the senior chief inspector's findings in his report for 1988&#x2013;89 where he states:
<quote>"In two-thirds of the secondary schools inspected the accommodation was unsatisfactory. In just under half of these there were serious problems".</quote>
He makes it clear that the state of our school buildings and the facilities in them will have adverse effects on the implementation of the national curriculum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03949">The Select Committee on Education in its report of July of this year is sceptical that the Government's objectives in this area will be achieved. It recommends that the DES should set minimum standards; identify those schools falling below them; agree with LEAs' target dates for bringing them up to standard and make the resources available to carry this out. I hope that the Minister will give us the Government's latest position on these recommendations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03950">I began my academic career writing about the provision or rather lack of provision of nursery education. I might have hoped that nearly 25 years later I would no longer find myself having to regret the fact that many small children still do not get the chance to benefit from pre-school education. However, such hopes were misplaced. It really is lamentable after Mrs. Thatcher made a pledge in 1972 as Secretary of State for Education to provide places in nursery classes and schools for every three and four year-old whose parents wished him to attend that 18 years later there is still state provision for only 44 per cent. of those children. In France and Belgium 95 per cent. of children of that age are in education and in Italy the figure is 88 per cent. A good nursery class provides the stimulating environment that all small children need. It is disadvantaged children who need it most. If we gave such children a better chance and a better start there might be fewer children falling behind in the primary schools. Such children contribute to our statistics of failure later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03951">Nursery education should not be a privilege for the lucky ones; it should be a right for every child. Labour authorities have tried to recognise this. Indeed a child in a Labour controlled area has twice the chance of a nursery place that a child in a Conservative controlled area has. I should be glad to hear the Minister's comments on that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03952">I now turn to the compulsory stage of education for five to 16 year-olds. I wish to touch on the debate on standards and say a few words about the Government's own reforms and their misplaced optimism about their likely effects. Recent opinion polls show that some 70 per cent. of voters think that standards are falling. Even 65 per cent. of Conservative voters share this view. More than two-thirds of those questioned blamed the Government. I do not know whether this high level of public concern is justified as we simply do not have the evidence. It was a Conservative government who abolished the former NFER national reading surveys and it was this Conservative Government who abolished the assessment of performance unit. As a
<col>688</col>
result we do not have the data to make informed judgments on standards over time, even in relation to basic skills such as reading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03953">There are, however, some worrying trends. Between 1975 and 1982 the proportion of pupils gaining five or more graded results in O-levels and CSEs went up from 62 per cent. to 75 per cent. That is a big improvement. However, from then on the trend towards improved performance came to an end although the introduction of GCSE is now helping matters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03954">Further, in its most recent report, <i>Standards in Education,</i> Her Majesty's Inspectorate judged 30 per cent. of what it saw in schools to be poor or very poor. It was concerned that the less able get the worst deal. The inspectorate views that as a persistent feature of British education at all levels. That is confirmed by international comparisons of achievement levels. Our most able pupils compare well with similar pupils elsewhere but average and below average pupils do not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03955">The HMI report identified a whole range of problems contributing to standards being lower than they should be. I shall list a few of those problems. There are worsening problems of teacher supply; too little non-teaching time for primary school teachers; too little clerical and ancillary help for primary heads; shortages of books, particularly in the first three years of secondary schooling; unsatisfactory accommodation adversely affecting work in half our secondary schools; a lack of equipment, materials and in-service training to allow even a start to be made in teaching technology in primary schools; a lack of coherence with respect to education for 16 to 19 year-olds; and a risk of too much prescription and 'too detailed an external scrutiny of teachers in the implementation of the national curriculum, leading to teachers having impossible workloads as well as their becoming deskilled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03956">That is just a small selection of the problems identified by the inspectorate, yet the Government try to reassure us by claiming that the Education Reform Act will make everything right. They talk a lot of ideological claptrap about market forces and parent choice. The Act's provisions for open enrolment are meant to increase the size of popular schools while unpopular schools wither and eventually close. But what about all those parents and pupils who do not have access to the popular schools? Are we happy that they should languish in bad schools which slowly wither and die, a process which could take many years? No, my Lords. The market does not work in a complex public service such as education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03957">What is needed is good public policies to intervene to improve our schools. That is what the Labour Party proposes by setting up an educational standards council to work with schools and LEAs, identifying good practice and working to bring up the standards of the less effective schools to those of the most effective. We shall also develop a home-school contract so that all parents can participate in their children's education.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0384"/>
<col>689</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03958">The Government set great store on the national curriculum and its associated testing. On this side of the House, while supporting a core curriculum, we have argued that the national curriculum is too detailed and prescriptive and involves too many compulsory subjects in secondary schools. That is now becoming apparent, as we predicted. Similarly, national testing on the scale envisaged by the Government is proving to be unimplementable. The national curriculum and national assessment will all come to nothing if we do not have enough teachers in the right subjects to teach it and if buildings, books, equipment and other facilities are all inadequate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03959">I turn now to the education of 16 to 19 year-olds, which was not dealt with by the Education Reform Act. Here we are in the biggest mess of all. Staying on rates after 16 are deplorable. Only just over one-third of young people remain in full-time education between the ages of 16 and 19. That is a lower proportion than in any other advanced country. In France, two-thirds of young people in that age group are at school or college; in Sweden and Japan, over three-quarters, and in the United States almost four-fifths. What do the Government propose to do about those appalling participation rates? Why, over the past 11&#x00BD; years, have they done so little to secure an improvement? They have allowed an incoherent and confusing mish-mash of vocational qualifications to develop&#x2014;confusing to parents, pupils and teachers alike.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03960">At the same time the Government cling to an unreformed system of A-levels even though both the over-specialisation and the old-fashioned and unimaginative assessment entailed have been criticised by many informed commentators. Those exams, and the courses that lead up to them, are a major factor in weeding out such a huge proportion of young people from full-time education. They are not even suitable for the top 20 per cent. of pupils. Substantial numbers drop out and we insist on failing 30 per cent. who take them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03961">For how much longer can we afford to do that? Every time moderate proposals for reform are put forward the Government reject them. The latest example comes from their own advisers&#x2014;the School Examination and Assessment Council&#x2014;to which Tim Eggar, the Minister of State, responded with a tired old clich&#x00E9; about A-levels being the gold standard. The gold is getting very tarnished.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03962">If we are to get more young people to stay on, nothing less than a radical overhaul is needed. At the very least we must create an alternative vocational route into higher education so that the many young people who find A-levels too narrow or too daunting but who have the capacity and interest to study after 16 can do so. I should prefer to see a proper examination of the Institute for Public Policy Research proposals for a British baccalaureate. That would create a unified system which could bridge academic and vocational studies. I should be interested to hear the Government's views on those proposals.</p>
<col>690</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03963">Finally, I want to make some remarks about higher education. I shall be brief because I know that several other noble Lords intend to focus on higher education. The Government quite rightly wish to increase the numbers of young people taking degree-level studies. I welcome the small increase announced in the Autumn Statement to contribute towards the cost of its expansion. However, the Government are hell-bent on trying to get higher education on the cheap in a way that can only lead to a damaging decline in quality.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03964">First, the capital allocation for next year is deeply disappointing. The polytechnics in particular are suffering from many years of neglect on the capital side. The universities, too, desperately need a greater injection of capital. For example, there are science departments and medical and veterinary schools which are required under the law to improve their animal houses yet the funding has not been provided to allow them to meet even the basic legal requirements. In his reply can the Minister say what the Government think the universities should do?</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03965">On the recurrent side, the Government insist on what they call further efficiency gains. Ministers are obviously completely out of touch with what has been happening in our higher education institutions. There have already been huge increases in efficiency and it is very hard to see where any more are to come from. Lastly, perhaps we could be told what the Government intend to do about the recent fiasco at the Universities Funding Council. The universities are still incredulous about the chairman's action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03966">I should have liked to be more positive about what has been happening in our education system, but until the Government give education the priority it deserves that will not be possible. There is mounting public criticism from all sections of the community. What people want to see is every child and young person reaching their full potential. They want to see properly resourced schools and colleges. Above all, they want the nation to succeed and they know that we shall only succeed in the 21st century if we have the best educated people and the best trained workforce in Europe. The Government have failed, not just in the execution of their policies but also through their lack of ambition in striving for those goals for Britain's children and young people, for Britain's future. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03967">3.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03968"><member>Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may first acknowledge the very kind and courteous reception that I have received in your Lordships' House as a new Member and all the good wishes that I have received for today. Many of your Lordships will know that it is a day of diffidence and trepidation, especially when one is faced with a series of speakers whose knowledge of a subject is as great as, if not greater than, one's own and whose experience is certainly greater.<lb/>
It is a particular privilege to speak following the distinguished opener of this debate on education, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. I wish to focus my
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0385"/>
<col>691</col>
remarks on postgraduate education, a subject which the noble Baroness touched on. My 40 years of experience in the field, both in this country and overseas, may be of assistance in the appreciation of the role of postgraduate education in the economic, cultural and scientific health and welfare of this country, the Commonwealth and the community of nations in general. It is an important part of the interdependent primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of education and it has been the seedbed for many distinguished leaders in the humanities and sciences. One can generally trace a period of postgraduate study in the careers of Nobel laureates, fellows of learned societies, heads of colleges and other houses of learning, vice-chancellors and indeed a most reverend Primate. Your Lordships' House is well represented in all of those callings.<lb/>
However, with due respect to such distinguished persons, it is the postgraduate and postdoctoral student who, within the United Kingdom at least, is responsible for much of the research effort. Without them that research effort could well falter, and training for leadership in science, industry and higher education would be very much compromised thereby. One must say that graduate students and postdoctoral fellows certainly are not motivated to their life of research and scholarship by monetary gain, since a graduate student's stipend is of the order of some &#x00A3;4,000 a year. Though admittedly it is tax free it is still hardly comparable with the salary of a junior secretary in London.<lb/>
They play a crucial role in the national research effort in that they are at the cutting edge of research. That includes the liberation of the head of department or the leader of a research project to undertake other essential matters of teaching and administration. It is also the efforts of those postgraduates and postdoctorals which are largely exposed to the scrutiny of academic audit bodies such as the Universities Funding Council in the form of its periodic assessment of research productivity. In turn, such assessment determines the future funding of various departments and institutions. Some have called it the periodic romp through the higher education institutes, but I hasten to assure your Lordships that in this case ROMP is the acronym for Research Output by Measuring the number of Publications, that being an updated and supposedly finer analytical tool than POP, or, to give it its extended form, publish or perish.<lb/>
Fortunately, the number of postgraduate and postdoctoral positions has been improved recently in all the research councils and by various charities. For example, the Medical Research Council has increased &#x2014;in fact, more than doubled &#x2014;its scholarship and research awards; the Natural Environment Research Council has significantly increased higher education institute support and postgraduate studentships; the Science and Engineering Research Council's support for scholarships and fellowships is up by 10 per cent. compared with five years ago; and similarly the Agricultural and Food Research Council has made a major shift in funding to higher education institutes.<lb/>
<col>692</col>
The charities concerned with research and education&#x2014;for example, the Wellcome Trust&#x2014;are also playing an important role.<lb/>
The problem now lies in the recruitment of appropriately qualified individuals from that population of one in five of all 18 year-olds who enter higher education and in particular in their retention within the system. An area of special concern is biotechnology, which is and will continue to be one of the highest competitive areas in postdoctoral science in the country. As a nation, to survive as a front runner in science and technology we must be able to compete with research and development efforts similar to those of our rivals in much the same way as major chemical and pharmaceutical companies must sustain their research efforts to match those of their rivals.<lb/>
It is therefore somewhat disappointing, after having provided the necessary funding for postgraduate studies and the ensuing research, to discover that there is still a substantial drain&#x2014;a brain drain &#x2014;of our people to other countries, from which the reciprocal flow is substantially smaller. It is no bad thing to gain further experience in different institutions. It produces a valuable hybrid vigour. But for much of that talent to be retained permanently overseas, especially in the USA where the institutions are just as hungry for outstanding people as are our institutions, is obviously not of benefit for this country.<lb/>
In 1964 I was part of the brain drain but I returned to this country 15 years later. I feel that I can speak with some experience of the factors which led to my departure and return. Essentially they were questions of career opportunity. I believe that it is critical to improve career prospects beyond our present postgraduate training if we are to keep trained people here and tempt them back following study overseas. Positive steps are being taken in that direction&#x2014;for example, through the IRCs (interdisciplinary research centres), where major funding is provided over a 10-year period which includes many postgraduate and postdoctoral positions. The Royal Society research fellowship scheme for distinguished young scientists is especially valuable in retaining our best people.<lb/>
Happily, there is a noticeable increase in persons returning from overseas to take up senior positions in universities and research institutions. That is a most welcome development. Nevertheless, the improved conditions that increasingly tempt people to return must be sustained if we are to fill the numerous lacunae in our postdoctoral education system.<lb/>
Perhaps I may refer to my own profession; namely, veterinary medicine. The recruitment of veterinarians to the Agricultural and Food Research Council, for example, has fallen to what we must accept as too low a level in that only some 30 veterinarians out of a workforce of some 2,600 are employed in the whole service. There is a similar situation in the schools of veterinary medicine. There was a clear association between recruitment and the planning blight that affected the six schools, especially the two which were threatened with closure. Perhaps I may take this opportunity to thank noble Lords on all sides of the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0386"/>
<col>693</col>
House for their generous support which resulted in the retention of six schools of veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I mentioned the brain drain from this country. There is another brain drain with which we are not perhaps so familiar; namely, the brain drain from the poorer countries of the world. Individuals from those countries go to Western countries, which retain them. Within the Commonwealth the mobility of students, particularly postgraduate students, has been a fundamental element in the support and development of education. The product has been obvious in all walks of life. Not least it has served to provide leadership and staffed the centres of higher learning. The most able and brightest people from those countries are usually sent and it is a tragedy that in some cases up to 50 per cent. of them fail to return to their native land.<lb/>
It is to be expected that the countries in need of most assistance in this respect are the developing countries. Whatever plans we may have for postgraduate education in the United Kingdom we must ensure that adequate provision continues to be made for training people from overseas, especially from those areas of the Commonwealth.<lb/>
Finally, I believe that there is a further commitment that we should make. We must assist in the re-establishment of research and scholarship in the academic institutions of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe where hitherto contact with the West has been minimal but where the demand will grow. In fact, it is growing very rapidly. Not only will there be a need to provide specific disciplinary training; it will also be important to re-establish some of the oldest institutions of learning in Europe in their former distinguished roles as centres of education, teaching and research. I believe that the provision of postgraduate places in Britain would be the most effective way to do that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03969">3.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03970"><member>Earl Russell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great pleasure to begin what must be in part a debating speech by speaking on behalf of the whole House in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, on an excellent maiden speech, to which I listened with great attention. Having been educated at Oxford, I think of the noble Lord as coming from the other place as well as from the other side of the House. Nevertheless, in my eyes his speech fulfilled the requirement of being non-controversial in that I agreed with practically every word. It was excellently delivered. We share many topics of interest and I look forward to being able to take part with the noble Lord in debates on them on many future occasions.<lb/>
I am pleased to be able to speak on the Motion of the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. I am pleased too that she chose to word the Motion as she did. The key point of the wording of the Motion is to link the idea of quality in education with the level of investment in education. The key point of the Motion
<col>694</col>
is that quality costs money. In using the word "investment" in the Motion, the noble Baroness has made a bow to what is rapidly becoming the new agenda of politics. The key point which holds that new agenda together is the link between the expansion of our education and the improvement of our industry.<lb/>
I should like to pay tribute to the part played by your Lordships' Select Committee on Science and Technology in helping to form that new agenda. The appearance of such a new agenda after 11 years of this Government testifies to the fact that in matters involving research and development, education and industrial training there is a role for the state. In fact the links between the state and industrial enterprise had become irreversible before 1979. Since that fact is recognised by all our major competitors, including such free market countries as the United States, it might help if we too recognised it and got on with the job.<lb/>
The key Word in the Motion is quality. Many noble Lords in the debate on the humble Address commented on the words in the gracious Speech:
<quote>"My Government will continue to take action to improve quality in education".</quote>
It was the verb which I think caused a certain amount of surprise. I know a good many people working in education. In speaking to this Motion I must declare my interest as a serving university teacher. I do not know anyone employed in education who believes that quality has improved since 1979. I rather wonder what the Government are talking about. After 11 years any government ought to be prepared to review some of their policies and principles, to ask whether they have had the desired effect and indeed to ask whether they fit changed circumstances.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Government to think again about what they consider constitutes quality in education. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, spoke about choice. Choice has a great deal to commend it. It is a concept for which Liberal Democrats feel enthusiasm. However, real choice does not exist without a proper free market. I believe that it has been recognised since the Elementary Education Act 1870, if not for longer, that the ideals of a free market in schools and of universal education are not compatible.<lb/>
The Government talk of efficiency. I shall say no more about the government definition of efficiency. I have dwelt on it before. However, I ask them to consider whether there are cases in which efficiency is compatible with an increased cost rather than a reduced cost. The Government also tend to identify quality with anti-professionalism, with which much of their thinking has been shot through. The difficulty with anti-professionalism is that the job of educating has to be carried out by professionals. There is a limit to the extent to which one can persuade them to accept and carry out anti-professional values. I was interested to note in the report of the Health and Safety Executive published last week that we are losing several million pounds a year as a result of occupational stress among teachers.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0387"/>
<col>695</col>
When I consider quality I think first and foremost of books &#x2014;the contents of the library. I have talked many times before about the problems of university libraries. The situation in schools is often even worse. In 1988&#x2013;89&#x2014;it is the last year for which I have complete figures&#x2014;the ILEA (as it then was) was spending &#x00A3;19 per pupil on books in secondary schools. That figure was the top of the range. The bottom figure, from metropolitan districts, was &#x00A3;10 per year per pupil in secondary schools.<lb/>
Your Lordships may perhaps imagine how few books one can buy for &#x00A3;10 a year at present prices. Those are the schools entering candidates for A-levels. In that year the average figure per pupil in secondary schools fell in money terms&#x2014;not in real terms&#x2014;from &#x00A3;14.92 to &#x00A3;14.52. The total expenditure that year was &#x00A3;74.5 million. It is not very much in a &#x00A3;23 billion budget. To be constant in real terms that would have had to have been &#x00A3;109.6 million. There is therefore a shortfall of &#x00A3;35 million. That is the equivalent of a loss of 8 million books. How can one have quality education with such figures?<lb/>
I am pleased to see that the Secretary of State has announced a figure for provision of new books for the national curriculum. As I understand it, that figure is &#x00A3;15 million. However, the Educational Publishers Council has estimated, in a figure which I believe to be an underestimate, that the cost of books for the national curriculum in history alone will be &#x00A3;58 million. We have a danger that the national curriculum will go the same way as community care. I have much admiration for a good deal of what is in the national curriculum on history. However, if that is all the money available to introduce it, for my part I would rather it did not take place.<lb/>
The problem of school buildings is very much the same. Throughout the public services, the Thatcher years will be thought of as the years of deferred maintenance. That is not entirely the Government's fault. The years of deferred maintenance come after the Wilson years, which I think of as the years of ferry building. But of course the effect is cumulative. That the maintenance requires to be done is not always the Government's fault; it is not always any government's fault. However, as all noble Lords who have ever called in a builder will know, if one leaves building jobs alone they get bigger and builders' costs increase. The figures are inevitably based on estimates. If any of your Lordships know a builder whose bill is not bigger than his estimate, I shall be happy to hear from you afterwards.<lb/>
I shall say no more about teacher shortages. I am glad that the noble Baroness dwelt on that subject. I agree with what she said. I pass on to the collapse of the system of competitive bidding in universities. I believe that the previous Secretary of State's faith in that system was always misplaced. He believed that competition would reduce the price without reducing quality. That seems to me to show an indifference to the notion of true costs. Like the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, I too have worked abroad in the United States. I have seen a competitive system in operation. It has many different effects at different
<col>696</col>
points on the scale. At the lower end one tends to have what is known as grade inflation&#x2014;giving grades more and more easily to encourage people to come. I have seen pressure in operation already to do that in British universities.<lb/>
At the other end of the scale one gels what one sees at Harvard and Yale; that is the operation of a quality market where the competition is not to be the cheapest but to be the best. Therefore, the effect is for competition to drive up the price. It is, as Mr. Robert Jackson used to say, a Rolls-Royce market. I believe that any faith that was placed in the competitive bidding system to achieve the Government's aim was always misplaced. Meanwhile it has collapsed. We do not know where we are.<lb/>
Universities cannot expand on the basis of one-year funding. Undergraduates are there for three years; they cannot be turned away in the middle. It is urgent that universities should have some confirmation of the planning exercise&#x2014;that is to say, the academic plans turned in with great effort in response to requests from the Universities Funding Council. Taking in students on one-year funding is like going out to drive on the motorway without enough petrol to get to the next service station. I do not think that that is very prudent.<lb/>
When the Government reply, I hope that they will not once again trot out figures of real terms. On the ground and looking at what is happening, they are not believable.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03972"><member>Lord Dainton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to join in congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, who has drawn our attention to the fact that the annual influx of able young people is indeed the lifeblood of all universities. I am pleased to have him here as a champion in our midst. He is very welcome and we thank him for his splendid maiden speech.<lb/>
It is only 17 months since higher education was the subject of a two-and-a-half hour debate in this House. One might reasonably suppose that little of importance in this field would happen in so short a period of time and therefore that only a little of this debate, which is to cover the whole of education, need be devoted to higher education.<lb/>
I wish most sincerely that I could report that this supposition was correct, and that having cast, as I have, an experienced eye over the university scene I could also report to your Lordships that, during the first 18 months of its existence, the new statutory body for the universities, the Universities Funding Council, had developed a sense of common purpose amongst its members, had devised a harmonious and effective <i>modus operandi,</i> and, in its dealings with the universities, had won their trust and confidence by demonstrating that it understood the problems that they faced as well as the national priorities, and therefore had created a sensible and realistic national policy framework without a knowledge of which no university can construct a practical corporate plan for the future. In a word, I wish I could tell your Lordships that what the Government said in its
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0388"/>
<col>697</col>
advocacy of the Education Reform Bill&#x2014;namely, that the Universities Funding Council would be superior in functioning to its non-statutory predecessor, the University Grants Committee&#x2014;had in fact come about.<lb/>
Alas, I cannot give your Lordships that assurance. Indeed, I have to tell you that the reverse is the case. Long gone&#x2014;vanished into thin air&#x2014;are the symbiosis and mutual trust of the universities and the UGC which had existed for 70 years, which were much admired overseas, and which were the sure foundation enabling the production of first degree graduates of quality at lower cost than in all other countries of comparable economic development. The UGC was a part of the machinery of government which had also carried us through some difficult periods, including the Second World War and, in 1974, when inflation rose to just under 30 per cent. Inflationary protection of university grants disappeared, and yet the UGC still did not lose that essential trust of the universities. That made it possible to come through.<lb/>
Instead of that trust and symbiosis, there is now mistrust and a feeling that the Universities Funding Council has not established that close and well-informed contact with the universities which can earn for it the reputation of understanding the way in which the universities have adapted their procedures to modern circumstances without sacrificing principles. Unfortunately there are no longer those subject sub-committees which made it their business to be informed by personal visits to, and therefore by face-to-face discussions with, university people as well as by correspondence, about the quality of work done in every sector of every university. A single individual so-called "adviser" to the UFC cannot, unaided, make those judgments in a satisfactory way.<lb/>
Nor are the major "visitations" as they were called, of the old University Grants Committee to individual universities, to which Lord Haldane many years ago correctly attached such importance, carried out with thoroughness and great benefit to both sides. Such visits as do take place are seen by the universities as being of too short duration, sparsely attended by UFC members and less mutually informative. Moreover, it is an open secret, and the subject of repeated press comment, that agreement on vital issues within the UFC and its two principal officers is often elusive if not absent.<lb/>
There may be those among your Lordships who will choose to disregard my remarks on the grounds that my personal history must imply that I have some nostalgia for the "good old days" which will carry with it, they will assume, a reluctance to meet the need for necessary change. So let me conclude with some statements of fact about our universities. British universities have always done their best to respond to national needs for higher education. They were always clear that more of the skilled manpower which they can produce is essential for the success of Great Britain Limited. They have been prepared to make sacrifices to achieve this end, especially in hard times. In fact, since 1974, which I remember very vividly,
<col>698</col>
they have accepted a steady erosion of the unit of resource&#x2014;that is to say, the amount of grant plus fee income provided by the Government per student per annum&#x2014;to the point that not only has any supposed fat been sweated out of the system, but evidence of unwise neglect in the form of poor building maintenance and antiquated equipment is now clearly visible in every university.<lb/>
Therefore, when the Universities Funding Council earlier this year called for bids from every university which were to be expressed in terms of numbers of students that university would be prepared to accept in various subject categories, and on which the UFC proffered some guide prices with which the universities would make estimates of costs, the universities set to work with a will, feeling that they had a planning horizon. They produced plans which, taken together, provided for an expansion of student numbers to 1994&#x2013;95 representing a 19 per cent. increase on 1989. Only 7 per cent. of those bids were under the guide price, for the very simple reason that, the efficiency gains having already been achieved over the past decade and a half, any further reduction in costs must inevitably carry a quality penalty.<lb/>
I am sure that your Lordships will accept without question that it is no service to this country to produce graduates less well qualified by education and training to serve their future employers than those of our competitor countries. The Universities Funding Council has responded to this situation by sending on 23rd October a terse letter to each university (I have a copy here) over the signature of its secretary&#x2014;not even the chief executive or chairman, be it noted&#x2014;expressing its disappointment with this response and putting its much trumpeted four-year planning cycle back into the melting pot for review.<lb/>
What are we to make of this shambles? Perhaps more to the point, what do the professional people and wealth creators, who give freely of their time, energy and experience to the onerous task of chairing the governing bodies of all British universities except Oxford and Cambridge, and each therefore having major responsibilities for the stewardship every year of tens of millions of pounds of public money, think of the situation? Until 31st October it was possible only to guess based on their well-known opinion of the new Universities Funding Council derived from accounts of their wholly unproductive meeting some months ago with the noble Lord, Lord Chilver, the chairman of that body. However, on 31st October Mr. Hugh Try, chairman of the Committee of Chairmen of University Councils, wrote to <i>The Times</i> as follows:
<quote>"Universities have responded with enthusiasm to the calls from successive secretaries of state for an expansion of student numbers and a broadening of the age and social mix of the intake. The fact that universities are significantly above the student numbers for which the Government has specifically funded them is evidence in itself of their commitment. They have also responded vigorously to the University Funding Council's request for their plans up to 1994&#x2013;5 with bids for a growth of 19 per cent.</quote>
<quote>Such an expansion can only be contemplated on a properly planned basis, with the necessary steps being taken to provide teaching space, equip laboratories, appoint staff and find or build student residences. To do otherwise would be unbusinesslike, would be potentially to let down students and their parents and, most serious
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0389"/>
<col>699</col>
of all for the long term, would affect the quality of education which we must provide if we are to compete successfully with our European neighbours.</quote>
<quote>This whole process of expansion, however, has been placed in jeopardy by the decision of the UFC to put forward planning into suspense for 1991&#x2013;2 &#x2026; Only a month ago, the Public Accounts Committee criticised the UFC Council for not having in place the planning and financial arrangements necessary for universities to draw up realistic financial forecasts &#x2026;</quote>
<quote>If Government and the UFC are looking to the universities to provide for growth in student numbers of between 15 and 20 per cent. by 1994&#x2013;5 and further expansion thereafter, we must have a longer planning and funding horizon than one year."</quote>
In the light of those wise words from experienced, responsible people, mainly drawn from the business community, and in the light of the deplorable situation which now exists, is it too much to ask that the Secretary of State takes remedial action before it is too late? This should be directed, first, to securing the funds necessary to ensure that the graduates we need get the education of the quality which we wish for them, without which prospects for this country's success will continue to recede. And, secondly, perhaps the Secretary of State will conduct an independent appraisal of the structure and workings of the Universities Funding Council with a view to a rapid improvement of both so that it can perform its pivotal task of planning for the future effectively. My Lords, time is of the essence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03974"><member>Lord Perry of Walton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that the Labour Party has instigated this debate. Perhaps I may congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, on a notable maiden speech which was non-controversial in dealing with a highly controversial subject.<lb/>
The Motion covers a vast territory and, if I may say so, a multitude of sins. However, let us make no mistake about it: they are not just the sins of this Government but the sins of many governments of both major parties.<lb/>
I have been married twice and have two separate families. My first child went to school in 1953 and my sixth in 1985, more than 30 years later. The changes I have noticed over those years appal me. Nowadays, "competition" seems to have become a dirty word. Neither the children nor their parents are given any information about performance relative to other children. Children are given no pat on the back for a particularly good piece of work; nor, as far as I can see, are they encouraged to be imaginative. The result is a dull level of mediocrity where the gifted consistently under perform because they are not challenged.<lb/>
Children are naturally intensely competitive about every one of their activities at home, in play and at school. This Government are always preaching about the value of competition in adult life. Yet children are being trained to believe that it is undesirable. That does not make sense.<lb/>
A second change which appalls me is the deterioration in discipline. That is not uniformly true. Some schools manage to maintain discipline very successfully. Alas, others do not. When things get bad,
<col>700</col>
they can become really horrible. If teachers do not have the sort of personality or charisma which makes children instinctively behave, they have no official means of enforcing discipline. Corporal punishment, which in my day ensured compliance, has long since disappeared. Even a slap in anger can lead to parental complaint. Other forms of punishment can be ignored. When appealed to, parents are often unable or unwilling to help.<lb/>
Why should that new situation haw come about? Why have teachers lost the status they formerly had? Thirty years ago they were respected citizens and children and parents looked up to them. I do not believe that the loss of status and respect is merely the result of relatively lower salaries. It seems to me that it may stem from the changes in teaching methods introduced over those years. Where once the teacher taught the whole class and those who could not keep up were left behind and where formality was the rule, now the atmosphere is informal and an attempt is made to treat each child individually. That sounds like a great improvement but perhaps it has been bought at the cost of bringing down the teacher from a pedestal to the same level as the pupils and perhaps that pedestal was necessary for the maintenance of discipline. There is very little evidence to show that the new methods in education have improved the output. They may have made it more enjoyable for the children; for the teacher perhaps less enjoyable.<lb/>
As I said in the House on 8th November, the welcome broadening of the school curriculum introduced by the national curriculum left the A-levels unchanged. In common with almost every educational group and institution in this country, I regard that as a mistake. A-levels force those who stay in school to study in depth rather than in breadth. That discourages many from remaining at school at all.<lb/>
I note also from a careful study or the national curriculum in science that few 16 year-olds are expected to reach beyond level 7 of the 10 levels of achievement available under the curriculum. I give an example. Very few 16 year-olds taking science will have been told anything at all about DNA, the genetic code or genetic engineering, since those subjects appear only at levels 8, 9 and 10. Surely it is cause for grave anxiety that more than 70 per cent. of our children should be turned out into the adult world at 16 with no training or education in a subject&#x2014;genetic engineering&#x2014;which will be so central to the development of society during their adult life. Of those staying on at school only students of biology to A-level standard will ever be taught anything about genetic engineering. All those going on to A-levels in the humanities or social sciences will stay ignorant unless they have gone beyond level 7 in the GCSE. Among those who remain ignorant will be many of our future politicians, civil servants, judges and businessmen. It is pathetic and is liable to be tragic for our future.<lb/>
In technology the situation is even worse. We have lagged behind our competitors. Apprenticeships have virtually disappeared. Further education has had to try to cope with students who are ill prepared in the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0390"/>
<col>701</col>
basics of maths and physics where the shortage of teachers has been a problem for decades. It is not a new crisis; it has been with us for many years.<lb/>
The many attempts of government to improve the technical training of 16 year-olds have not worked or have worked very poorly. The open tech spent a great deal of money commissioning courses without adequate quality control; the open college has been forced to become just another commercially based institution selling its services at a market price too costly for the poor. YTS was abandoned as a costly failure.<lb/>
How could those systems be expected to work when they had to deal with an output of school-leavers whose basic education in maths and science had been so neglected&#x2014;the same school-leavers that further education failed to cope with? To make matters worse there is a collapse of morale in the schools. Teachers believe themselves to be undervalued and underpaid and blamed for all the problems. The professions carry some of the responsibility but not all. They tend to resist change. Radical change is called for and can only be provided by political action.<lb/>
On 8th November I outlined my beliefs to this House. Allow me to repeat them. If we were to introduce the hardware necessary to provide pupils in schools with work stations&#x2014;a personal computer, a video-disc player and a cable connection to a central library of learning materials&#x2014;we could transform the situation. In the library we could have a series of mathematics lessons prepared by a very gifted teacher. We could have the same series prepared by a different very gifted teacher, and do that over and over again. The children could choose which they enjoyed; which they found interesting and stimulating. They could study at their own pace while their classmates used other teachers and went forward at different speeds. The class teacher would ensure that all the children spent a fixed proportion of time on mathematics, that a child having difficulty was helped and that discipline was maintained.<lb/>
I do not believe that in those circumstances discipline would be a problem. Children would want to study that way and the results would be astounding. No longer would many of them be forced to try to learn maths and physics from teachers with little or no training in those subjects and as a result be permanently switched off them. The capital costs would be high but the maintenance costs very low. That is a picture of the future. Can we ensure that it is not too distant a future?<lb/>
Finally, perhaps I may say a word or two regarding universities. They have been under financial pressure for a long time. I was still in office when it all began. For some years cuts were defensible for there was fat in the system that could be shed, but the fat has long since disappeared. There have been great efforts in the universities, and indeed great success, in finding supplementary sources of income other than government grant.<lb/>
<col>702</col>
The last effort of government to introduce competition between universities through the change from the UGC to the UFC, as my noble friend Lord Dainton said, was a disaster. We have only two choices. The first is to maintain our system in the universities, which is a high quality, high cost one. If we do that we can expand it only by increasing the resources put into it. If that means extra taxation, so be it. I rather like the idea of a graduate tax, but one paid by all graduates. Most of us who graduated in the past, I hope, would happily share the burden with new graduates. In that case it would be a relatively small annual sum for the individual graduate.<lb/>
The alternative is to move in the direction of the system in the United States where, in addition to universities, there are a large number of colleges which are not research-based, which do not offer post-graduate degrees and which have graduation rates of only around 50 per cent. They also offer associate degrees after two years, as well as bachelor degrees after four years. That type of institution could take, at much lower cost, the expanded number of students needed. It is at least arguable that graduates from such institutions would ably fill many of the skilled jobs in industry which too few of our university graduates wish to take.<lb/>
I am advocating radical policies; many will regard them as iconoclastic. I believe we need such changes; without them or something similar we shall find ourselves as a nation in a continued decline.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03976"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may first congratulate the noble Lord on his maiden speech. I assume that Swaffham Prior is in Norfolk. My father was a Norfolk man; he came from Swaffham, where they do not do any "troshing" for nothing. I am proud that I carry a name which I believe is a county name.<lb/>
With due deference I should also like to congratulate my noble friend on the Front Bench on the splendid way in which she introduced the debate. I am particularly pleased by the wording. We are investing in people. I know we must mention money but let us occasionally think of what education is concerned with.<lb/>
During the past few weeks I had the privilege of presenting prizes at three schools. It is useful to move from one place to another for then people have not heard the same joke. On each occasion I mentioned the story of the cynical politician who said that the Welsh had a passion for education, the Scots had a respect for it and the English had no particular objection to it. The older I grow the more I have the horrid feeling that there is some truth in that.<lb/>
I should like to illustrate the way I see education by using the quotation from the National Union of Teachers; I have not heard it put better. I use it when referring to investment in education. Education means the growth, the freedom and the happiness of the human being, the quality of society&#x2014;the quality&#x2014;and the wealth of the nation. The wealth of the nation is not necessarily expressed in money. Surely everything
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0391"/>
<col>703</col>
does not need to be expressed in terms of money. Is there nothing we can speak of which does not bring in that wretched point?<lb/>
When we speak of education of course we must say that we want books. There are teachers in my family; I have grandchildren at school. When I watch a child trying to learn Greek from a book that has been used so much that it is virtually unreadable and it has to be passed to someone else, I realise how nonsensical the situation is.<lb/>
We must be very careful. I believe all governments interfere too much in the process of education. We introduce Acts of Parliament; why do we not leave the practice of things to the practitioners? Why are we always interfering, especially in education? I have thought about that many times and believe it is because everybody has been to school. We all think that we know best. It is similar to giving a cookery demonstration to a group of women; they all know far better than the demonstrator how to do it. I was always safe in saying, as I said to my daughter-in-law, that whatever my husband married me for it was not my cooking.<lb/>
There is no doubt that we interfere too much. The poor&#x2014;I could use a word which we are not allowed to use in this House&#x2014;pathetic teachers, the practitioners; there are 400,000 in maintained schools in England and Wales. The loss of those teachers is alarming. Why? It is not difficult to find the answer. In the first place there is no support, no career development for teachers. There are assessments; everyone will assess them. But I defy anyone to say when I taught a class of dull and backward children and at the end of the year none could read that I was a less excellent teacher&#x2014;I do not often blow my own trumpet but in this case I shall&#x2014;than the person in the next class where there were 25 brilliant children. Of course they all obtained scholarships. None of my poor children would ever achieve that. Therefore, how one assesses a good teacher is, to me, one of the mysteries of life. The Government, however, are quite certain that they can do it. In fact, I believe that the government that I supported were nearly as bad.<lb/>
There are poor financial rewards for teachers. I was very interested to learn from the gracious Speech that an early Bill is to be introduced to establish permanent negotiating arrangements covering school teachers' pay, duties and conditions of service. I looked for it. It is another elaborate document and costs &#x00A3;4.95. Every copy produced results in a little less being available to pay the teachers.<lb/>
Why do we always have everything communicated at such great length? The Bill contains at least three pages explaining what a teacher should be doing. That may be very useful but I remind noble Lords that for a teacher there are only five hours in the teaching day. Of course, as I know from my own experience, teachers spend many hours on school work outside school. Let no one imagine that a teacher floats in and does a little nice work with all the children sitting quietly. That is what I believed when I left college; I thought that I would be confronted by dear little children sitting with upturned faces waiting for my
<col>704</col>
words of wisdom. An hour in the classroom soon disabused me of that. The position is now far worse, as the noble Lord just said.<lb/>
The starting salary for graduates who are articled in law, the clerks, is &#x00A3;13,000. The starting salary for computer operators&#x2014;and I have checked this in advertisements&#x2014;is between &#x00A3;10,000 and &#x00A3;12,000. The starting salary for a teacher, after at least four years' training (and presumably now also for graduates) is &#x00A3;9,000. Teachers have never been well paid but they have had status. Now the children despise the silly professional who has a clapped out old car parked by the playground. The children's fathers have jolly good cars. Teachers do not wear very good clothes but the children's parents wear jolly good clothes. Some teachers live in very small houses. Noble Lords should not believe that children do not take their standards from society and from adults.<lb/>
The teachers' powers of discipline have been undermined. The teachers are like the police and are blamed for all the evils in our society. They are not created by teachers. Any trouble is said to be the fault of the poor unfortunate teachers or the police. It is never the parents who are blamed. Only occasionally do the parents come in for comment. A parent once came to see me and asked why I did not deal with her child in a certain way. I said, "Madam, I have your son for five hours each day for five days in the week and a certain number of weeks in the year. You have him for 19 hours every day of the year. Who has the greater influence?" If teachers are expected to maintain discipline, they must be supported. In the old days they were supported by the authorities and by the parents.<lb/>
Almost every year the teachers are handed what looks like a new curriculum. They are expected to deal with different types of examination which come along as regularly as clockwork. What has happened to the three Rs, I ask myself? Now we have something new, and I do not understand it. When I last taught&#x2014;admittedly 30 years ago&#x2014;there was a moral obligation on all teachers to see that children moved to the secondary stage well equipped not only to read and to express themselves but to write, to do mathematics, and so on. What happened to that? Why is there something new? The children are receptive and waiting to be taught.<lb/>
I refer now to the HMI report. Incidentally, it has been quite interesting to read some of the material issued by certain educationists. The spelling is appalling. I underline examples. My secretary asks to read letters before I use the blue pencil&#x0021; However, I do not expect to find such errors in reports produced by HMI. One report produced this gem:
<quote>"Standards of learning are never improved by poor teachers and there are no cheap high quaky routes into teaching".</quote>
Does that need underlining? Every teacher knows that.<lb/>
I was interested to see in the <i>Daily Mail</i> last week that it has been discovered in certain places&#x2014;they are all given in the paper&#x2014;that more cash is being spent on non-teachers than on teachers. Does that make
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0392"/>
<col>705</col>
sense? I do not suggest that the Government are looking for cuts, but, if they are, why not consider the administration? I was intrigued to find, when in hospital, that if any department was overstaffed it was the administrative department. The hospital was not overstaffed with nurses, doctors, or people who prepared the food. Does the same position apply in schools?<lb/>
In my own borough&#x2014;I shall be fair by quoting a Labour borough&#x2014;there are 1,500 non-teachers and 1,400 teachers. There is something wrong there. Moreover, four schools are being closed, which shocks me. In Westminster&#x2014;a rather different political colour&#x2014;there are 1,700 non-teachers and 1,800 teachers. Does that make sense? We need the practitioners, the people at the grass roots, the people who are at the baseline. We shall not get graduates in universities if we do not have the highest excellence of teaching from the very moment when children start school. I have no time to speak about nursery education, but I believe that we also need pre-school training.<lb/>
I conclude by making a plea on behalf of teachers. Everyone will be making a plea of some kind. How would your Lordships feel if we were suddenly faced with a pool of inactive teachers who came from the "pit", as it is said? Let us make opportunities for the really well trained, professional teachers. Of course there will be a few bad ones, but most teachers are highly dedicated. Their morale is low at present because they are constantly under attack, are underpaid and feel that they are not receiving sufficient support. My call is this&#x2014;and I use the words of the NUT: freedom, happiness, quality of society and the wealth of the nation can only be achieved by true investment in the people who will make that possible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03978"><member>Lord Joseph</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to your Lordships that because of a commitment made before the business of this week was known I may have to leave before the conclusion of the debate. I join with other noble Lords in paying tribute to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior. The noble Lord was too modest to tell us the truth; namely, that he is the first veterinarian or veterinary surgeon&#x2014;or, more simply, vet&#x2014;to have sat in either House of Parliament. We can congratulate him and ourselves on that, as well as on the content and delivery of his speech.<lb/>
I rejoice that the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, who introduced the debate, laid such emphasis on standards. She might have evinced a little humility because, as the noble Lord, Lord Perry, said, the problem about standards in education&#x2014;particularly for the non-academic child&#x2014;goes back decades, if not generations or centuries. In fact, I take some pride in being one of the first to put it on the agenda. When I went to the Department of Education as Secretary of State I continued my modest practice of giving a short reading list to the officials of that department. I gave only one book, called <i>Lessons from Europe.</i> It was a
<col>706</col>
book from the Centre for Policy Studies which the Prime Minister and I founded in 1974. It was published in 1976 and argued, with detailed analysis, that in our neighbours of North-West Europe the standards of education, particularly for the nonacademic child, are a great deal better than in this country. I gave it to the senior officials in my department and they paid me the compliment of saying the next day that it was rather more interesting than they had thought. However, as for action, they never produced any ideas for action. We sent delegations of HMI to look at countries in North-West Europe and they came back with their eyes wide open and stated that it is true that non academic children do better in Germany and France. They were the two countries that HMI visited, but I am sure that that situation applies equally to other countries of North-West Europe.<lb/>
I do not believe that the Labour Party has helped in raising standards. No doubt it was sincere, but the action of demolishing direct grant schools, in seeking to extirpate grammar schools, in imposing the untried panacea of comprehensive schools, in decrying and seeking to eliminate competition and competitiveness when, as the noble Lord, Lord Perry, stated, all children in one form or another are inherently competitive, and in denigrating discipline did no service to children, particularly those from relatively poor and non-academic homes.<lb/>
It is also true to state that the Conservative Party has not succeeded in solving the problem. We come to the matter relatively late because there has been in this country a <i>trahison des clercs,</i> an unwillingness of those watchdogs who should have barked far earlier to point to the almost tragic lack of decent education for the non-academic child in this country. We accept that this country has some snobberies within it. Educational and intellectual snobbery accounts for a great deal of the shameful silence that has allowed the low standards of education for the non-academic child in particular to last so long. In this country there are 70 departments of education in universities and polytechnics where the taxpayer and the ratepayer pay for people to spend their professional lives concerning themselves with education. Did they shout? Did they proclaim the need for a sharp increase in quality in education for the non-academic? That happened very rarely indeed.<lb/>
I agree with much of the speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, but she would have done better to admit some humility, as I for my part (for what it is worth) admit that we have not as yet found the answer.<lb/>
The noble Baroness stated that if elected to government the Labour Party will forsooth introduce an "educational standards council". That was the only positive suggestion made by the noble Baroness except that there would be more money. We are told that the Labour Party understands that there is a limitation on the money that it would have available. We understand that any extra money is pre-empted by the increases in child benefit and in pensions that the party
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0393"/>
<col>707</col>
promises. I do not think that the noble Baroness did justice either to herself or to the House in riding so easily off on the panaceas that Labour will introduce.<lb/>
The tasks that fall on any government who want to raise standards for the non-academic children of this country will involve some very awkward issues. Some of the teacher unions have been close allies in the past of the Labour Party. I do not know about the present situation, but they will resist some of the proposals that will be necessary. On the agenda there will need to be the subjects of selection of teachers and training of teachers. I am very dissatisfied with my own performance as Secretary of State in that while I tried to introduce improvements in teacher training colleges, they were not nearly radical enough. There will no doubt need to be improvements in pay for some parts of the teaching profession. To my mind that is a matter that needs to be considered with teacher appraisal so that it no longer is necessary for a teacher to leave the classroom in order to get a better salary. Those matters are not without difficulty for a government to impose.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, failed to mention the most difficult problem of all, which is motivation. Governments cannot command motivation. A teacher can secure motivation, as can parents. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Perry, in his comments concerning the importance of the home background, the combination of love and discipline that must make many children a pleasure to teach and the lack of which must make some children almost impossible to teach.<lb/>
Some noble Lords will remember that I supported nearly every reform that was introduced in the Education Bill 1988, but that I led a division of the House against the national curriculum, while supporting the core curriculum. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and some of her colleagues and I, as the only Tory, were in the same Lobby in that division. I failed completely to persuade the House or my former colleagues in government. I think that the national curriculum was a noble aim. I agree with the noble Baroness that it is probably too rigid and too ambitious, but I strongly support the core curriculum. I hope that the Government will arrive at a practical measure of a national curriculum.<lb/>
Together with the skill of teachers, the encouragement of parents, the magic of motivation and a sensible curriculum, there have to be examinations. Whether I should be proud or sorry to have introduced the general certificate of secondary education, only the historians will be able to judge. I had hoped that there would be introduced&#x2014;I still hope it will happen&#x2014;that very difficult measure of examination performance&#x2014;criterion referencing which would apply not relative but absolute standards to every paper and every child. That proposal would present problems, but I hope that that system will be implemented.<lb/>
The House should recognise, as I think the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, probably recognises, that more money will not easily be available on any vast scale even if the Labour Party were returned to office
<col>708</col>
and that even if there were more money available, without reforms to teacher selection, teacher training and teacher pay, coupled with teacher appraisal, without more encouragement by many parents of this country and without all the other matters I have spoken about, more money alone will not raise standards for the non-academic.<lb/>
The Government have introduced changes which the noble Baroness found herself unable to replace by alternatives. The Government have introduced local management of schools, parental participation, changes in the curriculum, the GCSE and the city technical colleges, which are intended to radiate higher standards by competition in neighbouring schools. All of those are stimulating efforts to raise standards. Against those active and often unpopular changes the Labour Party, represented by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, was ungracious enough to offer neither any modified good wishes nor alternatives except forsooth an "educational standards council". That is a mockery to an important subject.<lb/>
I turn to higher education. It is essential that we should recognise that if either party goes for an expansion of students in higher education without insisting that quality be maintained and improved if possible, we shall be doing grave damage to all the interests concerned. I hear rumours that some universities and polytechnics are introducing students to subjects with Es in A-levels. That is to embrace mediocrity instead of quality. The difference between some vice-chancellors and others in going for the excellent, coupled with numbers, that al parties in this House would like to see is very startling. Perhaps we shall have to move towards difficult decisions about grading institutions of higher education as between teaching and research: as to between quality, I cannot say.<lb/>
The House would be wise to heed much of what the noble Earl, Lord Russell, states, in particular his warning about grade inflation. Mediocrity is the danger if we merely expand higher education without insisting on quality. One of the reasons for introducing some contribution by students to the cost of their higher education is precisely that they shall seek value for their own money. At the moment they are not so immediately concerned because it is taxpayers' money, and often poor taxpayers' money, that pays for their education.<lb/>
The Labour and the Liberal Peers are no doubt sincere in their wish to raise standards of education. I say again at the end of my speech, as I said at the beginning, that a little more humility from all sides would be welcome. Courage will be needed by any government who make the necessary changes to raise standards. It will not be done without much more parental encouragement of children; and that no government can command.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03980"><member>Lord Addington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in entering the debate I find myself following a great many very good speeches from all sides of the House. They started with
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0394"/>
<col>709</col>
the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and then we heard the excellent maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior. We have had many comments and views about various parts of the education system. I should like very briefly to refer to some of the points raised in those speeches.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Joseph, and the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, spoke of the difficulties of the non-academic child. I have bored the House on many occasions with the problem of dyslexia. As a dyslexic at a large state school, I often found myself, because at that time there was no provision for someone with such learning difficulties, in low ability stream classes. There the problems of discipline and motivation were always the greatest. A student would struggle through an academic exam which he stood no chance of passing. He knew that he could not get realistic grades. The noble Lord, Lord Joseph, did one very good thing when he brought in the GCSE and got rid of CSE. The CSE relied on tons of course-work. Many children passed with a grade 4 or 5. In many cases the CSE was not worth the paper it was written on. It was a complete waste of time. There is a great danger in the school system that we may overload people with academic work in which they cannot achieve anything.<lb/>
Inherently, a tightly drawn national curriculum may do exactly the same thing. If we have 10 subjects requiring a good deal of course-work, how can we avoid making a non-academic child feel more and more useless? I suggest that if one did not have a riot on one's hands within a few weeks, one would be doing very well. The teacher, unless he happened to be six feet tall or a black belt in karate, would have no chance to control the class. The fact of the matter is that sexism in schools might be introduced because badly behaved classes behave better when they have a large male teacher leering at them. That is a fact. Many female teachers would back me up on that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03981"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some female teachers are better.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03982"><member>Lord Addington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some small female teachers are indeed very competent.<lb/>
I wish to turn now to a subject on which I have spoken before but which I shall now approach from a slightly different angle. Entrance into the further and higher education system at the moment is shackled by the fact that the schools system is tied to the A-level. A-levels are very good at getting people ready to do a three-year course in a subject which they know they want to study. In the schools system one is channelled into a certain number of subjects. I suggest that matters such as how well one gets on with certain teachers are very important. Indeed the importance throughout the education system of the person who is instructing and inspiring cannot be overstressed. If one studies for A-levels one may find oneself channelled towards certain subjects. The A-level examination tells one how good one is at doing academic work to A-level standard. It channels the student far too much.<lb/>
<col>710</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Joseph, said that people were going to university with grade E A-level passes. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, mentioned to me that he had known people with E grades at A-level going on to get first class degrees. An A-level tells the student how good he is at passing A-levels. It can channel the student towards a certain subject. I was quite good at history and therefore the A-level served me very well. A couple of my other subject choices at A-level were of no use to me. I found that I was not all that good at them although I had achieved reasonable grades at O-level. However, I did not study very hard because I did not like them, and, as I did not like them, I did not have a good rapport with my lecturers.<lb/>
I suggest that a broader band of subjects would provide a far better basis for a young person to establish what are his interests. It would also give him a good background knowledge to enable him to put his specialist subject needs into context. There is a great danger that people push pell-mell for one subject, considering nothing else. They may then come a very bad cropper when they reach higher education, finding after one or two years that they have chosen the wrong subject.<lb/>
The structure of higher education work also needs to be looked at. In its initial stages it should be more unit based so that students take a greater number of subjects at university. I went to a Scottish university. I was astounded when I saw the number of unit-based courses that students took in the initial stages. I then discovered that this was the norm in the rest of the world. Only in England is it recommended that after one's second year at university &#x2014;students in England spend one year less at university than students elsewhere&#x2014;one should specialise. In Scotland one takes a unit-based course all the way through. Some English universities are moving towards this idea in the first year but departmental inflexibility still makes it difficult to transfer. I suggest that we should move the degree-based structure towards the unit-based course.<lb/>
It is quite possible that on reaching university a student will decide that he is not the academic person he thought he was. It must be remembered that schools tend to push people towards the highest quality academic institution for the simple reason that schools are academic institutions themselves. Academic achievement is how one grades success at school. The problem can be laid at the feet of teachers but it is inherent in the structure and organisation of any academic institution. Students are pushed towards the highest level academic institution that will take them. People thus find themselves taking the wrong course. A unit-based degree to a non honours level should be introduced. I saw this in Scotland. It was a revelation when I discovered it but it is the norm in the rest of Europe and America. It might offer a way forward.<lb/>
The A-level examination and the A-level system of entrance mean that people who go on to do an HND are usually the people who have D or E grades at A-level. In other words, they are unsuccessful academically. Such a person usually takes an HND in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0395"/>
<col>711</col>
a more&#x2014;for want of a better expression&#x2014;practically based subject, not because he or she may be good at it but because he or she is bad at academic subjects. That is another reason why students should take a broader spectrum of subjects post-GCSE. They could then find out what they are good at. There is no point in knocking out poor HND students just because they happen to be unsuccessful academically. We should try to find out where people's interests lie, how they work, and how they are motivated. It is a tall order, but I suggest that we should try for it. The A-level system encourages the channelling of people into the least best option as opposed to the best option.<lb/>
I should like to conclude with a few words about student finance. I shall understand if the eyes of noble Lords on the Government Front Bench glaze over. The level of student funding is geared to the three-year degree. There has been an increase in funding to about &#x00A3;25 million from the access funds, but we have lost something like &#x00A3;68 million in social security benefits. The increase in the level of grant and top-up loans is struggling to keep up with inflation. I suggest that it will always struggle to do so.<lb/>
We must ensure that people are encouraged to go to universities or colleges, or to undertake whatever training is appropriate for them, by giving them enough money to live on. There is much debate about what we should do: should we go for an all-grant system? Should we go for a loan system? Should we go for a graduate tax? I suggest that the Treasury can exercise its iron grip again and decide where it thinks it can reclaim the most money. However, before we start worrying about repayments and where we can get the money from, I believe the first step is to make sure that students have enough money to live on.<lb/>
Moreover, if we want to encourage people to undertake further education in other than the main academic stream&#x2014;that is, to take technical qualifications which are below, say, diploma level or Higher National Diploma level&#x2014;we must ensure that some funding is available to them. There is virtually none available at present. We must encourage people to take training seriously, because the country is running desperately short of skilled people in nearly all its areas. Indeed, there is a problem with skills worldwide as the world in which we live becomes more and more complex.<lb/>
In the future teachers will have to have degrees at virtually all levels, whereas this was not the case in the past, for the simple reason that today's degree will probably be the equivalent of tomorrow's A-level. Having just slated it, I shall use it as an example. An A-level in science today may well be the equivalent of a degree 30 years ago. We are experiencing a snowball effect as regards the knowledge and skills required. Therefore, we must make sure that we are getting enough trained people into the marketplace. Anyone who wishes to be retrained, or to top-up his level of skills, must be given the opportunity to have this funded by the Government if he undertakes such training or education on a full-time or even on a
<col>712</col>
part-time basis. If we start imposing financial penalties on people who undertake training, we shall ultimately starve industry of skilled people.<lb/>
We must ensure that this country's education system works for the simple reason that ultimately it is all we have. We can no longer rely on any great advantages as regards our position, our natural resources or anything else in this world. We have the geographical position and we must therefore join in the marketplace. All we can do is to get the best from our main natural resource&#x2014;our population.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03984"><member>Baroness Lockwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in supporting my noble friend's Motion, I should like to talk about the problems of access to further and higher education. In a sense I shall be following some of the themes of the noble Lord, Lord Addington.<lb/>
I am anxious about two groups of people; namely, the 16 to 18 year-old non-academic category, and the category of the mature person whom the education system failed in the past. It seems to me that there has never been a time when there has been such universal acceptance of the fact that Britain can no longer afford an education system which ignores the needs of non-academic children and concentrates upon academic children. We have already heard about that this afternoon. Sir Claus Moser in his recent address to the Royal Society talked about the situation.<lb/>
I recently read an article based on an interview with Peter Morgan, the Director General of the Institute of Directors. He aspires to an education system in which everyone succeeds and everyone wins; and he opposes a system which is structured from its very foundations to fail the majority in the interests of a small minority. He considers that an educational process which is designed to filter out failure until just a handful of successes are left is profoundly demoralising and demotivating for the system as a whole. He says:
<quote>"What an incredible disregard of human potential to accept that 60 per cent. of our children leave school at 16, while in our competitor countries that number is 10 per cent. or fewer".</quote>
Given that there is such universal agreement with that thesis both in the industrial and in the education sector, we may ask why it is that we have failed to match our competitors, and our friends in Europe and the rest of the world.<lb/>
As the Motion before the House indicates, there is a substantial question about resources it this respect. Surely education must be given a higher priority in resourcing; that is, resourcing in buildings, in equipment and in teaching staff. As we have heard, schools, colleges, polytechnics and universities can all produce evidence of serious under-funding. We must accept that education can no longer be achieved on the cheap. As many noble Lords have said, it is an important investment in the future.<lb/>
However, the problem goes deeper than resourcing; it is also a question of attitudes and institutional arrangements. There is already considerable movement in attitudes both at school and higher education level. O-levels have been replaced by the GCSE to
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0396"/>
<col>713</col>
meet the needs of more of the children. But, as has been said, A-levels have not followed suit, despite the widespread view in industry and in the educational world that they should be broadened. One suspects that opposition to the reform of A-levels comes from a very high level in the political system.<lb/>
We may ask how far we have travelled down the road of providing access for non-traditional students. First, there is the question of the B-tec, which is an accepted alternative to A-level qualifications. B-tec students are now entering both polytechnics and universities and accounting for something like 10.5 per cent. and 4.4 per cent. of the student intake respectively. However, the facilities for B-tee students are, as I understand it, limited to a small number of schools. The initial one-year B-tee first qualification is not taught in schools. I believe that this is at the request of the DES. Perhaps the Minister will comment upon the situation. This is surely a mistake. It could act as a taster for practically-minded children who could then move across to further education where resources for B-tec nationals were available to them.<lb/>
The work of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications is again a move in the right direction. However, I have two caveats in this respect: the first concerns resourcing&#x2014;and the council is underresourced&#x2014;and the other concerns standards. While NCVQ qualifications must be acceptable and useful to industry, just as academic qualifications must be, they must also contain an element of broader transferable skills. Competence to undertake a particular job is not enough in itself; there must also be the development of the full potential of the child so that he or she can progress as far as that potential will take him or her into further and higher education.<lb/>
The National Council of Vocational Qualifications is working towards an equivalency of qualifications. That work needs to be speeded up so that vocational and academic qualifications can be interchangeable at all levels. What we need is not two routes into higher education, but a broad highway made up of many feeder roads giving opportunities to all.<lb/>
The 16 to 21 age group is but one aspect of widening access. There is the whole potential of the mature person seeking a first chance in higher education or perhaps progressing into continuing education. Given our demographic trends, that poses an urgent challenge. The challenge is both to our higher education institutions and to the providers&#x2014;the government of the day. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, higher education is geared to A-level results and a three year full-time course. For that, the student is funded. Any deviation and the student loses out.<lb/>
Universities and polytechnics are attempting to cope with the institutional constraints imposed upon them. For example, many of them are now entering into agreements for access arrangements with neighbouring colleges. Part-time degree courses are being made more available, but still account for 5 per cent. of the total only. Some institutions have
<col>714</col>
introduced modular or unit courses, as the noble Lord said; and others are planning to do so within the next few years. I am optimistic that there will be considerable growth in that whole area which need not interfere with higher education standards.<lb/>
We are not nearly beginning to address the problem yet. We shall not do so until a number of the following occur: first, non-standard entrance qualifications are encouraged right across the board, and appropriate access courses are provided on an adequate scale; secondly, part-time degrees carry the same status as full-time degrees. I am afraid that that is not always the case at present. Thirdly, universities, in particular, make better use of capital resources by extending teaching time; and, fourthly, modular courses become the norm, providing greater flexibility and choice of mode of study.<lb/>
None of that will happen unless adequate resources are made available by the Government. That resourcing would entail more teaching and back up for non-standard students, because those need more attention than A-level students. More staff and back up will also be needed for the extension of teaching time to ensure that the conditions and standards for existing staff are not encroached upon and that time is still reserved for research. It would also entail more resources for a funding system to encourage and provide on an equal basis a mix of part-time and full-time students, and a fairer grant system to provide for the needs of part-time students equally with the needs of full-time students. It would not be the same student grant system as at present; it would meet the needs of the two groups of students equally.<lb/>
There are many barriers at present which discourage entrance to higher and further education. Unless we begin vigorously to remove those barriers, we shall never exploit to the full the potential of our whole population.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03986"><member>Baroness Cox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I congratulate noble Lords opposite on choosing a topic which is timeless in importance and timely in current concern; but it will not surprise your Lordships if I disagree strongly with the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, on the diagnosis and treatment of the ills besetting education, and if I offer my own diagnosis and strongly support the Government in the remedies that they are applying.<lb/>
Before turning to concerns and criticisms, I wish to pay tribute to the many good schools and dedicated teachers who are working hard to provide good quality education in always challenging and sometimes exceedingly difficult situations. But there is evidence that not all our young people are receiving the education that they deserve and need, and public concern about standards is legitimate.<lb/>
So, first, the diagnosis: what is wrong? Given limited time, I shall focus on basics&#x2014;literacy and numeracy&#x2014;without which any education is fatally stunted. Recent research has shown disturbing evidence of many people with serious deficiencies in those essential competences. Martin Turner's data
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0397"/>
<col>715</col>
published this summer show a serious decline in reading standards of seven year-olds in eight LEAs over the past five years, with an alarming increase in the numbers and proportions of pupils unable to read properly by the age of seven. That is serious. To be unable to read by seven undermines all other educational development, and, although Martin Turner's research has been denigrated by those who find it uncomfortable, his data have not been faulted. New evidence now shows even more LEAs&#x2014;over 20, I believe&#x2014;with falling reading standards for seven year-olds. It is worrying that Martin Turner has been subject to disciplinary procedures since bringing this serious matter to public attention.<lb/>
I turn briefly from the problems of literacy of young pupils to the problems of older students aged 16 plus. Another recent publication&#x2014;by Jennifer Chew, who teaches in a sixth-form college in Surrey&#x2014;documents serious problems of literacy in pupils who had already gained good pass marks at GCSE. Those students form the select group staying on in full-time education after 16, many of them doing A-levels; yet many cannot spell words which average 11&#x2013;12 year-olds could spell way back in the 1950s; and the average spelling age of those 16 year-old students, which has been falling over the past five years, is now less than that of pupils of 13&#x00BD; years.<lb/>
Jennifer Chew also compared English-speaking English students with black Zulu-speaking pupils in South Africa. She found that the Zulu-speakers' performance compared favourably with those in the English classes although English was not their first language and their schools have fewer resources. She commented:
<quote>"The Zulu-speaking children have not only learnt to spell rather well; they also produce neat, legible hand-writing (a great deal neater and more legible at the lower end of the ability range than that of the English sixth-formers), and there was no sign that their strength in the fundamentals of literacy had been acquired at the expense of breadth and creativity".</quote>
Jennifer Chew concludes her study:
<quote>"If we want to produce school-leavers who can express themselves fluently and cogently in writing at 16 and 18, then children need to be taught to spell, punctuate and construct sentences from their very first years in primary school: if they are deprived of early instruction in literacy, the damaging consequences may be with them for life".</quote>
This is such an important piece of research that I shall place a copy in your Lordships' Library.<lb/>
I move from literacy to numeracy. We also have problems of under-achievement in numeracy. For example, Professor Prais and his colleagues at NIESR found that the great majority of British 16 year-olds were two years behind their West German counterparts in maths. I do not believe that our young people are less able so this again raises questions with serious implications for individual pupils and for us as a nation.<lb/>
How has all this happened? It is a complex problem, but I suggest that it is in part a legacy of the ideas and ideologies of the 1960s which are now held by many people in key positions in the educational
<col>716</col>
establishment, including many in teacher education and LEA inspectors or advisers. Perhaps I may quote some teachers who have written to me in desperation:
<quote>"The rot lies in the Education Authorities; whatever we do, they have the ultimate control. What do we do when so-called advisors come round observing our lessons and giving us pep talks about not being 'modern' enough? What do we do when promotion is denied us&#x2014;by authorities who operate autocratic methods?"</quote>
I quote a teacher from another part or the country:
<quote>"Until recently I have taught at a school which kept to traditional methods; our Head had kept the Inspector at bay for years. Unfortunately he [the Head] was taken ill and within a matter of weeks the Inspectors were in and the school was severely criticised for being too traditional &#x2026; no account was taken of the creditable results [the school] achieved&#x2026; I firmly believe that children should be taught, but we are so demoralised and intimidated by the Inspectorate that we are completely impotent &#x2026; you can perhaps see our problems when you realise that Martin Turner had a very difficult passage after his revelations on reading standards".</quote>
I could multiply letters like these many times over. Many dedicated teachers in our schools are victims of educational ideologies and an education establishment which imposes them. Until and unless we can free professional teachers from such influences, we condemn many of them and their pupils to ideology instead of education. Many of these reluctantly leave the state system or are frozen out of it, like those two valiant history teachers in Sussex. The state system cannot afford to lose these good teachers, therefore I suggest that one of the remedies would be to cut back on this interference from local education authority advisers and inspectors.<lb/>
Another disturbing aspect to the present situation is the lack of any official rigorous, systematic research into new teaching methods, such as the so-called "Real Books" reading methods currently being imposed again on many teachers. It is left to courageous individuals to speak out and risk disciplinary procedures, if they are unhappy about these new teaching methods. Surely, if our education establishment really wanted to serve our children well, it would rigorously evaluate innovative methods. If they work then they could be endorsed. If they fail, they should not be imposed. We now suffer from the imposition of unproven methods imposed against the better judgment of many experienced teachers. The results are reflected in part in the evidence on literacy and numeracy.<lb/>
Moving from problems to remedies, I suggest that the answer does not necessarily lie in the provision of more resources. Much research shows that schools with comparable resources and with pupils from similar catchment areas enable their pupils to achieve dramatically better exam results than neighbouring schools. They also provide a better all-round educational experience.<lb/>
While mentioning resources, as my noble friend Lord Joseph has said, it is interesting to note that the shadow Opposition spokesman for education has said that Labour in power would not necessarily be in a position to spend more on education than the present Government. So consistent pleading for more money from the Opposition Benches sounds a little paradoxical.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0398"/>
<col>717</col>
Research also shows the importance of teacher attitudes and professionalism. Rutter, Tomlinson and others have shown that it is teacher professionalism that can make all the difference to the quality of the school and the education it provides for pupils. This surely is the key to the way in which the teaching profession can regain public respect, a respect which is still affected by the damaging results of two years of industrial action which harmed the education of so many children.<lb/>
I conclude by looking at effective policies. One of the most effective and truly democratic measures is to increase parental choice and the accountability of schools to pupils, parents and the community. Initiatives like the local management of schools and grant-maintained schools do just this. Many schools are now flourishing with LMS, enjoying greater autonomy in the allocation of their budgets. Many of them are freed from local authority interference to spend their budgets on their own educational priorities, knowing their own pupils best. Grant-maintained schools are also flourishing, despite vindictive attempts by many LEAs to sabotage them.<lb/>
For example, grant-maintained schools have more applicants for teaching and non-teaching posts, compared with other local schools. They enjoy a 40 per cent. increase in pupil applications. They are spending on average 90 per cent. more than last year on books and equipment. Morale is running very high, despite threats to abolish them if a Labour Government gets into power, and despite threats that staff will never again be able to find local authority employment. So grant-maintained schools are a success story.<lb/>
There is also the hidden success story in this policy: the story of the deterrent effects of opting out which have prevented some LEAs from imposing unpopular policies. Many schools have been saved from unwelcome interference by a local authority because of their potential freedom to opt out. Because they can opt out, the local authority has withheld imposing an unwelcome intervention.<lb/>
In conclusion, we all agree that education is the most important issue concerning people today. We cannot afford to betray young people by denying them the best possible start in life. We shall not achieve the necessary improvements by Labour's tired policies of bringing everyone forcibly back into the mould of LEA-dominated "comprehensivisation", which has been shown to fail so many young people. Instead, we must encourage policies which this Government have initiated, to enhance freedom of choice and accountability. This is the only genuinely democratic way forward. I hope passionately, for the sake of the country and above all for the sake of our children, that these democratic and educationally effective policies will go from strength to strength. I hope that Britain can once again have an education system of which we can be proud, because it serves our children well.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03988"><member>Lord Annan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are discussing today what kind of education we need to make this country more productive and our children more civilised and cultivated. I wish to begin by reviewing the curriculum. Here I very much share the views of the noble Lord, Lord Joseph, that we should have had the core curriculum. However, the national curriculum is now being modified, or it was by Mr. MacGregor when he was Secretary of State.<lb/>
I do not wish to go over that ground again, but I should like to raise the nature of the sixth form curriculum. It is clear that war is about to break out over A-levels. Those who wish to retain them have to face the fact that many good judges think they are far too narrow a discipline for the last two years of school. Secondly, they think that A-levels prevent many adolescents moving into higher education.<lb/>
On the other hand, those who wish to abolish A-levels and substitute a baccalaureate also have to face two facts: first, that the French are having second thoughts about the sacred baccalaureate because it condemns adolescents to continue studying at a high level subjects for which they have no aptitude and no desire to study. Secondly, if we had a baccalaureate type of sixth form, 18-plus exam, the universities and polytechnics would institute a four-year BA and BSc degree. The short three-year first degree depends on sixth-form specialisation; the cost of prolonging it would be enormous and would militate against the desire of the Government and the Opposition to increase student numbers. The only alternative would be to hold an interim examination after two years' study and eliminate those who gained anything less than an upper second-class degree. However, such a move would be vile and unpopular.<lb/>
So, what can be done? I believe one can retain the discipline and depth of learning of A-levels and yet at the same time insist that adolescents in the sixth form must study two compulsory subjects outside those specialisations. The first compulsory subject should be the use of English. Everyone should learn how to write his or her own language clearly without jargon. Everyone should learn how to write a pr&#x00E9;cis and how to present an argument in logical form and in paragraphs.<lb/>
I did not learn what I would call practical arithmetic, but I believe that is the second compulsory subject that everyone should learn. By the term "practical arithmetic" I mean the kind of mathematics that non-mathematicians must somehow master or at least be acquainted with, for example the use and analysis of statistics and the use to which computers can be put. It is those techniques that so many of our civil servants and middle managers had to learn on the job in the past. Quite often they never do learn those techniques. Those two subjects would give just that vocational content that sixth form studies require and yet at the same time an adolescent would be able to study in depth the kind of subjects that interested him. He would not be condemned to spend many hours on five or more subjects between his GCSE and A-levels.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0399"/>
<col>719</col>
In order to carry out this measure, teachers would have to be trained to teach the subjects I have referred to. I am not talking about teachers who are already skilled mathematicians. I am talking rather about people who will need to undertake conversion courses to be able to teach these subjects. If I dared, I would impose another compulsory subject in the form of a foreign language. I suggest that the study of a foreign language should be compulsory up to 18 years plus. However, I suspect that my suggestion is impractical. Nevertheless I have a practical proposal to put to the Government. Could we not send a delegation to Holland to discover why the Dutch are such admirable linguists? One of the reasons for that is that so many Dutch parents speak English to their children when the children are still very young and continue to do so as the children grow older. We are so slow to learn from our colleagues in the European Community.<lb/>
A senior officer in ILEA concluded that the teaching of foreign languages in our schools was so unproductive that we should abolish it entirely. That is the kind of counsel of despair that I hope we shall not follow. We have a great need to learn from our colleagues in Europe.<lb/>
That brings me to the organisation of our schools. We need to learn from Germany how to organise technical education. The Butler Act of 1944 was drafted by three senior civil servants before Rab Butler ever became president of the Board of Education. Those civil servants had been evacuated to Bournemouth during the war. The civil servant responsible for secondary education and the civil servant responsible for elementary education were very powerful and able. One of them wanted grammar schools and secondary modern schools, while the other wanted comprehensive schools. The permanent secretary ruled in favour of the former but a compromise was reached on the age at which pupils transferred from primary to secondary education. The third civil servant was neither as powerful nor as able as the other two. He was responsible for technical schools. In post-1944 Britain such technical schools as existed withered away.<lb/>
I know that on both sides of the House there is a considerable difference of opinion on technical schools. Good men and women recoil from the idea of them. They ask whether our children are to be arbitrarily selected at the age of 14, for example, and deprived of their birthright; namely, a general education following the national curriculum that introduces them to the cultural glories of our country. They ask whether our children will be made to feel second-class citizens unworthy to continue in the comprehensive system. However, we should look at what happens in Germany. There large numbers of boys and girls prefer to follow a less overtly academic course. They want to fit themselves for employment when they leave school.<lb/>
The Labour Party has set its face against city technology colleges. I am sorry that it has done so but I hope the noble Baroness will acknowledge that to set up technical schools will give some children a better
<col>720</col>
chance than they have now of obtaining a productive job when they leave school which will benefit our country as well as themselves.<lb/>
I wish to mention 16-plus education. We have heard cogent and impassioned arguments this evening in favour of more funds for universities and polytechnics. I add my voice to that although I think that the need to bring inflation down to 3 or 4 per cent. has priority over everything else. On the other hand I believe that economies could be made in some other areas; namely, in the useless nuclear deterrent which this country has and which is updated at enormous cost every so often. We have ways of raising money but our educational funds depend on how productive our industry is. We are in a vicious circle at the moment in that we cannot improve education as our productivity does not improve.<lb/>
I wish to make two points about universities. First, I believe that the Treasury has often exerted a malign influence over the University Grants Committee and may well exert a malign influence over the Universities Funding Council. In 1972 the UGC suddenly received an instruction to pass on to the universities that the latter were holding far too large balances. The universities, it was decreed, were not building societies and should spend their money on educating students. However, a large part of that money was being saved for the maintenance of buildings. The effect of the measure was that the maintenance funds were depleted. I feel that the Treasury should have a consistent policy on this matter. It should lay down the percentage of an institution's funds that should be saved for the maintenance of buildings.<lb/>
I wish to emphasise the comments that the noble Lord, Lord Dainton, made in his most powerful speech on the great lack of confidence that the universities have in the leadership of the Universities Funding Council. The polytechnics' funding council has done a much better job than the UFC on finance and on organisation. I hesitate to press the case of the universities and the polytechnics further because in my opinion the post-16 sector that needs most financial help is that concerned with the technical and industrial training of our future workforce in the technical colleges and industry itself.<lb/>
In the past we have heard many complaints from the Labour Benches that the schemes of the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, for industrial training were inadequate and underfunded. I believe those complaints were justified. However, what schemes have the Government&#x2014;perhaps in future years the noble Baroness and her colleagues will have schemes in mind&#x2014;to remedy the situation? Will the Government look again at the multiple agencies and schemes that they have set up? We are told by the Government that if we are to be competitive and reduce labour costs we must have a properly trained workforce. I implore the Government therefore to send someone to Germany to find out how this aspect of training and education is tackled.<lb/>
My final point is addressed not to the Government but to present and future prime ministers. Can we not have a Secretary of State for Education who remains
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0400"/>
<col>721</col>
in office longer than two years? It is a scandal that that is regarded as a major post but when there is a reshuffle the holder of that post is always reshuffled. I am glad to say that he is always reshuffled upwards, but that process impairs the educational policy of both parties in this country. I apologise to both noble Baronesses for the fact that I cannot be present at the end of the debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03989">5.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03990"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall turn to a quite different subject&#x2014;adult and community education. This is a time when provision for the education of adults in Britain is being materially affected by a combination of demographic, industrial, legislative and institutional changes. Opportunities for adult learners are being seriously reduced.<lb/>
The education of adults has never been given a coherent place in educational planning. As a result, adult learners have merely been accommodated on the fringes of the system. Local authorities spend half of 1 per cent. of their budgets on adult education. That situation is clearly mirrored in the Education Reform Act, which says nothing about the education of adults except in relation to higher education. The Government paid lip service to the need for more adult participants but refused, despite pleas from many Members of this House, to include in the Bill any obligation to provide for them.<lb/>
It was the same story with the Government's plans for deregulating broadcasting. Hitherto, all British broadcasting has been obliged to inform, educate and entertain. In general, the new legislation replaces that requirement with an obligation on commercial companies to make a profit. Though some protection is given to schools television, adult education is likely to disappear from the most popular channels. We very nearly succeeded in changing the Bill in this House but, sadly, we were defeated when our amendments came back from the other place.<lb/>
The government report outlining plans for adult training, <i>Employment for the 1990s,</i> also recognises that if Britain is to survive economically in the 1990s it will need a better educated and trained society. Yet in that field, too, things are being made more difficult. Unemployed adults who have been studying part time rather than looking for a job risk having their benefits cut. The changes in demography &#x2014;the drop in the numbers of 16 to 19 year-olds, the increase in the numbers of the elderly and the fact that by the year 2012 there will be more people who are retired than are active in the workforce&#x2014;have been accompanied by industrial change with a major decline in jobs in manufacturing, an increase in part-time low-paid jobs in the service sector (often employing women), greater segmentation of the labour market, shorter job life and the relative decline of cities.<lb/>
Education institutions have done their best to respond to those changes. Further and higher education institutions have begun to seek adult students directly through outreach programmes, the
<col>722</col>
introduction of part-time and modular courses and also through marketing their services to employers more actively than before.<lb/>
However, in many places adult education services are being cut. The most obvious change is in inner London, where adult education and youth service staff were the only academic staff not to be guaranteed transfer to new borough authorities when ILEA was abolished. Adult education was ILEA's pride. A National Institute of Adult Continuing Education survey of all LEAs in July revealed that the poll tax has had a dramatic effect on adult education. Charge-capped authorities have been hardest hit and a significant number made cuts in their 1990&#x2013;91 budgets to avoid being capped.<lb/>
The most dramatic impact of charge capping affected Barnsley and Haringey. In Barnsley, all evening and day classes for adults have been cut except for basic education classes. In Haringey, a 50 per cent. reduction in the adult education budget has led the authority to close an adult education centre, halve provision and give priority to basic education and provision for adults with special needs. Manchester, to avoid charge capping, has made cuts which have reduced provision by 30 per cent. In Somerset, staff are being made redundant. I could go on.<lb/>
Hitherto a substantial contribution has come from community education. Community colleges, pioneered in Cambridgeshire by Henry Morris, have become popular and spread widely. They involve the whole family and encourage participation by people of all ages. The phrase used to be "The cradle to the grave"; now I hear that it is "The carrycot to the crematorium". But just as the poll tax has had a devastating effect on adult education so, I fear, may local management of schools have a similar effect on community education. A school or college now has a separate budget for its community and its other work. The two have different accounts. Imagine the bureaucracy and the trouble and staff time that must involve. The centres decide their own fees and inevitably charges go up to pay for the increased work, and the purpose of availability for the whole community, whether rich or poor, young or old, employed or unemployed, will be lost. In authorities where community education had become really well established it will probably continue, but that is by no means the case everywhere. It is a great loss.<lb/>
However, there are some gratifying developments. Over the past 15 years adult education services have developed a range of targeted programmes in adult literacy and basic education, in teaching English as a second language, in making provision for unemployed adults, people with disabilities, older adults and ethnic minorities, in family education and in return-to-study and access programmes.<lb/>
I should like to say more about literacy programmes. It is International Literacy Year but recent surveys have shown that 13 per cent. of our population have significant difficulties with basic literacy and numeracy. There has been a great effort on the part of ALBSU (the Adult Literacy and Basic
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0401"/>

Skills Unit) to involve more people through advertising, television and radio. Even so it appears that only 5 per cent. of those who need basic literacy training are receiving it. Open learning centres are operating in some places. People can just drop in and take part; they find that less embarrassing.<lb/>
One of the great strengths of adult education has been its flexibility and its ability to adapt and innovate. A significant feature of those changes is that while traditional adult education has been a service used mainly by women, many of the new opportunities are targeted at men. If the main expansion in adult education is to take place in colleges, polytechnics and universities it is critically important that issues of child care, timing of courses and financial support are tackled urgently. Otherwise the changes will merely signal a redistribution of resources from women to men.<lb/>
One success story is that at Ford, where men are chiefly the beneficiaries. The company's new employee development and assistance programme, which offers workers an opportunity to take part in courses not related to their work, has created enthusiasm. A third of the company's workforce has taken advantage of the offer of &#x00A3;200 a year to study almost any subject &#x2014;six times as many as was expected when the scheme was included in the 1987 pay deal. Eighty courses are offered. It is interesting that now the workers are choosing largely academic rather than practical subjects. There are some minority tastes&#x2014;philosophy, theology, fly fishing, Finnish, criminology and deep-sea diving. That suggests an interest in learning for its own sake, something not usually associated with assembly-line workers&#x2014;and most of the workforce left school at 16. The most popular subjects chosen now are computer sciences and German, both of which are of special use in a multinational manufacturing company. It is a rule of the scheme that it should not be a substitute for proper training necessary for specific jobs. Other companies are now offering similar programmes&#x2014;Lucas Industries, Rover, Pedigree Pet Foods and Boots, among others.<lb/>
In Northern Ireland, the Open University has developed an action for community employment programme. The university's department of community education has designed and delivered within 12 months a course which trains trainers and core staff who are giving a year's employment to some 10,000 unemployed people in a range of 300 community projects. A typical core worker will have studied correspondence texts, attended group sessions with a tutor and other core workers and taken part in residential schools. Last week certificates were awarded to more than 400 people in a ceremony held at the University of Ulster. One of the core workers described his delight that unemployed people are now moving to permanent employment and decreasing the dole figures.<lb/>
Why is it that schemes such as Ford's and the Open University's can attract and hold the enthusiastic attention of people who at 16 had written off education as useless and boring? The waste of good
<col>724</col>
potential is appalling. It is an indictment of education as it has been with its division between the academic and the vocational.<lb/>
The success and excitement of the Open University and Ford schemes spread to other institutions comes from no government initiatives, no action taken by government. With the introduction of the poll tax and LMS, the Government have reduced the opportunities for adult and community education. After 100 years of public education in this country the vast majority of school-leavers are not automatically entitled to any further education or training. We need to work in an entitlement model that empowers people to take up education or training as a right.<lb/>
The Labour Party proposes a return-to-learn entitlement. We are thinking particularly of the over-fifties, almost all of whom missed out on the post-war improvement of education. Two-thirds of today's 60 year-olds left school at 14. Only one in ten of those now aged 50 continued at school.<lb/>
Our policy is aimed at both stimulating demand for education by those aged 50 and above and improving the supply of learning opportunities directly or indirectly geared to that age group. A 57 year-old unemployed former works manager from Walsall was quoted as saying: "Age is against you right from the start. As soon as you say you are over 50, that's it". I hope that our plans and our commitment to adult, continuing and community education will alter all that; and the sooner we have a Labour Government to do it the better.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03992"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that it is appropriate for me, as another new boy in your Lordships' House, to add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, for his excellent maiden speech. I thought that he was very well informed; and, if I may say so, I admired his confidence.<lb/>
In my own maiden speech on 8th November I mentioned that for the past eight years I have represented commerce on the Council for National Academic Awards, which is the largest degree-awarding body and quality assurance agency in the country. I said then, and I feel I should repeat now, that the views that this experience has led me to hold are necessarily those of an outsider looking in on our world of higher education. As might be expected, I am afraid that those views do not accord with much of the accepted wisdom of our education establishment.<lb/>
For instance, it strikes me that there may be a <i>non sequitur</i> in the Motion that we are debating. The Motion seems to assume that if more taxpayers' money were to be poured into our state education system, the quality of its provision would be likely to improve. I think that is rather unlikely.<lb/>
For a start, looking at the general sweep of the proposition, the latest OECD figures, published today, show that we spend a larger share of our gross domestic product per pupil on education than does either Germany or Japan, which have comparatively successful systems. Nor, if we compare the pay and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0402"/>
<col>725</col>
conditions of service of, for example, a senior lecturer in a polytechnic with, shall we say, a ward sister in the National Health Service, do we seem to be doing the teachers down.<lb/>
Let us look at the senior lecturer. Senior lecturers may expect to earn up to nearly &#x00A3;24,000 per annum for a 36-week year. For each of those 36 weeks they should not have more than 18 hours' contact with their students, whom they do not relish in ratios of more than 16 students to each one of them. Their university counterparts are even better off, which may be part of the reason why their main union, NATFHE, went on strike earlier this month and may be going to do so again this week.<lb/>
Now let us look at NHS ward sisters. In outer London they earn up to some &#x00A3;17,600 for a 47-week year. For each of those 47 weeks they do a basic 37&#x00BD; hours. They often work longer, and they certainly work unsociable hours. They carry very much more responsibility than does the polytechnic lecturer, including the responsibility of making decisions which may decide whether a patient lives or dies. Our nurses' record on strike action, particularly that of the Royal College of Nursing, is rather more professional than that of our teachers.<lb/>
Returning to higher education, I shall be told that for the other 18 hours of what is for most people the normal 36-hour working week, which is not spent in contact with students, and for the 16 weeks of what the rest of us might regard as holiday, the lecturers are not idle. No, they are marking their students' papers or otherwise they are engaged in "scholarly activity" and of course our old friend "research". Yet students in higher education, especially in the softer subjects, often have less than one essay to write per week, and marking papers may therefore not be all that onerous.<lb/>
As for research and scholarly activity, I think that most of us would describe much of that as merely keeping abreast of one's subject. There are very many honourable academics who are indeed extending the frontiers of knowledge, and many who also work extremely hard for their students, but too much research and scholarly activity in higher education looks to me more like academic self-indulgence.<lb/>
Be all that as it may, there is little doubt that, by international comparison with other more successful education systems, and by national comparison with other more esteemed and hardworking professions, we are not spending too little of our taxpayers' money on education.<lb/>
Are we therefore spending some of it wrongly? I believe so. Let us look at one vitally important area which lies at the very roots of our education system &#x2014;teacher training&#x2014;which costs us about &#x00A3;300 million per annum.<lb/>
I was very impressed, as I am sure were most of your Lordships, by the very courageous statement by my noble friend Lord Joseph to the effect that he wishes that he had done more about teacher training when he was Secretary of State. I am afraid that I have to agree with him.<lb/>
<col>726</col>
The vast majority of our teachers still have to go through either the one-year Post Graduate Certificate of Education &#x2014;the PGCE&#x2014;or the three-or four-year Bachelor of Education&#x2014;the B.Ed. Merely the process of having to go through these courses puts off a lot of the best potential teachers. The standard of entry to the B.Ed is often low&#x2014;as low as two Es at A-level. Most of our primary school teachers still come from our B.Ed courses, which they join straight from school. Many, if not most, successful teachers will say that their compulsory training was not of much help to them&#x2014;or at least the non-practical element of their compulsory training was not of much help to them. Having completed the B.Ed course, only one in three will stay in teaching. Surely that is wasteful, is it not?<lb/>
So what is wrong with our teacher training? In my view, there are two main things wrong with it. One is that teacher trainers have forgotten that the essential requirement for a good teacher is a knowledge and love of his subject, and an ability to teach it. The second is that teacher training has tried to turn itself into a profession, whereas the profession is, has always been and will always be, teaching. If you ask teacher trainers, "What is the body of knowledge necessary to become a successful teacher trainer?" they cannot tell you. Genuine professionals do not have that problem. Lawyers and nurses are not similarly stuck for words, and nor for that matter are stockbrokers.<lb/>
Because teacher training as an academic discipline is largely bogus, it uses a lot of course material which is irrelevant and often damaging to our common purpose in this debate: higher quality provision. I would not want noble Lords to think that I am seeing Reds under the bed&#x2014;or rather Reds under the B.Ed &#x2014;but I have to tell your Lordships that I fear that many students on our teacher training courses are still spending too much expensive time studying questionable and politicised aspects of sociology, and not nearly enough on subject expertise and classroom discipline.<lb/>
In order to back up that accusation I could show your Lordships many examples of the course profiles in question. In the time available I can quote a course to train people how to teach home economics at a college in the leafy shires which still offers 400 hours of the irrelevant material to which I have just referred. I could even show noble Lords a course to teach people how to teach business and information technology at one of our leading polytechnics, with much the same content on offer. This is information which can be gleaned from the course profiles and reading lists. The presentation at the chalk-face can be much more virulent.<lb/>
I am aware that the Government are considering revision of our national mechanisms for quality assurance for higher education. I very much hope that they will not listen to those polytechnic directors who are asking for even greater academic autonomy from the Council for National Academic Awards than they have recently been given. In my view the teeth of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0403"/>
<col>727</col>
quality control which the CNAA has retained as a background power should, if anything, be extended across the binary line.<lb/>
I suppose I may be told that I am forgetting about the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, or CATE as she is usually called, a body recently created in an attempt to improve subject expertise. I do not have time to deal with her achievements in detail, but I am afraid to say that, on the whole, CATE is too little and too late.<lb/>
One final point about teacher training is that most of your Lordships were taught by teachers who did not suffer it. I leave it to your Lordships to decide whether the education that you received was any the worse for that, compared with what our children are receiving today.<lb/>
What is to be done? Could we redirect some of the resources that at present go to the teacher training courses toward systems likely to improve the quality of provision? Happily, I believe the answer is really quite easy. The Government have recently introduced two excellent schemes&#x2014;the Licensed and Articled Teacher Schemes&#x2014;which allow especially more mature people with a knowledge and love of their subjects to teach in our state system without being obliged to attend a teacher training course. The obvious answer is to divert funds from our existing teacher training departments to the Licensed and Articled Teacher Schemes and to expand them and other similar initiatives as vigorously as possible.<lb/>
The trouble is that these schemes are strongly opposed by the teacher trainers and, I fear, by much of the remainder of our education establishment. I even have evidence that they may not be fully supported by the teacher education branch at the Department of Education and Science. I am afraid that the Government will have to be much tougher with those interests if they wish to see any worthwhile progress along the lines I have suggested.<lb/>
While on the subject of the Government's involvement, I should like to mention the recent outstandingly successful policy of allowing polytechnics to enjoy corporate status, independent of local authority control. In the planning stage that concept too was vigorously resisted by the education establishment, to the extent that it was abandoned in 1982. However, I am sure it is safe to say that this revolution is now welcomed by every single polytechnic director, including some who owe allegiance to the party opposite. I trust that this bodes well for other similar government initiatives such as Local Management of Schools.<lb/>
There are other ideas which would reduce waste in our state education system. I think that I have time to mention just one, which has been around for some time but which, again is being vigorously opposed by entrenched academic self-interest. It is that students should be able to earn a foundation degree after two years of study as opposed to three years at the moment, or four in Scotland. They might then take another two years to earn a more specialist master's degree, and a further two for a doctorate.<lb/>
<col>728</col>
I hope that I shall not be skinned alive if I suggest that the normal academic year might be extended to 45 weeks. Two years would then give 90 weeks' study, which is not far off what the universities now deliver in three years. Higher education could thus accommodate many more students, perhaps on more practical courses. An excellent article on this proposal appeared in <i>The Times</i> on 29th October. It was written by Dr. Malcolm Frazer, chief executive of the CNAA, and by Professor Sir Graham Hills, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Strathclyde. I propose to put it in your Lordships' Library in case anyone is interested.<lb/>
I hope that what I have said goes some way to show that there is much that we could do to improve the quality of our education provision without having to spend more taxpayers' money on it. Taken together with the Government's other excellent initiatives, which I trust they will pursue with the utmost vigour through all the obfuscation which the education establishment will put in their way, I feel sure that the quality of our education provision will indeed improve enormously.</membercontribution></p>

If he were alive today he could have written more prosaically but with greater truth, "University funding collapsed in October 1990". On 23rd October 1990 the Universities Funding Council announced in its circular letter 28/90:
<quote>"The Council was disappointed by the scale of economy offered by universities' bids &#x2026; and wishes to consider the options further".</quote>
That was the end of the so-called "bidding exercise". It left the universities of this country in financial uncertainty amounting to incipient chaos. They do not know now what next year's funding will be. They do not even know when they will know.<lb/>
I must declare an interest as the Principal of St. David's University College, Lampeter. I can assure your Lordships that we have absolutely no idea what is coming next. Yet the bidding system was invented by the UFC to force universities to compete with one another. It was the UFC which made the rules and established the "guide prices"&#x2014;an unlovely term deriving, I think, from the advertisements of estate agents.<lb/>
It was the UFC which demanded the incredibly detailed returns that we had to complete. The universities collaborated and complied because the carrot dangled before their noses was the prospect of four-year funding. I can assure noble Lords that throughout last winter and spring academics and administrators did a vast amount of work. One dean in one faculty in one university calculated that she had worked 200 hours on the bidding process alone. That is the equivalent of five 40-hour weeks. Thousands of academics could say the same. It has been reliably estimated that the UFC received over 10,000 pages,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0404"/>
<col>729</col>
photocopied 50 times, in submissions for the bidding exercise. It was unquestionably a multi-million pound project. When all the documents had been considered, it was agreed that no one had broken, bent or strained any of the rules and yet the UFC discovered that the money available was not sufficient to meet the bids.<lb/>
As the chairman of the CVCP, Sir Edward Parkes, told the council, any junior lecturer could have told it as much months ago. Its own chief executive, Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, warned repeatedly of the perils that awaited it and strove mightily to mitigate the excesses of this doomed system before it was too late. He is the only person in this whole sorry exercise who emerges with his reputation enhanced.<lb/>
However, the UFC would not listen and with all the unstoppable momentum of the Gadarene swine, it plunged over the cliff and was violently choked in the sea on or about 20th October 1990. I am sorry that I do not see the noble Lord the chairman of the UFC in his place in your Lordships' House today contributing to our debate. On second thoughts, I withdraw that comment. He is probably much better employed doing his sums than in listening to me.<lb/>
But his is the very council which was appointed by government Ministers to make the universities more efficient, to make them more cost effective and to make them provide more value for money. In the past 18 months it has wasted millions, dislocated the work of all Britain's universities for more than a year and in the end has totally failed to deliver. I ask noble Lords on all sides of the House who have experience of industry and commerce this question. Would not the chairman of a company which so totally failed to meet its targets be invited to place the keys of his car on the boardroom table before he left?<lb/>
The UFC is not a conspiracy of ivory-tower intellectuals. It contains captains of industry and others who,
<quote>"have shown capacity in industrial, commercial and financial matters".</quote>
I quote from the Education Reform Act 1988. Some capacity, some reform, my Lords&#x0021; If the Government's policies and practices in higher education are to retain any shred of credibility they must move and move rapidly to clear up the mess.<lb/>
In the short term, Ministers must order the Universities Funding Council, first, to get back to four-year funding by February 1991 and, secondly, to decide and announce at once by what method it proposes to fund Britain's universities in 1991&#x2013;92. At the present moment the universities do not know where their next meal is coming from and they do not even know the recipe from which it will be cooked up. Thirdly, it must be ordered to come clean. It must tell each university openly which parts of its submitted institutional plan the UFC considers sensible and economically feasible. It must then authorise that university to get on with those parts. Only in that way can a university plan sensibly and efficiently. The Government must tell the UFC what the CBI recently told the Government:
<quote>"Before it is too late, get your act together".</quote>
<col>730</col>
In the longer term the Government themselves must decide as a matter of principle whether they will fund universities so that the quality of their output stays as it is today or, alternatively, so that it is inferior to that which it is today. This is a vital, stark policy decision and the Government must make it. I can assure noble Lords that universities have now found all the so-called efficiency gains that it is possible for them to make. There is no further mileage down that well-trodden track. It is the primrose path to the everlasting bonfire.<lb/>
The Government must now decide what they want to do and take responsibility for it. The decision must be made by the Government and not left to the universities to decide by default. Yet to be fair to Her Majesty's Government and their record on education &#x2014;I strive at all times to be fair&#x2014;there is one matter on which it is possible to record a slight but welcome satisfaction. At the opposite end of the educational spectrum from universities, in all their dissatisfaction and uncertainty, those who are responsible for the national curriculum in our schools are to be guardedly congratulated on having at last recognised the existence, and perhaps even the importance, of the arts.<lb/>
In its earliest manifestations the national curriculum was a stern and martial concentration on literacy, maths, science and technology. But after long and arduous persuasion, much of it administered by Professor Ken Robinson of Warwick University, art and music as foundation subjects are now present, with some prospect of competing fairly for space in every school's timetable. Let me urge Ministers and their officials to grow in grace and go further.<lb/>
Professor Robinson has said:
<quote>"The Government has identified science as a generic area of the national curriculum and commissioned a single working group to say what it should include. For more than 10 years, the idea has been gathering force that all arts disciplines, including drama, dance, visual arts, verbal arts and music, share a number of common processes and have related roles in education. Consequently, they should be provided for within a common policy. There is an analogy &#x2014;though not an exact parallel&#x2014;with what is needed in the arts. It would have been preferable to identify <i>the arts</i> as a generic area of the national curriculum and to have commissioned a single working group to say what an adequate arts education should include".</quote>
The Government have made a start on recognising the importance of the arts in schools. It is too little; it is too late. But it is some, and it is now. There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth. Let us hope that the repentance of those who develop the national curriculum will be a shining example to the sinners of the Universities Funding Council.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03996"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to concentrate on one aspect of education which is often overlooked. I am very glad to see that, despite the much quoted observation of the honourable Member for Mitcham and Morden, Mrs. Angela Rumbold, that she did not see what schools could do to help the emotional development of children,
<quote>"if they had the misfortune not to come from a good home",</quote>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0405"/>
<col>731</col>
the Government have, largely at the insistence of the schools, included personal and social education in the national curriculum.<lb/>
There is much talk of education for citizenship and also in certain quarters doubt is cast on whether there is any such thing as society. The project that I wish to support, and for which I shall ask the noble Minister for financial support, is one that by-passes both of those issues and yet has the beneficial effects that everybody agrees are needed. Until a few days ago I had not heard of TACADE, the Advisory Council on Drug and Alcohol Education, but I recently attended the launch of one of its projects. I am so convinced of its benefits and usefulness to the nation that I am speaking today to give it my strong support.<lb/>
The approach to personal and social education offered by the TACADE teaching resource, Skills for the Primary School Child, is already proving very popular with teachers and pupils. I urge the Minister to continue the essential support which this project has already received from the Department of Education and Science. It invested &#x00A3;49,000 in the development of the project. What is needed now is a further &#x00A3;50,000 to carry out an evaluation of the usefulness of this programme.<lb/>
In this country we are world leaders in developing this kind of educational resource. There is the potential for generating useful export earnings and also for increasing Britain's moral and intellectual standing in the world. There is no doubt that more and more schools will take up Skills for the Primary School Child. Its acceptance and use by the teaching profession is assured. But scientific rigour requires that it be properly validated. This small amount of additional funding is necessary to that end&#x2014;that is to say, a direct investment in our most important resource for the future, the children of our country.<lb/>
It both fills the yawning gap that currently exists in personal and social education in our primary schools and also changes the behaviour of children for the better. As they become more aware of their own worth and that of others, they automatically become better citizens. I failed to point out that this project was originally designed to teach children about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. But its benefits go far beyond this. Educating children in such a way that they acquire skills that make them less isolated and more sociable is far more effective than simply adding a list of national rules of behaviour to the school and home rules to which they are already subject.<lb/>
There is another factor at work here. In former times traditional ways and customs dictated codes of behaviour that were broadly accepted, whether they were enforced or consensual. In our culture during the past 100 years and in the cultures of many of our ethnic minorities during the past 20 to 30 years, the relaxing or breaking down, depending on your point of view, of traditional codes of behaviour has left young people with a bewildering sea of choices to make about how to live in an increasingly complex and even fragmented society.<lb/>
<col>732</col>
Skills for the Primary School Child creates a structured programme through which children acquire the skill of making informed choices. The process through which they do this builds closer and more caring relationships between staff and pupils and among the children themselves. I am sure that this will also do more than anything to retain teachers in education. Its initial impetus was the need to educate children about the dangers of drug, alcohol and solvent abuse, but the results go far beyond even this major remit.<lb/>
The children who participate also become less likely either to bully or to be bullied and better able to cope with situations of abuse from adults. In addition they are more self-confident and better able to relate to adults and to other children. Being given these skills and opportunities to make informed choices at an early age also greatly reduces the sense of alienation that so often sets in after the exciting newness of going to school has faded to the dreary dullness of introversion and passivity. Through that programme children become active participants in the whole process of learning, from which attitudes, values, influences and skills cannot be separated. I should like to add also that a population able to make rational, informed choices is essential for democratic government.<lb/>
In another place on 15th July 1867 on the passing of the Reform Bill of that year, Robert Lowe, Lord Sherbrooke, said that he believed that it would now be necessary to prevail on our masters to learn their letters. One hundred and twenty three years later most people can read and write, but political and social life has become far more complex. We are many different groups. We are not two nations but one could almost say several nations in one.<lb/>
Also in the economic sphere increasing specialisation, the emergence of enormous multinational conglomerate trading companies and the feeling that one is reduced to being a 25-digit reference number on a gas bill all detract from people's sense of belonging. That is dangerous; it is very dangerous.<lb/>
I believe strongly that this educational programme devised and produced by TACADE will do much to reverse those trends, to improve behaviour in schools and provide an invaluable resource in combating the evil of drug and alcohol abuse. TACADE already has a successful track record in producing effective educational resources. Skills for Adolescence, TACADE's previous project, has been in use since 1986 and is now at various stages of implementation in half the secondary schools in the country. Hertfordshire and some other counties now use Skills for Adolescence in all their secondary schools.<lb/>
As with Skills for the Primary School Child, which was a tool to combat substance abuse, there have been other proven benefits; namely, reduced levels of truancy, improvements in pupils' academic performance, increased motivation, teachers developing closer, more trusting relationships with pupils and finding discipline easier and pupils being more tolerant and mature in their relationships with their fellow pupils and with teachers. Parents who have
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0406"/>
<col>733</col>
been involved have been very enthusiastic. Indeed part of the aim and success of the Skills for Adolescence project&#x2014;I am sure that the same will apply to Skills for the Primary School Child&#x2014;has been to form a bond and partnership between parents, pupils and teachers.<lb/>
I should like to give a piece of anecdotal evidence which illustrates the wide-ranging benefits of these programmes and in particular the growth of trust between teacher and pupil. I have a letter from a teacher to a member of the TACADE staff about a teenage girl who was able to discuss for the first time the fact of and the feelings surrounding being sexually abused by a member of her family. As a result, the perpetrator was prosecuted, convicted and sent to prison. That came to light directly as a result of her participation in the Skills for Adolescence programme.<lb/>
Skills for the Primary School Child and Skills for Adolescence are having a synergistic effect in making the most of existing resources. The &#x00A3;50,000 needed to evaluate results is a relatively minute amount of money and I hope that the Government will agree to fund the study.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-03998"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the winter of 1944, not one of the best for Britain with the world at war and our economy in hock as we strove to fight for the peace to follow, I heard R.A. Butler on his education Bill and I heard Sir William on his social security provisions. At that time the mood of the country was amazing. While many noble Lords were still about the business of saving and serving democracy in various parts of the world, Britain was turning its mind to what it might do in the next 50 years to create greater opportunities and to give the children of this country a better chance to benefit from living in it than their parents had had.<lb/>
One of the most significant things which happened in education at that time was the return from the services in 1945 of prisoners of war and ex-soldiers and ex-officers, men and women. The education system of which they had been a part had taught them that they were not suitable to command or lead, that they were to be in various slots of the economic and social position. Such people had been lifted out of that by the discovery that they had brilliancies which helped to win the war.<lb/>
At this stage I want to say that it is time for the Government to point the eyes of the country optimistically forward. If anything of consequence to education is to come out of this debate, it should not be the negatives which have been so much a part of the debate so far. There has been much condemnation on various sides of people who are trying to do a good job within the system. There should be an identification of what is possible with the resources available.<lb/>
When I went into the classroom in 1945, we were given the biggest rise which teachers had until then been granted. Our eyes were pointed forward. I was a two-year trained teacher. I was a product of the poor
<col>734</col>
man's university which did so much for education in Britain up to that time. We were taught that in education only one factor was important; namely, the child. In some of the destructive and rather snide comments which have been made as regards proposals for the future, very little emphasis has been placed upon the child. I believe that we should correct that at once.<lb/>
In speaking in this debate, I must say that I have listened to long speeches by people in other debates. I have sat through them to the end. I believe that we should return to some of the principles of this House. When people contribute in a debate and make sweeping assertions which need checking, they should sit to the end of the debate and then face the music of the response which they may receive. I do not say that viciously; I say it because when I entered this House 15 years ago noble Lords were courteous to all taking part in the debates. The House should continue to live up to those high standards.<lb/>
All the research which has been carried out in my lifetime in teaching&#x2014;and I was in it until 1975&#x2014;has proved one thing; namely, that the biggest single influence on the life of a child is the attitude of his parents to the school which he attends. All my experience in classrooms and staffrooms has taught me that the biggest single influence after that is the mood of the teacher who receives the child into the class and his or her identification with the community in which they may live.<lb/>
Since 1945 and through all the administrations which have followed, the general morale of the teaching profession at infant, primary, secondary and university level has declined. The feelings which teachers have about their acceptance in society have been affected. Some of the comments made in this debate will have further depressed them and will have made them feel that what they are trying to do is not understood.<lb/>
How do we set about reconstructing the education process so that teachers today are somehow given the same sort of influence and so that they feel they have a constructive job to do in the reconvening of the community spirit which has been so badly dented? How do we set about that? We will not do it by making snide, sweeping references.<lb/>
I shall make one comment as kindly as I can. One of the saddest and most depressing remarks made in this debate&#x2014;all the more sad and depressing because she believes it&#x2014;was the remark by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, that the rot lies in the education authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-03999"><member>Baroness Cox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a point of correction, that was in a letter written to me by a teacher. Those were not my own words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04000"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I withdraw that, but the noble Baroness knows what I think. I wrote down the words "The rot lies in the education authorities". I totally accept that that was in a letter to the noble Baroness from a teacher but I shall respond to that in this way. The education which we inherited and the chances that we had&#x2014;I mean those people

<col>735</col>
who were not expensively bought out of the system&#x2014;are not the politics of envy. One of the weaknesses of cases made in this House is that some of the people making them have no knowledge of the public system because they were educated outside that system. Many Secretaries of State for Education found their first access to the public school system on the day they came into office, and only then discovered what it was all about.<lb/>
I have served under every Education Secretary since Chuter-Ede who was president of the Board of Education until 1975. There have been some superb people in office, despite the background from which they came. But it is a weakness of the case when people educated in the public side of the education system see those running it contracting their children out.<lb/>
I believe in a positive constructive way that we should analyse the value of the private school sector of the education system. If there are people who feel that they must spend &#x00A3;7,000 a year on educating their children outside the general system, we should analyse that cost. Let us ask ourselves what proportion of that cost goes to essential education. Let us cut out the snobbery, the frills, and decide what is the right level of expenditure. If it is right to say that the sum a noble Lord chooses to spend on the education of his child is &#x00A3;3.000, how can we justify arriving at sums of expenditure for the other side of the education system that may be derisory by comparison? My positive comment is that if the public school system&#x2014;by that I mean the private school system&#x2014;is so valuable to parents, we should aim suitably to fund our side of the system to move towards that other system. But let us not criticise education authorities. They must work within the system and the provisions made available to them. Many of us would not be in this House if it were not for the dedication of unpaid men and women who devoted their lives to education in the education authorities of this country.<lb/>
I do not wish to omit some of the valuable points made by Members opposite. It is true that we sometimes wonder about the emphases placed on courses in teacher education. One of the reasons I went to university at 32 years of age was that I knew instinctively that I was not equipped to face the challenge of the classroom with a new and demanding child population. It should be easier for teachers to move from the classroom into further education. It should be easier also to sustain the in-service education to which I devoted part of my life. It is not enough that the teachers close down for one day a term and toddle off to a teacher seminar to hear some bright and shining star from Bristol talk of how clever he has been&#x2014;I mean no disrespect to Bristol; wherever the man comes from.<lb/>
Perhaps I may also say that we need a far better funded system. It is current party politics in Britain to say that the Labour Party has good ideas but to ask how it will it pay for them. I am not worried about that. If we motivate the will of the nation, people will always pay for education. We must find alternatives, and some have been suggested.<lb/>
<col>736</col>
Let us return to the real grist of the mill. Evening classes have been cut back; teacher in-service education has been cut back; opportunities for leaving teaching and attending university have been cut back. Pressure on the education authorities funding has made it impossible for them to sustain some of the courses. I am not a great believer in car-boot sale funding of education. I believe that the funds should come from a proper understanding of the people and a proper dialogue with them as to how the resources should be spent. No government can write a blank cheque for education. We know that. There is no question about that.<lb/>
Let me say this. There are certain matters which suddenly became policy. As the House will know, I am interested in the education of the mentally disadvantaged and the physically handicapped. At this time it is the conventional wisdom that we integrate those kids into the main stream. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, who will be answering, on one occasion when I asked a question about this thought I was being too pessimistic. I hope I am being realistic and I shall ask a direct question on this. What I believe about optimism and pessimism is summed up in a Hungarian proverb which says that the only difference between the optimist and the pessimist is that the pessimist is better informed.<lb/>
Regarding that issue, about which I have some knowledge, I ask how we can possibly move children who have been cared for in a protected and specially designed environment to a mainstream school where the head teacher is already organising car boot sales to raise funds to buy books for the general membership of the school. How can we modify a school to take the handicapped child? When we close down the school that has been carefully looked after by the community, has received a generous funding and has been given help from all kinds of sources, we are underprivileging the underprivileged, and doing it by accident.<lb/>
I believe that every Member of this House, however educated, genuinely wants to see a better British education system. We are committed to it. Let us vote for it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04002"><member>Viscount Ridley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no doubt that the projected increase in the number of students at universities and polytechnics is most welcome and the Government deserve the highest congratulations for that policy, which we all want to see succeed. But I should like to take a few moments to consider one aspect of that expansion which needs more attention than it has so far received; that is where the extra students are to live when they arrive.<lb/>
The increase that has already happened placed considerable strain on the universities and it can only worsen. With an inevitable shortage of purpose-built accommodation there will be an inevitable increase in demand on the by now limited private rental sector. Such increase in demand has already resulted in an increase in the rents charged for rooms. It does not appear that further space to rent can or will fill much of the gap, although it may help. It is perhaps
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0408"/>
<col>737</col>
significant that many young people choose to study at northern institutions of education largely because rents there are cheaper.<lb/>
I ask the Government how they believe the universities and polytechnics can best be helped to construct more halls of residence, flats or whatever to meet the expected increase in demand; or is it their policy to make students from the poorer homes study at the place nearest to where they live so that all they need is their bus fare? If that is the case, it is a radical and unwelcome change of policy.<lb/>
In this matter I wear two hats: one a university hat and another as chairman of a building society. We tried to make the two coincide and use building society funds to finance accommodation specifically for students. Over 500 places in the North of England have been funded within the last few years. However, that is now becoming much more difficult.<lb/>
We are starting to build a hall for 126 students in Newcastle. Given the present day costs of building, that will work out at &#x00A3;13,000 for each bedspace. I hate the word "bedspace" but I cannot think of a better one. I believe we all know what it means. At current interest rates the mortgage interest alone works out at almost &#x00A3;2,000 per annum per unit. That is close to the student's annual grant of &#x00A3;2,250. Those figures assume no site costs and rates at only &#x00BD; per cent. over the base rate on a 40-year mortgage, which no bank would even contemplate. The student must pay that figure. He is thus left with only &#x00A3;250 of grant and a loan of &#x00A3;420 if he has no other income. The students are now very conscious that they are paying some part of the poll tax and have just lost housing benefit during the long vacation.<lb/>
On those figures few new flats can be constructed and will not be occupied if they are. What can be done? I do not see any way that those figures can be reduced without some kind of help from the Government. I wish I could. Funds could perhaps be channelled through the universities and polytechnics funding councils, from which source nothing has so far come; perhaps there could be a higher grant or a loan in cases of hardship. There is an access fund of &#x00A3;25 million, as noble Lords will be aware. That may help but it is widely regarded as inadequate. I am told that it has so far helped mostly those in trouble with rents in private rented accommodation.<lb/>
I am not sure of the scale of this problem nationally. I have no means of working it out. However, if we are talking about 20,000 new bed spaces over the next five years&#x2014;which assumes that not more than 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the students use them&#x2014;that might come to &#x00A3;260 million over that period. A 25 per cent. subsidy on that would be &#x00A3;13 million a year. However, the figures are written literally on the back of an envelope and I am not sure that they are accurate.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will give an indication of what they believe should be done. Will it be possible for some sort of student housing corporation to be considered in order to assist those educational
<col>738</col>
institutions which have a long-term programme and have formed a trust in partnership with financial businesses and builders; and, with the help of local authorities, find the land and guarantee the loans for the conversion of unused property? Even a guarantee to fund a shortfall after the mortgage period ended would be of great assistance and would cost nothing.<lb/>
Finally, I believe that without some assistance of that kind, the expansion of higher education, which everyone in this House very much wants to see, could be seriously jeopardised.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04004"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the previous speaker always commands the full attention of the House wherever he happens to be sitting, either on the Benches with which I normally associate him or in his present position. What he had to say was followed closely by us all; but I hope he will forgive me if I do not develop his arguments.<lb/>
We have had a memorable debate. I always find it prudent to congratulate most warmly the speaker sitting nearest to me. However, it is not only for that reason that I salute my noble friend Lord Parry. I cannot remember anyone who made a more powerful speech in an educational debate than my noble friend. His experience is certainly much more deep-rooted in education than is mine. I became engaged to be married in the waiting room of the Workers Educational Association at Stoke-on-Trent, if any noble Lords know that part of the world. In those days I taught at two state schools, and I have been a university teacher since then.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Parry spoke of education as it is, from the point of view of those who have lived through it and those who teach. I am glad that he defended the teachers. When all is said and done, they have not had a very good deal from some of the speakers today; though that does not apply to these Benches. The thought that the teachers are getting full justice is to my mind&#x2014;and it is a personal opinion&#x2014;absurd. They are not receiving justice in this country at present.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Peston opened a debate on education earlier in the year. I described his speech as brilliant and comprehensive. I said that he had not had time to deal with religion but no doubt would be leaving that to my noble friend Lady Blackstone, who was winding up. I must make the same comment today, but the other way round. The noble Baroness made a speech that was brilliant and comprehensive and no doubt left the subject of religion for my noble friend Lord Peston when he winds up. Between them, in the course of these two debates, no doubt the subject will be covered.<lb/>
Religion might conceivably have been covered from the Bishops' Bench. It is not for me, an Anglican defector of 50 years' standing, to say anything critical about the absence of bishops today. However, considering that this is a debate on education, we might have hoped for an important contribution from the ecclesiastical Bench. I realise that I may be completely out of touch and that they have special
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0409"/>
<col>739</col>
reasons for not being here. As I am incapable of taking their place, I leave what is, to me, the most important of all educational subjects for the bishops to deal with on the next occasion, and for my noble friend Lord Peston when he winds up.<lb/>
I venture to deal with the polytechnics. I had thought of saying something about the noble Lord, Lord Annan, but he is not in the Chamber at present so those remarks will also have to be passed over. The noble Lord is on record, during an earlier debate, as describing the polytechnics as the great success story of the 1980s. On that point, at least, I agree with him. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, also agrees, as does the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I was not entirely happy about some of the later remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson; but I know that his heart is in the right place in regard to polytechnics. His other remarks will no doubt be dealt with firmly by my noble Friend Lord Peston.<lb/>
The facts are reasonably familiar. Incidentally, this is National Polytechnics Week, which celebrates the 21st anniversary of the creation of modern polytechnics. I hope that all noble Lords are doing something about that. I do not know what the noble Baroness, Lady Blotch, is doing, but perhaps she will tell the House what the Government have in mind for National Polytechnics Week. I am not sure that she is even wearing a badge&#x0021; At any rate, this is National Polytechnics Week, and the polytechnics have been described by the noble Lord, Lord Annan, as a great success story.<lb/>
It has often been said in these debates&#x2014;perhaps too often by me, but one cannot repeat the truth too often&#x2014;that polytechnics are the largest sector in higher education and cover over 55 per cent. of higher education students. I shall not go into detail at this time of night, but that gives some indication of their significance. It is generally accepted&#x2014;it has never been denied&#x2014;that their standards are comparable with those of the universities. We can therefore accept that they are doing a fine job.<lb/>
However, what are the Government doing to assist the polytechnics? Again, I have made these points on previous occasions; but until the Government improve their record, I am afraid that I shall keep on repeating them. It would be nice to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Annan, has to say in this regard because I respect his views. If anyone wishes to read a brilliant book, I suggest that they read his book called <i>Our Age,</i> which has just been published. I do not agree with the book in all respects; but if one wishes to have one's mind provoked into active thought, I suggest reading that book.<lb/>
I refer to the binary line. I should have thought that the time has now come to announce the end of the binary line. I know that on an earlier occasion I said that I had once defended the binary line; but that was many years ago when I was younger and more foolish and was some sort of ministerial hack, so I hope your Lordships will not count that against me. The binary line has had it. We do not want it any more.<lb/>
<col>740</col>
We should consider a few facts in regard to polytechnics. The achievements of the polytechnics have been carried out on 40 per cent. less funding per student than for comparable students in universities. Is anybody in this House able to justify the universities' position? I hope that the Minister will not. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Annan, might, but perhaps he has moved beyond that position. However, the nation is getting polytechnic education on the cheap. I hope that that will not continue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04005"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl suggesting that the universities should be brought down to the polytechnic unit of resource?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04006"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that that is a feed question in order to obtain a conclusive answer. The noble Lord cannot imagine that I am off my head. Of course I do not suggest any such thing. I have to be a little more offensive to the noble Lord than I had intended to be because if he making that suggestion, he should not continue his career in higher education but should go back to school. I did not intend to be offensive, but since such a ridiculous question has been put to me I cannot help but reply on the same lines.<lb/>
It seems to me that the position will get worse. According to my figures&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04007"><member>Lord Dainton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that the polytechnics do not cover any of the expensive subjects such as medicine, dentistry, agriculture, or veterinary science? There is no point in taking average figures unless one takes account of the great range of unit costs. If one makes the proper allowances, the situation is entirely different.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04008"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad of that even more expert comment from the noble Lord. However, the polytechnics consider that they should be given facilities for research that are at present being denied them. That situation alters the balance in the other direction. The situation will worsen. In that regard I do not think that the remarks of the noble Lord, who is highly expert, are helpful. The income per student will fall yet again. That cannot be due to any change in the curriculum. The income per student will fall again, adding to the decline of 20 per cent. per student over the past 10 years. The Government keep praising the polytechnics, but what are they doing about the situation? They are doing them down.<lb/>
Either one accepts the polytechnics on the same basis as the universities and gives them parity of esteem or one does not. I plead for parity of esteem, for an end of the binary system and for funding on the same basis. I hope that the noble Baroness, who showed good will in regard to polytechnics on the last occasion, will be able to say something encouraging on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04010"><member>Baroness Park of Monmouth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I will he forgiven for confining my remarks to Oxford, a university which has its fair share of poor undergraduates. I make no apology for covering some of the ground that has already been covered by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the noble Viscount,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0410"/>
<col>741</col>
Lord Ridley, because I should like to talk about access funds. I am talking about Oxford because that is what I know about. My own educational credentials are that I was educated by a correspondence course until I was 11 years of age; then I went to an excellent London secondary school, and then I went to Oxford on a state scholarship. Therefore, I know what it is like not to be rich.<lb/>
I welcome a great deal of what the Government have done but I remain deeply concerned about the access funds both for undergraduates and postgraduates and for the funding of postgraduates in general. The noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffbam Prior, has dealt with that matter in a masterly maiden speech.<lb/>
According to the Secretary of State, &#x00A3;25 million was to be allocated to the access fund in 1990/91 to alleviate in particular student hardship arising from the removal of students from the social security system. Fourteen million pounds was for undergraduates, &#x00A3;6 million for postgraduates and &#x00A3;5 million for students in further education. So far, the University Funding Council has received a total of &#x00A3;9.42 million for the universities, and of that Oxford's share is &#x00A3;360,000.<lb/>
A survey that was conducted by the Student Financial Support Monitoring Unit, which works very closely with both the university and the city, estimated that claims on the fund to replace lost housing benefit and income support will probably be in the region of &#x00A3;1.5 million.<lb/>
It is clear, as the universities and many others warned, that the access funds will be wholly inadequate. It is a very great pity that the amendment that was initiated in this House advocating the restoration of housing benefit for some students had to be ruled out on grounds of privilege. In Oxford, students have to pay an average of over &#x00A3;40 a week for the whole calendar year, for the year that many of them have to live out of college. The colleges are trying to build more accommodation and the university and colleges together have bought property to meet the urgent need this year.<lb/>
It must be clear that a top-up loan of &#x00A3;420, a maintenance grant&#x2014;what is left of it&#x2014;which has not been adjusted since 1979, and an access fund of well under half a million pounds for undergraduates and postgraduates cannot possibly compensate for the withdrawal of housing and social security benefits. Many students will suffer great financial hardship. That is a very expensive way to run a railway, since it is likely to lead to a high drop-out rate&#x2014;something which we have not so far experienced.<lb/>
Severe stress amongst students is very wasteful. For those doing postgraduate work the situation is especially serious because they receive no top up loan. Those students with Research Council and British Academy grants receive &#x00A3;3,725 per annum. The university estimates that no one can survive without a minimum of &#x00A3;4,800. Postgraduates are expected to work on their research for the full calendar year less
<col>742</col>
four weeks and they are under pressure to complete their doctorates in three years. Therefore, they cannot do lucrative jobs in order to earn more money, even if that situation were academically desirable.<lb/>
Successive Secretaries of State have been concerned that the resources of the country&#x2014;in this case the universities&#x2014;should be wisely used. The Government's paper, <i>The Development of Higher Education in the 1990s,</i> stated that the future health of higher education and its funding from public and private sources depended significantly upon its own success in generating the qualified manpower that the country needs and which is vital to the country's economic performance.<lb/>
I have always been energetic in promoting the links between industry and education, but in applying a purely financial yardstick to the entire issue of funding, the Government are putting the seed corn of all our academic institutions at risk.<lb/>
In the face of such relentless stress graduates will not undertake the postgraduate work which will sustain research. The number of British postgraduate students in Oxford has dropped by one-third since 1980 and the situation is now becoming dramatic. The same drastic fall has been observed in the United States over the past five years and there it has been justifiably described as leading to the decimation of the ranks of the young academics&#x2014;the seed corn. It cannot but lead to a serious erosion of the quality of university life both in teaching and in research. Why do we have universities with a superb reputation for their research if our own postgraduates cannot afford to work there? Our own physics fellow in my college of Somerville, who is one of this year's Fellows of the Royal Society, steadily loses her best postgraduates to the United States, and the only reason for that is money.<lb/>
I know that Her Majesty's Government are concerned about the quality of academic life and that no public purse is bottomless, but I appeal to the Secretary of State's vision and common sense. I ask him to listen to the universities, to find a way to meet the special needs of postgraduates and meanwhile to review and significantly increase the access funds.<lb/>
As a country, we cannot afford to put short-term financial arguments before the long-term needs of education, which is in itself our human riches and investment. To put it another way, quality costs money. As the Council for Industry and Higher Education stated three years ago, at present the United Kingdom's plans for the development of highly educated people are at odds with its ambitions for renewal and growth.<lb/>
In 1989 the previous Secretary of State reaffirmed his commitment to a doubling of numbers in higher education over the next 25 years. I firmly believe that the Government genuinely want to achieve that position, but it will not happen if the financial hurdles for future postgraduates, many of whom should be teaching the next generation of students, are made higher and higher. Education is a national necessity and not a luxury.<lb/>

We have been speaking about foreign languages and most of our debates concern communication and persuading people to listen to us. I took a year off to learn Russian when I was in the Foreign Office and I was sent to a Russian family in Paris to do my practical. They were very stern and rigorous and used to take me out to dinner parties where everyone was forbidden to speak to me except in Russian. Therefore my conversation was considerably limited in the early months. On the very first occasion when I had a conversation of any kind, my neighbour said to me very carefully and slowly in Russian, "What is your favourite sport?" He thought that that was a suitable question to ask a young English woman. I could not think of any sports in Russian until I finally remembered the word for "swimming". I said to him equally slowly and clearly, "I am very fond of swimming." He looked horrified. Unfortunately, I then remembered the word for "long distance" and I said, "I am particularly fond of long-distance swimming." After that, he would not speak to me again. Luckily the hostess had overheard this conversation and at the end of the dinner she broke the rules and asked me in French, "Why did you say that extraordinary thing to Prince so and so?" I told her that "swimming" was the only word that I could remember that was a sport. She said, "What a pity. You did not say that." I said, "What did I say?" She said, "You told him you were very fond of spitting."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04012"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a 13 year-old girl I know who attends one of the best comprehensive schools in Norfolk was asked to do a biology project on blood. There were no textbooks to take home so she went to her school library. There were no relevant books there. Being a resourceful girl, she went to her central public library only to find, on increasingly empty shelves, one relevant book: an elderly tome on anatomy. She took it home, copied out large chunks of it, confessing that she did not really understand very much of it. Such incidents are replicated up and down the country. At primary level, at secondary level and at higher education level, our education system is starved of books. As headmasters will testify, after dedicated teachers and supportive homes, it is books that contribute most to children's progress. It is on that subject that I should like to make a few remarks today.<lb/>
Book expenditure, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, has already reminded us, has been declining throughout the 1980s. In cash terms, it was &#x00A3;65 million in 1981. By 1988&#x2013;89 book expenditure had risen to just &#x00A3;75 million. Had it kept pace with inflation, it would have been nearer &#x00A3;110 million. In other words, there was a real cut of some &#x00A3;35 million. Indeed, between 1987&#x2013;88 and 1988&#x2013;89, half of the English counties cut expenditure on books both in real terms and in cash terms.<lb/>
With local management of schools, that situation has now become worse, especially for smaller schools with staffs of perhaps only 10, and where staffs are mature, experienced and stable. Under LMS, schools are funded on average salaries but have to pay actual
<col>744</col>
salaries. Such schools are therefore penalised for the older and experienced staff they have and find themselves too often in budget deficit. The governors of three or four of the first and middle schools to whom I was talking last weekend find themselves with budget deficits of from &#x00A3;20,000 to &#x00A3;30,000 on budgets of around &#x00A3;250,000. All expect to see their classroom size rising from below 30 to 36 or more, and all expect to cut by at least 50 per cent. the hours they can offer to children with special needs. First schools are dropping rising-fives entry, and middle schools are ending expenditure on music, craft and design. Internal repairs and decoration are being left undone. In all of those cases, one or two of their most experienced teachers face the sack.<lb/>
As for capitation&#x2014;books and equipment&#x2014;one headmaster who helped to pilot LMS has already had to cut his book budget by half in two years. Another does not expect to buy any books for the next three years. A third cannot even fund pencils and paper&#x2014;that is left to the PTA&#x2014;let alone meet the requirements of the national curriculum, let alone buy books. I emphasise that those are all good schools with the benefit of experienced staff, and being penalised for it. Under LMS they face a budget deficit which is felt particularly by capitation. How many noble Lords would want their children or grandchildren to attend schools so severely under-resourced?<lb/>
The book stock of secondary schools is also dire. In 1989 HMIs surveyed the 58 school libraries of six local education authorities. They reported:
<quote>"In some schools, more than 70 per cent. of the stock is obsolete".</quote>
Because the stock is old, the children do not use the books. The HMIs reported that in Barnsley one school had 36 loans from its library in a month. Another school library had 72 fiction titles&#x2014;22 had not been borrowed for 15 years. Kent's 140 secondary schools had on average 1.5 library books per pupil: the library of an average Kent secondary school would probably go into half a dozen suburban bookcases: the HMIs recommend 10 books per child. By any standards, these are desperate figures and reflect the low amount of money being spent.<lb/>
I suggest that as a result of those problems the demands of the national curriculum are not being met, project work for GCSEs and A-levels cannot be resourced and A/S-levels cannot be mounted. When we lose books, education loses depth and breadth at the same time.<lb/>
Can our children turn to public libraries? They might but for the fact that over the past 10 years the opening hours of public libraries have been cut by 15 per cent., and public library book funds have been slashed in real terms by almost one third.<lb/>
The situation is equally bad in universities. If one asks students what is their greatest academic problem, they will not say essays or examinations, they will say getting hold of the books. With frozen grants, they cannot buy them. They turn to the university libraries. Yet as book prices have risen by nearly 40 per cent. in the past five years, and science monographs by 100 per cent., and as acquisition budgets have been barely
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0412"/>
<col>745</col>
constant in cash terms, the number of books bought by many universities has virtually halved. One university has bought 17,000 fewer books in the past five years than in the previous five years even though student numbers have risen.<lb/>
Many universities now stop buying books in March. Next year many will stop buying in January. In some universities no science books are being bought at all, since science periodicals have to be protected and they are escalating in cost even faster than books, at some 18 per cent. a year. <i>Chemical Abstracts,</i> which are essential reading, cost more than &#x00A3;8,000 for a single year's run of one copy. If you break the run, you destroy the value of the periodical. As periodicals topslice university library budgets, less money is left for other books to meet the needs of more and more students. Unless we can fund book purchase properly, as well as student grants, we shall not be able to sustain three-year honours degree courses, since the library is the hub of the academic community.<lb/>
Under-investment is equally dire in the area of scientific equipment. In 1989 the advisory board to the research councils surveyed all British universities but one, and five polytechnics. It identified 16,000 pieces of research equipment such as microscopes. According to the advisory board, 14 per cent. was inadequate or obsolete; 17 per cent. was in poor condition or inoperable; and 37 per cent. of it was more than 10 years old. Over four-fifths of all university departments reported that they were unable to perform or had seriously to delay critical experiments, due to lack of equipment. Investment of nearly &#x00A3;453 million is needed to make good the backlog on an equipment stock whose replacement value is now some &#x00A3;600 million.<lb/>
As the dean of chemistry from my own university reported:
<quote>"Visitors from other UK departments are usually favourably impressed. Those from the USA or other industrialised countries are amazed that we cope with so little equipment and that so much of it is obsolescent or obsolete".</quote>
This is the research on which this country's scientific innovation rests. Yet despite the report, the Government have again funded their ear-marked equipment grant to universities by less than inflation. I do not think the Government can know what is happening inside our schools as concerns books and inside our universities as concerns books and equipment. If they do know, they are being unbelievably complacent. The &#x00A3;15 million MacGregor money for national curriculum development and the &#x00A3;9 million Baker money for universities was welcome but woefully inadequate.<lb/>
Books are about literacy in primary schools. They are about skills, and overcoming handicap and deprivation. They are about examination projects; they are about the national curriculum; they are about cost-effectiveness and they are about research. They make possible all of those things. However, I should like to suggest that books are more than that; they allow pupils and students&#x2014;that is, our children&#x2014;to
<col>746</col>
roam freely and imaginatively in other times, other places and other cultures. To under-fund books is to under-equip minds and to under-resource all our futures. I suggest that that is what this Government are doing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04013">7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04014"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in great difficulty about how to open my contribution to this debate. My noble friend Lord Longford mentioned my failure to discuss the subject of religion on the last occasion I spoke. I shall tell him that, quite honestly, if I were a free agent I would devote the whole of my speech to that subject. However, I am not a free agent for a reason that he will understand. Some years ago my wife told me that under no circumstances should I ever express my views on religion in public; indeed, if she had her way, I would not express them in private. I should point out to my noble friend that underlying all my views on education are classical liberal principles&#x2014;that is, principles of freedom of thought and freedom of expression&#x2014;and certainly therefore I shall never be one to prevent those in the religious business from expressing their views on education. I only wish that they would show a similar tolerance towards people who share my views on the matter.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Blackstone used the word "investment" in the Motion which is before the House. I shall say a few words on that aspect of the matter in a moment. However, I believe that she would agree, as we all do, that education must not just be thought of as an investment. First and foremost, it must be a valuable experience in its own right. I know that we have discussed many technical matters today but one must not lose sight of the fact that these are marvellous years and the young people must appreciate what they are doing at the time they are being educated.<lb/>
I turn now to concentrate on investment. I hope that there is one aspect upon which we can agree when we discuss education. I trust that we can scotch once and for all the canard which is often put forward by noble Lords opposite about wealth only being created in the private sector. If one ever needed a case to prove that that is nonsense, surely it comes to light when we consider that education takes place largely in the public sector. The one reason I bridle so much whenever I hear noble Lords opposite producing that clich&#x00E9; is that I wonder what they think the rest of us do and have done with our lives.<lb/>
As a university teacher, I believe that I have been a wealth creator, as have my colleagues. When I look around at my students who go to work in the City of London as foreign exchange dealers, and into banks and building societies&#x2014;I do not deny that they are creating wealth&#x2014;I think that one ought to ask how they have been able to do so. Without boasting, I believe that they can do so in part because I told them how to do it. Therefore, if they are wealth creators I feel that I am also a wealth creator.<lb/>
My second observation on investment relates specifically to the importance of nursery schools, which my noble friend emphasised. The interesting
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0413"/>
<col>747</col>
factor about such schools is that they are a particularly good investment in the child. Such investment pays off over the longest period imaginable. By definition it starts to pay off, as it were, 17 years earlier than investment in higher education. Moreover, that pay-off in itself is an educational pay-off, at least in part, in so far as we wish children to derive the most out of primary and secondary schools. In my opinion we can and must lay the foundation in nursery schools. Curiously enough, the right honourable lady the Prime Minister used to hold that view about 20 years ago. One wonders what happened to the impetus for nursery schools on that side of the political divide. Therefore, in arguing for investment in education I should especially argue the case for nursery schools.<lb/>
I should like now to say a few words about the national curriculum. The curriculum as sketched out at present is recognised by everyone as being overloaded and too complex. It is certainly not helpful to children at the lower end of the ability scale. My noble friend Lady Phillips pointed out that the use of the expression "non-academic" is pejorative and tends to put such young people down. I agree with her. However, the difficulty is in finding another expression for people whose interests are not primarily academic.<lb/>
The main objection to the curriculum in its present form is precisely that which we put forward when we debated the matter two or three years ago; namely, that it squeezes out so many other valuable activities in the arts and also, as we have now discovered, in sports. I find the situation extremely worrying. It is especially worrying and upsetting because during my early days in your Lordships' House we debated what became the Education Act 1988. I worked with my noble friend Lady David and learnt much about how the House operates.<lb/>
I found most upsetting that one could put down an amendment &#x2014;I did so with the noble Lord, Lord Joseph, who I regret is not present in the Chamber but who reminded us of the occasion&#x2014;which was not at all contrary to the spirit of the Government's legislation. Many of us argued at the time that it was actually helpful to their objectives and moreover it was supported by Members on all sides of the House. The amendment concentrated on the importance of giving the core curriculum the central role and not insisting upon the remainder, even though much of that was desirable.<lb/>
However, one can put down such an amendment and it can simply be rejected by the government spokesman on the grounds that the Government do not want an amendment. That is a completely unreasonable and irrational rejection, after which they bring in the so-called backwoodsmen&#x2014;I suppose I should refer to them as backwoodspersons&#x2014;who do not listen to the debate but who are required to traipse through the Lobby simply to ensure that the Government get their own way. The Government then spend the succeeding five years trying to undo what they insisted upon. That is exactly what the right honourable gentleman the previous Secretary of State for Education and Science was doing. My guess is that
<col>748</col>
the present Secretary of State will continue with the unravelling of something which could have been avoided in the first place. I have learnt that lesson, and I hope that in the near future when we are in government I shall remember it in terms of giving practical responses to sensible suggestions from the other side.<lb/>
I should now like to turn my attention to higher education and the question of quality. Other noble Lords&#x2014;especially my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris and the noble Lord, Lord Dainton&#x2014;dealt with the disaster of the UFC. I was somewhat doubtful about the UFC; but I cannot pretend to have predicted that it would turn out to be the calamity which we currently see. I also find it curious to note that the chairman of the UFC did not feel it worth while to speak in the debate or even to listen to what anyone else had to say. I suppose he feels that spreading alarm and despondency throughout the universities is a higher priority.<lb/>
In my view the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Dainton, are correct. However, my worry goes further than that. I echo the view on higher education expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Of course you cannot have quality on the cheap. However, we still talk about maintaining standards and say that the crisis is yet to come. I am not so confident about that prediction. I believe that it is at least possible that standards are falling. I am as strong a supporter of the polytechnics as are my noble friend Lord Longford and others; but I am also concerned a bout whether standards may be falling in that area.<lb/>
When I refer to standards, I refer to educational standards. I do not see it as a kind of batch process where we consider how quickly we can get the young people through their education and ram stuff into them. I have always argued that I could teach all the economics I know to my students in much less time. Indeed, I could teach almost anyone to pass an economics degree within a very short time, mainly because I am quite good at explaining learning. I do not remotely regard that as having anything to do with education and in practice I do not do it. What worries me especially about polytechnics is that they will be pushed more and more into exercising so-called efficiency measures&#x2014;namely, those with adverse staff student ratios&#x2014;which do not produce good education. I must therefore issue that word of warning.<lb/>
More generally, on the question of higher education, I should like to ask the noble Baroness whether she can give us any information as to what is happening about the loan scheme. Perhaps she will be able to tell us what rate of interest students will be charged under the scheme. I also echo the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth. I should like to know what is happening about access funds, which do not seem to be operating as we had expected. Again, that is not surprising because of the enormous administrative problems connected with those funds. I also noticed that when in trouble the Government revert to one of their standard responses&#x2014;they have decided to look yet again at student
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0414"/>
<col>749</col>
unions, as I understand it, with a view to making out that they are somehow the cause of all the problems. I find that hard to believe.<lb/>
I have two further remarks to make while I am on the subject of higher education. I wish to echo all those who have congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, on his speech. I agree with his remarks about postgraduate and postdoctoral education. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, made similar remarks. It is a subject to which we shall perhaps return in a short debate because it is one which is worth exploring in much more detail in its own right.<lb/>
Having congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, I have, with great regret, to take the opposite view of the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. My initial response on hearing his contribution was to say, "My time is valuable, and I shall ignore his contribution". The best I can say about it is that it was ill informed, but speaking as a teacher I found his remarks about teachers to be defamatory. I wondered whether he understood what he was saying. I should like to know whether the Minister will say that his views are the Government's views. Having been a teacher all my life I have always worked 60 to 70 hours a week. When my friends in the private sector were having Saturdays and Sundays off to play golf or to be at home with their children I was still working.<lb/>
I wonder what the noble Lord thinks that he is saying. I take such remarks personally. He is making them not just to me but to other noble Lords, because the House is full of academics and former academics. That is just not the type of thing to say. Perhaps I may finish with a further insult to the noble Lord. He said that he was part of the CNAA. Having been on the CNAA and having felt that it had done a good job, I believe that the time has come to free the polytechnics from it. Having heard his contribution to the debate I am now doubly certain that I am right in my views.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04015"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I began by saying that I was an outsider looking in at the unusual world of higher education. The figures, timings and so on that I gave clearly related to senior lecturers in the polytechnics. I contrasted their workload with the workload of an NHS ward sister. I did not go into details of the teachers' load at other levels of the system and all the rest of it. That was the precise comparison that I was seeking to make.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04016"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord said&#x2014;I greatly resented it&#x2014;that teachers were not professional. Teachers are professionals and always have been.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04017"><member>Lord Pearson of Rannoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry, I did not say that. I said that the problem with teacher trainers is that they try to make themselves into a profession when the profession is in fact teaching.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04018"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems to get worse. The noble Lord has made it clear that he does not understand anything about this subject. Perhaps I may make it clear to him that at the height of my
<col>750</col>
powers as a professor I taught for six hours a week only, in the sense that he uses the words, but I was still doing 70 to 80 hours' work a week. I was doing as much work as a ward sister, although I would not claim that I was as useful as a ward sister. I have rather strong views about what happens in hospitals. I was not that useful, but I was as useful as the average managing director of a private enterprise company, who has never worked my kind of hours. The noble Lord should know that if he makes such defamatory remarks some of us will respond strongly to them.<lb/>
Finally on the universities, I came across a quotation from Sam Johnson the other day which I thought that your Lordships might like to hear. He said:
<quote>"It is surely not without just reproach that a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending and the wealth increasing denies any participation in its prosperity to its literary societies. While its merchants or its nobles are raising palaces it suffers its universities to moulder into dust".</quote>
I shall turn now to teachers. Teachers are always criticised for what goes wrong and for not achieving the impossible. What one must do&#x2014;I was pleased that many noble Lords said this&#x2014;is praise them for what goes right. A great deal goes right in our schools because of the teachers' devotion, and, I add, despite the Government. It may well be, as my noble friend Lady Phillips said, that we interfere too much with the teachers but we often interfere with cause when we are trying to be helpful. We must learn not to be unhelpful. That teachers are excessively criticised is patent, and that we must stick up for them is an obligation.<lb/>
I shall refer to the noble Lord, Lord Joseph, merely because he attacked my noble friend, and so implicitly attacked me, because we did not tell him enough about Labour Party policies. I have been around your Lordships' House for a while, and one of the favourite things that the Government do is to say, "We are doing something stupid. What is your policy?" The answer is that we are not going to do that same stupid thing. The Government then say that we have no policies. That is absurd. Our policy is not to be stupid.<lb/>
I remember the football Bill. "We are going to engage in a ludicrous membership scheme. What are you going to do?" Our answer was that we were not going to engage in that ludicrous football membership scheme. The classic example is the poll tax. The Government introduced the poll tax, something that all noble Lords opposite now bitterly regret. The Government said to us, "What is your policy?" Our policy was that we were not going to introduce the poll tax. The list continues. My favourite example is the CTCs. We shall not continue with them. As my noble friend Lady Blackstone pointed out, nor will the Government.<lb/>
When it comes to resources we have the ultimate in stupidity. I pointed out in our economic debate last week that the Government's great error was to waste the oil revenues on a great consumer boom. The Government then said, "What will you do?" The answer is that we would not have wasted the oil revenues. It will be hard for us to regain them, but
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0415"/>
<col>751</col>
when the Government insist on being stupid they cannot criticise us merely because we say that we shall not be stupid.<lb/>
I have some more positive things to say. I can give your Lordships a list of the policies that we shall be pushing strongly. First and foremost, we shall be pushing for greater parental participation in all school activities. The evidence is overwhelming that the more one can include parents the more productive the education system will be. Our concept of the home/school contract is a good one. We shall press it strongly. We shall reform the A-levels. There is nothing to stop the Government doing so. They have had the evidence for some time, but they have invented the bizarre concept of the gold standard of the A-levels, when in fact they are saying that they are willing to ruin everything that happens in schools to, as it were, meet some of the demands of some university teachers.<lb/>
What we must do is ask what is the best education for 16 to 18 year-olds and then see what follows for higher education. That is the rational way. We shall reform teacher training; introduce the education council; improve the induction of new teachers; improve career development; and provide incentives for staying on in the teaching profession, something that is vital in any reform of the pay structure. We shall also provide better rewards for career teachers to encourage them to stay in teaching. One of the great problems, and it is even true of higher education, is that if one wants to get on one has to give up doing the very thing that one is there for; namely, teaching.<lb/>
As I have said, we shall reform the national curriculum and also introduce a four-year technical and vocational traineeship with a core curriculum. We shall hope that that will be an entrance qualification to higher education for those who want it. I have said, as have my noble friends, that we shall give education the highest priority, but that must of course be subject to the proviso that the first task of the next government must be to extricate the economy from the mess that this Government have got it into. Excellent forecaster though I am, I admit that I have great difficulty predicting the precise scale of the economic problems that will confront us. On present forecasts, it looks as though it will be nothing short of disastrous and quite a lot of time will be needed to sort it out. Therefore, it would be foolhardy of me or of any of my right honourable and honourable friends to commit any sum of money before saving the economy.<lb/>
I am confident that, as we have done in the past, we shall solve these problems, and the resources that will then become available will be channelled so far as possible into education. We shall do that for two reasons. First, our children and young people deserve it. That is exactly the point made by my noble friend Lord Parry when he said, paraphrasing Tawney, that what the wealthy desire for their children we desire and will guarantee for all children. That seems to me to be the fundamental principle of education in which I have believed all my life. The other reason is the principle that my noble friend Lady Blackstone emphasised: we will channel resources into education
<col>752</col>
and training because they are an investment. Indeed, they are the investment that we need if our long-term economic future is to be safeguarded.<lb/>
Perhaps I may throw the points back to the noble Baroness. Having said what we will do and how we will fight the next election, I am not sure on what programme the present Government will fight the election; nor am I sure who will do the fighting. I am even less sure whom they will fight against. However, we shall emphasise our commitment to education; we shall emphasise our commitment to raising standards and finding suitable resources. I believe that we will be able to persuade the electorate that that is one among many reasons why we deserve the victory which I am sure is now within our grasp.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04019">7.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04020"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I start by offering to my noble friend Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior my most hearty congratulations for a splendid speech. He brought all the wealth of his experience and talents to bear on this debate. We look forward with enormous enthusiasm to his participation in debates in the House. For the record, I should point out that Swaffham Prior is in Cambridgeshire, not Norfolk.<lb/>
This has been a wide-ranging debate. The Motion is extremely wide ranging and it will be almost impossible for me to do justice to it in my response, but I shall do what I can in the time available.<lb/>
No one, either on this side or in the whole House, can possibly argue against the desirability of increasing investment in the education system at all stages and of improving the quality of what is provided. However, as other noble Lords have indicated, a serious debate depends upon propositions about relative priorities, about how much more should be spent and at the expense of what competing claims. I fear that such propositions have not been well argued by noble Lords, except by the noble Lord, Lord Peston. He simply said that he would not do what we do.<lb/>
We have had vigorous and hypercritical speeches from the noble Baronesses, Lady Blackstone and Lady Hollis, and less vigorous from the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who always manages to temper what he has to say with an understanding of some of the actions of the Government.<lb/>
All the criticisms being ranged against the Government today come from a party whose record bears no comparison whatever with ours over the past 10 years. Under the Labour Government, spending on education fell by &#x00A3;1.6 billion in real terms. Spending as a percentage of GNP fell one percentage point. Teachers' pay rose by only 6 per cent., and under this Government in real terms it rose by 39 per cent. Classes were larger; fewer young people stayed on at school; when the Labour Party left office it was only 40 per cent. but that figure has now risen to 55 per cent.<lb/>
More recently, on 8th February 1990, the newspaper the <i>Independent</i> pointed out that successive Labour Governments and numerous Labour local authorities must bear their share of responsibility for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0416"/>
<col>753</col>
the unhappy way in which education theory and practice have evolved over the past 25 years. Forced to acknowledge that it is the Conservative Government which has made the running in the reforming of schools, the Labour Party has spent most of its time criticising, often unjustly, the state of our schools and achieving little except the demoralisation of teachers. The <i>Independent</i> continued that Labour's last outline of its policy is contained in the document <i>Looking to the Future,</i> which was published in May, 1990. It rests on three principles: more spending, more bureaucracy and no choice.<lb/>
Tomorrow a document will be published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It will be available for all noble Lords to read. The document opens with the statement that Britain devotes a proportionately bigger share of national income to education than the United States, Japan or Germany. It continues with many more favourable statistics about what Britain is doing for our young people in this country.<lb/>
The Government share the desire to increase the quality of education and have a coherent programme for achieving that generally uncontroversial objective. I shall come to that in a moment. As to the investment of public money, we should all like to be able to afford to invest more. However, the Government can point to the following.<lb/>
In the Autumn Statement the week before last, we announced a 16 per cent. increase in standard spending for schools, and a 10.5 per cent. increase in expenditure on higher education. These represent increases in real terms of 10 per cent. and 4.5 per cent. respectively over the comparable figures for 1990&#x2013;91. These figures plainly demonstrate that the Government will continue to invest in improving standards. Perhaps I may comment to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that he said he was tired of hearing statistics; but these are real statistics, real resources, which go to our schools to provide education for our young people.<lb/>
We hear much about crumbling school buildings; and the Government recognise that there is more to do to improve the fabric. A Select Committee in another place has reported on the maintenance of schools. At present that report is with the Secretary of State and his response to it is being prepared. The publication of the report is very much a matter for that Select Committee. However, again all noble Baronesses have exaggerated the figures on that issue.<lb/>
Capital investment on schools has been substantial. Local authorities and governors of voluntary schools have spent nearly &#x00A3;2.6 billion since 1986. This year capital guidelines for education are being increased to &#x00A3;538 million in 1991&#x2013;92; an 11 per cent. increase on the sum available this year. This year's figure was a 37 per cent. increase on last year. Grants to voluntary schools will increase by 21 per cent.<lb/>
Spending per pupil in nursery and primary schools rose by 35 per cent. between 1979 and 1988. That is again in real terms. Spending per secondary pupil rose
<col>754</col>
by nearly 50 per cent. over the same period; and overall spending in both sectors rose by over 40 per cent., again in real terms.<lb/>
As to the implied reproach in the terms of the Motion put by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, I must say that it costs nothing for Opposition Members to claim that they will spend even more "as resources allow". I hope that she and other noble Lords acknowledge the difficult judgments involved in striking the right balance between public expenditure on the one hand and on the other the investment in industry on which the future of our economy largely depends.<lb/>
There is just one more statistic. By next year, one in five of all young people will enter higher education, compared with only one in eight at the end of the last decade when the Labour Party left office. The Government recognise that there is more to achieve, but I do not think that we need to be unduly apologetic about current levels of investment.<lb/>
There is a very proper desire to improve standards of education. This is of vital interest to us all. In this country, as in others, higher standards are a necessary condition of economic growth and greater cultural and spiritual awareness. We neglect them all at our peril. This Government have put higher standards at the top of their educational agenda and have taken major steps to achieve them. We are particularly anxious at suggestions that in some key areas&#x2014;reading and computation, for example&#x2014;standards may have slipped.<lb/>
It would be wholly wrong to say that standards are in general decline. There have been notable improvements. This year, record numbers of pupils gained GCSE with grades at least the equivalent of the old O-level, and nearly all pupils now leave school with at least a pass in English and mathematics. I take note of the value of those passes that young people achieve, and I took careful note of what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. Although too many pupils still leave education too early, our performance relative to that of our European neighbours is steadily improving. Last year, over 55 per cent. stayed on in full-time education when they reached 16&#x2014;that is a 7 per cent. increase in three years&#x2014;with record numbers going on successfully to A-levels.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, did not include in the figures she quoted those staying on in education outside the school system nor those undertaking part-time education beyond the age of 16. The figure for young people undertaking education and training both in and outside schools is a staggering 90 per cent.<lb/>
It was clear by the mid-eighties, however, that improvements such as these were simply too slow to keep up with our national expectations or with progress overseas. The time had come for action&#x2014;not a quick fix but reforms which would go to the heart of the problem and set us on a course for solid and lasting success. The national curriculum is such a reform; through it the Government are providing for the first time a clear framework for the teaching and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0417"/>
<col>755</col>
assessment of 10 foundation subjects in all our state schools. Teachers, parents and pupils everywhere will know what they are aiming for and how it can be achieved.<lb/>
The arrangements for each subject are being constructed in the most careful and systematic way. They take the example of the best and replicate it for the benefit of all our schools. There is extensive consultation in every case. The statutory orders for English, maths, science and technology have already been made and are being implemented in schools. There are encouraging early signs that teaching and learning are beginning to improve in consequence. Eventually, we believe, the national curriculum will have far-reaching effects in raising standards but we must beware of expecting instant success.<lb/>
Part of the purpose of the national curriculum is to ensure that all pupils get a broad, balanced education and to ensure that all follow a curriculum that keeps up the core subjects of English, maths and a proper course of science through to the end of compulsory schooling. We are making good progress in these directions now, although much remains to be done &#x2014;for example, in providing modern foreign language study for all to the age of 16.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Annan, is not with us but I must say that I believe we have gone a long way towards achieving the objective that he sought. The national curriculum which this Government have introduced gives us for the first time a clear framework within which these improvements can be secured. Meanwhile there is still unease and no magic way of dispelling it. Parents are worried when they see reports that reading standards may have fallen in some areas. We do not scoff at such reports. I wish to thank my noble friend for bringing that point to our attention. While we have not yet substantiated the report referred to, we need to take criticism seriously. Employers seek a higher calibre of recruits. We have to be sensitive to those concerns, and we are.<lb/>
Recently concern has focused on reading capability at the age of seven. HM inspectors over the years have been able to point to much good and effective work in teaching young children to read, so we must beware of talking genuine progress down. But, recognising public concern, the Government have asked the School Examinations and Assessment Council to survey the available evidence on reading skills at the age of seven and HM inspectors have been focusing on the teaching of reading in their inspections of primary schools this autumn term. This will give a clearer national picture and an opportunity to take stock before the full impact of the national curriculum is felt.<lb/>
I have explained how the national curriculum provides clear goals which challenge and stretch pupils to their full potential, but that is only half the story. Through regular assessment, teachers and parents can get hard information about pupils' attainments against those goals. That information will enable teachers to plan classroom work to the best advantage and tackle the needs of pupils both individually and collectively. From next year it will begin to be
<col>756</col>
supplemented by assessment against benchmarks for the country as a whole. Those benchmarks will be absolute tests. The first national assessment will be for seven year-olds and will focus quite properly on the fundamentals of schooling: literacy, numeracy and basic scientific skills.<lb/>
We are tackling long-standing problems which have called for new and radical solutions. That is why the Education Reform Act introduced such important changes in the way schools are run.<lb/>
All but a handful of LEAs have introduced schemes for the local management of schools. On a personal note, I am glad to recall that Cambridgeshire was one of the first LEAS to pioneer the idea of greater financial delegation. Local management will give schools fairer shares of the education budget and greater autonomy in the management of their affairs. The Local Management of Schools scheme does not in itself alter the total resources available, but it distributes them in a more open way, based on better and clearer criteria, and it improves the effective deployment of resources. The challenge is to implement the Education Reform Act. That, in the Government's view, is the way to raise standards.<lb/>
I wish to say a few words about grant maintained schools. The increase from 18 grant maintained schools in September 1989 to 44 in September 1990 has been most encouraging. To date, 55 applications for grant maintained status have been approved. This reinforces the Government's belief that the grant maintained sector is here to stay. Where grant maintained schools have been established, there is evidence that they are popular and oversubscribed.<lb/>
I have already mentioned improvements in the proportion of young people staying on in full-time education when they reach the age of 16. We have set in hand a programme of work towards improving the standard and relevance of post-16 education through proposals for future AS and A-level syllabuses; work on the core skills&#x2014;those were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Annan&#x2014;recommended by the National Curriculum Council to ensure that all courses have a measure of breadth and balance; and work to promote vocational qualifications and to improve the status of vocational qualifications. I shall elaborate on that point. The Government are committed to ensuring that the education and training system for post-16 year-olds caters for all. We want young people aged 16 to 19 in schools, in further education and in work to develop the skills they will need in an increasingly complex world.<lb/>
We are committed to increasing post-16 year olds' participation. As I have said, over 55 per cent. of our young people now continue in full-time education at 16. However, we must not be apathetic about that. Improvements in participation must not be at the expense of standards. That would be a hollow victory. We intend to build on the best of the current systems. I am speaking of the academic system of A-level and AS examinations.<lb/>
We noted what the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said. The Government have not set their face against
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0418"/>
<col>757</col>
reform but they have certainly set their face against any kind of compromise as regards standards. A-levels will remain and standards will not be compromised. However, we have talked about readdressing the issue of balance and breadth. A-levels are more popular than they have ever been. The new AS courses, which cover half the ground of an A-level but to the same standard are also increasingly popular. We are committed to maintaining and improving, where possible, the standards of these examinations. We expect towards the end of the year to receive some proposals from the School Examinations and Assessment Council as to how that might best be done. We will look at any such proposals very carefully, particularly in the context of their possible impact on standards. My colleagues in the Government have made it clear that they could not accept any proposals which put at risk the benchmark of A-level excellence by either reducing the depth of study or undermining the essential content which existing A-levels require in order to obtain a given grade.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Perry of Walton, argued for more breadth but also catalogued the reasons why we should not neglect depth. I believe that we have addressed both the points that the noble Lord made. Should the council decide to propose changes in present practice, the onus would be on the council and on those who supported it to demonstrate clearly that standards would not be compromised and that the changes would be fully justified.<lb/>
We recognise that A-level and AS examinations are only currently taken by around 30 per cent. of all young people. We want to see this proportion increase but, for a majority, vocational qualifications are more appropriate. That is why we are encouraging more young people to follow the vocational route. We want national vocational qualifications to have a higher profile and a more prestigious place in our national education provision. The Government are considering the scope which exists for more vocational qualifications to be available in schools. We want to make it much easier for students to move between the two streams. I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, that we are taking seriously a proposition made to us by BTEC on BTEC first courses in maintained schools. As I have already said, we are committed to a broader and more balanced curriculum.<lb/>
I shall turn now to the under-fives. I am conscious that I have not yet mentioned the education of the under-fives. I must repair that omission before I say more about post-compulsory education. The Government set store by the present diversity of provision for these young children. The spectrum of provision is very wide-ranging, from nursery schools and classes to workplace creches, day nurseries and childminders. This reflects the widely varying requirements of children and their parents and allows many parents a choice between alternatives. This is healthy as they are best placed to judge their own and their children's needs. But parents can and should
<col>758</col>
have the opportunity to play a leading role in the education of their children. This is the philosophy on which the playgroup movement is built. I am sure that noble Lords will join me in paying tribute to the work of pre-school playgroups up and down the countryside.<lb/>
Noble Lords will know that the Government have always emphasised quality. For that reason my honourable friend who is now Minister of State in the Home Office was earlier commissioned to chair a committee of inquiry with a group of experts to look into the quality of the educational experience which should be offered to three and four year-olds. The Government are concerned to improve educational content across various settings, a point for which the committee's terms of reference allowed. The committee's report is now with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who is considering it. Noble Lords will also be aware of the measures in the Children Act last year to improve local co-ordination of care and educational provision.<lb/>
Teacher supply has also been mentioned. I could go on for ever and repeat, as I often do at the Dispatch Box, the enormous number of measures that we have put in place to help on that front. Action on pay is one of a number of measures to improve teacher recruitment. For example, this year's pay settlement helped LEAs in London to offer incentives to attract more teachers. There are also other measures, including a new education support grant for returners and mature entrants; bursaries for prospective teachers of maths, physics and technology; and a work-experience scheme to give students a taste of teaching before they make up their minds about careers.<lb/>
I believe that the views of all noble Lords in this Chamber should be respected. I noted what my noble friend Lord Pearson said and I shall give careful consideration to it. He welcomed the licensed and articled teacher routes which provide a way into teaching for those who do not want to go back to college in the traditional way. More than 50 LEAs have applied for and received training grants for licensed teachers. The scheme is proving timely and attractive for people who choose that route into teaching.<lb/>
The Government will continue to recognise the importance of investment in the education system. A very important point raised in the debate concerned the Universities Funding Council, which was mentioned by many noble Lords. The Government are manifestly investing additional resources in the expansion of higher education. Again the figures compare very favourably with those of the party of noble Lords opposite. We are entitled to look for greater cost efficiency. As we have seen in the past, that is not inconsistent with the maintenance of quality. However, the Universities Funding Council has obviously not had an easy time. I have noted noble Lords' comments that it has not deserved one. However, the Government share the disappointment of the Universities Funding Council at the universities' response to the bidding exercise.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0419"/>
<col>759</col>
The common aim now must be the early establishment of a sound basis for the future which <i>inter alia</i> provides universities with an appropriate planning period. That is doubtless one of the matters that the Universities Funding Council will have considered at its meeting today.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and others have reminded us that higher education is about more than numbers. I should like to deal briefly with the issues of purpose and quality. The Government fully accept that the pursuit of knowledge lies at the heart of higher education. Higher education also of course yields a range of personal, social, cultural and economic benefits. It does not detract from any of those complementary purposes to seek to ensure that they are met in cost-effective ways.<lb/>
The nature of higher education means that responsibility for content and quality lies essentially in the hands of individual institutions. Therefore, expansion to date has been in institutions whose quality is envied in Europe and elsewhere. As that expansion continues, the nature of higher education may change as new client groups come into scope.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady David, raised the subject of adult and continuing education. I am glad to say that that is not an area of education which is neglected in your Lordships' House. Nearly 3&#x00BD; million adults in England and Wales enrol each year in some form of education. Courses range widely: degree courses, at the Open University, Bitkbeck College and elsewhere; retraining courses at many levels; basic skill courses; philosophy; do-it-yourself and keep-fit classes; and much else. There are many providers: local education authorities, further and higher education institutions, voluntary and community organisations and indeed the media.<lb/>
The Government's stance is to identify at national level needs which may be inadequately met. I want to lay particular stress on two. First, the fostering of access to higher education continues to be a leading strand of our policy. The special access courses have an important part to play here: the number of courses in England has risen from 130 in 1984 to 522 last year. Last year we persuaded the CNAA and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals to establish an access course recognition group to safeguard standards and to promote the currency of the courses within higher education.<lb/>
Our other priority is to promote activity in support of the skills of the workforce. I give two examples. We have placed much emphasis on updating and retraining. There has been average growth of some 20 per cent. a year in enrolments for such work in further and higher education. Our target is that by 1992 10 per cent. of the workforce a year should be undertaking such training in further and higher education. We look to universities, polytechnics and colleges to integrate such work into the normal work of their institutions.<lb/>
No less important is our support for adult basic education. Our record in supporting the adult literacy programme is a good one.<lb/>
<col>760</col>
I know that I must now wind up my speech, but I should like to say to the noble Earl, Lord Longford, that I shall continue to give unequivocal and enthusiastic support for the work of the polytechnics. I am not sure what I shall do to celebrate polytechnics week. Perhaps I should write to my son, who is engaged on a very successful course at a polytechnic at this moment.<lb/>
I join with the noble Lord, Lord Parry, in paying tribute to councillors who serve on local education authorities up and down the land. I served for many years on a local education authority. However, I should like to say, as I said many times in my own authority, that no school in Cambridgeshire was a better school just because I went to a great many local education authority meetings. Schools were better schools if they had good staff, good head teachers, responsive parents and responsive children. That is what makes good schools, not councillors attending meetings.<lb/>
On the subject of TACADE I should like to say that the DES has already contributed &#x00A3;50,000 towards the cost of the project during the past three years. The DES has also contributed &#x00A3;9,000 towards other TACADE initiatives and has committed a further &#x00A3;30,000 to assist TACADE in raising private sector funding to support its further work. The department has therefore provided grant of almost &#x00A3;90,000 to TACADE since 1987. However, if TACADE wishes to submit to the department details and costings and its valuation of proposals for the project relating to skills for the primary school child, funding will be considered. Of course no guarantee of either full or partial support can be given in advance of any application.<lb/>
I have been beaten by time and I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for not addressing all the other points. I shall of course write to noble Lords.<lb/>
We recognise the need for vigilance over the standards of public examinations. We have clearly identified the need for greater rigour and clarity in the organisation and assessment of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools. We shall not be satisfied until far more young people take part in full-time education and training. We shall aim for further cost-effective expansion in higher education. This Government have shown a steady determination in their pursuit of quality throughout the last decade and under successive Secretaries of State&#x2014;and I noted the point made about the rapidity with which successive Secretaries of State have moved on from the department. I can talk, my Lords. I am the third Minister to have my job in the department since July.<lb/>
The Education Reform Act has set the agenda for the next 10 years. As in any great matter, we shall not be satisfied until the reforms are thoroughly in place. I hope that I have replied to most of the points raised in the debate. As I promised, I shall write to noble Lords with further details if they wish.</membercontribution></p>

I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for taking the time and trouble to reply to many of the points raised. There were of course a number of issues on which I could not entirely agree with her. Similarly, there were points raised by other noble Lords on the Benches opposite which we would wish to take up on another occasion.<lb/>
However, there are two points on which I felt that the Minister was particularly complacent and to which we shall want to return. I was very surprised to hear her remarks about 16 to 19 year-old participation, particularly in relation to participation rates in other countries. It may be the case that there is now some relative improvement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04025"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Baroness will forgive me for interrupting.

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04026"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was referring to participation in full-time education. The Minister tried to bring in part-time participation, where the figures are different. The issues involved are quite different. We are talking about young people on work-based training courses as well.<lb/>
I also felt that she was somewhat complacent in her remarks about the funding of higher education, in which there is a continued squeeze on the unit of resource in both our universities and polytechnics. That is true again this year in the latest settlement when set against the Government's expectation that student numbers should increase by 5 per cent.<lb/>
We shall want to come back on other occasions to many of those issues. We shall table Motions for further debates on the subject of education, perhaps, as my noble friend Lord Peston said, in some cases short debates rather than five-hour debates.<lb/>
It remains for me once again to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, on his excellent maiden speech and to thank all noble Lords who have contributed to this debate. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.<lb/>

<title>Gaming (Amendment) Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04027">7.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04028"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. Some noble Lords have expressed a small measure of curiosity about the
<col>762</col>
contents of the Bill that we shall discuss this evening and the fact that I am moving it. In the course of my remarks I hope that that curiosity will be satisfied.<lb/>
The Bill carries out one task in particular in seeking to amend Section 31 of the Gaming Act 1968. That Act governs the operation of commercial casinos in England, Wales and Scotland. It also regulates other forms of gaming. The single amendment proposed by the Bill before us will affect only the approximately 120 premises (as of this evening, I believe that there are 119) which are currently licensed in Great Britain to provide casino games such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat and dice. I mentioned Great Britain. Your Lordships will note that the Bill does not apply to Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The sole purpose of the Bill is to allow a casino to have on its premises up to a maximum of four jackpot gaming machines, as they are known. Under the 1968 Act the present limit is two such machines. That limit has applied since the Act came into force approximately 20 years ago. The change which an increase from two to four machines, as proposed by the Bill, will represent is significantly less than the limit which was recommended by the Royal Commission on Gambling in 1978. Its report reasoned that the number of jackpot machines permitted should be related to the size of the particular casino and specifically to the number of gaming tables on the premises. The report cautioned&#x2014;I quote:
<quote>"No one wants to see jackpot machines installed in serried ranks in the way they are in Las Vegas casinos or in clubs in some parts of Australia".</quote>
It added the observation that:
<quote>"most [British] casino proprietors themselves would dislike this prospect, which they would see as bringing about a detrimental change in the character and atmosphere of their establishments".</quote>
Those are two important reservations.<lb/>
I hasten to add that I have no interest in those areas. I have never been to Australia although I must confess&#x2014;and noble Lords may be surprised to hear this&#x2014;that I spent an interesting but unprofitable evening in Las Vegas as part of a parliamentary delegation studying defence, not gambling. I had a view of the gambling areas in Las Vegas, and it was a sight that I would not recommend to your Lordships or anyone of similar disposition.<lb/>
In taking account of the two reservations which I mentioned as part of the Royal Commission's report of 1978, the commission concluded that:
<quote>"licensed casinos should be allowed to install one jackpot machine for every two gaming tables at the premises on which gaming licence duty is paid".</quote>
That was a logical formula, but the Bill does not go nearly so far. It would not allow a casino with 12 tables to install six machines, or another casino with 24 tables to have up to a dozen machines. The Bill would apply a universal limit of four machines to any one premises. The reason is that the Gaming Board for Great Britain, which is the statutory body set up under the 1968 Act to regulate gaming in this country, is concerned that:
<quote>"the special character of casinos in Great Britain should not be altered".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0421"/>
<col>763</col>
However, the board accepts that:
<quote>"the number of machines could be doubled without detriment but that four represents a limit which it would be undesirable to exceed".</quote>
The Gaming Board has said that it is prepared to lend its support to what the Bill which is before us this evening proposes. That is very valuable support and I express my gratitude to the board for its comments and the support that it gave to me and to this Bill.<lb/>
The board adds the proviso that it would only allow the support that it has expressed so far on the basis that the stipulated maxima for stakes and prizes remain the same for all jackpot machines regardless of the premises in which they are sited. There is nothing in the Bill which would alter that basis.<lb/>
I shall not take your Lordships down the interesting avenue of different gaming machines. I shall simply refer to jackpot machines, which are the concern of this Bill. There are other machines called amusement-with-prizes machines but jackpot machines are regarded as primarily for gambling. The stipulated maxima to which the board's proviso referred are currently a stake of 20p for a maximum prize of &#x00A3;150.<lb/>
Under the 1968 Act, the so-called jackpot machines are confined to premises which are licensed and for that particular category your Lordships will find that the premises are casinos and bingo clubs. Alternatively they are confined to premises which are registered. Those cover sports, political and similar types of members' clubs, and miners' welfare institutes, which are spelt out in interesting detail in the schedules to the 1968 Gaming Act. The current maxima for stakes and prizes were agreed in 1987 by an organisation called BACTA (the British Amusement Catering Trades Association) and the board. I understand that BACTA has a great interest in these types of jackpot machine.<lb/>
The number of jackpot machines throughout Great Britain might arouse your Lordships' curiosity. According to the figures given by Customs and Excise, in the year ended 31st March 1989&#x2014;the latest year for which figures are available&#x2014;there were in Great Britain over 190,000 amusement-with-prizes machines (to which the Bill does not refer) and approximately 41,000 jackpot machines. However, of those 41,000 jackpot machines, not more than 232 machines were on casino premises, which are the only premises in Great Britain specifically licensed for what I shall call professional gaming. In fact there were even fewer than that number because, although each of the 116 casinos in 1989 was entitled to two jackpot machines, some of them (I understand about three or four) had none of those machines at all. A casino is permitted to apply instead for a specified number of amusementwith-prizes machines under a direction by its local licensing authority. I understand that some casinos are able to choose amusement-with-prizes machines in place of jackpot machines. Those are separate machines not covered by the Bill. However, casinos cannot have both. The Bill spells out the number of jackpot machines and the premises.<lb/>
While most of the casinos that I have mentioned opt for the two jackpot entitlement with their casino
<col>764</col>
licence, a few high stake casinos in London prefer no gaming machines. I understand that at present there are 119 casinos in England, Wales and Scotland of which 103 are in England, four in Wales and no fewer than 12 in Scotland. Thus, the measure proposed in the Bill adds no more than about 0.5 per cent. &#x2014;a minuscule number&#x2014;to the 40,000 jackpot machines around the country.<lb/>
Noble Lords may ask: why bother? Only 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. of the adult population in Great Britain frequent casinos. However, it was precisely to meet the demand for professional or hard gaming by that minority that the licensing of casinos under strict regulations was introduced in the 1968 Act, with great skill and effort. I stress that point. To ensure that there is no emergence of public gaming houses, or easy access for those who might be unfamiliar with such games, casinos have to be clubs to which the general public&#x2014;even your Lordships&#x2014;will have no access save as a club member, and guests who have made a deliberate, considered decision to join that club. No one can enter the gaming taking place&#x2014;whether at tables or on machines&#x2014;unless they are over 18 years of age and members of the club who have signed at those premises a declaration of intention to take part in gaming in those casinos, and have then waited 48 hours before being allowed admission to play. That point may settle some points that have been raised by noble Lords to me in informal discussions.<lb/>
Would noble Lords consider what other premises are safer, more secure, or more suited to the siting of gambling machines? Over the past 20 years, since the limit of two jackpots for each casino came into force with the Gaming Act, attendances have somewhat naturally increased. I understand that the largest group in the operation of provincial casinos has seen growth of some 10 per cent. per annum in all but one year of a five-year period in its number of members and players.<lb/>
Even noble Lords who do not frequent casinos, or have no interest in these licensed gaming machines, may agree that it is unreasonable that casino club members and their guests who can play roulette, blackjack and dice without let or hindrance must queue up if they wish to play on one of the two jackpot machines. The maximum stake on such machines is 10p or 20p. That is a considerably reduced stake compared with the stakes which will be wagered on any other of the tables in that casino. They must queue up for no other reason than the arbitrary limit of two machines. That limit was set nearly two decades ago. The Royal Commission on Gambling recognised the anomaly 12 years ago. I have quoted a reference to your Lordships. It has not yet been found possible for the Government to find any time to amend legislation to remedy that point.<lb/>
The remedy that I propose in the Bill is fairly simple. Section 31 of the original 1968 Act defines a jackpot machine by specifying the manner in which it must operate and the premises to which, as a gambling machine, it must be confined. The limits on stakes and prizes have already been mentioned. The premises are
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0422"/>
<col>765</col>
referred to in parenthesis in Clause 1 of the new Bill, and in Section 31 of the Gaming Act 1968. Clause 1 refers to,
<quote>"(use of machines by virtue of licence or registration)".</quote>
Premises under licence are casinos and bingo clubs. However, bingo clubs are excluded from the effect of the amendment in the proposed new subsection (2) (a). The words are again in parenthesis. Both casinos and bingo clubs are licensed under Part II of the original 1968 Act.<lb/>
Premises under registration are clubs or miners' welfare institutes registered under Part III, within which Section 31 of the 1968 Act falls, which are concerned entirely with machines, or Part II of the 1968 Act which deals with kinds of gaming other than on machines. Thus Clause 1(2) (a) of the amending Bill raises the limit from two jackpot machines to four on licensed casino premises other than bingo premises. Paragraph (b) maintains the limit of two such machines "in any other case". In other words, the provisions refer to bingo and all clubs and miners' welfare institutes which are registered, whether under Part II or III of the 1968 Act.<lb/>
In the light of the very proper constraints that we have in this country on certain types of gaming, I wish to stress again that the amending Bill to the Gaming Act 1968 would be confined in its effect to casinos alone, and to no other premises. The number of casinos is small. They are places specifically licensed for gambling under very tight and professional control, with inspection by the Gaming Board and the police.<lb/>
The change would be less than the limit recommended by the Royal Commission in 1978, which I read to your Lordships earlier. There is nothing in the proposal which would militate against the social objectives of the Gaming Act. I am advised that the Gaming Board supports the measure. I know that we have the support of the current chairman of the Gaming Board, together with the very distinguished past chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. Sadly, through my fault in arranging the debate for this evening, he has to be away. However, I believe that he is with us in spirit although he cannot be here.<lb/>
I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench will not object to what I have set out in the Bill. I await his remarks and those of the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, with interest. I understand that the trade associations and national bodies who represent other users of the jackpot machines, whether licensed or registered, have no objections. Those organisations include the Bingo Association of Great Britain, the Clubs and Institutes Union, the Royal British Legion and other similar clubs.<lb/>
I apologise that I have spoken for longer than I should have done. The Bill is simple and I believe effective. Above all, it has the support of the Gaming Board, which supervises the gaming that takes place in casinos which are professionally and well run. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.<lb/>
<col>766</col>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time &#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04029">8.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04030"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, I thank the noble Lord for his very full and clear explanation of the Bill. One of the merits of the Bill is that it is not too difficult to understand. The noble Lord has made quite certain that there is no part about which we are not clear.<lb/>
We on these Benches have no objection to the changes proposed in the Bill for the following reasons. We understand, as the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, has explained, that it is not inconsistent with the Rothschild Royal Commission on Gambling report which recommended that casinos might be permitted an even larger number of machines than is proposed in the Bill. We are very glad that it has the blessing of the Rothschild report. We also understand that the Home Office is happy with the Bill. That too must be in its favour.<lb/>
We support the change because it is asked for on practical grounds rather than with the aim of attracting more people into the premises and therefore increasing the number of people who gamble. As the noble Lord made clear, the Gaming Board for Great Britain has no objection to the change because it is restricted to casinos where gambling already takes place. At this point I wish to stress that we on this side of the House are against&#x2014;I am speaking outside the Bill&#x2014;an increase in the number of gaming machines because young people and previous non-gamblers might be attracted.<lb/>
I remember the first time I spoke from this Front Bench. The subject was amusement arcades and the anxiety that was felt then was that many schoolchildren were being drawn by the excitement and glamour of these machines. That led to truancy from school and on to petty crime in order to gain money to pay for gambling. The children became quite hooked on it.<lb/>
I am a non-gambler although I seem to have spoken on this subject on many occasions. It is wrong to try to attract non-gamblers towards that pastime. I understand the reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, as to why casinos wish to increase the number of machines. There are increasing numbers of people who go to casinos and there are queues for the two machines on the premises. The queues increase and therefore an addition in the number of machines would make life better generally in these clubs.<lb/>
I wish to ask the noble Lord a couple of questions on the points about which I am not quite clear. I am not sure whether I should ask the noble Lord the questions or whether the Minister who is to respond will be able to deal with them. I should like to know the number of machines currently being operated in casinos. The noble Lord gave some figures but I was not clear whether he was referring to the number of machines in casinos or the number of machines in general. Can the Minister or the noble Lord tell me whether the number of machines in casinos has
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0423"/>
<col>767</col>
increased or decreased since 1968? I should like to be given an estimate of the increase in the number of machines which is expected as a result of the Bill.<lb/>
Can the Minister or the noble Lord tell me whether the Bill will require any changes to the licences currently held by casino operators or whether they can operate with the licences already held? I should also like to know whether Her Majesty's Government have received representations from any other interested parties. I understand that working men's clubs feel that there is an anomaly in that casinos are able to increase their number of machines whereas the clubs, which also have an increasing number of clients, are not allowed to add to their total of machines under the Bill. Can the Minister say whether the Government have had representations from any other organisations which are affected by this Bill?<lb/>
In principle, we certainly agree with the objective of the Bill. It will improve life within casinos and provide practical help in increasing the number of machines. We wish the noble Lord success with the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04031">8.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04032"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be helpful if I indicate the Government's view of the Bill which my noble friend Lord Lyell has introduced and explained to us in a very full manner.<lb/>
We see the proposal in the Bill to increase from two to four the number of jackpot gaming machines permitted in casinos as a modest proposal which fits well within the established framework of gambling in this country. Because jackpot machines provide for a much harder form of gambling than the common amusement-with-prizes machine, or fruit machine as it is usually referred to, their number and location are closely prescribed by law. Only premises licensed or registered under the Gaming Act 1968 are entitled to install these machines and Section 31 of the Act limits them to two each.<lb/>
As my noble friend pointed out, as long ago as 1979 the Rothschild Royal Commission on Gambling concluded that it was anomalous for premises expressly set aside for hard gaming to be treated on an equal footing with, for example, a village cricket club. By way of a remedy the commission adopted the proposal put forward by the British Casino Association&#x2014;I am pleased to see that the chairman of that body, the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, is in his place this evening&#x2014;namely, that a casino's entitlement to jackpot machines be linked to the number of gaming tables, and recommended a ratio of one machine for every two tables. Such an arrangement is in our view no longer practicable.<lb/>
The Royal Commission's recommendation was made when gaming duty was assessed, partly on the number of gaming tables, and casino proprietors were under an obligation to notify changes in the number of tables to Customs and Excise. Duty is no longer assessed on that basis. Since the 1984 Finance Act it has instead been assessed on the basis of a casino's gross gaming yield, that is to say, the amount staked, less winnings. Subject only to any undertaking given to the licensing justices, there are now no controls on
<col>768</col>
the number of gaming tables; they are limited only by the available gaming area. As a result, entitlement to jackpot machines could vary without notice as a casino proprietor increased or decreased his complement of gaming tables.<lb/>
The solution which has been developed by the British Casino Association and is now brought forward in this Bill to increase the entitlement to four machines per casino overcomes this difficulty. Furthermore, by maintaining a reasonable upper limit on the number of machines the Bill avoids Las Vegas style serried ranks of jackpot machines which were opposed both by the Rothschild Royal Commission and the Gaming Board for Great Britain as alien to the character and atmosphere of casinos in this country.<lb/>
The Bill also, quite rightly in our view, maintains the existing limit of two machines for premises other than casinos which are permitted to use jackpot machines. I am referring to licensed bingo clubs and registered clubs. Such premises are not intended primarily for hard gaming and so are in many respects less tightly regulated than casinos. There is, therefore, no justification for extending to these other premises the concession contained in the Bill.<lb/>
On a more general point, since 1986 there have already been three Gaming (Amendment) Acts, the last of which received Royal Assent as recently as July. In the past that exposed us to the criticism that gaming legislation was being reformed in a piecemeal fashion. The noble Baroness made that criticism on an earlier occasion. The basic framework for the control of gaming in this country which is provided for by the Gaming Act is generally recognised to have withstood the test of time. Complex legislation of this nature, which has been on the statute book for over 20 years, is bound from time to time to require updating to take account of changes in circumstances or to plug loopholes which have come to light. However, that does not warrant revamping the whole Act, which has generally worked well. From time to time amendments are necessary, many of which are instigated by relevant trade associations, as in this case, and not by the Government.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked what representations the Government had received. I understand that we have not received any representations other than those from the BCA and working men's clubs. In both cases they were made to the Gaming Board.<lb/>
My noble friend's Bill must be considered in the context that I have outlined. As I said, it provides for a modest increase in the number of hard gaming machines permitted in casinos and in so doing does not disturb the framework of the 1968 Act. We understand that the Gaming Board has no objections, as my noble friend indicated. In those circumstances, the Government are content for the Bill to proceed, subject to the views of your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04033"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful for the welcome given to the Bill this evening. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for her kind and helpful comments. I am grateful to her for what she
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0424"/>
<col>769</col>
said. She asked me one or two questions. She quite rightly stressed her fears about young people. As I pointed out in my opening remarks, nobody under the age of 18 may become a member of or enter a casino as a guest in order to game. Therefore, young people under the age of 18 would not have access to the machines or premises set out in the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked about the size of the increase over the years. It is my understanding that as of last year 116 casinos were licensed. Of those licensed under the terms of the 1968 Act, between 80 and 90 per cent. took up their entitlement to the jackpot machines within the first year. The figures which I gave have been constant throughout the 20 years or so since the master Act came into operation. Therefore, there has been a demand which was recognised in the original Act. I hope that that demand has been satisfied, and according to figures which I gave to your Lordships there would be an increase of a maximum number of 238 machines as a result of the successful completion of this Bill through your Lordships' House and another place.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked about any changes in the Bill in terms of licences. As I understand it, the number of machines which a casino may have under the licences which are granted by the local authorities
<col>770</col>
and the Gaming Board are set out in Section 31 of the Act which my Bill seeks to amend. Therefore, there will be no change.<lb/>
The third question asked by the noble Baroness has been partially answered by my noble friend on the Front Bench. There have been no representations about which I have heard. One representation was mentioned to me this morning outside this Chamber. However, as my noble friend set out in his comments, it is likely that there may be objections to widening the scope of my Bill to other registered premises.<lb/>
I am very grateful for the comments made and the welcome given by my noble friend on the Front Bench to the Bill and the measures proposed. He has raised a number of additional points which I do not believe your Lordships would wish me to go into this evening. I am grateful to him for what he said. I agree with him that Section 31 of the master Act is particularly important and I hope that the Bill which I have proposed to your Lordships this evening will go a long way towards remedying one particular aspect of Section 31 of the master Act.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.<lb/>
House adjourned at twenty four minutes past eight o'clock.</membercontribution></p>

<title>City Technology Colleges</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04035"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04036">How many city technology colleges are in operation, and what have been the costs in establishing and maintaining them to the public sector and to the private sector.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04037"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, seven city technology colleges have been opened. Those are located in Birmingham, Teesside. Nottingham, Gateshead, Bradford, Croydon and Dartford. To date, the cost to the Government of establishing those colleges has been &#x00A3;52.8 million, of which &#x00A3;47.1 million is capital. The private sector is committed and will contribute 20 per cent. of those costs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04038"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say why the original objective to establish 20 CTCs within two years, with the cost being met wholly or largely by the private sector, has not been achieved?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04039"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, seven colleges have already been established and seven more are in the process of being established and will be opened by 1992. A fifteenth college is in the early stages of being considered in Bristol. Therefore the Government have not only secured substantial sums from the private sector but they have also gone a long way towards achieving their target of 20 CTCs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04040"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness kindly answer my question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04041"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: M y Lords, I gave all the information which was required for that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04042"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that these constant attacks from the Opposition Benches on the city technology colleges show up the hollowness of the Labour Party's claim to care about the relationship between education and our industrial performance?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04043"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right; indeed, only yesterday we had such a debate. The policy of noble Lords opposite would mean more spending, more bureaucracy and no choice. They would abolish CTCs. We hope that CTCs are here to stay. Moreover, where they have been established they have an excellent reputation, are popular with both parents and pupils and are oversubscribed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04044"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, said, can the Minister confirm that nearly 200 major companies were
<col>772</col>
approached and asked to support the city technology colleges and that they all rejected the request for support?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04045"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness is characteristically negative on the issue. I should prefer, as would the Government, to concentrate upon how positive industry and commerce have been in setting up these centres of excellence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04046"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness kindly answer my question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04047"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have given the figures representing how much industry and commerce are committed to supply towards the capital cost of setting up these colleges. I believe that this shows a very good record thus far.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04048"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister give an answer to the noble Baroness's question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04049"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, negotiating to make contributions towards the setting up of CTCs is a voluntary activity both on the part of industry and commerce and on the part of government in accepting and establishing the arrangements. I have given all the figures as regards the contribution of the private sector. The private sector is still showing an interest. As I said, seven other CTCs are in the process of being established and a fifteenth looks as though it may get off the starting block but is at present in the early stages of being established.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04050"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the great cost involved in the setting up of CTCs, will the Government consider giving an amount of money equal to that which has been spent on established CTCs to the local education authorities in those areas so that they can meet the great cost of the necessary repairs to their schools? Perhaps I may give one example. In the North East, where the Gateshead CTC has been established, the amount of money spent is almost &#x00A3;6 million. That is more than the whole of the money available to the Newcastle and Gateshead authorities for the repair and maintenance of their schools.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04051"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the money which has been spent on establishing CTCs is over and above, and not part of, the moneys which will go into the mainstream education system. Noble Lords opposite disagree with the establishment of CTCs. They have taken many opportunities to criticise them and have done all they can to establish a proposition that they should be abolished. The noble Lord can travel down that road, but we believe that extending choice is a very good thing not just for education but also for the young people who will benefit from a good, sound technical education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04052"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister realise that many children are not in the CTC schools and that a great deal of money needs to be spent on the schools attended by the majority of pupils? Does she also realise that those schools are crumbling? It seems most unfair to many people that an excessive amount of money is being spent on CTCs in proportion to the amount spent on the maintenance of maintained schools.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0426"/>
<col>773</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04053"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the risk of repeating some of yesterday's debate, I believe I made it clear that the Government are doing a great deal towards increasing technical and vocational education in our schools. We believe that the excellent example being set by CTCs will do more than anything else to improve technical education in schools. My belief is that we shall see a growth in technical education which will have a great status equal to academic achievement in our schools.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Uniform Business Rate</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04054">3.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04055"><member>Lord Monson</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04056">Whether, in view of the 64 per cent. increase in company liquidations in the third quarter of this year and the sharp decline in business confidence reported by the Confederation of British Industry, they will consider (a) limiting the increase in the uniform business rate next year to 5 per cent. and (b) extending transitional business rate relief to new lettings as well as existing ones.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04057"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer is no. The cost of limiting the increase in the uniform business rate in 1991&#x2013;92 to 5 per cent. for businesses would create a deficit in local authority funding which would require local authorities to reduce their spending or to levy it on the community charge payer; or the deficit would have to be met by the national taxpayer. As regards the second part of the Question, we have no plans for extending transitional relief to new lettings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04058"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her reply, disappointing though it is. I half expected that some fresh thinking might have been applied to the subject. However, does she agree that it would make far more sense to cap business rates, thereby helping businesses specifically, especially small businesses, than, for example, to lower interest rates prematurely, which would only set off the appalling house price spiral once again to the great detriment of first-time buyers and to the economy generally?<lb/>
Will the noble Baroness also agree that refusal to extend transitional relief to new lettings prevents the effective allocation of resources? Surely that must be a primary aim of government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04059"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is very important to make a distinction between transitional arrangements and the system as it will operate after transitional relief. The effectiveness of the reforms means that business and commerce rates will be capped; they will be capped to the level of inflation. Therefore, no rate increase will ever be greater than the rate of inflation. The only power which exists in legislation is a power to reduce the rate and not to increase it. That compares, under the old system, with rate increases over the past year or so of anything between 33 per cent. and 57 per cent. I believe that when the new reforms are in place they will prove to be much fairer to business and commerce.</membercontribution></p>
<col>774</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04060"><member>Baroness Sharples</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether small businesses have been more successful in these difficult times than large businesses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04061"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am more than pleased to give the figures in that respect. The year 1989 was the most successful one ever. There was a net increase of 87,000 new businesses. That figure takes into account the new businesses which came into the system and the liquidations that went out of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04062"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has told the House that the increase in the uniform business rate will be in line with inflation. Can she now tell us why the figure for inflation for the UBR is so much higher than the figure for inflation allowed in local authority expenditure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04063"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the increase in the figure for local authorities is indeed in line with the rate of inflation. The noble Lord has actually taken into account one aspect of provision for local authorities. The increase in their spending is in line with inflation. The increase in respect of local businesses&#x2014;namely, 10.9 per cent.&#x2014;is a publicly published figure and that is the figure which has been applied when assessing the rate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04064"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry but that answer is still not clear. Is the Minister saying that the standard spending assessments for local authorities are being increased by 10.9 per cent., in line with the inflationary increase in the unified business rate? If not, what is the figure? If the figure is different, why is there a difference?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04065"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am saying that the SSAs for local authorities are well beyond 10.9 per cent. I believe that the average for most classes of authority is in excess of 16 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04066"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that current valuations of business premises are based on the semi-boom conditions that prevailed in the spring of 1988, when interest rates were exceptionally low and business confidence was high? Are not those valuations unrealistically high in view of the slump that prevails today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04067"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord makes an important point. No one suggests that these times are easy for business, but that only strengthens the Government's objective, which is to get inflation down. If we can do anything for local businesses, especially small businesses, it would be to reduce the level of inflation. If we remit the costs to businesses now, that cost would only have to be levied on other people.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Gulf</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04068">3.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04069"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04070">Under what circumstances British forces in the Gulf would be placed under the orders of a commanding officer answerable to the United Nations and what is the present position.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0427"/>
<col>775</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04071"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the multinational force deployed in the Gulf is not a United Nations force. The question of United Nations command does not arise, therefore. British and other forces have been deployed at the request of Saudi Arabia and other countries in accordance with the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The British forces are under ultimate UK command.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04072"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for his explicit Answer, which clarifies the present position that, although the forces are deployed under an article of the United Nations Charter, there is no United Nations command in the Gulf. Having regard to the danger of the present forces being regarded as wholly Western in command, have the Government considered that it might be better to examine the possibility of an ultimate United Nations command?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04073"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we believe that effective arrangements have already been put in place. Forces are present in the Gulf in substantial numbers in support of Security Council resolutions and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. We do not believe that such a proposal would necessarily bring an improvement. The important point is to bring enough pressure on Saddam Hussein to ensure that he complies fully with United Nations resolutions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04074"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the British forces in the Gulf are under the command of a singularly able and distinguished officer, General de la Billi&#x00E8;re, in whom those concerned have the greatest confidence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04075"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks, which I am sure many noble Lords share.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04076"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that we have been reading in the press that there have been substantial moves towards drafting a Security Council resolution which would authorise the use of force in the Gulf? What progress has been made on that resolution? We understand from a French spokesman that they are getting down to drafting the resolution. Is part of that resolution concerned with putting all the forces in the Gulf under United Nations command?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04077"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot say whether there will be a further United Nations resolution. Nothing has yet been formally proposed. The wording of any resolution must of course be acceptable to all 15 members of the Security Council, but we would be happy to see a new Security Council resolution which would increase pressure on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04078"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that, in the unfortunate event of hostilities breaking out, the successful outcome will depend very much on having one commander-in-chief of all forces, whomsoever he shall be?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04079"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend makes a sound point.</membercontribution></p>
<col>776</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04080"><member>Lord Bridges</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister reconsider the information that he just gave the House that the resolution would have to meet with the approval of all members of the Security Council? Does he not mean that it would have to be approved by the Security Council?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04081"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is highly experienced in these matters, and I accept his correction if that is necessary. We cannot be certain that there will be such a resolution. There is considerably further to go before we shall know whether there is to be one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04082"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has not the Soviet Union been pressing for a United Nations single command in this enterprise? Is it a condition of Soviet support for the proposed Security Council resolution that such a command structure should be put in place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04083"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that I cannot say. The Soviet Union has shown itself to be in support of the full implementation of all Security Council resolutions which seek to secure the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. We have no reason to suppose that the Soviet Union would not support a resolution permitting the use of force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04084"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what are our commitments in the interim? Will the Minister assure us that the United States will not take military action against the British Government's advice?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04085"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the important point is that in our view Article 51 of the United Nations Charter provides legal authority for the use of force in response to the armed attack on Kuwait. However, we shall continue to play our full part in the ongoing Security Council discussions on how to increase pressure on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04089"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, much of Britain's aid programme is devoted to poverty alleviation in the least developed countries and is directed specifically to fighting disease and malnutrition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04090"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Are the Government aware of the need to develop UK institutions to help in the field of tropical health? Are the Government aware of the magnificent endeavours of Mrs. Lynda Chalker in the United States when, on behalf of the millions who are threatened, she spoke of the need to prevent starvation and death on a horrendous scale?

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04091"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for the comments that he made about the Minister for Overseas Development, my right honourable friend Mrs. Chalker, and the work she has done. Of course the Government give her total support. I have seen some of the overseas development work in Africa and the Far East and it is to be recommended. The noble Lord mentioned the important question of tropical diseases. The ODA works closely with several UK institutions, especially the London and Liverpool schools of tropical medicine which are centres of international repute. This year we have committed a total of &#x00A3;16 million over a 5-year period to 14 new research and training programmes at the London and Liverpool schools.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04092"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister recollect that at the recent world summit on children the Prime Minister and other world leaders signed a plan of action designed to alleviate the suffering of children in the poorest countries? Is he aware of their commitment to make available resources to meet those goals? Has the ODA adjusted its development aid policies so as to honour the pledge and so help children in the poorest countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04093"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we continue to help all kinds of people in the poorest countries. As the noble Baroness will fully understand, it is not just the children who are important but also the women, for whom she has great concern. There is family planning. All types of aid are important. The current aid programme in total is &#x00A3;1.62 billion. That will rise to &#x00A3;1.72 billion in 1991&#x2013;92 and to &#x00A3;1.86 billion by 1993&#x2013;94.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04094"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving those figures. Will he nevertheless confirm that the ODA is now under an obligation to adjust its development aid policies to meet the aims signed by the 71 leaders, including our Prime Minister?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04095"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the noble Baroness for not covering that supplementary question which she posed to me. We are constantly reviewing the placing of the emphasis. In a reply to an earlier Question some weeks ago, I said that the ODA was considering the matter. I understand that some work has already taken place on it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04096"><member>Lord Dormand of Easington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that in the important problem raised by my noble friend a contributory factor is the world population explosion, particularly in developing countries? We appreciate what the Government are doing and the noble Earl will recall that we had a debate on this subject before the summer Recess. Will the Minister give an assurance that all the assistance given and work now being done by the Government will continue and increase?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04097"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can confirm that this is a most important matter, as the noble Lord said. The population of the world has doubled since 1950; it is on an upward trend and that poses considerable problems. The majority&#x2014;95 per cent.
<col>778</col>
&#x2014;of the increase is in the worst-off areas: therefore the noble Lord's point that it is an important problem is fully underlined.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04098"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that all the surpluses about which everybody complains in food production in the EC should be channelled to the people mentioned by my noble friend?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04099"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course we must send food aid at the appropriate times. However, it is quite wrong for us unnecessarily to dump our excess production on other countries. It is surely much better to help them to produce their own goods.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04100"><member>Lord Rea</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister say what proportion of our gross domestic product the aid figures that he gave us represent? Can he say how soon this country will attain anywhere near the level of 0.7 per cent. of GNP which was recommended by the United Nations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04101"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was fairly certain that the noble Lord would ask me exactly that question. I have already answered it when he asked it in the recent past. I refer him to the Question on the Order Paper. I believe his question is a little wide of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04102"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that a number of British periodicals and newspapers which specialise in these matters are submitting horrendous stories of millions of people who will probably starve to death unless help is forthcoming? I give the Minister one example to contemplate: in the Horn of Africa, where the rains failed, millions now face starvation.<lb/>
Mrs. Lynda Chalker carried out magnificent work in the United States and some of our British institutions are carrying out remarkable work. Nevertheless, there are also reports that, for example, in the Sudan Britons who are doing good work are&#x2014;one can only assume from what we hear from the Foreign Office&#x2014;being asked to leave. If the Minister cannot comment on that now, perhaps he would give me further information later.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04103"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord underlines another area of concern. Perhaps those who suffer most are children and that is the burden of his original Question. There have been disasters throughout the world. The noble Lord mentioned some places and I have seen the effects of hurricanes and cyclones in the South Pacific which cause equal problems. I can reassure the noble Lord that we give serious attention to these matters.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union: ECC Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04104">3.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04105"><member>Lord Aldington</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union (<i>27th Report, 1989&#x2013;90, HL Paper 88</i>).</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04106">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this report on <i>Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union</i> is
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0429"/>
<col>779</col>
full, is calm and has a balance which I shall try to retain in my speech to your Lordships. I should start by reminding your Lordships, in view of the distractions along the corridor and in another place, that the conclusions in this report were reached on 24th October. The report is made to your Lordships in the course of the Select Committee's scrutiny of Community proposals. It is through this scrutiny that the House plays its part in securing the accountability of the institutions of the Community, and particularly the Council, to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04107">The Select Committee has produced more than 500 valuable reports over its 16 years, involving hundreds of your Lordships. This report arises from the various proposals put forward by the Community's institutions about economic and monetary union and political union. They were laid out in the introduction to our report. Not for the first time, very important questions of policy and attitudes are raised; not for the first time, the report covers issues to be resolved by governments negotiating with each other and offers advice to our Government on the position they should take in their negotiations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04108">As is usual, the evidence we took governed our conclusions. The witnesses were as impressive and authoritative on their point of view as can be found. The members of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee who conducted the inquiry have a record in this field as distinguished as one could find anywhere. I have to confess that I was very proud when I was selected as their chairman. Now, standing in front of the House, I feel very humble and rather shy. However, I am told to get over it and I will&#x0021;</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04109">The pattern of our work followed that of the many inquiries conducted by the European Communities Select Committee. We kept to our role all the more successfully because of the presence among us of the Select Committee's chairman, the noble Baroness, Lady Serota. Her reappointment last week most deservedly won the applause of your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04110">We could not have accomplished our work for noble Lords without the help of our splendid advisers: Sir Julian Bullard, Mr. Christopher Johnson and Mrs. Eileen Denza. They, with the members of the committee, will tell you that we should have made a poor show indeed without the guidance, the really encyclopaedic knowledge and the superlative pen of our clerk, Mr. William Sleath. How often do we need to pay a warm and well deserved tribute to these wonderful clerks of both sexes who serve us so well in our committees.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04111">Before coming to the individual issues under each of the two heads&#x2014;EMU and political union&#x2014;which are to be discussed and decided upon by the inter-governmental conferences starting next month, it may help the debate if I begin briefly with the committee's conclusions about the nature of the Community itself&#x2014;what is it?&#x2014;and some of the terms being used and, we have to say, sometimes abused.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04112">The constitution of the Community is unique. Its founders chose a unique name: not a federation, nor
<col>780</col>
a confederation, nor the United States of Europe. There is no sign that they intended or that any member state since has intended any of these forms. They most certainly did not intend the form of a "superstate", a term which I heard used the other day when some of my noble friends were talking about the Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04113">In our view it is sterile to waste time and valuable rhetoric on arguments as to what the Community might wish to be in its second, third or fourth half-century. It is not only sterile but we think positively damaging to public understanding to parade what my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has called ogres and we call spectres of idealistic visions or of federalism. It is as clear that the Community now contains some federal elements, as it is clear that the member states retain their independence and their international sovereignty and have every intention of doing so in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04114">The application of Community law direct on our own citizens in the United Kingdom and in other member countries is one federal element. Another is the conduct of external trade relations and the whole apparatus of the single market. These and all other federal type elements in the constitution of the Community were agreed by the member states for the benefit of each of them. It was an exercise of national sovereignty to pool into a united sovereignty some of the political power which had been national. The key question to be asked before those decisions were taken, as it would be before any future decision on the transfer of political powers to the Community, was how the next step towards European unity would further the strength of the Community and the welfare and aspirations of its peoples.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04115">There is nothing new about the commitment of all members of the Community to progress towards ever closer union. All members have accepted that commitment as part of the Treaty of Rome; they have agreed on many occasions that such progress is their aim. Progress has been, and will be, achieved by agreement and will be furthered step by step. The intergovernmental conferences will sort cut what steps should be taken now in the fields of economic and monetary union and of political union and when they should be taken. It is not a question of whether any steps should be taken but what steps and when.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04116">Your Lordships will have noted that we asked ourselves questions about sovereignty. What does that word mean? What help does it give to independent and diverse states which have joined together to increase the prosperity of their peoples and to increase their influence in the world? I commend to your Lordships the sobering paragraphs on sovereignty in Part 2 of the report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04117">The two sovereignty issues of particular importance in our inquiry related to foreign policy and monetary union. We are quite clear that to include all aspects of foreign policy fully within the Community's competence would remove from member state, the right to take any independent action in foreign policy which had not been approved by the Council and would thus destroy the international sovereignty of each member
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0430"/>
<col>781</col>
state and its right to a seat in the United Nations. We reject that concept. Foreign policy can be well co-ordinated within the existing system of European political co-operation which we believe can be beefed up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04118">On the other hand, we see no fundamental objection on sovereignty grounds to full monetary union including a single currency. It would be a reasonable exercise of sovereignty by Parliament to pool with other members such elements of political power as exist in monetary policy if the advantages of so doing were clear. I shall return to that point when I talk about EMU later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04119">The report welcomes the acceptance of the principle of subsidiarity; namely, that there should be done by the Community only those things which can be better done or, under another definition, must necessarily be done at the centre and not by member states. This principle already appears in the Single European Act in relation to environmental matters. We think it should be included in the revised treaty, perhaps in the preamble, but in such a way that it does not become justiciable but rather a firm political commitment and guideline to govern the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04120">As the Community has progressed with wider scope and more powers, its institutions, the Council as well as the Commission, have become too little accountable to national parliaments and to the European Parliament. The proposals to improve democratic accountability, financial control and the effectiveness and implementation of Community laws and court decisions arc all important for the Community at its present size but must be designed for a larger Community in a few years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04121">Those general themes led us to conclusions on some of the points to be negotiated at the EMU conference and at the PU conference. Your Lordships will note that I use acronyms for economic and monetary union and for political union. I hope I may intersperse a little light relief at this stage. In acronym language the report is about EMU and PU. The emu is the second largest bird and is distinguished from the largest bird, the ostrich, by not putting its head in the sand. <i>Pu,</i> which means simple in Chinese, is a state of Chinese meditation in which, believe it or not, all contradictions vanish.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04122">I deal first with the happy thought of simplicity. Political union proposals are not simple, but they are not difficult to understand. Political union means the process of ever closer union. There is no defined goal. The general ideal of European union cannot be forgotten, but the intergovernmental conferences have to concentrate on the very real needs and concerns of the present. We recommend some principles which should be applied.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04123">We consider that, as its first priority, the Community must take steps to meet the requirements of democracy. Its institutions must be, and must be seen to be, democratically accountable. I shall return
<col>782</col>
to that point when I deal with the role of national and European parliaments and their relationships with each other and with the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04124">However, there are other shortcomings which have to be remedied. We summarise those in paragraphs 141 to 144. The finger is pointed both at the taking of decisions at Community level when they should be left to national choices and at the unbalanced way in which the Community's development has been dominated by agriculture and the single market without enough concern being shown for social and environmental affairs. The key here, as in so much of the argument about increasing the scope of Community competence, is the principle of subsidiarity. If that principle is held fast, efforts to dispel the perception of an imbalance in Community objectives need not automatically be equated with cumbersome centralised intervention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04125">Another Community shortcoming lies in the delays in implementation of legislation. We ask that legislation should not be agreed in the first place if it cannot be implemented properly. We further ask that member states should be required to make a written response to Commission reports on implementation and that those responses can be discussed in the parliaments and in the Council. The United Kingdom has consistently been one of the best performers in implementation and has an interest in seeing that disciplines encourage other states to achieve similar standards. The same applies to judgments of the European Court of Justice. They have to be complied with by all and without delay. Effective and efficient implementation of Community policies and laws is vital to its reputation and to the confidence of the public in its control of money and resources generally. The enormous losses suffered by the Community because of fraud is a scandal to which the committee has drawn and will continue to draw the attention of the House. I am very glad that your Lordships will have another opportunity to debate that scandal next week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04126">There is one further principle that we recommend to the intergovernmental conference. It must look to the future when the Community will have been enlarged&#x2014;quite soon&#x2014;by some members of EFTA and later by some of the Central or Eastern European states. Institutional changes must allow for such enlargement. We firmly declare our view that enlargement is desirable and will take place. However, that enlargement is not a question of widening or deepening; the one needs the other. We believe that there is a dominant conviction across Europe that events require the Community to take further steps towards strengthening both the effectiveness and accountability of its actions. We believe that the prime reason why any European state might consider applying for membership is that the Community is seen as strong and growing stronger.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04127">Many proposals have been made to increase the powers of the European Parliament. Our recommendations favour some extension of power over legislation, through the co-operation procedure, and over treaties. We call for the Parliament to have
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0431"/>
<col>783</col>
greater powers over delegated legislation and enhanced powers to scrutinise Community activity. That will mean more concentrated effort by the Parliament, particularly over the efficiency of spending. We recommend that the Parliament should have a role in the appointment of the commissioners by holding confirmation hearings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04128">I turn now to the question of the Council. How accountable is the Council? We considered the case for council meetings being held in public but rejected it, even for legislation. We believe that the Community is not yet ready for that. The Foreign Secretary made his view very clear and 'we agreed. However, we ask that the Council and its members should be much more informative both about their intentions and about the progress of legislation. The main answer to the question of accountability lies not so much in Brussels as in the accountability of Ministers to informed national parliaments, just as the European Parliament also has a need to know what the Council is doing and why.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04129">In our view the key to the removal of the so-called democratic deficit in the Community lies with national parliaments as much as with the Community institutions. Members of national parliaments need to involve themselves more closely in Community affairs and to develop appropriate procedures for doing so. They have to be well and properly informed by the Council and by the Commission. They have to have a close partnership with Members of the European Parliament. That is something that your Select Committee, under the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, has tried to develop. The role of Members of the European Parliament will be debated at the forthcoming conference of parliaments, or <i>Assizes,</i> in Rome. Perhaps our procedure here is not too bad an example of what can be done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04130">We considered but rejected the proposal for a second chamber of the European Parliament, to consist of members of national parliaments. That would put serious strain on the members chosen and would not fully involve their own colleagues back home. We believe that it would delay as well as confuse Community proceedings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04131">We also have important points to make about the Court of Auditors and the European Court of Justice. They must be given the resources and structure necessary to do their job properly. That job is of growing importance. They form an important part of the balancing mechanisms in the unique constitution of the Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04132">My final point relating to the terms of political union concerns the means of securing full cooperation on foreign policy. The idea of European political co-operation has worked quite well but the Gulf crisis has shown some of its limitations. We were advised and concluded that it can be made to work better, and with closer links to the Council. The extent to which it should embrace defence matters came under public debate after we had started our inquiry and we did not take any evidence on that specific point. We therefore confined our opinion on defence to the statement that:
<col>784</col>
<quote>"The Committee believe that it will be in the interests of Member States to find a way of discussing relevant security issues in EPC meetings".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04133">Your Lordships will see that we have tried to apply our general themes to questions relating to political union. I now turn to the subject of economic and monetary union, where we had the same themes in mind. The Community has declared itself in favour of economic and monetary union&#x2014;not simply economic union&#x2014;since 1969, before we became members. Many declarations have been made since to which the United Kingdom has been a fully consenting party.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04134">Within that EMU has monetary union been seen simply as a process or as a definable goal? The other 11 member states are quite clear that it was and is a definite goal with irrevocably fixed currency exchange rates leading to a single currency, a single monetary policy and a single monetary authority by whatever name. We have recorded the different interpretation given to us by the Treasury which defines monetary union by the objectives of monetary policy rather than by the means of securing it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04135">Our opinion is clear. The goal of a single monetary policy, a single currency and a single authority to be responsible for the battle against inflation and for securing the stability of prices is generally accepted in the Community. That is the case not only outside Britain but it is a goal shared by many people within the country in banking, commercial and academic circles. The real and vitally important question for the IGC, and particularly for Britain, relates to how and when the Community proceeds to that goal. We are careful to ask the IGC not to fix dates now for the eventual adoption of a single currency.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04136">It is now generally agreed that insufficient attention has been paid to the transition from the current stage one to the final stage three. Sir Michael Butler's British Invisible Exports Council came forward with a scheme for stage two using a hard ecu but expressly as the next move towards a single currency. That scheme was adapted by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer into his hard ecu scheme but expressly without commitment to the single currency as the end. It is that lack of commitment, albeit with the rider that the hard ecu could lead to a single currency if governments and peoples sc decide, that appears to us both to deny the acceptance of the proposal by other countries and to damage the viability of the scheme in itself. We regret that as we find in the Chancellor's scheme a number of elements of great value to the next stage in monetary union, even though, as we explain in paragraphs 79 and 80 of the report, we cannot regard the scheme as a whole as viable as it now stands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04137">Specifically, the valuable elements are the establishment and experience of a European monetary fund with supranational powers over the hard ecu and some other matters, and the use of the hard ecu to promote faster convergence of inflation rates and the opportunity for markets to give their verdicts. We very much hope that other members of the IGC will take those proposals seriously. However, I urge that they are more likely to do so if our Government accept the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0432"/>
<col>785</col>
same goal as other member states have accepted. There are many details which will have to be considered by the intergovernmental conference, no doubt with the help of the Committee of European Central Banks, which will have in mind subsidiarity. I shall not mention all the points but I shall draw your Lordships' attention to some of them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04138">We are convinced that a successful monetary union requires a satisfactory measure of convergence of anti-inflationary performance before it starts. Stage two has to ensure such convergence before it ends. A Big Bang entry to stage three as was proposed at one time by some people in the Commission, regardless of inflation rates, would impose unacceptable strains. The institution chosen to issue the currency and to execute a Community monetary policy which will be put in place in stage two, and which we say should be called a European monetary authority, must both be independent of political interference in its operations, and work, as does the Bundesbank, within an agreed economic policy&#x2014;in the case of the European monetary authority within an agreed Community economic policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04139">Also, we say, it must be accountable to parliaments in the sense that it must regularly explain its policies to them. We assume that the Chancellor's European monetary fund would do the same. Experience of that form of accountability should be assured during stage two.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04140">Timing of the next stages is all important. Stage one is by no means complete either in the single market generally or in the financial services area. The timing of the start of stage two clearly must depend on the content of that stage and on the progress in stage one, as assumed. In my opinion and, I believe, the opinion of all the committee it was a mistake for the Rome Summit at the end of October to try to fix the start date of stage two. I say that even though, on the assumptions that we have made, some time in 1994 (which is its date too) would in our opinion be an appropriate date. I repeat that the start date of stage three should not be fixed until stage two has been in operation for several years. Step by step and evolution are the right guidelines for progress in the Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04141">The Community should not contemplate a two-tier monetary union. It should be viewed as an essential part of the Community's single market. Two-speed it may have to be if some countries are not able to keep up with the convoy at the chosen time. Firm dates must be established for those countries to join if they are left out in the first place. But we emphasise with all the force at our command that the United Kingdom must be in the front rank. The United Kingdom can only remain outside a monetary union at substantial economic cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04142">Avoidance of such a division must be uppermost as government negotiators plan for the intergovernmental conference. Why do we stress that danger? It is quite simply because we believe, as do a great number of people inside as well as outside the country, that the advantages of a single currency to the Community and
<col>786</col>
to each of its members are very large. The full benefits of the single market will not be realised while the Community suffers from having several different currencies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04143">Secondly, individuals as well as businesses would save substantial sums from the removal of transaction costs and the need to pay for hedging against currency fluctuation. For the whole Community the savings in costs under that head are estimated by the CBI and the Commission as around &#x00A3;10 billion a year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04144">Finally, the single currency would give Europe a major&#x2014;perhaps the major&#x2014;world currency and corresponding influence. Taken together, the advantages of a single currency (I quote from the report),
<quote>"in creating globally competitive industrial production and financial services would be of the same order as the gains of the Single Market programme itself".</quote>
Those gains have been estimated at 5 per cent. to 7 per cent. of gross domestic product.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04145">For the Community to pass up such advantages would seem to be fairly mad, but for Britain to deprive its manufacturers, traders and financiers of them while other members of the Community enjoy them would seem to me at any rate to be disastrous both for the City of London and for our industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04146">It was said to the committee that those advantages have been overestimated. We questioned the CBI and bankers and are satisfied that they are real. It was also said that the disadvantages of moving to a single currency are substantial both in cost and in the loss of the weapon of devaluation. Certainly there will be costs in preparation for it and in the process of getting accustomed to it. As for devaluation, we were told that the value of the devaluation weapon in running the economy is doubtful in the long term. Our assumption is that there will have been sufficient convergence of anti-inflationary performance before the final fixing of exchange rates to avoid any basic disequilibrium that could lead to large unemployment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04147">There is the political objection to passing over to a European authority the power to set monetary policy and issue the currency for Britain as well as for the Community. I have said that there is no fundamental objection on sovereignty grounds to such a pooling of powers. But it is argued that neither the present Government nor the House of Commons will agree to a single currency because they believe that they must retain power over monetary policy. The assumption must be that they believe that they can use that power better than a European authority. Recent evidence going back to the 1970s hardly supports that proposition. However, I believe that in some of the objections there is confusion in some places between monetary policy and the rest of economic policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04148">The Community has already progressed a long way toward economic union outside the monetary area through the single market and its associated arrangements on competition policy and other matters as well as through the agreements to seek co-ordination of national economic policies. Earlier ideas of setting binding rules for limiting national budget deficits have been dropped but procedures&#x2014;binding procedures, as they are called&#x2014;have still to be
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0433"/>
<col>787</col>
agreed to secure mutual scrutiny of policy and performance, lest the action of one country should put the Community currency in jeopardy. Baling out and printing money to meet deficits will not be allowed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04149">However, in the main the responsibility for deciding economic policy within each country is rightly to remain with national governments, which will control their own budgets, tax policies and public expenditure policies, paying full regard to the objectives of Community policy as agreed. That is the proper application of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04150">Our proposals for EMU&#x2014;indeed, all our proposals&#x2014;follow the step by step approach that the Community has taken over two decades. There is nothing new about progress to closer union or economic and monetary union as a goal. Nor is there anything new about the need for Britain right from the start to take a full part in the formation of new policies and institutions. All that is new is the recognition of the importance of the changes now under consideration and a realisation that a decision has to be made very soon on the next steps forward but not on the steps to be taken after them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04151">We emphasise that the Community's strength lies in the support of its peoples. Many of the points to which I have referred relate to a closer involvement of national parliaments and through them the people of each nation. There is a clear need for more understanding of what the Community is, what the European Parliament does, what national parliaments do and can do, and what advantages are sought from action through Community institutions rather than nationally. The committee hopes that the report will play a part in removing misunderstanding&#x2014;and indeed help to slay the Foreign Secretary's ogres&#x2014;and a part too in building a fuller understanding of the advantages that will come to Britain from a stronger and more democratically accountable Community. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04152">Moved, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union (<i>27th Report, 1989&#x2013;90, HL Paper 88</i>).&#x2014;(<i>Lord Aldington.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04153">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04154"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I proceed to the debate, I feel I must refer to the events which are very much in our minds at this time; namely, the impending resignation of the Prime Minister, which is not unrelated to the subject of this debate. The right honourable lady has occupied her high office for 11 years. While we were often dismayed and occasionally distressed by her policies, nevertheless we always recognised her clarity, confidence and courage.<lb/>
Mrs. Margaret Thatcher has given her name to a decade and left her mark upon it. For that, as well as for the fact that she is our first woman Prime Minister, she will have a place in history.<lb/>
I must now congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and the members of the Select Committee upon their report. It is timely, thorough and of the first importance and we are grateful to our colleagues for
<col>788</col>
their hard work over several months. To read this document is to realise how complex are the problems facing us. The changes implicit in economic and political union are immense. There are implications for the way government is conducted, for the legislative process, for economic and financial management, and for the democratic process generally.<lb/>
This country has committed itself to membership of the Community in a referendum and the policies of all political parties are based upon this commitment. I believe that to be significant because in matters of great national importance it is desirable if not essential that parties should seek agreement. The significance of the report is that it represents the views of Members from all parties in this House and it should therefore be taken seriously by the Government and Opposition parties alike.<lb/>
We are also conscious at this time of the problems facing the Government and indeed of the debate which is taking place at this time in the House of Commons. The subjects that we are debating are close to the heart of the Government's current problems. I shall not pursue this aspect further at this time save to say that it is very much in the interests the country that these difficulties should be resolved quickly.<lb/>
It has been said many times over the past 20 years that Britain has been slow to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Community and that we should have been party to the negotiations of the Treaty of Rome and subsequent developments. That is probably true but there were at that time reasons for Britain's tardiness. We were disengaging from the empire; Commonwealth countries were strongly opposed to it; memories of the war were fresh in the mind; and General de Gaulle was not wildly enthusiastic about British membership. Finally, the English Channel has always been a silent barrier. However, the referendum, when it came, showed that the great majority of the British people had put those obstacles behind them. That is why it is imperative that Britain should play a full, constructive and indeed leading role in the development of the new Europe.<lb/>
That does not mean that we must accept everything M. Delors proposes without question or that we cannot approach new proposals critically. We in this country have been brought up to scrutinise matters in detail from First Reading to Third Reading and we are not quick to change our habits. However, it is the spirit in which we approach the Rome Conference, and the language we use to express our views, that will make it possible for us to work for a consensus and to reach agreements.<lb/>
There are other obstacles, many of them in the mind. I am glad that the committee went to the trouble in Part 2 of the report to define some of the areas which have caused confusion. The noble Lord referred to sovereignty. The report states:
<quote>"The word 'sovereignty' has a powerful emotional impact, bound up as it is with people's sense of nationhood".</quote>
Let me, however, remind the House that we, the Welsh people, surrendered our sovereignty&#x2014;very reluctantly at the time &#x2014;several centuries ago. What makes that
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0434"/>
<col>789</col>
tolerable to me and my fellow countrymen today is that in Britain we live in a parliamentary democracy and that we enjoy freedom under the law. If we lived in a dictatorship, I would want our sovereignty back. It is in that context that I contemplate the great changes that are impending.<lb/>
But the Community itself came into existence primarily for political reasons: to ensure that war would never again break out in Western Europe. That has so far been the great achievement of the post-war period, and I believe it to be our duty to build upon that. We must of course also concede and recognise that since financial markets and environmental matters cross national boundaries, sovereignty has already been removed to some extent from areas of our economy and national life.<lb/>
The report deals with these matters&#x2014;with the effect upon national sovereignty of economic and monetary union. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher and her colleagues have been involved in the argument that monetary union in the form of a single currency would detract substantially from the sovereignty of this country. That has been one of the chief causes of the division within the Government over the past few months. But in fairness it must be said that divisions on this are not necessarily confined to the party opposite.<lb/>
When the Minister replies, will he agree that it will take a long time before a single currency becomes a reality? The report points out that even if a single currency materialises, this country and others will continue to be separate sovereign states. Will the Minister confirm that that is in fact the Government's view?<lb/>
The report points out that there are several examples&#x2014;and this I think is an important point which may have been overlooked&#x2014;where sovereign states have shared a single currency, including, for example, this country and the Republic of Ireland for a period of years. Paragraphs 74 to 81 of the report are therefore of the first importance because the committee concludes in paragraph 77 that the majority of member states,
<quote>"see the IGC's goal as determining not whether, but how, to achieve a full monetary union".</quote>
Last month's Rome Summit showed that Britain at that time was totally at odds with its 11 partners. It cannot be true that Britain is right and the Eleven are wrong on all issues and that there is no room for negotiation. The report takes a broader view and calls on the Government to play a constructive part in the coming Rome negotiations. On that we agree with the committee. However, we must now wait for a new Prime Minister to form his administration and to formulate new policies.<lb/>
I believe that paragraph 93, which discusses the dangers which will result if the United Kingdom finds itself in the second tier of a two-tier Europe, is significant, as the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, has said. The report argues that London has an excellent case for becoming the operational centre of a European central bank if the United Kingdom is part of the monetary union from the start. Other noble
<col>790</col>
Lords are better equipped than I am to judge the consequences for the United Kingdom if the central bank were to be established somewhere else. But if London is to keep its position as Europe's foremost business and financial centre, the Government will need to modify their approach.<lb/>
How is London to organise its efforts to achieve that against the ambitions of Paris and Frankfurt? Here I must say in parenthesis that it was a major mistake to abolish the GLC and leave London without the leadership of a central authority which exists in every other major city. Can the Minister tell us precisely what action the Government are taking to meet this challenge which can have grave implications for our country?<lb/>
I noted with interest the recent speech of the new Lord Mayor of London in which he emphasised the importance of preparing London for a drive to make a constructive bid as the city most qualified to accommodate the new centre. Can the Minister say what plans the Government have to co-operate in that? Is a body being set up which will take the place of a central authority such as the GLC and which will contain experts in all fields; for instance, economic, financial, commercial, industrial and political? If that is in the Government plans it would show that they are serious about securing the new centre for our capital city.<lb/>
The House will recall that political union was placed on the agenda for Rome at the Dublin Summit in June, and we are grateful to the committee for dealing with that also.<lb/>
During the years less attention has been paid to the implications of political union than to monetary union, which, as the report reminds us, has been on the agenda since the 1960s. Aspects of political union have been discussed in many reports but we assume that the IGC will study all the possibilities and implications. A number of national parliaments have already submitted their views and it would be interesting to know whether Her Majesty's Government are proposing to submit a memorandum setting out our views.<lb/>
The basic question that people are asking is: what effect will political union have on the British Parliament? It is a question of the utmost gravity and it must be answered. People ask whether the European Parliament will carry more authority than national parliaments and whether the Commission and the Council will exercise wider and greater functions. These are matters which the report discusses in detail. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher has suggested that a referendum might be held on monetary union and the single currency on the ground that it is a constitutional issue. Personally, I do not believe that would be practicable. However, if a referendum were held on that subject I dread to think of the referendum which would have to take place on an even more obvious constitutional issue.<lb/>
But one thing is certain; namely, that political solutions are needed now to resolve problems which have developed in the operation of Community
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0435"/>
<col>791</col>
affairs. Every member of the Community has a form of democratic government with a freely elected parliament. The report points out that in some respects the Community has the role of a supranational government; furthermore, that there is a danger that the democratic safeguards in the Community structure have not kept place with this development. The House will know that when Community government is criticised, as frequently happens, the response is that the Council of Ministers is there and because Ministers who attend are accountable to parliament the democratic process is thereby satisfied.<lb/>
I regret to say that I find that totally unsatisfactory. I am glad to note that the committee shares that view. There is a fundamental weakness here which must be recognised and removed. The Council, which has a huge responsibility and which meets in secret, cannot through a Minister of a member state convey its deliberations to national parliaments so that they may be debated there and Ministers can at least be questioned intelligently by the members of those parliaments. More information about the work of the Council and its intentions must be released.<lb/>
Paragraph 159 of the report states:
<quote>"The Council, through the mouthpiece of the Presidency, must be more open".</quote>
I should add that I read with great care and interest the very valuable evidence of the noble Lords, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead and Lord Cockfield, upon this subject. After deliberating, the committee came to the conclusion that the key to giving national parliaments greater knowledge of Community affairs and a greater say in decision-making is to strengthen their relationship with the Commission and especially with the Council of Ministers. I see no argument whatever against that. Furthermore, we assume that the IGC will regard this as a first step in the consideration of political unity, accepting that much more work needs to be done before the twelve parties can hope to achieve a consensus. I am bound to say that I do not see that taking place in the immediate future.<lb/>
We in this House are fortunate to have our European Communities Committee, whose reputation is high both here and in the Community. A warm tribute is due to my noble friend Lady Serota, the chairman, to members of the committee, the staff and their advisers for their outstanding work. It is far and away the most effective method yet devised of scrutinising the work of the Community. It is well in advance of that of the House of Commons, but that is no criticism because I know of the weight of work which these days Members of another place must carry.<lb/>
Time will not allow me to dwell on other important matters in the report; for example, subsidiarity, the European Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors. Therefore, I conclude by commending and supporting the spirit in which the report has been composed. Its advice that,
<col>792</col>
<quote>"The Member States must continue to pursue the goal of a closer union of independent sovereign states, acting collectively in the Community when collective action is better than individual action to build on existing achievements"</quote>
is, in my view, sensible. Its emphasis on accountability and on the requirements of a democratic society are, however, crucial. I hope and pray that the new Prime Minister and his colleagues will study the report carefully and have it under their arms when they travel to Rome next month.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04155">4.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04156"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin my contribution to this important debate by stating that my noble friend Lord Bonham-Carter should have been speaking at this stage. He was a member of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, but unfortunately he is indisposed.<lb/>
I was pleased to hear that the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, generally supports the report and its conclusions. We on these benches do likewise. I recently saw the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, in the corridor. I asked him how he could put his name to so many best sellers. I had the honour to serve with him on the committee on our overseas trade which produced his previous report. That was a best seller and, judging from the difficulty in obtaining copies, this report will be likewise. I have no doubt that another best selling report will come along at some future date.<lb/>
The report could not be more timely. The committee is to be congratulated on the speed with which it has produced it and on the clarity and forcefulness of the argument. It is compelling reading. Before commenting on and supporting its conclusions, particularly in regard to economic and monetary union, I wish to fill in a little of the background. I have been continuously involved in the affairs of the Community since 1949. I then participated in discussions on the response that the Government should give to the Schuman declaration. There was a working party of officials and the steel and coal industries were represented. Our recommendation to the then Attlee Government was that on balance it would be in our interest to join. No doubt for other reasons the Government declined to take that advice.<lb/>
From 1952 to 1956 I was a member of the United Kingdom delegation in Luxembourg. A big advantage of being there at that time was that it gave us the opportunity of regularly meeting that most remarkable man, Jean Monnet. It was from long discussions with Monnet that I gained a clear appreciation of the vision which had impelled him in the first instance to launch the Schuman plan with the support of his then foreign minister, Mr. Schuman, and of the further steps which he clearly envisaged right from the start.<lb/>
He considered it imperative that the countries of Europe should band together, and do so in a more coherent way than had ever occurred before in history by voluntary actions. He felt that, in order to bring about that banding together, there should be clearly defined objectives and an institutional framework consisting of a council of ministers to represent the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0436"/>
<col>793</col>
member states, a commission or executive, a court of justice and a parliament. Those would be the four main institutions. He believed in a step-by-step approach and that clearly defined dates should be set whereby certain achievements should be attained. Therefore the whole framework within which the Community is now operating was envisaged by that great man at that time.<lb/>
It is remarkable that, in spite of periods of inactivity within the Community, the move forward within that broad framework which he envisaged has continued. There have been certain major landmarks. For example, after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1950 which set up the European Coal and Steel Community, with which I was personally much involved, there was the Messina Conference of 1955. That was the next big step forward which widened the area of operation within the Community to cover all economic affairs. There was then the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The next big landmark was the move towards the EMS&#x2014;the European monetary system&#x2014;in which my noble friend Lord Jenkins played such a major role when he was president of the Commission.<lb/>
Moving on, we come nearer to our own times when, in 1987, we took the big step forward of the Single European Act. The noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, played an enormous role in translating into reality the intentions set out in the Single European Act for the creation of a single market.<lb/>
That brings us to where we are now. The next big step forward is a move from the creation of a single market to the creation of a European system of economic and monetary union. The mistake which we appear to be making to our friends on the Continent, but perhaps which from now on we shall cease to make, is that we have given the impression that we want the evolution of the Community to stop at the single market. They do not envisage that as even a remote possibility. Nevertheless there is the lurking thought in their minds that we should have always preferred a European free trade area as an alternative. After all, in the early days we were responsible for the creation of the free trade area as an alternative to the European Community. They believe that we wish to return to that and they do not see it that way at all. Nor indeed will it be like that. The momentum in the European Community will continue and the important issue, as this report demonstrates, is that we should play a positive role.<lb/>
The value of the report is that it brings out those points. I am glad to see that the noble Lord, Lord Roll of Ipsden, will be speaking later. I was with him last Monday at an international meeting in Vienna. The dominant consideration, when we came to speak about European affairs, was the way in which the Community is developing. Countries outside the Community&#x2014;Austria and others&#x2014;were represented there. They are keen to gain entry into the Community and their attraction to the Community is its strength. If that strength were weakened, their interest would diminish.<lb/>
<col>794</col>
With the reunification of Germany what is very important is that the Germans give every appearance of being committed to playing their full role in this new evolving Europe. They do not want to give the impression of dominating the affairs of the Continent. At present that is the last thing they wish to do. I believe that that is a historic decision; we must participate to make sure that the present German intentions are turned into a reality. Currently one of the most important ways in which we can do that is by following the very sound advice in this report.<lb/>
Of course the committee was absolutely right in saying that as we progressively move towards a single currency, we must achieve a greater degree of economic convergence. I should like to submit that we need not wait until there is total convergence because we may wait for that until the end of time. Indeed it could be argued that after a certain point the creation of a single currency could itself lead to greater convergence. Therefore, we must choose the right moment. I believe that the report is correct in stating that we should accept a date for stage two. The date of 1994, which was mentioned at the recent Council in Rome, does not seem to be out of place.<lb/>
The press statement issued after that Council meeting made it clear that it would be some time before a single currency emerged and that a review of the whole situation would have to be made in 1997 when we would see where we are going. That seems to be a reasonable course to pursue if we wish to play a part in an increasingly integrated Europe.<lb/>
Consideration is being given to the hard ecu scheme to which the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, referred. It is most unfortunate that that scheme, which contains some admirable features, should have been presented in such a confusing way; namely, whether it would lead to a single currency or a parallel currency; whether or not it would be legal tender; and whether or not anybody would use it. There is not the slightest doubt that our friends on the Continent are very dubious about the proposition. Let us hope that we can clarify their minds on this subject and make it clear to them that that is a practical way in which stage two of the Delors plan can develop. It has many merits and I am sure that our negotiators could show a way of introducing some substance into what is otherwise a somewhat nebulous stage two.<lb/>
The report provides a framework for Britain to take a leading role in the next big step forward in European integration. I believe that our destiny lies in Europe. I believe that our interests lie there too.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04158"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin with an apology to the House for breaking the rules of debate, in that I shall not be here for the majority of the debate or indeed for the winding-up speeches. I wrote to the noble Lords, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos and Lord Ezra, on the matter. The reason is that the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister, Tian Zengpei, is in London, and I shall meet him tonight at a reception he is kindly giving for me. I hope your Lordships will understand
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0437"/>
<col>795</col>
that I do not like breaking the rules of the House&#x2014;in fact I criticise others for so doing&#x2014;but on this occasion I hope the House will understand.<lb/>
I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Aldington for tabling today's debate on economic, monetary and political union. His committee, which has been examining these questions since May, has produced a thorough and detailed report for which we are all grateful. Clearly it is the product of a great deal of expertise and thought, and I should like to congratulate all those who took part.<lb/>
I shall approach the subject in the same order as does the report of my noble friend. I shall deal first with economic and monetary union, and then with political union. When speaking of EMU my noble friend described it as a bird that does not put its head in the sand. It is also a fast runner, but not a flyer. Be that as it may, today's debate provides us with an excellent opportunity to cover three key areas on the subject of EMU: first, the degree of common ground that already exists between the 12 and the commitment that exists to move together as the 12; secondly, the immediate questions that face us as we try to chart out the progress to which we are all committed beyond stage one; thirdly, the longer term.<lb/>
If all one read were press reports one could be forgiven for believing that the opinions of the British Government diverged absolutely from those of the 11 other member states. In fact we are agreed on a great many matters. The treaty already provides for regular and detailed co-operation on economic and monetary matters. On 11th November Henning Christopherson, Vice-President of the Commission, was quoted in the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> as saying,
<quote>"We already have many of the components of the EMU. What we are going to do now is add the last bricks to the building".</quote>
As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in another place on 30th October, Britain intends to be part of the further economic and monetary development of the Community and believes that next year solutions will be found to enable the Community to go forward as 12. We have all signed up to Stage I, which began in July. We all agree that the overriding objective on monetary policy must be price stability. We all agree that excessive budget deficits and monetary financing must be avoided. And we all agree that there should be arrangements beyond Stage I which would come into existence as soon as possible after ratification of the necessary treaty provision.<lb/>
That there is common ground cannot be doubted; that we are committed to the process should not be doubted either. We have often repeated our commitment to the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union. I am sure your Lordships will again welcome those assurances.<lb/>
What, then, are the next steps in the process? The report of my noble friend's committee concludes that it,
<quote>"is of paramount importance to the United Kingdom economy to be at the forefront of steps towards monetary union".</quote>
<col>796</col>
That is a laudable conclusion and one with which we fully concur. That is why the UK has produced the only comprehensive proposal for the next steps in the process. We would vigorously contest the conclusion in the report of my noble friend that the Government's hard ecu scheme is not viable as it stands. Its technical viability has not been seriously disputed by our European colleagues. Politically, we believe that an approach along our lines is the only viable way of moving beyond Stage I while encouraging convergence.<lb/>
Our approach allows the 12 to move ahead together, working with the grain of the market rather than attempting to distort the market by imposition. We shall pursue our proposals at the intergovernmental conference which opens in Rome next month. Despite some pressures to the contrary the IGC will set its own agenda as promised at the European Council in Strasbourg last December. It is only by keeping our eyes on the road ahead and not by gazing into the distance that we shall achieve the progress we all wish to see. The original Delors Report, published last year, has been compared to a Chinese painting: great detail and clarity in the foreground and lofty peaks in the background, but a vast area of mist in the middle distance. Our immediate task is to clear away that mist.<lb/>
Lastly I deal with the longer-term position. My noble friend's report argues that a single currency will bring substantial economic gains. There is no doubting the savings that would arise through an end to transaction costs and exchange rate risk within the Community. But a single currency will also have major costs. My noble friend mentioned the cost of losing national control over monetary policy. However, he did not mention the cost of jobs lost and localised depression if the transition to the single currency were anything other than gradual and market-led, nor the cost of paying, in effect, compensation to those peripheral states which demanded it to mitigate the disruptive effects of a single currency regime on their economies.<lb/>
It is only right to tell the House that the answers I received from a number of members from those countries when I questioned them on a single currency without such compensation were quite revealing. Although it is the opinion of my noble friend's committee, it is not the opinion of this Government that the benefits of the proposals we have before us for a single currency outweigh those costs and disadvantages.<lb/>
My noble friend's committee wisely concluded last year that the most effective way to decide on the right form of eventual economic and monetary union would be by waiting for proof that Stage I was a success. Stage I has been going for only five months, and we are still in the process of adjusting to a new environment. Stage I, as defined by M. Delors, will not be complete until the single market is achieved and all Community currencies are in the exchange rate mechanism. The Greek and Portuguese governments have given no formal commitment as to when the drachma and the escudo may join.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0438"/>
<col>797</col>
Like my noble friend, we believe that we need to wait for proof of success before defining final objectives. Moreover, we agree with the conclusion of my noble friend that monetary union should not be imposed before sufficient economic convergence is assured or before full preparations are complete. But, without defining the final structure, we believe we can still move ahead to the next stage by establishing a European monetary fund to manage the hard ecu. People would begin to use the common currency. The market would then decide whether or not the common currency should become the single currency. It certainly could do so if that is what peoples and governments choose.<lb/>
The key is not to decide now on what the market will tell us soon enough. The eminent Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, Dr. Padoa Schioppa, who was so closely involved in drafting the original Delors Report, wrote recently that,
<quote>"In a modern democratic society &#x2026; existing arrangements &#x2026; can be changed only when a current of public opinion develops, followed by political and legislative initiatives".</quote>
He went on to say that,
<quote>"Whether or not the ecu's potential is realised depends primarily on private action".</quote>
We must not run ahead of public opinion. Clearly we need to think hard about how to gauge that opinion. Recent debates in another place made it abundantly clear that the democratically elected representatives of the British people would not support the imposition of a single currency. The speed of progress on monetary issues must run with the market, and with market opinion, rather than against it. There is no need now to bind ourselves to a final destination. The Community's best interests will be served by setting up new economic and monetary arrangements for the next steps which will be dynamic and evolutionary.<lb/>
Let me turn to political union. I am glad to say that the Government fully share the main elements of the committee's analysis and wholeheartedly endorse the majority of its recommendations on political union. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State recently said, the Community does not stand still. It is debating continually for the mutual benefit of all our citizens whether the Community should develop its role in existing or new areas. The forthcoming intergovernmental conference on political union is part of that process.<lb/>
We shall be seeking reforms that will make the Community more efficient and more accountable while preserving its liberal, open and market-oriented principles. We agree that the Community must move forward together, by consensus, towards a future which may include new member states but which will always respect the identities and institutions of the nation states within it.<lb/>
We see considerable scope in the IGC for reforms which will make existing Community policies more effective. People in this country, as anywhere, will only put their trust in institutions and laws in which they
<col>798</col>
have confidence. In the preparations for the IGC, the Government have therefore already proposed a number of improvements to the working of the Community's institutions, several of which are also identified in your committee's report.<lb/>
First, there is a need for balance between the institutions. The founding fathers of the Community established a structure which has stood the test of time and adapted remarkably well to the demands made of it, not least in the face of the dramatic events of the past year. We should be careful not to upset that balance by strengthening any one institution at the expense of another. Like your committee, the Government do not want the position of member states to be weakened by giving the European Parliament substantial new legislative powers, or significantly extending qualified majority voting.<lb/>
The balance must also be kept in defining the areas in which the Community may act. We must have a clear division of responsibility. The Community should not become involved in areas which are more appropriately dealt with by member states. This is what is meant by subsidiarity. We should welcome a clear reference to that principle in the treaty.<lb/>
Secondly, where there is a role for the Community, it must work effectively. I am glad the committee share the Government's long-held view that the Community's financial accountability needs to be reinforced. We have also argued, like the committee, that the roles of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors should be strengthened. We must ensure that the Community's laws are not only passed at the Community level but put into effect at the national level. At the last count, only 20 of 107 single market measures requiring transposition into national law had been implemented in all member states. The joint leaders, the United Kingdom and Denmark, each have less than 20 to implement. At least one other country has not even implemented half. Once in force we need to be sure these laws will be respected. At the end of last year there were still 82 judgments by the Court of Justice not complied with by member states. There are none against Luxembourg, only one against the United Kingdom and 26 against the current presidency. We have therefore made a number of suggestions on this which have already attracted support and will be taken up in the IGC itself.<lb/>
Thirdly, we must ensure that the Community is properly accountable for its actions. In this respect, I strongly agree with the committee's recommendation on the need for partnership between national parliaments and the European Parliament.<lb/>
There are two pillars of accountability: the European Parliament, which monitors Community legislation and the Commission's activities; and Ministers in Council, who are each accountable to their national parliaments. If the countries of the European Community are to work more closely and effectively together, their national parliaments need to be more involved in the Community's life.<lb/>
The Government welcome the Conference of National and European Parliamentarians (sometimes
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0439"/>
<col>799</col>
known as "Assises") to be held in Rome at the end of this month, and which will be attended by eight of your Lordships, five of whom are members of the committee that drafted this report. This will be an important meeting. I hope it will be able to suggest ways to take this partnership forward.<lb/>
Finally, recent events have illustrated the value of the existing political co-operation machinery, which enables member states to co-ordinate their foreign policies. We believe it can be made more effective and have suggested a number of improvements to that end. There is also clearly a case for examining whether it should not cover a wider range of security issues, even though defence itself must continue to be co-ordinated through NATO. But I think all member states are agreed that, as the committee emphasised, they must retain the right of independent action where necessary.<lb/>
I congratulate the committee on its thorough and lucid report. Although, as I have made clear, the Government do not agree with all its conclusions, it provides us with an excellent opportunity to debate these issues, which are of fundamental importance to the future of this country. Discussions here and in the Community will be long and hard; but that is the right way to do things in a democratic community. Indeed, debate is the lifeblood of democratic institutions. We shall arrive at a better outcome as a result. I am confident that the full and constructive part that the Government intend to play in these negotiations will enable the Community to continue its progress on a sound and successful basis.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, asked us to play such a constructive role in Europe. I would only say, "as if we have not". I can say from my own experience that every negotiation in which I have taken part, representing whatever Ministry, has been nothing if not constructive. In addition to what I have already said, the House will know that the United Kingdom played a leading and successful role in the last IGC, which agreed the Single European Act and opened the way for completion of the single market. We championed the cause of agricultural reform in the future financing negotiations which was successfully concluded with the introduction of budgetary stabilisers in 1988. We shall lead the way again in putting forward proposals for a more efficient and accountable Community. I firmly believe that once again we shall achieve a successful outcome that will benefit both Britain and the Community.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04160"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, I hope I may claim to be a loyal observer of the rules of this House, which moves me to say in advance that I apologise if it proves impossible for me to stay to the end of the debate. I do not think an <i>ex post facto</i> apology is easy to contrive in this House.<lb/>
I was privileged to be a member of the committee which produced the report we are debating today. As a member of the committee I congratulate our splendid chairman on the way he led us through this very difficult subject. I also congratulate him on his
<col>800</col>
excellent speech today which said almost everything, leaving very little for the rest of us to say, but we must do our best.<lb/>
As we found while we were considering this subject, from the written and oral evidence given to us by Ministers and officials the committee's conclusions are&#x2014;perhaps I should say "were"&#x2014;at variance with the views of Her Majesty's Government. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, has today confirmed that some of our conclusions still are at variance with the Government's views. However, the pressure in Europe to attain the goals of economic and monetary union and in the end some sort of political union are relentlessly increasing. As so often in the past, I am afraid that it is the United Kingdom which is the laggard. Perhaps in future we shall not be.<lb/>
We cannot deny that this country was late in joining the Community. There may have been good reasons, but we lost opportunities to take part in decisions which eventually proved to be of great importance to us; for example, the common agricultural policy, which we wish could be very different from its existing form.<lb/>
Some seven years ago I was chairman of a committee which considered entry into the exchange rate mechanism in furtherance of European monetary union. The report of that committee, which was debated in your Lordships' House, recommended early entry into the ERM. The Government did not reject that conclusion but merely said that they intended to enter the ERM but only when the time was ripe. Repeatedly over those seven years when asked the same question the Government have stated that they intended to enter but that the time was not yet ripe.<lb/>
Of course in the end the time became overripe and the Government joined the ERM but in circumstances which were most unpropitious, with difficulties in the United Kingdom which probably need not have arisen had we entered at an early date. That is another example of the attitude taken by the Government to European affairs, which I hope in the future will change and they will be taking part rather than dragging others backwards.<lb/>
Incidentally, I am one of those who believe that this Government have brought immense benefits to the country over the past decade or more. I fear the erosion of those benefits if other hands were to take the tiller. But until today I despaired at this Government's ineptitude in European matters. Not all the arguments are on one side but, as I say, I look for improvement.<lb/>
Today I want to confine my remarks to the proposed single European currency, monetary union and the proposed European monetary authority or central bank. From the evidence given to our committee&#x2014;I realise that in the past week things may have changed, and one hopes for the better&#x2014;it was quite clear that Her Majesty's Government were firmly opposed, as the late Prime Minister herself made all too evident, to a single European currency in the foreseeable future. Vague references were made,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0440"/>
<col>801</col>
which have been repeated today, to the possibility of such a development in the far mists of time. But they carried little conviction. The opposition of Mrs. Thatcher did nothing to support the credibility of the Chancellor's proposal for a hard ecu to supplement the 12 separate currencies of the Community member states until such time as it might replace them because of its superior attractions.<lb/>
Several noble Lords welcomed the hard ecu proposal. I entirely accept that there is much to be said in favour of an evolutionary approach, but I doubt whether evolution into a single currency is likely to come about within a reasonable time after the flotation of a so-called hard ecu. Leaving aside the present ecu, which has achieved a modest, useful existence as a unit of account, I do not see a new hard ecu circulating side by side with existing currencies as a medium of exchange in day-to-day transactions&#x2014;that is to say, the money in people's pockets.<lb/>
The growth in its use would depend very much on whether the local currencies were continuously depreciated by inflation. Assuming that the aim of eliminating anything but marginal inflation in Europe is to be achieved, why should people desert the currency they know for some new fangled ecu, especially if in the UK it did not have legal tender status, as the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said just now? That is a recipe for chaos and very unlikely to lead to the emergence of a single European currency.<lb/>
We all regret the long decline in the international status of sterling, which was still a proud currency on the gold standard when I first entered the City. Like many others, in more recent years I have done my bit in trying to nurse and support sterling. I do not see it ever again being strong enough on its own to hold a place with the strongest currencies in the world. I believe that before too long, even if perhaps not in my lifetime, sterling should be absorbed into a stronger European currency, standing on equal terms with the US dollar and the Japanese yen. We must not be bewitched by our own great past but intelligently and realistically face the future.<lb/>
If we are to have a single European currency, I do not see how we can avoid having a European monetary authority. Whether it would be a bank or a reserve board making use of more independent national central banks would be a subject for discussion. All central bankers yearn for more independence; some believe that they have more than they really have. Only two important central banks have real independence&#x2014;the US Federal Reserve Board in Washington and the German Bundesbank. Both are in this happy position for special reasons. As we all know, federal government in the USA is based on the Founding Fathers' belief in the division of powers. They feared the over-mighty. Hence the independence of the Fed, subject only to regular accountability to Congress.<lb/>
In Germany where, incidentally the US as occupying power had much influence in the early post-war years, the haunting nightmare of the terrible inflation during the period of the Weimar Republic
<col>802</col>
after the First World War has guided them into giving the Bundesbank responsibility for maintaining the value of the currency, with the independent authority enabling it to do so. What a good job the Bundesbank has made of it.<lb/>
As we know, things are different here. But talk about giving increasing independence to the Bank of England has been growing in political circles. Mrs. Thatcher found some attraction in the idea when she spoke to me on the subject before she came to power many years ago. So also did the noble Lord, Lord Joseph, and, more recently, Mr. Nigel Lawson and Mr. Michael Heseltine. My own cynical view is that such ideas flourish only while the proponents have no power to put them into effect.<lb/>
But if monetary union in Europe with a single currency is ever achieved, an independent European monetary authority would undoubtedly be required. Monetary policy, which needs day-to-day attention and not infrequent modulation and adjustment, certainly could not be run by a council of finance ministers meeting in Brussels once every three months. The inevitable trading of short-term political objectives would make a coherent and long-term monetary policy impossible.<lb/>
I see nothing inherently undemocratic in the parliaments of the European countries freely delegating such responsibilities for monetary management to an independent body accountable at regular intervals to those who gave them that authority. No doubt mistakes would be made; even central bankers are not super-human. But the politicians make mistakes all the time partly because short-term political aims so often clash with the needs of long-term economic management. Such management in support of a single European currency, which would be the sole medium of exchange among 12 or more European countries, would be a highly complex task requiring great skill. It would not be quickly organised and put into operation, with due regard to the wide differences in economic prosperity in the many European countries. While momentum must be maintained a blind rush would be disastrous.<lb/>
Willing, as I believe we must, the eventual achievement of a substantial degree of European unity, perhaps we may take some comfort from the success of our American cousins. They have a country almost as large and as heavily populated as Europe, with just as wide differences of prosperity. Their society is a much more recent creation than the ancient peoples of Europe from whose peoples they sprang. They have the advantage of a single language. Nevertheless, their monetary policy covers all that sub-continent and the responsibility for it rests largely with an independent authority. Need we be all that afraid of following their example?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04162"><member>Baroness Serota</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although as chairman of the European Communities Select Committee, I always attend debates on our reports, it is only on rare occasions that I feel the need to add to the excellent work of the six specialist sub-committees which
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0441"/>
<col>803</col>
undertake such thorough inquiries into Community proposals and then report to the House on those which raise important issues of policy and principle.<lb/>
But this particular inquiry into economic, monetary and political union, prior to the two intergovernmental conferences in December, was, as the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, has explained to the House, undertaken by an enlarged Sub-Committee A of which I became a member in view of the constitutional and scrutiny issues involved.<lb/>
First and foremost, I must join with all other Members who have spoken so far in this debate in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, for the way in which he chaired what was undoubtedly a difficult and time-consuming inquiry. The skill and the courtesy with which he presided over our 21 sessions, through a long hot summer, and questioned a large number of distinguished witnesses were quite outstanding. I know that all Members of expanded Sub-Committee A would like to join with me in thanking him for all he contributed to what I believe&#x2014;as I think this debate has already shown &#x2014;has been seen on all sides of the House as a most valuable report, whether noble Lords all agree with its findings or not.<lb/>
My purpose in speaking in the debate is to focus the attention of the House on some specific issues which are dealt with in Parts 6 and 7 of the reports, which deal with the basic principles which should underlie the deliberations at the intergovernmental conference on political union and the practical changes now needed to improve the working of the Community's existing institutions.<lb/>
When the sub-committee was set up last May and its forward programme was planned, none of us could have envisaged that the report would be published at a time when both the parliamentary and public debate would be so heavily concentrated on the arguments for and against economic and monetary union and the ultimate goal of a single currency. I was very glad to hear my noble friend Lord Cledwyn stress the need for us not to overlook at this moment of time the importance of the issues for the future of the Community, which the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, mentioned to us in the context of political union; namely, the democratic legitimacy of its actions, the accountability of institutions, the role of national parliaments and the European Parliament and the principle, which I personally consider to be of basic importance in determining the balance of powers between the member states and the Community's institutions, subsidiarity, which the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, mentioned early on in his introduction to this debate.<lb/>
It is not a word that rolls easily off the tongue, however frequently one uses it. But as we pointed out in paragraph 24 in Part 2 of the report on definitions, it has been in use for a considerable time and has a very respectable history. It is not an example of Eurojargon, but is of course much more familiar in those member states which have written constitutions, such as the Federal Republic of Germany.<lb/>
<col>804</col>
At present it only appears in Article 130R of the Single European Act in the following terms:
<quote>"The Community shall take action relating to the Environment to the extent to which the objectives referred to &#x2026; can be obtained better at Community level than at the level of individual Member States".</quote>
The emphasis then is on the effectiveness of the resultant action.<lb/>
Otherwise, says our report, it is a purely political principle which could be used when deciding to propose Community legislation or when formulating such legislation. After considering all the evidence we received on this subject, including that of Sir Leon Brittan, who defined "subsidiarity" as,
<quote>"you do at Community level only what needs to be done at Community level",</quote>
the committee concluded that the principle of subsidiarity cannot be defined as a precise measure against which to judge legislation, since the test of subsidiarity cannot be wholly objective or indeed consistent over time. We came to the conclusion that, properly used, it should determine not only whether Community legislation is necessary or appropriate at all but also the extent to which it should regulate or harmonise national divergencies and how it should be enforced. For these reasons, the committee recommended that subsidiarity should be added to the objectives set out in the Preamble to the Treaty and perhaps also to the principles in Part 1 but that it should not be justiciable before the European Court of Justice.<lb/>
This view is widely but not universally shared. For example, the Institutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and their <i>rapporteur,</i> Valery Giscard d'Estaing, are recommending that the principle should be enshrined in the opening articles of the Community treaties, with provision for Community legislation to be challenged in the European Court of Justice as being outside the limits of Community powers.<lb/>
Last Tuesday week, when the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, was opening the debate on the Address, he said on behalf of the Government:
<quote>"We believe that subsidiarity must be a major element of IGC reform. This will ensure a clear division of responsibilities, leaving to national governments everything that does not need to be done in common."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 13/11/90; col. 202.]</quote>
Once again today he referred to the Government's position on this issue and, as I understood him, he said that there should be a clear reference in the treaty to this principle. But I still feel a need to ask, and perhaps to ask the noble Lord, Lord Hesketh, when he comes to reply at the end of the debate, what specific decisions the Government have come to in view of the importance we all attach to this principle? Are they in fact in favour of the committee's recommendations which I mentioned a moment ago in paragraphs 165 and 216? How do they think the principle should be defined and how indeed should it be applied?<lb/>
Turning to the question of national parliaments and their role in Community decisions, which have already been mentioned by a number of speakers in the debate today, I should perhaps first draw your
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0442"/>
<col>805</col>
Lordships' attention to the fact that the report includes at appendix 7 a brief note on the way in which the European Communities Committee goes about its work. The key to our scrutiny system, both in this House and in the other place, is the Government's undertaking that they will not, except in special circumstances, agree to any proposal in the Council of Ministers until scrutiny by the committee has been completed.<lb/>
As the note points out, there may be a need from time to time to adapt the committee's working methods to take account of changes in the Community, not least the increased pace at which decisions have been taken since the Single European Act has been implemented. This has led us to send letters to Ministers on urgent matters where there is insufficient time for a full inquiry, and these letters are all published in due course.<lb/>
But it is a tribute to the wisdom and the foresight of those who set up the committee in this House in 1973 and 1974, following the Maybray-King Report, that so few changes have been needed. The terms of reference have stood the test of time: the key to effective scrutiny has been careful selection and flexibility and of course the immensely hard work of the 80 or so Peers who man the sub-committees' inquiries, assisted by the clerks in the Committee Office and their supporting staff.<lb/>
So far as I know, no other House of any other national parliament is so fortunate in terms of the time which its Members devote to Community matters&#x2014;some 3,000 Peer hours in a Session on our last count. I was delighted to hear the praise which has been extended to their work today, and I am sure that I can express the gratitude of all noble Lords who take part in our deliberations for the very kind words that their work in the sub-committees has also received.<lb/>
There are many encouraging signs though that parliamentary scrutiny of Community proposals is being given much greater priority now in all 12 member states. Now, for the first time, there is a scrutiny committee or similar specialist body in every national parliament. A year ago this month representatives of those committees met together for the very first time in Paris as the result of an initiative by M. Laurent Fabius, President of the French National Assembly. Since then, we have met in Cork and in Rome following the pattern of the presidency of the Council of Ministers. These regular meetings have provided a useful forum for contacts and exchanges of experience between those who in committees with very different parliamentary traditions all have a similar job to do; namely, parliamentary scrutiny of EC proposals.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, referred in his speech to the forthcoming conference of the parliaments of the 12 member states and the European Parliament which is to be held in Rome next week under the presidency of the Italian Government. The United Kingdom delegation will include some eight members of your Lordships' House. This will be a unique opportunity for members of national
<col>806</col>
parliaments and Members of the European Parliament to meet together to discuss economic and monetary union and political union in the run-up to the two intergovernmental conferences. From the outset our Government have supported that initiative for this Parliament has much to contribute both in terms of its democratic traditions and its long experience of systematic and detailed scrutiny of Community proposals.<lb/>
Those two developments, and the many bilateral contacts we have with our opposite numbers in member states and the European Parliament where our clerks regularly visit the Plenary Sessions that take place every month, convince me of the wisdom of the report's conclusions, which were unanimously agreed and which the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, appeared to endorse in his speech, that:
<quote>"there must be a partnership between national parliaments and the European Parliament, based on mutual understanding and respect. But a senate of national parliamentarians is not the answer".</quote>
There are those who would argue that the European Parliament, given adequate powers, could alone remedy the Community's democratic deficit. I do not agree. Ministers in the Council of Ministers represent national interests and must remain answerable to their national Parliaments. My noble friend Lord Jay, in his usual forthright manner, argued before the committee that Ministers should be just as accountable for decisions taken in Brussels as they are for those taken in Birmingham. I am convinced that it is no coincidence that the countries with the most developed scrutiny systems, the United Kingdom and Denmark, are consistently at the top of the Commission's league tables for the implementation of Community law.<lb/>
I would have wished to comment on certain other aspects and recommendations in the report, particularly those relating to the more efficient working of Community institutions and the financial scrutiny of Community expenditure. I should also have liked to go more deeply into the need for the full and speedy implementation of Community legislation by all member states once decisions are reached. However, we have a long list of speakers today and it includes many noble Lords who were the members of this or previous relevant committee inquiries. I have no doubt that they will deal fully with all those issues in their speeches.<lb/>
I should like to conclude by expressing my personal belief, based on my experience as chairman of the Select Committee, that this country, with its unique and long-standing parliamentary traditions, has a vital role in building a democratically accountable and outward-looking Europe. I hope that this report will assist all concerned in the forthcoming intergovernmental conferences to achieve that objective.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04164"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the report before us is a remarkable one. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Aldington, to the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, and indeed to all members of the committee for the most exhaustive and authoritative analysis of the issues
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0443"/>
<col>807</col>
involved and, above all, for the clarity of their conclusions. Perhaps I may refer briefly to the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos. I greatly appreciate the tribute he paid to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister.<lb/>
The Prime Minister and I have not always seen eye to eye on many of the important issues which we are debating today. I should just like to say that I look back with nostalgia to happy days of years gone by. There is one other point in the noble Lord's speech to which I should like to refer. He mentioned the merging of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Wales with the Kingdom of England. Of course, in those days there was no United Kingdom. But for that merger of the sovereignty of those two countries, we would still have had immigration officers on Offa's Dyke and we would have been deprived of the most distinguished contributions that the noble Lord makes to our debates.<lb/>
I have addressed your Lordships on many occasions recently on the question of monetary union. Therefore, I do not wish to traverse the same ground again in any detail. I shall only say that monetary policy was brought within the ambit of government control in this country in comparatively recent years; namely, during the time of the Labour Government of 1945&#x2013;50. Today we have two eminent members of that most distinguished Administration present in the Chamber. I can quite understand them still holding precisely the same views as they did 44 years ago. I am only a little surprised that some of my noble friends and right honourable friends have emerged as born again Keynesians and supporters of vintage Labour Party policy. The report is so categorical on the question of monetary union and argued with such detail and conviction that I hope it will now put the issue beyond doubt.<lb/>
Interestingly enough, on the very same day that the report was published, Dr. P&#x00F6;hl was making a speech in London. The important point to remember is not that Dr. P&#x00F6;hl is President of the Bundesbank but that he is also chairman of the committee of governors of the central banks of the European Community. On that occasion, he said that the single currency was really now a matter of fact and no longer a question of argument. In the light of all that, I hope the hard ecu proposal will now be quietly buried.<lb/>
It is not a question of arguing as to what are the merits or demerits of the proposal; quite simply, its time has long since passed. Ten years ago it would have been an interesting and even valuable contribution in building a bridge between the old EMS and a single currency. However, 10 years have come and gone and times have changed. Eleven of the 12 member states are now determined to go ahead with a single currency. In my view the time has come for the Government to stop flogging what is in fact a very dead horse.<lb/>
There is one other comment I should like to make upon the matter. I do so because, unfortunately, the same point re-emerged in the speech made by my noble friend Lord Caithness. I refer to the way that the Government are still talking in terms of a single
<col>808</col>
currency being imposed on this country. There is no way in which a single currency could be imposed on this country. It is a simple point of Community law. It does our position in the Community no good that, on such a point, we are still using rhetoric which is quite untrue and inaccurate and which could indeed be said to be misleading.<lb/>
The other point which causes me some concern is the fact that a decision has now been taken that stage two should start in 1994. The Government have objected to that proposal. However, I still find some difficulty in ascertaining precisely what is their objection. At one time they seemed to be saying, "We do not really know what stage two comprises". All I can say is that everyone else seems to know. All the major problems have been identified and solutions have been proposed. We have even reached the stage where the draft statute of the European central bank has been agreed by the governors of the central banks of the European Community. The Governor of the Bank of England has put in a general reserve as he was instructed to do by the British Government. That alone indicates that our own Government must have known what it was all about.<lb/>
The alternative possibility is that the Government are trying to argue that you should take all the decisions first and then you should fix a date. However, no one ever proceeds in that way; indeed, the Government themselves do not proceed in that way. In the Queen's Speech we were given a list of Bills that it was proposed to present to your Lordships' House and to another place. We were given a date by which those Bills were to be adopted by Parliament; to wit, the end of the present Session. At the time of the Queen's Speech no one had seen any one of those Bills, still less had any decisions been taken by either House of Parliament. The Community has never proceeded in the way that the Government suggest. If your Lordships turn to the Treaty of Rome you will find that the customs union, which was the Community's foundation stone, was to be completed by a date specified in the treaty itself. There were not tens or hundreds but thousands of decisions to be taken. Nevertheless, the treaty specified the date and that date was adhered to.<lb/>
When I launched the 1992 single market programme I followed the same procedure. The first thing I did in January 1985 was to say to my colleagues, "We must fix the date of 1992 as the date by which this programme is to be completed". And because we fixed the date, which was agreed by the heads of government at Milan a few months later, we were able to put in a discipline to ensure that the programme was kept on course. That is why the single market will be achieved by the date now specified in the Single European Act. Incidentally, that Act followed the launch of the 1992 programme. It did not precede it. That is why the date of 31st December 1992 will be achieved. The position at the time that we agreed the date was that the preparatory work was far less advanced than the preparatory work on monetary union is advanced today.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0444"/>
<col>809</col>
Perhaps I may turn from that subject to the much more general question of economic and monetary union and political union. Perhaps one of the most valuable things the committee does is to debunk&#x2014;perhaps I should use a more polite phrase&#x2014;or defuse the arguments which centre upon the use of terms such as "sovereignty", "federation" and so on. Those terms mean such different things to different people that much of the debate is sterile and gets one nowhere. We have now to settle down to the hard task of deciding what should be done.<lb/>
On subsidiarity, my views do not coincide entirely with those expressed in the report. Subsidiarity has become the popular catchword of the moment; too often it tends merely to be a substitute for thought. It is a philosophical concept, more valuable in intellectual or theological disputations than as a guide to decisions. It cannot be treated as a principle to be applied bluntly and rigidly.<lb/>
My experience in the Commission indicated clearly not just how difficult it is to draw the line in the first place, but that subsequently the line shifts so easily. That proved to be the case in the instance of the new approach to standards. I shall not go into that matter in detail, but we started on the subsidiarity principle of devolving responsibility to the member states. We then found that trade and industry were demanding that we took it back at Community level and operated upon the basis of European standards rather than upon the principle of mutual recognition.<lb/>
There is another important point here. While it would often be far better for member states to legislate themselves, and there may well be a consensus that they should legislate, nevertheless, in practice, they will not do so. That may be because they do not trust one another. None of them will legislate unless certain that the others will. That is sometimes because they expect domestic resistance to legislation; sometimes it is due to manifold and ill-defined other reasons. That is a situation that we meet time and time again. I can say only that, for all the reasons that I have given, it would be a serious mistake to incorporate subsidiarity into the treaty. To do so would open up endless opportunities for sterile argument. The committee takes that view to the extent of saying that subsidiarity should not be justiciable, but it then attempts to compromise by proposing that it should be incorporated in the preamble to the treaty. I do not agree with the committee. That device has commonly been used in directives. I can say from practical experience that it provokes endless argument and dissension and provides a basis for opposition and obstruction.<lb/>
I do not propose to say much about the substance of political union. When I went to the Commission in 1985, I would not join in arguments or debates on political union. I then took the view that we would see economic union in my lifetime and that I should work to achieve it; but political union we would not see in my lifetime, and I was only too happy therefore to leave it to a future generation. Unfortunately, events have moved faster than I had at that time anticipated.
<col>810</col>
If we are reluctantly forced to deal with political union, we must deal with it. I do not believe that there is any future in the kind of approach illustrated by the Spinelli treaty of European union, despite the fact that it was favoured by the European Parliament. Your Lordships will remember that it was the subject of a special report by your Lordships' committee in 1985.<lb/>
I believe it more likely that progress will be made by specific increases in Community competence from time to time. That is the way that the Community has always developed. We started with the Coal and Steel Community; we then had the Economic Community and the Atomic Energy Community. We had the launch of the European monetary system in 1979. In 1986, we had the Single European Act which extended or confirmed Community competence in particular areas and also provided a legal basis for political co-operation on foreign policy, although in a somewhat semi-detached form.<lb/>
As each successive step forward is taken, it paves the way for the next development. That is the way I believe that political union is likely to be achieved. We may well see at Rome next month an agreement to clarify or extend Community competence in the field of foreign policy. Technically, foreign policy is not a Community competence at all. It is detached from it but we may at Rome see it brought formally into Community competence. We may also see Community competence extended to defence and security matters.<lb/>
I want to make a brief comment upon institutional issues. In many ways, to whom we delegate power is just as important as what powers are delegated. Community institutions reflect the doctrine of the separation of powers; that is, one has an independent executive, a separate legislature and an independent judiciary. It is a sound principle. Many of our present troubles in this country are due to the erosion of that principle. We should not make the same mistake in relation to the Community. Thus it will be a grave error to subject the Community to control by the European Parliament. The Commission is one of the institutions of the Community which, under the terms of the treaty, enjoys its own functions and its independence. The powers of the parliament are inadequate. But they need to be strengthened in relation to the Council of Ministers, not at the expense of the Commission.<lb/>
The history of the Community is one of development and progress: sometimes faster, sometimes slower, but never completely coming to a halt and most definitely never going back. That is the Community we joined, and that is the Community whose laws and decided policies we were bound by the treaty of accession to accept. We now see this process of development carried forward. The matters considered in the report of your Lordships' Select Committee are an important illustration. It is not simply our obligation to participate; it is very much in our interest so to do.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04166"><member>Lord Cromer</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise with great diffidence as I am not a familiar figure in this House. With even greater diffidence, I apologise for not being able to remain for the completion of the debate. I wish to take the opportunity of adding my compliments and respect to our chairman for the admirable way in which he organised the report. It was an extremely educational, interesting and enjoyable way of passing the hot summer.<lb/>
I wish to touch on a couple of points. So much ground has been covered that it is difficult to avoid being repetitious. I shall do my best. The British are traditionally experienced in the practical field of international payment systems where they are deservedly renowned for having created a high standard, although much of it is now bygone history. The gold standard and the sterling area have passed. But the system took much construction and running which we were rather good at.<lb/>
It was practical British banking leadership which led to the creation of the Bank of International Settlements in 1930 and which fortunately exercised a disproportionately large influence on the creation of the International Monetary Fund at Bretton Woods. That ended with a distinctly American overtone, but the British influence was considerable.<lb/>
It so happens that because I was available at various times as the UK executive director of the IMF and later as a director of the Bank of International Settlements I was conscious of the advantaged position of the United Kingdom as a respected leader in practical international monetary affairs. We had more experience than most of our colleagues. In 1964 the Community set up what later became known as the central banks' governors committee. It was difficult from my point of view as we had walked out at Messina and were not members of the Community. I was rather averse to this group of bankers meeting without my being present. I had to take the necessary action to make sure that we were not embarrassed by not being included. There was no difficulty about that.<lb/>
As a result, I naturally received invitations over the years to participate with bankers and academics in seeking, within international, entirely European, groups, a European payments system. Those meetings took place at different venues and under a number of different guises. Our prime quest was to evolve an international unit of account as an enduring store of value or, if that is preferable, <i>numeraire</i> &#x2014;a benchmark and a currency of exchange. In those days we used to refer to it as a Europa, sometimes a European unit of account and many other similar variations.<lb/>
We went so far as stimulating what became known as the Werner Report and even created a "snake in the tunnel", alleged by some to be a tribute to Basle as a leading railway junction in Europe. It was not a great success, but it was an attempt to get the European monetary system into a controllable form. Then we
<col>812</col>
dabbled extensively in baskets of currencies of various compositions and shapes but never arrived at a pattern that met our criteria.<lb/>
We were, however, always unshaken in our firm belief that no one national currency would enduringly provide the stability we sought. After all, the dissolution of sterling as the instrument of the gold standard and the disappearance of the dollar as the international standard of measurement increased our belief. That continued right up to the devaluation of sterling in 1967. Roughly 60 per cent. of world trade was reckoned by the Bank of England to be carried out in sterling. However, the dollar was the unit of currency. It confirmed our belief that a national currency was not the ideal basis for an international system.<lb/>
So we come to the present, and the ecu. I do not find myself wholly in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, in his remarks about the hard ecu. I do not believe that the basket ecu has the qualities that are necessary. There is little disagreement among us that the final goal is the single European currency. But what will that currency be defined as? The question remains. It must be solved practically, not only in terms of what is academically acceptable but also of what is acceptable in the market. This is one of the great challenges and will remain so. I wish I knew the answer; perhaps some noble Lord will provide it. The basket ecu is a fairly wobbly item: it is not the ideal standard to set for the future.<lb/>
Finally, perhaps I may touch on monetary sovereignty. I should say <i>en passant</i> that monetary sovereignty cannot be claimed on borrowed money. I did as much borrowing in my day as anyone in this House on behalf of the Government. That does not create sovereignty until it is repaid. A certain loss of sovereignty was inherent from time to time in our drawings from the International Monetary Fund. Thus to take a high position on monetary sovereignty&#x2014;I am not talking about political sovereignty, which is different&#x2014;is rather artificial.<lb/>
The suggestion in our report of evolutionary progress towards the single currency is the goal we should keep in front of us. Certainly, for the administration of the currency&#x2014;whatever it may be&#x2014;I share the views that have been expressed about the desirability of a politically independent monetary authority or central bank. I do not like the term "Eurofed"; we use the words "monetary authority". My noble friend Lord O'Brien referred to the Federal Reserve System as being a child of the founding fathers in the United States. In that case the gestation period was rather unusual because the Federal Reserve System came into being in 1908 by which time the founding fathers had been underground for some time. However, that has very little to do with the future that we are trying to achieve.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0523P0I0446"/>
<col>813</col>
the whole of the debate. However, it is in no conventional spirit that I add my congratulations to those already offered to the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, for the way he steered the committee gently but very firmly to an agreed conclusion. Indeed, I believe the noble Lord is in danger of reintroducing the word "consensus" into the British political vocabulary. I for one would be heartily delighted at that.<lb/>
Several speakers have made reference to the way in which this report debunks and dispels mythologies such as sovereignty. One piece of mythology which has dogged debates about Europe has taken the form that the Community monetary authority will in some way come to dictate Europe's economic priorities and objectives, whatever the elected representatives may want or think. That concept may be expressed in the phrase, "The European central bank rules okay". However, that is not all right, in my opinion. That position is not desirable and I do not believe that it would happen in practice.<lb/>
In his evidence Dr. P&#x00F6;hl rightly and understandably laid great emphasis on price stability. He referred to the contribution that the Bundesbank had made to the achievement of that objective in Germany. He laid great emphasis also on the need for independence of a European central bank. That idea has been echoed in debates, not least in the debate here today. We should remind ourselves of what Dr. P&#x00F6;hl said at paragraph 65 of the Select Committee's report where he made it clear,
<quote>"that the Bundesbank recognised the limits of its responsibilities, namely monetary policy. Political and economic objectives&#x2014;such as full employment&#x2014;had to be taken into account, whether by a central bank, ECOFIN, governments, employers or trade unions".</quote>
That was underlined by the present Governor of the Bank of England in the evidence he gave. He said on page 21 of volume II of the Select Committee's report, with reference to the Bundesbank:
<quote>"I know that it is required to exercise monetary policy with a view to price stability and to exercise it free from intervention by central government, yet nevertheless it is required within that prime responsibility to have due regard to the elected government's economic policy".</quote>
The conclusion drawn by the committee is set out in paragraph 83 of the report. We were interested in, if not preoccupied by, the German model as a possible indicator of the way in which we might establish this kind of institution within a European context. It is right that we should reflect on and learn from the German experience and that we should acknowledge the important part played by the Bundesbank in helping to create a climate of price stability in Germany.<lb/>
We have been reminded this afternoon that the Bundesbank had the enormous advantage of preaching to the converted. Experience of inflation after two world wars meant that German trade unionists were more willing than British trade unionists to make their actions conform to the achievement of price stability. The noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, reminded us of that point. However, we
<col>814</col>
should remember that that price stability, and the contribution made by German trade unions to it, did not come mainly from wage restraint but rather from the acceptance of industrial and technological change, training, retraining and modifications in working practices, all in the context of the principle of social partners working closely together in industry.<lb/>
That principle is too often derided in this country, at least on the Benches opposite, and dismissed as corporatism. In short, the German achievement of price stability has not merely been a matter of monetary policy.<lb/>
How effective a European central bank would be in promoting price stability would depend in part on the powers written into its constitution and in part on the toughness of its chief officers in practice. However, what the European central bank does will, at the end of the road, depend on its judgment of what it can do without provoking an undue reaction from national governments, national parliaments, the Commission or the Council of Ministers. The impression I received from listening to Dr. P&#x00F6;hl was that he was as well versed in the art of the possible as any of your Lordships.<lb/>
I would expect a European central bank to give not only national governments but also banks, employers and trade unionists a hard time. If any of my friends are apprehensive about coming under the hammer in that way, I must say that I would rather be exposed to that kind of continuous and predictable pressure than be subjected to sporadic invasions by the faceless men of the International Monetary Fund. I would also regard steady pressure from an institution of that kind as preferable to sporadic lurches by governments of either party into wage restraint as a means of extricating the nation temporarily from a crisis only to sow the seeds of the next crisis. Indeed, the recurrent resort to pretty crude wage restraint has given incomes policy in Britain an unnecessarily bad name.<lb/>
Paragraph 86 of the report underlines the need for economic as well as monetary co-ordination. The report does not dot all the "i"s and cross all the "t"s of economic monetary union, but it opens up genuinely clear new options for Britain. The report offers the means by which we can develop a strategy&#x2014;or even a plan if that is what we would choose&#x2014;for achieving a better life for the citizens of the European Community. That is the test of this report and of all that will be achieved in the coming intergovernmental conference.</membercontribution></p>

On more than one occasion we have travelled together to Brussels when the noble Lord was a member of the economic and social committee.

I thought of him as a good European even though we may not have agreed on everything.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0447"/>
<col>815</col>
I wish as briefly as I can to endorse fully the conclusions and recommendations in Parts 8 and 9 of this admirable report on which the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and the members of his committee, as well as the first-class clerks and specialist advisers, should be warmly congratulated. I was not a member of the noble Lord's committee, but I nonetheless managed to attend some of its meetings. I was particularly struck by the distinguished composition of the committee, which included no fewer than two former Governors of the Bank of England, whom we have just heard.<lb/>
I listened to many most distinguished witnesses whom I happen to know. They included my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, and the present Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who I thought was sympathetic to most of the recommendations made by the committee. I was particularly impressed by the President of the Bundesbank, Dr. Karl-Otto P&#x00F6;hl, Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner, and my noble friend Lord Cockfield. I agreed with a great deal of his evidence and also with much of the evidence given by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, among others, and M. Trichet the Directeur du Tr&#x00E9;sor in France.<lb/>
Ever since the publication in 1970 of the Werner Report, which has already been mentioned, I have been favourably inclined to the concept of a single currency for the EC, and, more recently, eventually for an enlarged European Community. For some 12 years, since I sat in the European Parliament, I have advocated it. Like my right honourable friend Mr. Nigel Lawson, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Geoffrey Howe when he was Foreign Secretary, I have been even more convinced during the past five years of the need for a single currency if we wish a united Europe to be a major power in the world. I say that not merely because I am half French and have many relations and friends in other member states. Surely a Europe completely united economically and monetarily will be stronger than a series of relatively small independent sovereign states. Strength and power must reside in union and must contribute to the effectiveness of the 1992 single market. This must be a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.<lb/>
On more than one occasion in your Lordshps' House and elsewhere I have stressed the benefits of a fixed exchange rate regime and even a hard ecu. However, I agree with the statement in paragraph 189 of my noble friend's report that those benefits are far less than the substantial gains which would derive from a single currency, which is much favoured by industrialists trading with the Continent and by tourists.<lb/>
I agree too that the benefits of a single currency should outweigh fears about the loss of national control expressed in paragraph 75. I therefore agree with many in your Lordships' House and in another place that the sooner we agree to a single currency and go along with the other 11 member states of the EC the better, even if we all have separate problems in that connection. I feel that we must now take the plunge.<lb/>
<col>816</col>
I agree too that the hard ecu scheme is not viable as it stands, although it is certainly a useful step in the right direction which should benefit us in the transitional stage. I also agree with what my noble friend Lord Aldington said about convergence and that highly controversial word "subsidiarity".<lb/>
However, on the question of a European monetary authority and/or a European central bank, it appears that not all experts, even in France, are in agreement. I have just read a book by Mr. Bernard Schmitt <i>L'ECU et Les Souverainet&#x00E9;s nationales en Europe&#x2014;The ECU and National Sovereignties in Europe</i>&#x2014;which I recommend to your Lordships, even though I do not agree with all that Mr. Schmitt writes. He is one of the best known French authorities on the question of international monetary policy. He considers the setting up of a central bank similar to the Fed in the USA Utopian and that realism must entail a rejection of the idea of supranational money. I do not agree with him on that point. Nevertheless, I believe that it is a book which those of your Lordships who are interested in the subject should read, even though we may not agree with everything that he says, although some people in this country do.<lb/>
I wonder whether a committee of governors of the central banks would be able to perform the role of a central bank or monetary authority and be concerned in the transitional phase with the proposed European Monetary Fund.<lb/>
Above all, I consider that we should not remain out on a limb in Europe, with the result that we would not be able to play a full part in developing the overall benefits of monetary union in some form. I agree very much with all that the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, said on the subject.<lb/>
I sincerely hope, therefore, that all members of Her Majesty's Government, present or future, and of our party, as well as those in other parties, will agree with the report's recommendations in Part 9. That is not to say that, like others, I do not greatly admire what our Prime Minister has done to make Britain great again in Europe and the world.<lb/>
I have stated more than once in this House that I do not believe that the loss of sovereignty argument is valid. By joining other international organisations such as NATO and the International Monetary Fund we have already severely curtailed our freedom for independent action. I hope, therefore, that at the next intergovernmental conference Her Majesty's Government will go along in principle with a majority of the other 11 member states.<lb/>
I agree very much with the report's recommendations on political union. However, in this ease I accept that member states must also retain same right of independent action in foreign affairs. I have already referred on other occasions to the success of European political co-operation in which considerable progress was made when my noble friend Lord Carrington was Foreign Secretary and chairman of the EC Council of Ministers.<lb/>
Above all I hope that we shall go forward with our 11 partners to full economic and monetary union. I
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0448"/>
<col>817</col>
agree that that should eventually lead to the establishment of a common monetary authority, as described in paragraph 194. I believe that if we had joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism earlier that would have been beneficial in controlling inflation and reducing interest rates. Between you and me, my Lords, I do not believe that a closer connection with the deutschmark can do anything but strengthen sterling.<lb/>
Again I should like to pay tribute to my noble friend's report and to all those who helped him draw it up. I fully support the recommendations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04171">6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04172"><member>Lord Cobbold</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my congratulations to those of other noble Lords to the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and his sub-committtee for the production of a first-class report. Its coverage of economic and monetary union is the clearest and fairest exposition of this complex subject that has emerged since, if I may say so, the Select Committee's earlier report last December. There are many speakers this afternoon and I wish to touch on only three issues related to monetary union: sovereignty, convergence and the form that a single currency might take.<lb/>
The report's definition and analysis of the sovereignty issue is masterly. The only point that I feel was not perhaps directly addressed is whether Parliament has a sovereign right over the creation of money in the first place. There can be no question but that Parliament has the right to tax and the right to borrow, but it is at least debatable whether Parliament has the right to lend itself money by running the printing presses.<lb/>
For those who believe that politicians cannot be trusted with the management of the money supply&#x2014;and history supports that view&#x2014;it is essential that central banks, like the judiciary, should be independent. However, if I may presume to say so in the presence of two former Governors of the Bank of England, in this country the sovereignty question in the monetary field is about independence of the Bank of England. Once the principle of independence is accepted at the national level, it is less of an intellectual jump to envisage a merging of independent central banks within the Community.<lb/>
With regard to convergence, it is sensible for an advanced degree of convergence to be achieved before the adoption of a single currency. But there is a danger that the call for convergence is used purely as a delaying tactic. I support the view noted by the committee in paragraph 90 that,
<quote>"convergence will be most effectively secured once a single currency is in place, with no more pain than if the struggle is drawn out".</quote>
I for one hope that the process will be shorter rather than longer. I believe that there is a risk, particularly after the political changes that are taking place this week, that the momentum for a single currency may now accelerate and that business will demand fairly fast progress in this area.<lb/>
<col>818</col>
In any event, since a single currency at stage three will take a number of years to introduce once the decision is taken, it would be advisable to commence the process while economies are still converging. Convergence without the single currency locking mechanism, were it ever achievable, might well be followed by resumed divergence.<lb/>
I turn to the question of what form a single currency might take. In the recent evidence that I submitted to the Select Committee, I suggested that the public might not welcome the introduction of an esperanto currency such as the ecu. Since then, we have heard already in this country cries of, "Save our pound". The committee states in paragraph 87 of the report that it sees,
<quote>"no objection to the proposal that national currencies should be redenominated into round numbers, which could then be printed on one side of a banknote or a coin, with the single currency denominated on the other".</quote>
That is indeed a desirable solution, provided that it involves only a small change in the perceived value of the familiar currency unit. Too large a change in value would destroy the consumer acceptability that is sought.<lb/>
I would turn the proposition round. Is it not possible to line up the new single currency with existing known values? The three principal currencies of the EMS are the deutschmark, the French franc and the pound. Together they account for 62 per cent. of the weighting of the ecu and, if East Germany is included, 56 per cent. of the population.<lb/>
The pound has recently entered the exchange rate mechanism at a central rate against the mark of 2.95 and against the franc of 9.89. An adjustment of only 1.7 per cent. in the case of the mark and 1.1 per cent. for the franc&#x2014;well within the narrow 2.25 per cent. band&#x2014;would put those central rates at round numbers three and 10. At 10 francs to the pound a franc is the same as a 10 pence piece. If it were not for decimalisation, a mark at three to the pound would be equivalent to six shillings and eightpence. Unfortunately, a decimal pound is not divisible by three. However, most people can handle without difficulty a mental conversion of three to one.<lb/>
In my written evidence to the committee I put forward a suggestion based on the probability that the deutschmark would need to be revalued within the system before exchange rates were finally fixed. That may still prove necessary and the proposed scheme is still valid. If, on the other hand, further major realignments can be avoided and we manage to get to stage three with existing relationships, a consumer-friendly solution would be to consolidate the &#x00A3;1, three mark, 10 franc whole-number relationship and to fix the value of the new single currency ecu in direct relationship to one or other of the three currencies.<lb/>
The mark may seem to be the obvious choice. At the moment the ecu is worth close to 2DM. However, a case can also be made for the ecu to be fixed at &#x00A3;1, which happens to be the largest monetary unit in Europe. There would then be three marks to the ecu, and 10 francs. For the British and the French there would be little change. The Germans would receive
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0449"/>
<col>819</col>
one new ecu for every three deutschmarks. Such an option would obviously have great appeal to the City of London and is one that the British delegation at the IGC could actively pursue in the national interest. There are other variations for such a scheme and several of the other EMS currencies might also be fitted in with only minor adjustments to their existing central parities&#x2014;for example, the Spanish peseta at 200 to &#x00A3;1.<lb/>
The important point is that the opportunity to enhance consumer acceptability by making use of such round number relationships between Europe's major currencies should not be missed. Where practical the new should be created to match the old rather than the old redefined to suit the new. In all other respects I fully support the conclusions of the report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04173">6.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04174"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this afternoon I speak with diffidence as a non-member of such an eminent committee. I should like heartily to applaud all that has been said about the clarity and lucidity of this report. I fully agree with one of its conclusions; namely, that these issues are well worth discussing in the House.<lb/>
Economic union and monetary union are phrases which in themselves could mean almost anything or nothing. However, in practice what appears to be proposed as a settled aim under economic and monetary union is a single currency and a single monetary policy controlled by a single more or less unaccountable central bank.<lb/>
First, why do we want a single currency? It seems to me that a strange fallacy has grown up recently, to the effect that by adopting a single currency a country can somehow abolish a current account payments deficit. But it does not do that. What a single currency would do to a weak economy would be, first, apparently conceal the deficit and, secondly, convert the debtor country into a more or less depressed area, eventually sucking its population elsewhere if those conditions continue.<lb/>
Producers in such a country would find that their costs were too high and would contract or close down. People would be put out of work and depressed conditions would arise. That is what happened in Northern Ireland over the past 50 years, and interestingly enough is visibly happening in East Germany at the present time. There, unemployment has already reached something like 20 per cent. Therefore I wholly agree&#x2014;it is a pleasure sometimes to agree with the Government&#x2014;with the statement of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer as recently as 11th November on television that a single currency imposed&#x2014;that is the word he used, but I do not think the word matters much&#x2014;on our currency would mean massive unemployment in the present condition of the British economy.<lb/>
Secondly, it is true that to manage the single currency we are faced with a plan for a Euro-fed, independent central bank which Dr. P&#x00F6;hl believes should be wholly free of political control. Since it is sometimes a good thing to consider the real world, in
<col>820</col>
evaluating that issue I should like to remind noble Lords of what happened on 16th March 1939. On that day, Hitler, having seized Prague and the Bank of Czechoslovakia, in the name of the bank put his instruction to the Bank for International Settlements that &#x00A3;12 million of gold deposited there should be returned to him in Prague. At a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements a few days later, Mr. Montagu Norman assented to that arrangement and the BIS duly handed over the gold to Hitler. Some wit made the comment, <i>BIS dat qui cito dat.</i><lb/>
However, when the British Foreign Secretary was asked about it in Parliament he said that he knew nothing about what had happened. When Mr. Montagu Norman was asked by the press whether he had consulted the British Government, he said that politicians should not interfere with central banking. I believe that that incident is worth recording. According to the report, the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, is wholly in agreement with that sentiment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04175"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will allow me to intervene when he is talking about this incident of the Czechoslovak gold, I wish to point out that the gold was deposited formally with the Bank for International Settlements in those far-off days. The Bank of England merely held it on behalf of the Bank for International Settlements as a depositor. It had to obey, and did obey, the instructions of the people who deposited the gold with it. I cannot tell you to what extent the Governor at that time consulted the Government, but as a banker he was absolutely obliged to comply with the instructions of the people on whose behalf he held the gold. It was their responsibility to decide whether that gold should properly be returned to Herr Hitler rather than to the original Czechoslovak owners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04176"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad to have that confirmation of the account that I gave of the incident. The upshot was that the Government were not consulted and Hitler obtained the gold. That is not in dispute.<lb/>
However, there is an even more fundamental objection to a supranational central bank. In a modern economy there is almost always a standing dilemma between high employment, on the one hand, and stable prices, on the other. If one has no incomes policy, one is usually forced to choose between either a rising price level or rising unemployment. That is the most fundamental decision that any modern government have to take other than the choice between peace and war.<lb/>
However, on this issue central bankers&#x2014;worthy and distinguished characters as they all are, as we can see by looking around the House&#x2014;a re inevitably biased. Dr. P&#x00F6;hl has rather condemned himself by saying that there is no need for political control because stable prices will be the sole aim of the central bank. The implication is that employment or unemployment does not matter. Indeed, we have hardly heard the word "unemployment" mentioned in the debate until now. It is no disparagement of central bankers to point that out. Like all of us they have their occupational party line, shall we call it? It is no
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0450"/>
<col>821</col>
criticism of them, but such bias is highly important when one considers how much authority one should put into their hands.<lb/>
The truth is that central banking is too important a matter to be left to central banks. If one has a supranational authority, either it is unaccountable or, in so far as one tries to make it accountable by direct elections or other devices, one is inevitably moving towards a loss of status as a sovereign independent nation.<lb/>
It is not only sovereignty that is now regarded as a legal restriction that is at stake but the fundamental reality of self-government and independence. It is not simply the right of Parliament but the right of the electorate that is at issue. We have hardly heard mention of the electorate and the ordinary people of the country. That issue cannot be fudged. It is a merit of the report that it does not attempt to do so. The status of a sovereign independent nation, as the report points out, is legally defined. It is adjudged by the United Nations when anyone applies to join.<lb/>
Those who do not wish to retain this country's status as a sovereign independent nation should realise that if that concept were applied to Britain, this country would not merely cease to be a member of the Security Council but would cease to be a member of the UN, while about 120 other nations&#x2014;one need not enumerate them&#x2014;would still be members. Those who wish to retain our essential independence and self-government should say so clearly and also accept that in that case a line must be drawn somewhere in handing powers away from the British Government and the British Parliament.<lb/>
I gathered from his speech last week that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, who is not with us now, would be averse to going quite so far as that. He said that he did not wish to see an analogy of the United States in Western Europe. There is also something curiously outdated about the spectacle of the EC at this stage seeking closer and tighter centralisation, when all over the world other societies are seeking independence and a loosening of bonds and Eastern European states are joyfully breaking away from years of centralised authoritarianism. Indeed, even the Soviet Union is being forced to decentralise in order to survive. Surely what we need politically is a wider and looser Europe embracing the EFTA countries to start with&#x2014;many of them would be willing to join&#x2014;the liberated ex-communist states at some stage, and perhaps others, in a freely associating society, and not a narrow, exclusive, would-be super power in Europe.<lb/>
If one insisted on more enforced centralisation, as with a single currency and a supranational central bank, one would surely make it far harder for the EFTA countries and the ex-communist countries to join. Therefore I believe that in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference the UK should stand firm against extreme and authoritarian proposals but&#x2014;I emphasise this&#x2014;should not try to veto other countries in the Community from going further in that direction if they wish. I believe that talk of a two-tier
<col>822</col>
Europe is extraordinarily misguided and misses the point. It would be much truer to talk of overlapping or concentric circles of countries.<lb/>
Finally, it is time&#x2014;since we have gone as far as we have &#x2014;that the electorate were consulted. Parliament surely has no right to barter away essential constitutional liberties which are the property of the electorate rather than of Parliament. So far the electorate has been misled rather than consulted. We should remember that in Mr. Heath's original White Paper which was presented to Parliament in 1971 he said categorically that in joining the EC:
<quote>"There is no question of any erosion of essential national sovereignty".</quote>
The pamphlet circulated to all electors in the 1975 referendum under the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, and others recommending a yes vote stated:
<quote>"All decisions of any importance must be agreed by every member".</quote>
The other yes pamphlet&#x2014;there were two yesses and only one no&#x2014;circulated by the Government under the name of the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, stated:
<quote>"The Minister representing Britain can veto any proposal for a new law or new tax if he considers it to be against British interests".</quote>
It is interesting to note that the latter pamphlet, which some people may have forgotten, stated:
<quote>"There was a threat to employment from the movement in the Common Market towards an economic and monetary union. This could have forced us to accept fixed exchange rates for the pound &#x2026; This threat has been removed".</quote>
In view of what was said by my noble friend Lord Cledwyn about possible referenda, it appears that if those pledges given at the previous referendum are to be honoured the electorate, as well as Parliament, must be consulted again.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04178"><member>Lord Plumb</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Aldington for the thorough research that he and his committee carried out in producing the report on European economic and monetary union and on political union. The fact that so many of its conclusions have already been fully vindicated by events is a tribute to the quality of his work.<lb/>
I fully support my noble friend's views on the democratic procedure, the future development of the European institutions and their relationships with national parliaments in particular. We should remind ourselves of the importance of next week when, for the first time formally, there will be the gathering in Rome of the representatives of this House, of national parliaments and of the European Parliament. I hope that we can obtain a better understanding than has obviously been the case hitherto.<lb/>
I speak with knowledge as a past president of the European Parliament in paying tribute to the courageous lead given by my noble friend Lord Cockfield. Without the pioneering effort that he made in steering his report on economic and monetary
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0451"/>
<col>823</col>
union through the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, we should not have made the progress that we have thus far.<lb/>
The recent European Council in Rome has proved that there is broad support among our Community partners for creating a single European currency by the year 2000. We can now be in absolutely no doubt that Continental member states are serious about this. The prospect of finding ourselves outside a European currency union, therefore, is very real. It is a prospect that I view with the gravest misgivings. The potential damage to the status of the City of London as the principal centre for financial business in this time zone, the risk of our losing foreign investment which has come here because we are part of the European single market, and the probable difficulties for British business in competing in that market through a currency barrier are all extremely grave.<lb/>
There has been some talk of a single currency being imposed upon us. The fact is that the real argument is whether we choose to exclude ourselves and the costs to us of so doing. But while I regard the process of European monetary union on the Continent as unstoppable I think it wrong not to consider the very positive advantages for this country in accepting this process; indeed, there is still all to play for in determining the precise form which it takes.<lb/>
I feel that we have been fighting the wrong battle of late. We cannot prevent the Continentals proceeding down this path. Rather than harbour this illusion we should analyse the benefits which monetary union could bring us and determine that we so influence the course of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference that monetary union, when it comes, is of a form that fully suits our national interests.<lb/>
What are these advantages? As the committee clearly describes, a single European currency is the obvious next step from the completion of the single European market. Savings on transaction costs and the greater commercial certainty brought about by a currency union are acknowledged even by opponents of EMU. The possible savings are assessed, for instance, at some &#x00A3;20 billion annually for the European Community, Businessmen, travellers and tourists will benefit. I submit that that creates employment rather than the reverse. The member states of the European Community already conduct the great majority of their trade with each other, the basic pre-condition for a successful currency union. Intra community trade will increase after 1993, thus increasing the benefits flowing from a single currency.<lb/>
But the single European currency is not just a question of saved costs and the abolition of exchange rate uncertainty. More important are the European monetary arrangements that will accompany the single European currency. We should certainly welcome these arrangements. By definition, devaluation of the British currency against Continental competitors will be impossible; this must restrain inflation and will rule out the "fool's gold" of competitiveness pursued through devaluation.<lb/>
<col>824</col>
That is not just theory. Those of our Community partners who have been members of the exchange rate mechanism have already experienced some aspects of these benefits, albeit in an imperfect form. In the fields of my own experience, in agriculture for example, I have long witnessed the debilitating market-distorting consequences of the parallel so-called "green currency" system. For farmers, our entry into the exchange rate mechanism and the abolition of the green pound is greatly to be welcomed.<lb/>
Again, in commercial banking the expansion of ecu-denominated lending is an indicator of how powerful are the pressures for greater currency stability. The committee has rightly concentrated much of its attention on the controversial question of central bank independence. I have long found it incredible that so many people seem to view with scepticism the notion that monetary policy is of such fundamental importance for the health of the economy that it should be removed from the direct political arena. It is difficult to believe that this country has benefited from the subordination of its monetary policy to political control which, after all, dates only from 1946 when Mr. Attlee nationalised the Bank of England. An independent European central bank would allow government to supplement their programme of privatisation by denationalising British monetary policy.<lb/>
We now realise how absurd it is for British Gas to be ruled from Whitehall and Westminster. It is no less absurd for monetary policy to be decided by Ministers and their officials. We know that the role of central government needs constantly to be scrutinised and frequently to be pruned back. I should personally regard it as a great triumph if the defence of the currency and therefore, incidentally, of personal savings were taken out of the political arena.<lb/>
A European central bank drawing up its membership from all the countries of the Community, but independent of either national governments or the European Commission, is precisely the kind of Europe that Britain is trying to build. It is a Europe based on sound monetary conditions and minimal intervention from governments or the Commission.<lb/>
This is the point where the question of monetary union becomes linked with the question of political union. There is no doubt that the form of institutional arrangements which we devise for monetary union will have a tremendous influence upon the manner in which we propose to conduct other areas of common interest whether it be securing the single market, the environment, or formulating common foreign or eventually even security policies.<lb/>
The benefits of a single European currency for this country are not merely economic. We must not forget the political desirability of binding a united Germany irrevocably into the Western European camp. Herr Kohl will not always be in power, and we have today a perhaps unique chance of ensuring that a maverick Germany will never again pose a threat to the peace of Europe. The European Community is founded upon the pragmatic sharing of sovereignty. Germany's enhanced economic and political weight in the new
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0452"/>
<col>825</col>
Europe should make more rather than less attractive the prospect of an increased British share in German sovereignty.<lb/>
Where does all this leave us now in the run-up to the negotiations of the intergovernmental conferences? If I were to identify the one thing which is absolutely crucial and which the report of my noble friend Lord Aldington has made abundantly clear, it is that we will only be able to influence the debate on European monetary union if we say now that we share our Community partners' ultimate objective to create a single currency to go alongside the single market. If we do this, we will be able to bring our full influence to bear on the timing and detailed form of the process to create that single currency. And our full participation in the discussions on European monetary union will allow us also to influence effectively the debate on European political union.<lb/>
After all the controversies that we have had on these matters, I am convinced that only this can restore our credibility with our partners and secure the true interests of the nation in the crucial negotiations which lie ahead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04179"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down and with the consent of my noble friend Lord Harris, perhaps I may remark on the noble Lord's proposition that the Bank of England became a creature of government only in 1946. The shareholding of the Bank of England, which had previously been in private hands, became the shareholding of the government, the Treasury Solicitor. That made very little practical difference to the position of the Bank of England which remained a confidential adviser of government and the implementer of monetary policy. It is true that in earlier years there was an attempt at independence as the noble Lord will see if he reads the correspondence between the late Lord Cunliffe and Lloyd George in which Lord Cunliffe was unsuccessful in his bid for independence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04182"><member>Lord Harris of High Cross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I readily join others in paying tribute to the Select Committee for its clear and instructive report. In measuring its contribution, there may be value in starting from two propositions which may carry wide agreement at the outset. The first is that the basic purposes and principles underlying the Treaty of Rome are so simple and sensible that it is difficult to see how any student of history or politics could seriously dissent. My second proposition is that implementation must give rise to testing judgments on complex, practical details which are bound to divide people of equal good will. The tragedy now unfolding is that a truly historic movement for increasing co-operation should look likely to prove so divisive in our own country and also threaten to aggravate divisions between and within our EC partners.<lb/>
<col>826</col>
I should like to follow the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, in looking back to the visionary purpose of the architects of the EEC. As he said, their aim was so to unite the warring nations of Europe that a repetition of 1914 or 1939 would be impossible to contemplate. Their solution was to supplant the national socialism of Hitler and Mussolini by the international liberalism of my old friend Adam Smith. Neither Germany nor Italy could have armed for war without the central planning, protectionism and subsidised industry necessary for self-sufficiency in all essential supplies. Thus the Treaty of Rome aimed to prevent any repetition of economic autarky, which Adam Smith had denounced two centuries earlier as mercantilism.<lb/>
If the purpose of the Treaty of Rome was plainly political, its primary method was economic. By entrenching freedom of trade and mobility, the resulting international division of labour would intensify true economic interdependence between nations as the surest guardian of peace. At the same time, it was the best way to spread prosperity among countries with widely differing natural and acquired endowments. As a bonus, free trade would diffuse power and buttress civil liberty. It upset me to read in the report at page 45 that this lofty liberal ideal was rather contemptuously dismissed by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, as nothing more than what he called "a Europe of packages".<lb/>
Many hotly-disputed Euro-issues would be on their way to resolution if the partisans on both sides would pay attention to the following text from Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations.</i> As I have said before, the trouble with this House is that it does not look backward often enough. Smith said in 1776:
<quote>"Were all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation and free importation, the different states into which a great continent was divided would so far resemble the different provinces of a great empire".</quote>
There you have it. It is precisely in this spirit that the promise enshrined in the Treaty of Rome offers the best of both worlds; that is, the economic and the political. The removal of barriers to trade, investment and mobility ensures nothing less than complete economic integration just as though the nations of Europe were indeed part of a single empire. However, at the same time, we preserve the advantages of political decentralisation and democratic accountability among otherwise independent governments.<lb/>
I found most helpful the Select Committee's three definitions of sovereignty, of which the third best accords with common understanding; namely,
<quote>"The extent to which a state had a power of effective or unfettered action".</quote>
In that sense, by completing the single market on the timetable settled by the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, we have in effect agreed voluntarily to sheathe part of our sovereignty in the cause of economic disarmament. But in all other respects separate nations would retain their national sovereignty. However, that national power is denied its destructive outlet in war and is diverted to peaceful competition in the marketplace. That was the dream.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0453"/>
<col>827</col>
A long line of classical economists from Smith to Keynes and Milton Friedman have emphasised that competition requires a strong framework of law and institutions to prevent distortions from vested interests ever seeking special privileges. We know that all short-sighted producers naturally prefer a monopoly in what they sell and competition only in what they buy. That is why I underline that we need in Brussels a strong central, if you like, federal authority to police competition, check subsidies and prevent the future re-emergence of restrictive or monopolistic practices.<lb/>
Strictly speaking, beyond such a commission for competition, full economic union and total economic integration require no further central or federal institutions except a court with power to impose fines for transgression. The danger of multiplying political and social initiatives without end is that they would be the product of the same, often shady, shoddy, opportunistic and nakedly nationalistic power play we recently witnessed over quite trivial cuts in the totally indefensible common agricultural policy. Every vague, starry-eyed, fashionable proposal for further advances in political or monetary union therefore demands the most earnest and searching scrutiny.<lb/>
It is a neglected liberal principle&#x2014;alas often neglected on the Liberal Benches&#x2014;that where trade unites, politics divide. When politicians seek to steamroller national differences by imposing policies, using majority voting&#x2014;artfully called harmonisation&#x2014;the method employed includes inevitably more than a dash of double-dealing in the name of compromise and phoney consensus. The long-term result is less likely to be unity and harmony than the division and mistrust of the CAP, multiplied tenfold or even a hundredfold.<lb/>
Beyond paying tribute to Margaret Thatcher for her magnificent stand on principle in this as well as other matters, I prefer to avoid politics. M. Delors is plainly a lifelong socialist who brings a strong personal commitment to Euro-centralism in his advocacy of the social charter and not least monetary union. I am arguing that neither is necessary for the success of the single market. The contrasting liberal logic, consistent with Adam Smith, points to allowing competitive evolution as the best discovery procedure for determining the pace and direction of progress to fit each nation's changing circumstances.<lb/>
Turning to EMU, on which I had my say in the debate on the Queen's Speech, I must add that any remaining remnants of seduction were tarnished when I read in paragraph 83 of the Select Committee Report that the Eurobank would have "price stability" only as its main objective but also other guidelines including&#x2014;I assure the noble Lord, Lord Jay&#x2014;"a high level of employment".<lb/>
I was further disturbed by the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, on page 47, throwing some doubt on the famous independence of the Bundesbank. Still more revealing was the memo by Mr. John Stevens, MEP, on page 142, saying that even if our Community partners believed that the move to a single currency would be "disruptive"&#x2014;his word&#x2014;they would go
<col>828</col>
ahead because of what he called "the German political imperative". I did not like the sound of that. He implies that weaker members like Greece and Portugal have been bought off in their opposition by the promise of still more cash from the enlarged structural funds. Others will be driven on by nothing more substantial than the vision of EMU as a symbol of political integration. There is enough mischief there to keep the snakes in the snake pit.<lb/>
Mr. Stevens predicts that progress would not be delayed by loose ends and unsettled major issues, even on matters like the extent of a common fiscal policy, because of what he describes as the "steely resolve" to advance to political union.<lb/>
On page 144 of Mr. Stevens' evidence comes the stripping away of the final veil of principle:
<quote>"It is all completely consistent with the way in which Community policies so often advance, namely by leaving unresolved problems in the air which demand resolution by further initiatives".</quote>
We must ask where that process will lead us.<lb/>
I conclude by saying that I predict no happy outcome to this restless pursuit of the European holy grail. In the Select Committee report and elsewhere we are witnessing a descent from the original principles to political opportunism, made worse by the inevitable clash and compromise between 12 versions of short-term national interest.<lb/>
Mrs. Thatcher has for the moment been punished for struggling to keep alive a noble vision, which the noble Lord, Lord Jay, presented from the Labour Benches&#x2014;a vision of an open, liberal and expanding association of free self-respecting peoples, with their distinctive national structures and local loyalties. If Mr. Heseltine or some other pretender now leaps aboard the Euro express he will find himself in for a bumpy ride through hostile country on fixed tramlines heading fast towards the buffers. It is a journey on which he will find a surprising number of enthusiasts for the single market, in both the main parties and none, will not wish to travel with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04183">6.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04184"><member>Lord Barnett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find myself in total disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross. I am not sure whether my noble friend Lord Jay would agree with what was described as the "liberal" element of the debate.<lb/>
I apologise to the House that due to a long-standing commitment which I cannot cancel I shall sadly miss some of the debate at the end. I simply wish to concentrate briefly on economic and monetary union. I can be brief because I largely agree with the Select Committee. I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, along with all the other congratulations that he, my noble friend Lady Serota and the committee received on its excellent report. Even those who disagree with it found it clearly expressed.<lb/>
This much I concede to my noble friend Lord Jay, who seemed to be agreeing to some extent with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was right in not wishing to pre-judge the inter-government conference
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0454"/>
<col>829</col>
but she was wrong to assume that the inter-government conference would settle all the issues in stone for all time. Even the next one or the one after that will not do anything remotely like that.<lb/>
What those of us who agree with the report, and I hope members of the committee and the Government, are saying is that we agree with the central objective but that it will be a long path before we arrive at the objective. The committee brings that out clearly, and I shall say a word or two about that later. But I should like, first, to say something about what might be called the non-issues, and sovereignty is the first matter I should like to take up. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, had a lovely description when he said, understandably as a former Bank of England governor, that it was difficult to have national sovereignty over a huge debt. We need to pay some attention to the people to whom we owe the money.<lb/>
I would put it another way as well. In paragraph 10 the committee referred to a remark of Judge Edwards, who said that it is a dangerous distraction. That must be true. Indeed, the committee quote John Biffen, who was never known as a great European. He said that the issue of sovereignty raises the temperature unnecessarily. Of course it does, and the Prime Minister did us all a disservice by raising the temperature unnecessarily in Rome.<lb/>
The only national economic sovereignty available to us as a country, outside economic and monetary union, is the freedom to have a living standard even lower than we already have in comparison to our major competitors in the European Community. I know some believe that we did very well in the old siege economy days living well outside the European Community. But that is not a view that I have ever held and it is not a view that I hold now. I believe the facts clearly dispose of any sense in that argument.<lb/>
Equally, the next non-issue that I wish to take up is the question of economic and monetary union now. As paragraph 200 of the Select Committee's report brings out, we are not talking about economic and monetary union now. The committee says, and we all agree, that it should not be imposed "before sufficient economic convergence". The committee had difficulty in finding a definition of "sufficient". I have difficulty, as does everybody else, in understanding how we can achieve economic convergence among 12 sovereign states. Indeed, I hope there will be even more member states by the time we reach that stage. Therefore, I can understand why the committee could not give us a clear definition. Nobody can.<lb/>
Indeed, another paragraph of the report states:
<quote>"As yet there are too many imponderables".</quote>
The report quotes the President of the Bundesbank, Karl-Otto P&#x00F6;hl (presumably called the "supreme ogre" in the Community) as saying that he, too, could not see us moving fast along the road until there was greater economic conversion. Therefore, the recent arguments in Rome about stage two are another non-issue. Again, as the report brings out, stage two simply prepares the way for what eventually will be, if
<col>830</col>
we agree the objective, economic and monetary union. However, there is a long way to go before we get to that stage.<lb/>
Perhaps I may also dismiss at this point the concept of consulting the people, as it is called. Here again, the Prime Minister and my noble friend Lord Jay seem to be in agreement on the need to consult the people. My noble friend knows that I have always had the highest regard for him while largely disagreeing with his views, particularly on this subject. Even if we agree the principle of a referendum at this stage, I must ask: what would the question be? Would it be: "Should there be a single currency?" But that is to put the cart before the horse. The fact is that we shall not have a single currency before we have greater economic convergence and economic and monetary union.<lb/>
Equally, there is the question of the hard ecu. I am inclined to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield. At one stage it might have been possible to see it as a possible road towards economic and monetary union, but one cannot forget what has happened. John Major, the Chancellor, said he saw it as a road leading to a single currency. His cricket bat was broken, so to speak, shortly afterwards by the Prime Minister; and given all that has happened it would be a waste of time at this stage to pursue that aspect much further in the Community.<lb/>
The real issue&#x2014;and here I hope the Government will be able to give us an assurance&#x2014;is whether we as a nation want to be part of an economic and monetary union and, thereafter, of a single currency. My answer is, yes, but like the Select Committee I recognise the huge problems about the date when we actually get there. Therefore, in a sense I agree with the Prime Minister. In another context, I would join an exchange rate mechanism. I would join an economic and monetary union, but the time is not yet right, and nowhere near right. There are huge problems before we reach that stage.<lb/>
Let me say at once that I also agree with the Select Committee. When we reach that stage, or before that, I would certainly want to see some democratic accountability. We have had contributions from two former governors of the Bank of England who, not surprisingly, are perfectly happy that governors of banks are accountable to themselves because they know they are always doing the right thing. As a politician I am not so certain. I should like to see some degree of accountability.<lb/>
The Select Committee said&#x2014;I am paraphrasing in the cause of brevity&#x2014;that there should be some power to have national parliaments involved. I very much agree with that. I also happen to agree with the Prime Minister on something else that she said. I would not want to give too much power to a European parliament. The problem with the European Parliament as it now exists, and is likely to exist for some considerable time no matter how directly and democratically elected, is that it largely has the power to spend money while national parliaments have the powers, responsibilities and duties to raise money. In those circumstances, to pretend that you can leave it

entirely to the European Parliament must be wrong. I should much prefer to bring national parliaments more into the mainstream of accountability.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04187"><member>Lord Jay</member><membercontribution>: On that point may I ask my noble friend a question? If most of these are non-issues, and if it is all so far away in the distance, why do we have these intergovernmental conferences?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04188"><member>Lord Barnett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought I had made that clear; certainly the committee has done so. We must have a central objective of where we are going; otherwise what on earth are we doing? I agree with that central objective and that is why I say that these are non-issues.<lb/>
Indeed, in paragraph 18 the report gets to the heart of the problem on this question of a central monetary authority. It refers to,
<quote>"how far the need for a central Community monetary authority can be reconciled with governments' desire"&#x2014;</quote>
the report was not referring only to the British Government but to all governments within the Twelve&#x2014;
<quote>"to retain an influence over economic policy."</quote>
I do not want to see national governments give up all influence over economic policy, though I recognise only too well&#x2014;I only wish that others would, too&#x2014;that the extent of our sovereignty over our own national economy is, to put it mildly, distinctly limited in the modern world. Therefore, while I want to see some accountability to national governments, I recognise that there will be and must be a central monetary authority.<lb/>
I conclude by returning to the central question of whether we want to be genuinely involved in the discussions, and part of the discussions, on the objective of economic and monetary union and a single currency. To some extent there is a chicken and egg argument. The noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, referred to what he did by fixing a date, with which I wholly agree, of 1992 for the single market. That concentrated our minds and without that date I doubt whether we would have got there. He was quite right in that respect. However, I do not believe that we can fix a date for economic and monetary union for the reasons I have already given. Nor should we say that we will have what is called the "big bang" theory of a single currency in advance. That is not the right way to do it. The correct way is to achieve economic and monetary union with much greater economic convergence. A single currency will then almost automatically evolve of itself, because it would be absurd if we did not have a single currency in such a Community.<lb/>
I know that there are some people, like my noble friend Lord Jay, who sincerely in the first place never wanted to join. They now tend, as my noble friend did today, to put up bogies and then knock them down. With the greatest possible respect, to talk in that way primarily ignores Britain's true position in the real world. That is why I strongly support the
<col>832</col>
recommendations in the committee's report. I hope that we can put irrelevant arguments behind us and play an active, positive and constructive role in the Community. That is the only effective way in which Britain can play a serious part in world economics.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04190"><member>Lord Carr of Hadley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I comment on the report, I must add to the praise already given to my noble friend Lord Aldington for his role as chairman of the sub-committee conducting this inquiry, and to our clerk and advisers. This year has been my first experience of participating in a scrutiny of European Community affairs by your Lordships' House. It has been an honour to be so involved and it was a pleasurable and stimulating experience, particularly the inquiry leading to this report. I am sure&#x2014;though it is not necessary to say this&#x2014;that all Members of your Lordships' House understand that the high degree of regard which I believe our committee's scrutiny has achieved, not only in your Lordships' House but far beyond it and outside the shores of this country, is due more than anything else to the skill and dedication of those who chair the inquiries and those who serve the inquiries as clerks and advisers.<lb/>
One of the problems in debating European Community affairs is that the discussion is bedevilled by big words such as "federalism" and "sovereignty" which stimulate strong emotions far more than they stimulate reason. Different people give them totally different meanings. Therefore, I believe that one important part of the report is the way it has most carefully defined some of the big words which keep on cropping up.<lb/>
Perhaps I may strongly add that, keen European that I am and have always been, I most definitely do not support and have never supported the concept of a single unitary state; nor does the report support such a concept, or foresee it. When people fear this they must face up to and come to grips with some of the spectres or ogres that bedevil these discussions. They are nothing more than nightmares. There are some very prominent people in Europe who hold these views. I do not believe that there is a party (nor individual leader in any of our European democracies) which would win power if it were to come out in support of such a concept. Though no one can say what may happen in decades or centuries in the future, the single unitary state is a false bogy at the moment.<lb/>
My noble friend has set the overall scene dealt with by the report so fully, comprehensively and valuably that I wish to concentrate on one subject only&#x2014;that is to say, the single currency. I propose to do so not by posing as an economic or financial expert but as a politician. I do not apologise for that. I use the word in the broad sense. I believe that the task ahead of us is above all a political one. It is part of what someone once expressed most graphically as the endless adventure of governing men. I disagree with some of the analysis of my noble friend Lord Cockfield. I do not disagree with him at the intellectual level but
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0456"/>
<col>833</col>
because I feel that, if we are to bring this ship home to port, the intellectual argument has to be moderated to some extent by deep political considerations.<lb/>
The whole weight of evidence leads to the conclusion that, if we are to maximise the long-term benefits of the single market, then we need a single currency. You cannot have that without also having a single European monetary authority. I do not doubt that that is what the weight of evidence shows, and I believe that that conclusion is backed up by considerations of common sense. Economic benefits are very important. They are very much wanted and appreciated by the people of our own and other countries. However, they are not the only factors that matter in life. The economy is made for man and not man for the economy.<lb/>
I do not seek a single currency at any price. It would be in the interests of Britain in particular and of Europe as a whole to seek seriously and with determination to find ways to bring it about which are both economically effective and socially and politically acceptable. What are the essential requirements for doing that? Above all, we must not try to proceed too fast. We must rule out any approach towards the "big bang" way of doing it. There are several reasons for this.<lb/>
First, the purely technical problems are considerable. For that reason alone there has to be an adequate, and possibly defined, amount of time in stage two to design, set up and test the component parts before we move to stage three. Therefore, no date should be given to the beginning of stage three, let alone the end of it. There may come a time, for the reasons given by my noble friend Lord Cockfield, when it will be necessary to set dates. That is a considerable way off so far as stage three is concerned.<lb/>
Secondly, for economic, political and social reasons, we must have time to achieve greater convergence between the economies of the different member states before we come to the single currency. Some argue that establishing a single currency is the essential instrument for achieving convergence. I see force in that argument, but it is a dangerous overstatement and misreads the economic and political factors with which we have to deal. There will come a time when convergence is near enough and the introduction of a single currency will be the necessary instrument to bring the matter to a final conclusion. If you apply that force too soon, then I have little doubt, and certainly very much fear, that it will almost certainly lead to sharp increases in the differences in employment opportunities and living standards between different parts and within different countries in the Community. In the end that could make the whole concept politically and socially unacceptable, and could indeed kill it. Therefore, we must make further considerable progress in a long convergence before we leap into stage three.<lb/>
Thirdly, we need time to narrow what has been described as the democratic deficit in the way in which the Community's affairs are presently conducted. The report before us makes proposals to that end. That is
<col>834</col>
essential if the achievement of the economic goals is to win the acceptance and confidence of the peoples of Europe. If the customer is always right it is the peoples of Europe who are the customers for what we are doing. That requires action in relation to the European Parliament, and proposals about that are contained in this report. Even more importantly, it requires action by national parliaments. Although it is perhaps difficult and delicate to say so as a Member of your Lordships' House, this matter requires much more progress in another place.<lb/>
Perhaps I can say this more easily than some of your Lordships. For a long period I was a Member of the other place, and I have many colleagues who are in the same position. For a short time I was the Leader of the other place. Therefore, I understand only too well the difficulties, but I believe they can be surmounted if the will is there. It is necessary for both Houses of Parliament to realise that the social and economic affairs of Europe are now among the most important issues that need to be dealt with in the interests of the people of this country and the constituents whom Members in another place represent. Therefore, the other place must give these matters priority not only in the amount of time devoted to them but in the prominence dictated by the time of day at which they are discussed and reported. That is of the greatest importance.<lb/>
Thirdly, it is necessary to pursue the idea of subsidiarity. Although I heard and understood the reasons for the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Cockfield on this subject, I think it is necessary to write this matter into the preamble of a future statute. Finally, it is only if we follow this careful, thorough, step-by-step approach that we shall assuage the fears and win the confidence of many people&#x2014;and not only in this country&#x2014;on the surrender of sovereignty which is involved.<lb/>
I agree strongly with the report's conclusion that the pooling of United Kingdom sovereignty with that of other states on the issues of economic and monetary union need not jeopardise parliamentary sovereignty. It will not do so provided we take the time and care needed to work out and define the terms of reference of the new European monetary authority and its procedures for accountability to the Council of Ministers, to the European Parliament and, particularly importantly, to national parliaments as well. That is of special importance so far as Britain is concerned. At the risk of appearing to repeat myself, this applies above all to the proceedings and concerns of the other place.<lb/>
In conclusion on this vexed, emotive question of sovereignty, let us remember three things. What really matters is our country's effective influence in the affairs which affect our lives; and increasingly in the modern world that may be achieved by pooling some aspects of sovereignty with that of other states.<lb/>
Secondly, we ought not to exaggerate, let alone romanticise, the sovereign independent power which we have exercised in these matters over recent decades. If I am honest, I cannot remember in 26 years as a Member of another place, or even as a Cabinet
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0457"/>
<col>835</col>
Minister, being much consulted, or my advice, let alone my approval, sought very much in advance about decisions on monetary policy. They are by their nature taken more or less in secret. That is unavoidable. So let us not romance about the amount of control we have had, and therefore about the amount we shall be losing. More often than not we are reacting to other people's actions in the present world.<lb/>
I would rather have these matters settled by a proper monetary authority, with proper terms of reference and proper accountability, on which we have proper representation, than always be reacting to something which is done by the German Bundesbank or in other countries. I believe that Europe as a whole would he on more equal terms in monetary affairs with the United States and Japan, and that we should be on more equal terms as a member of that grouping than we are at the moment.<lb/>
Finally, as the report makes clear and as my noble friend Lord Aldington stressed, there is a very big difference between the sovereignty involved in the EMU and what would be involved if we had to consider putting foreign affairs within the competence of the European Community. Then we really should lose national sovereignty and that is not something which we ought to do. We must make a success of our affairs in Europe; we must be in the vanguard and not in the rearguard of these events, and I believe and hope that this report will help to that end.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04192"><member>Lord Roll of Ipsden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the report we are debating today matches perfectly the importance of the issues with which it deals. From a medium and long-term view there is none as vital for the future of our country. The noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and his committee deserve our congratulations and gratitude for a masterly document. It is particularly noteworthy in that it presents, very objectively and clearly, all the various views that can be held on these complex issues and yet it is not a bland document. It comes to quite clear-cut conclusions. I say at once that I agree wholeheartedly with the committee at least on all crucial points. The report comes at an opportune time, just before the opening of the intergovernmental conferences on monetary and economic union and political union. I propose to confine myself to the former.<lb/>
Now that the long-playing Whitehall farce "The Ripe Time"&#x2014;or was it "The Right Time"?&#x2014;is off the boards, I hope that we shall not again be involved in semantic acrobatics; for example, as to whether monetary union is to be imposed. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, in last week's foreign affairs debate and again today has put this red herring firmly where it belongs. It has often been said&#x2014;for example, last week in the economic debate by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead&#x2014;that we have disadvantaged ourselves enormously in our relations with Europe by always being late.<lb/>
Before the Macmillan Government took their historic decision in 1962 to seek membership of the Community there were, as your Lordships may well
<col>836</col>
imagine, the most intensive and detailed studies in Whitehall on the possible consequences of such a step, including particularly the common agricultural policy, which was at that time just being debated inside the Community and which we regarded, I think rightly, as the main stumbling block.<lb/>
In sending forward our report to Ministers I said:
<quote>"We must not suppose that we can square the circle. A solution which pleases everyone is out of the question. But our best chance of making the best of it lies in influencing the Common Agricultural Policy before it is completely settled".</quote>
I ended by quoting the obvious:
<quote>"If it were done when 'tis done, 'twere well it were done quickly."</quote>
Alas, it was not possible then. I had hoped that the Government's endorsement of the objective of monetary and economic union in the Single European Act, and in so many solemn declarations since, had shown that we had at last learnt our lesson. I am not sure that that is so.<lb/>
I had also hoped that by this time some of the more extravagant attacks on the Community and its aim of monetary and economic union would have ceased, including the personal attacks on President Delors. I should like here to join in the tribute which the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, paid to him last week. I first had dealings with M. Delors when he was French Finance Minister and I fully endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, said. To hear some people, M. Delors is a rabid, red revolutionary. It should be remembered that the remarkable turn-around in French economic policy, and subsequent economic performance, which started in 1983 was very largely his work.<lb/>
Although the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, and my noble friend Lord O'Brien of Lothbury have, I think successfully, dismissed the hard ecu proposal, it deserves a few more words since it still seems to be the centrepiece of the Government's policy. As an analysis of possible monetary arrangements it belongs to a very long series of similar efforts; and those with an antiquarian interest in these matters may like to compare it with, for example, the proposals made by Alfred Marshall over 100 years ago and the many discussions on the gold standard, the gold exchange standard, a standard based on commodity indices and many others, including Bretton Woods; though it should be remembered in regard to Bretton Woods that the dollar, the basis of the Bretton Woods system, is a real currency, legal tender in its own country and, as it is still the major transaction currency, widely accepted everywhere else.<lb/>
In the form presented by the Government it resembles&#x2014;though it is, I believe, analytically inferior&#x2014;a proposal produced by our most eminent living economist, James Meade. To my mind, the essential point is that it is not a proposal for the further development of the European monetary system nor for the creation of a common or eventually a single currency, but rather for the setting up of a separate and separately managed standard which may or may not in time act as another, thirteenth, currency
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0458"/>
<col>837</col>
according to whether it is used alongside national currencies&#x2014;a point dealt with by my noble friend Lord O'Brien.<lb/>
These national currencies have the great advantage over the ecu not only of custom but also of being legal tender and they are used by everybody. We know that in at least one important quarter the view has been expressed that the hard ecu would not be much used. Thus neither its use as a parallel currency nor its use as a standard for exchange stability is really guaranteed. That being so, I find it extremely difficult to see why it should be called evolutionary.<lb/>
This proposal must above all be judged not in terms appropriate for sophisticated discussions in the classroom but as a diplomatic move; and its purpose was clearly diplomatic both domestically and internationally. As the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, said, had it been made after the collapse of the first Community attempt at monetary union, the Werner plan, and certainly before the adoption of the European monetary system in 1979, there might have been some inclination to consider the creation of an outside unit of account which would also somehow have been made to act as an increasingly common currency and standard of value. That might have had some virtue to be discussed. Even then, I suspect it would not have lasted long.<lb/>
But it came after the EMS and its essential mechanism, the exchange rate mechanism, had been going for more than 10 years. These were and are instruments internal to the Community, to its currencies, its monetary policies and its monetary institutions. Moreover, the Community had decided to move towards the achievement of the agreed goal of monetary and economic union by building on the existing system and mechanism. We belonged to the system but not to its operating mechanism. Only very belatedly did we accept that mechanism in principle; and then we delayed putting it into operation. We also subscribed to the objective of monetary and economic union but had shown&#x2014;to put it mildly&#x2014;little enthusiasm for it.<lb/>
Therefore, is it surprising when we belatedly produce this new proposal&#x2014;which in the words of its authors involves monetary control being exercised simultaneously both at national and community level with no indication of how this duality is ever to work while it lasts or whether it will be made to disappear over time, and with no commitment that we accept the ultimate objective&#x2014;that it is firmly rejected by the Community and particularly by those who have most experience with successful monetary management.<lb/>
In my view, Bundesbank President Dr. P&#x00F6;hl has quite rightly pointed to the confusion and potential conflict of policy to which the proposal would lead. Nevertheless, it is worth remarking parenthetically that this proposal was most courteously received by our partners in the Community, which is very much in contrast to what has been said in some quarters in this country about the Delors plan. Indeed, I remember some people describing it as infamous. I checked the definition of the word in the dictionary in case I had
<col>838</col>
missed something and found that it was defined as "vile" or "abominable". Those are certainly not words which any of our partners have used about the hard ecu proposal.<lb/>
When you add to that central flaw the many other unanswered questions, such as whether or not the ecu would, or indeed could, become legal tender, or how the objective of price stability, which the European Monetary Fund was to secure, was to be measured and achieved, I am not surprised that the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, in its report unequivocally concludes that the hard ecu is not viable as it stands.<lb/>
Suggestions have been made for hardening the existing ecu. That is perhaps what the committee had in mind when it stated that the hard ecu could help with preparation for monetary union. That is one aspect of the committee's conclusions about which I am not convinced. I am delighted that my noble friend Lord O'Brien has a similar view. However, be that as it may, it would in any case be absolutely essential, first, that the ultimate objective of monetary union should be clearly reaffirmed; secondly, if there is to be a process of hardening the ecu, that it should not be in the hands of a newly created institution but firmly in the charge of the European Committee of Central Banks&#x2014;the forerunner of a future European central bank; and, thirdly, that it should be regarded only as an adjunct to the other aspects of the progress towards a single currency.<lb/>
Whatever details the Commission's plans may need to undergo &#x2014;and without a doubt they will have to undergo some&#x2014;its essence of reliance on the narrowing of exchange margins with the ERM, increasing collective management to achieve this objective, and simultaneous progress in convergence of economic policies (which narrower exchange margins will themselves facilitate) must remain the basic next steps.<lb/>
When we joined the ERM, at a time and in conditions now regarded as far from ideal, it was stated that we hoped to move soon into the narrow band of exchange margins. That may not be so easy; nor indeed may it be easy to keep pace with our partners in the progress towards the start of stage two. From every point of view, not least the position of the City of London as a premier financial centre, it is highly desirable that there should be no delay, or, if there must be some delay, that it should be as short as possible. However, if it proves impossible to avoid some delay we should nevertheless join whatever projects emerge from the intergovernmental conference even if our economic circumstances at the time oblige us to seek for ourselves a device, well accepted and much practised in the Community, for a short delay in working it out. If the Government's optimistic forecasts of economic developments, especially on inflation, prove right, perhaps any such delay can be avoided.<lb/>
As for the single currency, in some quarters it is regarded as an unacceptable surrender of sovereignty. I shall not go into the more arcane philosophical aspects of sovereignty. But if on any particular issue
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0459"/>
<col>839</col>
the practical question is whether we need to preserve an absolutely unfettered right of national decision-making, I think that this, for a trading country such as ours, is not one of them. As the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, pointed out, we do not have it now. I cannot understand why those who argue all the time that you cannot buck the market should think otherwise. Even the Tudor monarchs had experience of the constraints which we now call Gresham's law.<lb/>
The single currency is certainly some, or perhaps many, years away. However, it is one example of the need&#x2014;precisely when you look some years ahead&#x2014;to be prepared to think afresh. Let us take another example. In 20 years' time, which is not so very far away, the four leading countries in terms of gross domestic product will be China, with over 6 trillion dollars and somewhat ahead of the United States; Japan, the Soviet Union (if it survives as a union); and Brazil. No single European country will reach even 1 trillion dollars. The four largest European countries taken together will only just be ahead of Japan; nor are the demographic trends favourable to Europe.<lb/>
We in this country still possess great social, moral, political, intellectual and indeed material resources. But is it not crystal clear that we cannot hope to use these to the best advantage for ourselves or to deploy them to the advantage of the world, except within the indispensable framework of Europe? And this, for many years to come, must mean the Community.<lb/>
Our decision in regard to European integration is, I think, the single most important example today of the vital necessity to develop new mental attitudes. The great mathematician, Alfred North Whitehead, who left Cambridge, England, to become a great philosopher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said what I believe to be the last word on this supremely difficult task. He said:
<quote>"The task of free society consists first in the maintenance of the symbolic code; and secondly in fearlessness of revision &#x2026; Those societies which cannot combine reverence to their symbols with freedom of revision must ultimately decay either from anarchy or from the slow atrophy of a life stifled by useless shadows".</quote>
Throughout its history, this country has shown an extraordinary aptitude to achieve just that combination. We must not fail now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04193">7.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04194"><member>Lord Butterworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a member of the sub-committee, I wish to join all those who have expressed thanks to my noble friend Lord Aldington. I should also like to congratulate him on so skilfully presiding over the production of a report, the character of which may well permanently have shifted the British argument in this area.<lb/>
I confess immediately that I may not be prepared to go quite as far as the report goes in certain respects. However, many of the major tenets are undeniable. First, on the evidence we received, it would be difficult logically to deny now that the benefits of a single currency are the natural complement of a single market. Secondly, although some of the comments
<col>840</col>
made on this aspect today were somewhat equivocal, Britain is now fully committed to the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union.<lb/>
I recognise that a single currency may well be the ultimate solution. My problem is that so many decisions still need to be taken before the single currency can be established. I refer to decisions required to complete the single market and to identify all the stages which are necessary to complete monetary and economic union. In my view it would be politically irresponsible to appear to be accepting all those changes even before we know what most of them will mean.<lb/>
We clearly need experience of the single market before we can, with confidence, commit ourselves to a single currency. Most governments in Europe would seem to assume that the single market has already been organised: the truth is that much still remains to be done.<lb/>
We need to take all the difficult decisions which will make the single market a success; otherwise it could so easily fail. Our report refers to problems of insurance. Other difficult areas are the movement of animals and plants, political asylum, drugs, firearms and public health regulations. Moreover, many Community regulations need to be pruned. They are inhibiting free flow within the market.<lb/>
Next, we must identify the decisions that need to be taken to achieve stage two. Convergence has already been mentioned. Our report states that the switch to a single currency should be undertaken only after "satisfactory convergence". But what does "satisfactory convergence" mean? How much convergence is satisfactory? Unless we can recognise what amounts to "satisfactory convergence" we may launch the single currency prematurely and do great damage to the weaker currencies.<lb/>
Do we agree with countries joining the new single currency seriatim; that is to say, when each country considers that it has achieved "satisfactory convergence"? Again, there is a view prevalent in Europe that sufficient convergence can be achieved only by direct assistance being given to some of the poorer member states. The Delors Committee Report hinted that the increased structural funds could be used for that purpose, but the Commission immediately distanced itself from the opinion. The possibility of financial assistance is a factor in the expectation of a number of member states. Reference in Community documents to "economic and social cohesion"&#x2014;they are words to look out for&#x2014;is Euro-jargon envisaging the possibility of setting up funds for that purpose. We then need to know what powers individual countries must be prepared to surrender to the centre. How can anyone talk about the length of stage two before we know what is to go into it?<lb/>
One of the functions of the IGC will be to recommend what powers should be surrendered to the centre if a single currency is to be launched successfully. Monetary powers to be surrendered to the new central bank may not be difficult to identify and would probably not cause any political problems.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0460"/>
<col>841</col>
However, the economic powers that would need to be surrendered to the centre are a different matter. Here the centre does not mean the central bank; it means the Council. As our report points out in paragraph 68, the Delors Committee Report implied that tight controls would be necessary on member states' freedom of action in fiscal and budgetary policy.<lb/>
The Commissioners' March 1990 paper seemed to reject that approach and suggested instead that "binding procedures"&#x2014;whatever that may mean&#x2014;would be sufficient. The problem is of course that irresponsible action by national governments, such as running heavy budget deficits, could undermine the viability of the single currency. Recently, some member states, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have made it clear that they would not consider joining unless the Council had express power to set clear limits in that area. An economic power of that sensitive kind goes to the heart of an individual government's political responsibility to its legislature and ultimately to its electorate. What would happen over the Budget if the Chancellor of the Exchequer confessed to the other place that he could not deal with the problem because the power had already been surrendered to Brussels?<lb/>
At the moment we are so far away that governments do not need to commit themselves wholly to a single currency, especially when there is no agreement as to what the next stage should comprise or what powers it is necessary to surrender to the centre. The purpose of the IGC is to identify those problems and to make recommendations. They can then be debated in the House and elsewhere. Once agreement has been achieved amendments to the treaties can be drafted for presentation to individual national parliaments.<lb/>
If one reflects upon the steps that must be taken&#x2014;the completion of the single market to make it a free competitive market and the identification of the stages within stage two&#x2014;there is much to be said for some kind of evolutionary approach to enable the European Community to have experience of each stage as it works progressively towards a single currency. The difference between the two courses, as I have tried to describe them, is not great. The advantage of the evolutionary course has the merit of being consistent with the democratic accountability of the governments involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04195">7.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04196"><member>Lord Greenhill of Harrow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all members of the committee are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, for his magisterial chairmanship of it, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, for her calm oversight of all that we were doing. As one of the least qualified members of the committee, I shall speak simply and briefly. Most of the technical aspects of the problems have already been brilliantly discussed.<lb/>
I wonder how much the importance of the coming IGC is understood by the general public. Over the past two decades and longer, British Governments, political parties and the media have paid inadequate
<col>842</col>
attention to the trends in Europe and have nourished our traditional lack of interest in what goes on across the Channel. We must add to that the language problems and the memories of some people of the 1940s years of disaster.<lb/>
Contrary to the view of some noble Lords, it is by no means all our fault that we have missed part of the journey of the famous European train described by the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield. The ticket office was shut on us by a vindictive General de Gaulle; and that simple act was well understood by the public here.<lb/>
President Pompidou relented in due course, but not until the requirements of his government on agriculture and other matters had been met. I hope that in the coming months a special effort will be made to explain to the British people what is at stake. I hope that a majority in all parties can come to agree on where our interests lie. This report will, I think, contribute to that understanding.<lb/>
I was particularly struck by the remarks made by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, in recent speeches. They are two statesmen who do not usually agree on Europe. On 13th November, the noble Viscount said:
<quote>"I wish that the major political parties could agree on the main objectives &#x2026; Our negotiators, whoever they are, will not obtain the best deal for Britain unless they are supported by a manifest consensus at home. This is a great issue; it is much greater than party politics".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 13/11/90; col. 226.]</quote>
The noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, had the same thought in mind. He said on 14th November:
<quote>"I become increasingly convinced that the two party politics in this country have served the vital question of our relations with Europe remarkably and almost impartially badly".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 14/11/90; col. 348.]</quote>
It is easier to agree with these two noble Lords if one sits on the Cross-Benches, but even the most ardent party man must admit that there is more than a little truth in what they say.<lb/>
The Aldington Committee was an all-party affair. If its advice is accepted by all parties, our negotiators will be in a much stronger position. I have confidence that the isolation for which we are mocked will diminish when reality rather than the rhetoric of the Community is faced.<lb/>
Great emphasis has been laid on the supposed unity of the 11. They may share a vision, but, when realities are faced, as we have seen recently on agriculture, automobiles and insurance, there are marked national differences. I recognise just how difficult it is to ask for unity between our political parties at this time, but the cost of disunity will be high.<lb/>
Perhaps I may make one further point on an entirely different subject&#x2014;the enlargement of the Community. The report did not elaborate on this; I do not think that it was in the terms of reference. The committee reminded us that the Community remains open to new members. Do all the present members have any wish to enlarge the Community? Personally, I have doubts. I am assured that I am mistaken, but I have met several significant Europeans over recent times who agree with me. What, for example, is to be
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0461"/>
<col>843</col>
made of M. Delors' recent statement that his objective was a unitary state with the Commission as the executive and the Council as senate? This suggests to me that his unitary state does not include any country other than the existing members. His proposed objective appears to me to make the entry of several desirable partners difficult, if not impossible.<lb/>
The policy of Her Majesty's Government is, I believe, aimed at an enlarged Community. I hope, like the noble Lord, Lord Jay, that as soon as possible it will include the Scandinavians. From a democratic and historic point of view they are as reliable as, if not more reliable than, some of the existing members. They are the largest trading partners of the Community. I hope therefore that Her Majesty's Government will continue to prepare for enlargement.<lb/>
I return for a moment to my original point. At this critical time it makes little sense that our national interests in this vital area are the subject of party bickering. Is there not enough common ground on Europe between all the parties to give our negotiators in Brussels significant support and to secure in this country wide public agreement across party lines? Is this too much to hope for? I am afraid that it may be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04197">7.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04198"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been in political life for a long time. Taking up the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, I can hardly remember a week in the past 50 years which was not a critical time of one kind or another.<lb/>
The report we are discussing this evening seems to me to be based on two assumptions which so far as I am aware were not articulated in the committee itself. Thanks to the courtesy of the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, and the chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, I was able to attend almost every session of the committee. The two assumptions which were not articulated were, first, that the European Community itself, taken as an entity, has so far been a resounding success. To disagree with that assumption immediately invites one to be a heretic.<lb/>
As your Lordships know, on certain matters I am a heretic. Nevertheless, from the record, what is the success which is assumed? The gross domestic product in the Community as a whole over the past 10 years has been markedly below that of Japan and the United States. Inflation over the Community as a whole has been higher than in both Japan and the United States. Unemployment has been much higher in the Community than in either Japan or the United States.<lb/>
The Government, with an adjusted figure of 1.7 million unemployed, boast of their success against wider and greater unemployment in Europe. That unemployment has oscillated between 11 million and 15 million over the past 10 years. That does not take into account quite a large number&#x2014;almost 1 million&#x2014;of migrant workers who have since departed from some of the EC states and gone back to their own countries without being included in the unemployment figures.<lb/>
I do not wish to embarrass noble Lords who may not have thought of these figures previously, but they
<col>844</col>
are valid. They show that the dream of the European Community in terms of economic progress lies more in the realms of propaganda, financed considerably from funds provided by the member states as well as by organisations such as the European Movement.<lb/>
Some noble Lords talk of the single market as being the end of the whole process of the freeing of trade within Europe. However, they forget that ever since 1972 we have progressively moved towards a single market for about 90 per cent. of the goods and services provided by this country. All we have been seduced into believing is that the achievement of the single market represents a goal which in point of fact should already have been achieved in any case. All that this talk amounts to is a shifting of the goal posts. They know quite well that the Common Market as an organisation has not lived up to its original expectations. Therefore they shift the goal posts and declare that in 1992 when the single market arrives everything will be all right.<lb/>
These are weighty matters. I regret that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, is not in his place at the moment. However, in his valedictory speech to the European Parliament he remarked rather regretfully that up until then the European Community had merely comprised of the Common Market plus a few peripherals. Those were the words he used and he was right to say that.<lb/>
It is not often realised that at present the European Community is largely concerned with the common agricultural policy. According to the Government's own figures, the common agricultural policy has resulted in the average British family of four paying &#x00A3;17.50 a week above normal world prices for its food. The common agricultural policy is the biggest protectionist racket that has ever been devised by any bureaucracy. It goes completely against the much lauded sentiment of free enterprise and right into the realms of protectionism. By its continued existence, despite a 30 per cent. reduction in subsidies dated back to 1986, the common agricultural policy is still a bar to the proper achievement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such an agreement would be a valuable achievement if we could obtain it. It would free world trade to a far greater degree than is the case at present.<lb/>
I am sorry to have to speak somewhat expansively about this matter. I would be glad to be contradicted. I suppose that some noble Lords who have listened to me before will consider my remarks to be old hat. They will say, "We have heard it all before. This is the referendum argument reproduced all over again". However, it is nothing of the kind; it is a plain objective statement of fact which I challenge anyone to refute in detail.<lb/>
Many of my best friends are bankers, including happily my bank manager. However, the second basic assumption that lies behind the report is that bankers are somehow the final repositories of all human wisdom and that banks are solid, impartial institutions that can be relied upon to look after one's investments. I have been in politics a long time and I well remember the exploits of Montagu Norman and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0462"/>
<col>845</col>
others. I have had the benefit of reading Cabinet minutes under the terms of the 30-years' rule and therefore I know what a mess Montagu Norman and his cohorts and supporters got us into in that era.<lb/>
I am not saying that the City of London does not perform excellent functions. I am sure that in facilitating and financing commercial transactions and in dealing in currency futures and a whole host of other banking functions the institutions of the City of London perform a perfectly good and respectable task. However, we seem to presume that what is good for the City of London, which includes banks, insurance companies and syndicates, trusts and other such institutions, must be good for the remainder of the country. I do not know where that idea came from, but it seems to be assumed that what is good for the City is good for the rest of Britain. However, one should try to tell the tenth of the population living at or below subsistence level that the banks are good for them and see whether they believe that.<lb/>
There is an identity of view between the banks, the other financial institutions and the Conservative Party itself. At Lord Mayors' banquets a polite welcome may be given to Labour Chancellors of the Exchequer and a coded language of reproof may be used in so far as it is consistent with politeness, but the parties have nothing in common with each other. The financial institutions and the City have nothing in common with the Labour movement as I knew it and as I know it today. Therefore the idea that bankers are the final repositories of wisdom in this matter is complete nonsense. Some 90 billion dollars a day travel across the exchanges in currency transactions. However, are those transactions beneficial to the country as a whole? They certainly benefit that section of the population that can be identified with the City of London.<lb/>
Your Lordships will probably have seen an article in <i>The Times</i> the other day that appeared on the day we entered the exchange rate mechanism. The article described a couple of foreign exchange dealers in their early twenties who arrived at their offices in the afternoon just as the announcement about the exchange rate mechanism was made. They took up their positions in front of their screens and watched the screens for a couple of hours without making any changes. They then walked off with &#x00A3;600,000. They gained that money simply by watching their screens. They said they were going to buy yachts and one or two other odd items and that they wanted to have a good time abroad. I do not begrudge them that, but anyone who suggests that that activity has anything to do with the production of valuable goods and services in this country ought to have his brain examined. It does nothing of the kind. Among other things it adds to the money supply and to inflation.<lb/>
Let us not hear talk of bankers being mystically capable by virtue of their profession&#x2014;noble Lords should note that it is not by virtue of their honesty or their integrity&#x2014;of maintaining the financial balance in this country. However, if one reads bank reports published over the past few years one discovers that
<col>846</col>
debts have been incurred in developing countries. The banks have had to write off a lot of the money deposited with them after the OPEC explosion which they subsequently lent to other countries. Nevertheless the assumptions that I have mentioned have been made.<lb/>
Those remarks bring me to the exchange rate mechanism itself, which we have now joined. It is reckoned to be the precursor to economic and monetary union. In 1986 our trade with other countries was roughly in balance. There was a slight deficit but nothing very significant. Since that time the balance of payments deficit has soared. We are told that the responsibility for that lies with ordinary working people who have been demanding too much in wages, and other such nonsense, whereas it has been due to the appreciation and progressive overvaluation of the rate of exchange. Since the second and third quarters of 1986 the pound has become overvalued by some 20 per cent. against the deutschmark, 25 per cent. against the yen and 50 per cent. against the US dollar. That has not been due to any action taken by ordinary working people in this country. It has been due to the activities of the experts on whom we are now supposed to rely.<lb/>
Much has been said this afternoon about the necessity for convergence. The use of the term varies; some have referred to convergence in inflation rates, others have referred to convergence without any qualification and the rest have talked of economic convergence. To my mind economic convergence means that, broadly speaking, ordinary people, who have not taken part in the discussions and who probably would not understand the somewhat complex and technical language of the report, can have a reasonable standard of life without the risk of permanent unemployment hanging over their heads. There has to be a gradual narrowing of the gap between the rich and the poor. There has to be a growing convergence socially and in ordinary economic terms.<lb/>
We have had some 10 years of this Government. Far from there being more convergence, we have not even achieved convergence or anything approaching it in this country. So it is in Europe. I was for some time president of the regional affairs committee of the European Parliament as well as being a member of its budget committee and economic and monetary affairs committee. The poorer regions of the Community have become poorer and the richer regions have become richer. That is still happening.<lb/>
What does a single currency mean? It means that we have a fixed rate of exchange. No matter what happens within the country, no matter what misfortunes, no matter how its occupations vary and its economics change, one is tied to that rate of exchange. So it is with the ERM. All that has really been done is that we have kidded ourselves that in fixing the barometer we have also fixed the weather. That is nonsense.<lb/>
We ought to look at the whole matter afresh, casting aside our occupations, our connections, our social positions, our personal wealth, our personal
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0463"/>
<col>847</col>
associations and everything else. We ought to think in terms of the people of this country and what we want for them. There is nothing that I would wish more than that there should be co-operation between all the nations of Europe, as independent states with their own cultures and customs. I am all for anything that can expedite that. I should like to see free trade between them. However, I fear that we may be going astray because we have ignored the end of the Cold War.<lb/>
The Cold War has changed the whole face of the world. As a country, instead of withdrawing into fortress Europe, with all the agriculture rackets to which I have referred and fraud on a massive scale, we ought to be looking to the wider world. We ought to make it possible to co-operate freely with all the countries that are prepared to accept the social market to which I have referred on previous occasions and, above all, with our own Commonwealth.<lb/>
I am distressed by the fact that at the time when we joined the EC&#x2014;and I do not wish to turn that clock back&#x2014;we seemed to adopt a defensive posture as if there was nowhere else for us to go. There was no positive dynamism about our action. It was as if it was a hopeless step and there was nothing else for us to do. At the same time we ditched the Commonwealth. I bitterly resent that. Many of us know well what happened, for example, to New Zealand. New Zealand lost 10,000 of her men who came over to this country of their own accord to fight against an undesirable form of Mittel Europe. They paid with their lives. Yet when it came to joining the EC we entered into arrangements which have now culminated in New Zealand being denied one of the most important outlets for her survival, the export of her sheep. Those exports have now been reduced to one-tenth of their original level and the country now faces distress.<lb/>
I do not wish to be jingoistic, but it seems to me that there is something wrong here. We ought to take a wider vision of the world, not for the sake of the world as a whole, although we live within it, but for the sake of our own people, with whom there should be considerable ties. We are a great people. We have contributed much to the culture and law-giving of the world. We should not, by default, cast that away in favour of a regime imposed by a bureaucracy in Brussels.</membercontribution></p>

I worked with Montagu Norman for many years and was his last private secretary at the bank. He was by no means the ogre the noble Lord portrayed. Philip Snowden, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, was one of his dear friends. Philip Snowden left to the bank the casket in which he received the freedom of the City of London. If the noble Lord cares to read the book written by Andrew Boyle, who never knew Montagu Norman, he will get a much better picture of what he was really like.</membercontribution></p>

I would not wish to impugn his integrity in any way. All say is that his judgment, like that of Philip Snowden, was not the last word in logic, reason or correctness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04201">8.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04202"><member>Lord Bridges</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like other members of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee presided over by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, I should like to say how much the committee owes to his guidance and leadership. The document we have before us bears the stamp of his leadership. As others have said, it owes much to our excellent clerk.<lb/>
It is my hope that the document will lead to something that I believe we need at this point, namely a more informed debate in the nation at large about the issues which are presented by the two intergovernmental conferences. I have been greatly dismayed in the past six months to observe the manner in which these important issues, which concern so much of the future of our country, have been the subject of judgments that are sometimes instinctive and sometimes prejudiced. They are very rarely based upon an informed knowledge of these very large issues.<lb/>
It is not the least virtue of the report that it provides a collection of facts, gives a careful balance of opinion and suggests some judgments. I hope that it will serve not only your Lordships but the nation at large in the days to come.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be permitted one further observation on this. I do not believe that, confronted with decisions of such gravity, any other nation in Europe would have indulged in the superficial opinions that we have had cast before us in the past few months. They are difficult subjects but I believe that the citizens of this country deserve rather more guidance than they have received from some quarters in both the political world and the world of some newspapers.<lb/>
Unlike most other speakers in this debate who have concentrated on the issue of economic and monetary union, and unlike the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, who with his characteristic eloquence and vigour took us down byways some distance away from the theme of the debate, I should like to speak of one aspect of political union that is the subject of one of the two intergovernmental conferences; namely, the activity known as European political co-operation. I agree with the committee's opinion on this subject which is stated on pages 56 and 57 of the report. However, there are some matters that merit a little further examination.<lb/>
My starting point is agreement with the committee's view that in general at these conferences we should look for evolutionary rather than revolutionary change. That applies to the future of European political co-operation. Above all, we should aim to ensure that any changes to the treaty which may emerge in the next year or two should accommodate the future needs of the Community. I am confident that that is the right approach. I suggest that we might
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0464"/>
<col>849</col>
do well to encourage some expansion of the subjects at present covered in European political co-operation so as to permit discussion by member states of the topic which I would define broadly as political security; that is to say, the boundary between foreign affairs and defence.<lb/>
I should make it clear that I do not seek to transfer additional formal competence to the European Community. I do not propose that the Community should act together in this field, but I suggest that we need to discuss some of the issues in that way. Perhaps I may give the House some reasons for these opinions. The profound and very welcome changes which have taken place in Europe over the past year or so will make it more necessary than ever that the nations of Europe, both East and West, take collective decisions about the way in which we secure peace throughout the European Continent. Happily we are moving away from the confrontation of two armed alliances to a more relaxed situation. The treaty on conventional arms in Europe and the charter of the CSCE, which was signed in Paris this week, mark a watershed in European political affairs. We can now expect an accelerated decline in the number of armed forces in Europe and their equipment.<lb/>
However, the situation is still extremely uncertain. New tensions, long buried in some instances during the Stalinist ice age, are beginning to appear. Let me mention a few examples. The state of affairs in Yugoslavia illustrates how a new nationalism, which has been concealed from our view for perhaps a generation, now threatens the stability of the Yugoslav state. We shall have to find the right solutions to problems of that kind. Put another way, the era of ideological confrontation, which it seems has now just ended and which was accompanied by much tyranny and repression, from another point of view was an era of stability in international relations. The aspirations of new nationalism which are now emerging throughout Europe will produce different kinds of tension.<lb/>
Agreements for the future security of Europe will have to be reached on a pan-European basis. It will be very important for the nations of Western Europe which are members of the European Community to discuss such issues together and to prepare a common approach, using for the purpose the machinery of political co-operation. I believe that that will prove much the most effective way of defending our interests on questions involving the political future of Europe.<lb/>
I suggest that the intergovernmental conference on political union should be encouraged to consider some marginal expansion of the work done in political co-operation for that purpose. That should include the ability to cover broad issues involving matters of defence and security. It would not make sense to exclude those issues or to allow one or more member states to prevent the proper discussion of such vital questions on the grounds that the treaty does not extend so far.<lb/>
Another reason for reaching that conclusion is that none of the existing organisations is ideal for the
<col>850</col>
purpose which I described. It is true that the CSCE is now to be established on a more permanent basis, with its own offices and secretariat, which it has never had before. But with 34 signatories it is much too large and its membership much too disparate to be appropriate for the purpose. Some people would like to use the Euro-group in NATO. I personally have nothing against that notion but we need to understand the objections of some EC member states, either existing members or those who may join the Community in future years, who would be unwilling to take part in political discussions under the NATO umbrella. NATO will continue to play an essential role in European security issues as the vital hinge between Western Europe and the United States. But I do not think that that is an altogether appropriate place for the formulation of policy by the West European member states themselves.<lb/>
Recently the Italian Government suggested making greater use of the Western European Union as it has been used during the Gulf crisis to co-ordinate the movement of naval vessels on patrol in the Gulf. But I doubt whether WEU would be an appropriate organisation for the purposes that I described; nor do I believe that the Western European Union could in some way be subsumed within the European Community. We need to remember that the WEU treaty was the precursor of NATO and that the obligation on its members to come immediately to the aid of a member state which is the object of external aggression is in fact more binding than the terms of the NATO treaty itself. Also, in other respects the WEU treaty shows signs of its age. I do not believe that WEU would be useful. The transfer of WEU obligations to the Community would mean endowing the Community with formal and binding commitments in the area of defence, which seems to me and perhaps to most other people to be going further than we need or should go at this stage.<lb/>
For those reasons I feel that the committee is right to suggest, as it did in paragraph 176, that:
<quote>"it will be in the interests of the Member States to find a way of discussing relevant security issues in EPC meetings".</quote>
My plea is that we should recognise the profound change that is taking place in the nature of European political affairs. We should equip ourselves with the right piece of machinery for dealing with that situation. The states of Western Europe will need to take counsel together in the broadest possible way. That is how I see European political co-operation developing in the future and I hope that the intergovernmental conference will take the opportunity to acknowledge that need and to point the Community in the right direction.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04204"><member>Lord Selsdon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I stand before you in a slightly more pragmatic way as a trader. For almost all my working life I have been involved in trade and the financing of trade&#x2014;the financing of British trade in yen and of foreign trade in ecus. I have been dragged around the conferences in Europe discussing
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0465"/>
<col>851</col>
the "Europa" and the ecu, and working out new mechanisms. All in all I have come to the conclusion that the hard ecu is a good thing.<lb/>
Certain doubts have been expressed about the desirability of the hard ecu, or indeed the wet and whimpering ecu that sits in its basket. The noble Lord, Lord Roll, took us back 100 years and reminded us that other systems did not work in those days. However, out of deference and respect to the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, who has drilled me and so many in your Lordships' House over so long a time, I must return to the days of William of Wykeham. At the time when he founded Winchester he was a great proponent of currencies. At that time the <i>&#x00E9;cu de la couronne</i> was launched. It was a very solid, hard ecu. Indeed it was certainly harder than the ecu that was launched in 1339. travelled alongside other currencies and in substitution for them. In the 14th and 15th centuries came the noblest of all, the golden ecu of the sun&#x2014;<i>l'&#x00E9;cu d'or au soleil.</i> That too financed trade and, based upon a gold standard, travelled happily alongside various currencies and in substitution therefor.<lb/>
Six hundred years or more later we find ourselves in a position where, regrettably, finance and politics are seeking to usurp the first place of trade. It is as though the army and the air force tried to demolish the Royal Navy. Trade comes first and with it the financing of trade. Within the countries that now comprise the EC, or the Europe of the ecu, we have many disparities in trade. The United Kingdom is more dependent upon foreign trade than any of the other members. But if we move, as we would all like, towards a common currency, we are told that at some time in the distant future there will be a stage three. As my noble friend Lord Caithness said, the foreground and the background are painted, but the middle ground has yet to be taken.<lb/>
Thus those noble Lords who seem to reject or oppose an initiative taken by Government to fill in the middle ground in a perhaps more pragmatic way than Jacques Delors with his excellent report has managed to do need to think a little. The convergence, about which noble Lords have already spoken, is difficult to achieve when one has the existing membership divided logically, and regrettably, between the high inflation and the low inflation countries. To seek to bring those together too quickly will cause serious pain and unemployment among the high inflation countries. We shall see a division with perhaps on the one hand Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and maybe Ireland and on the other ourselves with Italy, Spain, Portugal and possibly other members who join.<lb/>
We must recognise too that it is not the Community of today which we are considering when thinking of the years ahead but a broader Community which will include many other countries with different currencies, different exchange rates and different trading patterns. To accommodate all those countries in plans today is difficult indeed. Inevitably there will have to be an intermediate stage. Stage two and stage three, may be
<col>852</col>
followed by stage four, stage five and stage six. They may continue for ever as we develop and finance follows trade.<lb/>
Our own trading pattern is not yet determined for the future. One has seen in a few short years that 50 per cent. of British exports have gone to the EC. We are told that by 1992 those exports will be home sales. The pattern becomes stronger as one recognises that the greatest trading <i>bloc</i> in the world at the moment is the current EC. What does it lack? It lacks a hard currency. We have been brought up to recognise the value of the gold standard, of Bretton Woods, and of various other attempts. Perhaps with some regret some of us are nervous about the movement towards a deutschmark standard and have fears about the ability or the desire of the Bundesbank to administer the economy of Europe. Thus, inevitably, we feel there should be some form of currency. The ecu, which is already translated into different languages and has been around for a while, is a logical one. To have a weak ecu is to admit weakness and demonstrates a rather wet attitude when it is perfectly possible to have a strong ecu which we may call the hard ecu.<lb/>
While the proposal of the Government is that the hard ecu should run alongside existing currencies, it is also in substitution for them, as is appropriate, so that gradually a transitional period can take place without the pain and suffering that would inevitably arise from the differing inflation rates. The danger is that if we move too quickly to stage three the pressure on the ERM within the 2&#x00BC; per cent. band will be so great that the system will break up and much that we have achieved today will be thrown away.<lb/>
I believe strongly in the hard ecu for another reason, one which the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, will appreciate. I went to the same school as the noble Lord, and the noble Lord, Lord Jay, although, unfortunately for me, at a different time. I was in the same house as the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, although also at a different time. A Wykehamical colleague, a banker for whom I have much regard, conceived the hard ecu. It was not just a government idea. It was thought out carefully by the banking system over a considerable period of time. Perhaps the Government used it as a stalking horse to demonstrate some political commitment towards Europe, as the noble Lord, Lord Carr, said. But it is not a bad idea and it has been quite well received in the economic and financial centres of the continent of Europe by our European partners.<lb/>
It is difficult for me to conceive of a stage where Europe does not have a hard currency. Indeed if we do not have that hard currency, our future difficulties will be very great indeed. In moving towards the third stage, we need a second stage. I believe that the hard ecu in the form proposed has a very real role to play. If the original ecu &#x2014;the golden ecu of the sun which was based upon the gold standard, and the gold standard itself that served us so well&#x2014;can be replaced today by a hard ecu, it will be no more than a return to a gold standard. It is hard, and it is the best. The ecu of the basket is wet and weak. I prefer the hard ecu.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04206"><member>Lord Benson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to speak to only two points in the report. First, perhaps I may draw the attention of the House to paragraphs 166 and 167. They repeat, as has been done many times in the past two years, the need to overhaul the resources and the objectives of the Court of Auditors in the Community. I do not propose to develop the point any further tonight because we shall debate it next week. However, I urge the Government to take note of the continued requests for action to be taken on those lines. I hope that they will be able to tell us something about it on Wednesday.<lb/>
My second point relates to wider issues. Every now and then a fever overtakes a country or a continent. There are numerous examples in history. Many influential people in Europe have been infected with the fever of European unity. I agree with the report that nothing will stop it and this country must and can play its full part.<lb/>
Let us see where the fever has taken us so far and where it is likely to lead us in the future. At present the Community comprises 12 member states representing 320 million people speaking nine languages. A form of government organisation has been set up in Brussels which bears little resemblance to representative democratic government. The operations of the Community and the 12 member states are riddled with fraud. For years past up to 70 per cent. of the Community budget has been spent in distorting the whole agricultural industry of Europe and, to some extent, of the world. Therefore, there are some defects in the foundations on which this great enterprise is built.<lb/>
Perhaps we may now look a little further into the future. Some influences in Europe believe that the Community should be contained within the 12 member states. However, the report makes it clear, and a great many people believe, that the fever will extend into wider fields. Indeed, negotiations are already taking place in those areas and they will continue and become faster.<lb/>
If within the next 25 years the Community is joined by the seven EFTA states and the six Eastern European countries we shall have a body comprising 25 member states, representing 450 million people and speaking 16 to 20 different languages. We shall be led into some form of monetary union and a single currency. Neither of those processes has yet been properly thought through. Political union will follow and some federal government will be set up in Brussels. We shall seek to govern by remote control the daily lives of up to 450 million people in an area stretching from Crete to John o' Groats and from Lisbon to Stockholm.<lb/>
At the same time, up to 25 bankers will be set up in another capital of Europe, probably 200 or 300 miles from Brussels. They will be charged with the task of maintaining single stable prices. The evidence given by the bankers was refreshingly frank. They made it clear that they wished to be autonomous. They desire security of tenure so that they cannot be dismissed
<col>854</col>
from office. They expressed great unwillingness ever to be infected or touched by the decisions of the political parliament sitting in Brussels. I hope that the House will forgive me if I stifle a gasp of incredulity at some of those proposals.<lb/>
But what will happen then? I suggest that the fever will abate and the relentless lessons of history will point the way ahead. I believe that this great edifice will crumble at the edges and eventually disintegrate. The reason for my belief is that whenever a community reaches a certain stage of sophistication it finds government by remote control repugnant. The whole trend of social development is in favour of devolution into smaller units whose communities can be masters of their own destinies.<lb/>
At the time of the First World War the British empire was a dominant factor in the world; it was then probably the dominant factor. It now lies in tatters. The Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French and Belgian empires have suffered the same fate and for the same reason. During the past 12 months we have watched the Soviet Union and its satellite countries disintegrating. In the 1950s, after a series of intergovernmental conferences, we sought to impose a federal government on a huge chunk of central Africa comprising many thousands of square miles and many millions of people. After a further series of intergovernmental conferences the whole structure collapsed within four or five years.<lb/>
We in this country should be particularly sensitive to this trend of history. During the 1920s the Republic of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom because it found remote control from London repugnant. We have only to look across the banks of the Tweed to find a clamour from Scotland for devolution. If that takes place, Wales will follow. We see that Quebec is seeking to distance itself from Canada. The Basques are trying to detach themselves from the Government of Spain.<lb/>
This fever of European unity is a virulent disease. I believe that it will be dispersed by the remedial forces of history. It is difficult to know when this will take place but I believe that it will be during the second half of the next century. I do not know whether the House of Lords will exist at that time. If it exists at all it will probably have a different structure from that now prevailing. But whatever the form of government that exists I suggest that it will have before it a Select Committee report written with the same clarity and conviction as this report explaining beyond peradventure that Europe must be unbundled. There is only one sadness: that no one in this Chamber will be alive to reap the harvest that we are now sowing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04208"><member>Lord Briginshawe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too associate myself with the congratulations offered to the noble Lord, Lord Aldington. The Government are in disarray over Europe. Each of the two main warring factions in the Conservative Party offer a so-called strategy for our relationship with our Community partners. Both plans, I am afraid, seeks to obscure the fact that this
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0467"/>
<col>855</col>
Government are irretrievably out of step with developments within the Community and both plans offer no credible path forward.<lb/>
I draw your Lordships' attention not only to the manifest flaws in the Conservative party's approaches but also to the more significant realities that we should recognise as we plan the basis of our European co-operation. Two smokescreens have been emerging. The first we may call the little England approach. Apparently, there is to be a two-track Europe with Britain left adrift to pursue an independent economic strategy which will guarantee our future prosperity. We are invited to take as read at least three fundamental misconceptions. There is as well a thinly veiled appeal to nationalism which is dangerously unpatriotic and which seeks to confuse important issues by equating superficial symbols of national identity with self-determination.<lb/>
I watched with some interest a news feature on a little village in central France. Its inhabitants were concerned, we were told, about their future prosperity in a more unified Europe. The name to be given to the currency used as one of the methods of engineering that prosperity did not, however, worry them. I suspect that the villagers of central England have the similar sense to separate things that matter from those that do not. The idea that calling a currency by another name acts to undermine our sovereignty is disingenuous. A pound that will buy only one apple where an ecu can buy two in some ill-thought-out twin-track exercise is no demonstration of national pre-eminence.<lb/>
Another limb of the little Englanders' approach is their reverential attitude to what they call free trade. There is, of course, no such thing as free trade, nor has there ever been. There are no perfect markets. At the risk of sounding too technical, what are commonly known as "transaction costs" always intervene. Moreover the historians who inform us that our prosperity in Victorian times was based on a <i>laissez-faire</i> trade philosophy are the same historians who neglect to mention that our imperial armies and navies saw to it that those who underpinned our ability to compete were forced to supply on terms favourable to us. Thankfully, we can no longer reduce our transaction costs in such a manner. Such was the cost of free trade then as it is now. Markets are always shaped and engineered. If soft loans have replaced strong navies the effect is still the same. The idea, therefore, that we can somehow compete internationally as an individual nation in a world of trading blocks is one that has truly had its day.<lb/>
The final misconception in this particular approach is that the Community should swiftly be enlarged to welcome Eastern European nations into membership. I am far from convinced that the idea is even put forward in good faith. Certainly no one with even an ounce of sense could seriously propose that nations like Poland or Hungary could be ready for the disciplines of membership in the next decade. Our own problems, nearly 18 years after joining the EC, are weakening this Government by the hour. Imagine then the instability that would be caused by hasty
<col>856</col>
invitations being sent out to Eastern Europe from Brussels. So transparently inept is such a proposal that when I say that the real purpose behind the plan is to apply a brake to developments taking place from within the existing membership, I am neither the first to make such a comment nor am I being controversial.<lb/>
Let us imagine, for a moment, that the little Englanders won the day. It is 1995 and Britain has opted for a twin-track approach. The relationship with the Community will have remained, constitutionally and economically, as it is now. However, our European partners will have, in the meantime, forged closer links, all converging on Brussels. A big Englander, let us say British Airways, has decided that it wishes to take a stake in a German airline. The success of that acquisition would revolve around the application of competition rules made in Brussels. In such a scenario, it is inevitable that there would at the very least be a comparative decline in our ability to influence any decision made. It is verging on dishonesty to pretend that our national interests could be protected. The weight of a committed, participating administration behind any such strategy on the part of one of our international players is absolutely essential.<lb/>
I turn to the second smokescreen emerging from the Conservative Party. Partially visible, there is the outline of the so-called hard ecu parallel. The idea has attracted little or no support in Europe and has gained barely minimal credibility. For a party that has championed itself as a scourge of bureaucracy, an idea that relies on a European monetary fund owned and run by all the central banks of the EC states and then gives the fund not one but two roles as a treasury authority and disciplinary authority is choice to say the least. It will not work and should be abandoned before it embarrasses us further.<lb/>
It is time to expose the fundamental weaknesses in the Conservative Party's attitude towards the EC. These are weaknesses that neither of the arguments I have spent time assessing can conceal.<lb/>
On the one hand, the Conservatives view the run-in period to monetary union far too narrow as a process of economic management. Monetary union is not only designed as a mechanism for stabilising currency differentials and making banking and trade transactions more efficient. Monetary union has a fully social context. Europe is a social as well as economic community. We harmonise both in order to create conditions for Europe to compete internationally as a trading block and also, just as important, to provide for better standards of living for all the inhabitants of the community. It is because the Conservatives refuse to recognise this that we fall further and further out of step.<lb/>
Europe has accepted that the socialist principles which are the engine of social democracy are those best suited to the needs of the present and the near future. Intervention by government in industry, whether at a national or supranational level is healthy. That is beyond dispute. Also beyond dispute of course is the notion that government should manage industry. Once a matter of historical necessity, it is an idea that has served its purpose.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0468"/>
<col>857</col>
Harmonisation then means two things. First, it demands that national economic apparatus are brought together on a European basis so that we can compete internationally. Secondly, it means that at the same time as we take steps to compete externally, we also take internal measures to ensure that those who help create this economic trading block are justly rewarded. They should expect to receive the same value attached to their work, whether they happen to live in southern Spain or northern Germany. If the price of an apple in Ipswich is to be the same as the price of an apple in Heidelburg, we should not expect the inhabitants of either to possess less purchasing power than the other.<lb/>
Some might seek to insert some rather complex economic irrelevancies into this equation. They ask what if apples cost more to sell or produce in Ipswich than in Heidelburg? The correct response to the assertion is that in the main these things will iron themselves out. For example, there may be more elderly persons living in Heidelburg. Ipswich would therefore return the subsidy that it effectively received in apples by contributing proportionately more to welfare provision. Of course, in such a context, the precise terms of monetary union are absolutely crucial.<lb/>
This leads to the other great weakness for which the Government are responsible. It is said that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The only way that we can ensure that monetary union benefits the ordinary British citizen as much as the ordinary German one is to justify our right to equality by competing as an industrial nation. I spoke last week on our pressing need for investment in education to create an infrastructure which will supply us with the raw materials of future competitivity. Indeed, investment is an urgent necessity not just in the medium term for education, but in the shorter term for industry. The failure of the Government to build a competitive economy is the real reason why they are frightened of deepening our relationship within the EC. Monetary union exposes the Conservative Government for what they have failed to do.<lb/>
I hope that I have added to the debate on this subject. I conclude with three brief points. Monetary union is not to be feared. Monetary union can only happen when there is in place a radical investment strategy that has begun to bear fruit. This is likely to be in five to six years' time rather than in two or three. Social harmonisation should proceed as an integral part of the process of monetary union.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04210"><member>Lord Thurlow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, is not present I shall not add to the chorus of congratulations in which I should otherwise have participated. His work was extraordinary. However, I should like to join in the many tributes paid to our remarkable clerk, whose drafting&#x2014;I know a little about drafting&#x2014;has been very fine indeed.<lb/>
I endorse all the recommendations of the report. I hesitate to bring the hard ecu section into the debate
<col>858</col>
because it is above my head. I am prepared to accept the view of my colleagues. I should like to refer briefly to the main topic of the hour; that is to say, the single European currency. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, that this issue is a dangerous distraction. The noble Lord, Lord Butterworth, referred to the issue as dangerous and as if it were a commitment. However, in our report we referred to it as a goal. A goal is quite different from a commitment.<lb/>
The notion that monetary sovereignty is bound up with a national currency is, as I am sure most noble Lords will agree, an illusion. The pound sterling has long ceased to be a currency of sufficient international weight on its own. Twenty-five years ago I had the rather tiresome experience of leading a financial delegation to Australia to ask on our bended knees for Australian support for the arrangements to be made under the Basle agreement. In order to demonstrate to us how weak the pound sterling and London had become, we were kept hanging around for weeks as the Australians deliberately refused to make up their minds until the highest monetary authority in this country went out secretly to Australia in dark glasses. I believe that secret mission has never been disclosed.<lb/>
I should like to refer briefly to the European Parliament. The noble Baroness, Lady Elles, is present so I do so with diffidence. In my view the European Parliament is bound to increase its influence over the years and become a more effective instrument of scrutiny, of supervising administration. It will probably be a very long span of years. I have no doubt that the logic of events will force the European Parliament into that increasing role and will force the other institutions of the Community to accept such an increasing role.<lb/>
The committee's recommendations in relation to the European Parliament are modest, but they are forceful. It is especially important that the British Parliament should develop a warmer relationship with the European Parliament. At all costs, we must avoid sliding into a second tier as a second-class member effectively shut out from the inner councils of the Community that determine policy. That could be disastrous for our national economic and financial interests.<lb/>
We need to remain within the inner ring to establish a position of influence. We must show that we share the creative vision of our common goals, and that we wish to contribute constructively to the creation of the best framework for enterprise and innovation. Unless we are seen to be co-operating constructively in further improvement of the framework and institutions we shall effectively be relegated to a second tier and have little influence in matters that will be of great moment in determining our own interests. That could lead to a downward spiral for us. We already have ground to make up. There can be no illusions regarding the serious difficulties that confront this country. We have slipped relatively backwards in our competitive power and must build up.<lb/>
The conditions for effective progress were recently defined in striking terms in the new book by Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School on the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0469"/>
<col>859</col>
competitive advantage of nations, in which he puts all the emphasis in maintaining or regaining effective progress on to innovation and enterprise. We made strides in those directions in the past 10 years, but there is a long way to go. We can best advance our interests and gain the acceptance of the basic principles that we regard as sound by co-operation in the top European league. If we slide into a second tier the framework within which we are locked will increasingly be changed to our disadvantage and developed in directions that could prejudice our future.<lb/>
We must co-operate. But our co-operation must be aimed at making the European Community and its institutions more efficient and more accountable. We must be vigilant in insisting that nothing should be done centrally that can be done as well or better nationally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04211">8.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04212"><member>Baroness Elles</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with others in your Lordships' House I congratulate the chairman of the committee which produced the report before the House. I also congratulate the clerk and the special advisers. The report, however, deserves more than that. We owe a great debt of gratitude to my noble friend Lord Aldington and the clerk, William Sleath, as well as to the special advisers, who produced a report which is a monument to clarity and breadth of vision. That is supported by the fact that so many distinguished witnesses came before the committee, including the Foreign Secretary. It is a sign of the importance of the subject matter both for the United Kingdom and for Europe as a whole.<lb/>
The report should be studied not only with regard to its recommendations, all of which I warmly support, but also against the background of the current political situation inside and outside the Community. This week we have seen a gathering of 34 nations and from their backgrounds over the past 15 years one realises that radical changes have taken place in many of them since the signing of the original Helsinki Final Act in 1975.<lb/>
I take this opportunity of paying a deep tribute to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. These radical changes, both in the Soviet Union and Eastern European states have been largely due to her own perception, persistence and determination to bring about change in oppressed nations. It is also true to say that in Paris on Tuesday a charter was signed, to which the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, referred. It has been hailed as heralding "a new era of peace and unity".<lb/>
However, we have become sceptical of such treaties and it may well end up as so many treaties in the history of Europe have done unless it is bolstered, strengthened and cemented. A lesson can be learnt from the Treaty of Rome., which has relied for the past 40 years on economic and social progress, practical measures and closer economic and political cooperation based&#x2014;I insist on this&#x2014;on perceived national interests. No member state has given way on its own national interests in order to arrive at a
<col>860</col>
common position. It is also based, of course, on a strong security policy in an alliance with the United States and Canada within the framework of NATO.<lb/>
If the Paris charter is to endure, the above conditions must apply gradually to the whole of Europe. Just as it is now unimaginable for the Twelve ever to go to war with each other again&#x2014;I cannot understand how the noble Lord, Lord Benson, who is not in his place, can refer to that as a virulent disease when for the first time in European history there has been over 40 years of guaranteed peace between our nations&#x2014;so surely those are the principles that should guide the European Community along its way.<lb/>
If we are to contribute to political and economic progress throughout the whole of Europe, we must take measures which will consolidate the Community itself. The EFTA countries and the new democracies of Eastern Europe will not want to join just a free trade area. They practically have that already. They will want to be part of a system, as they have already declared, taking part in decision-making as Greece, Spain and Portugal wanted after their experience of totalitarian regimes. They will want a system which will retain their national pride, based on economic advantage and, above all, the guarantee of a democratic political system. Therefore, if the vision of Europe stretches from the Atlantic to the Urals&#x2014;a vision of the future of Europe which I believe is shared by many people of all persuasions&#x2014;it is essential for us to build successfully on a stronger, more effective and more efficient Community.<lb/>
The second point which I should like to stress before referring to one or two aspects of the report itself relates to Britain's role in shaping the Community. It is not soft words which protect Britain's interests. People in this country do not always seem to be aware of the admiration and respect in which our Prime Minister is held throughout not only the member states of the Community but practically everywhere else in the world. She is by far the best known and best respected of all European politicians. That is precisely because she has always stood up for the interests of Britain and has always eventually reached agreement with other member states. It is well known in the corridors of power in Brussels that many people have hidden behind the skirt of Mrs. Thatcher in order to conceal their own disagreement which, eventually of course, emerges. All those who, over the years, have teen involved, whether at high or low level, in the formation and adoption of European Community law will know that those who are the furthest away from the objective at the outset win the most battles. They give attention to detail in the knowledge that the results will be applied in national law. It is well known&#x2014;one or two noble Lords have already referred to this fact&#x2014;that those who speak loudest with the rhetoric of Europe are the worst at applying and implementing law in their own national systems. Many others who fail at the last minute, despite clamouring for European sovereignty and the giving up their own national sovereignty, are the most resistant to agreement when it comes to the crunch. I can give several examples and I know that
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0470"/>
<col>861</col>
my noble friend Lord Plumb is well aware of matters such as insurance, aspects of energy policy, television directives and many other issues where Britain has led the way and reached a satisfactory conclusion. In many cases it has been thanks to Britain that agreement has been reached.<lb/>
As leaders of the proponents of a single European market, we should surely not think it illogical to foresee that at some stage one will arrive at a single European currency, whether by achieving fixed exchange rates or by the process, or modification of the process, proposed by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;the hard ecu. Many noble Lords have spoken with great experience and wisdom on that matter.<lb/>
It may be of interest if I point out the results of a recent public poll taken throughout member states on how many people would want a single currency. Surprisingly enough, in the United Kingdom 37 per cent. are already in favour of a single European currency and 58 per cent. in favour of a central bank. The figures for other countries varied. In Germany and Luxembourg, for example, the figure was over 70 per cent. but in Denmark it was 31 per cent. Considering the lack of interest and discussion in the press on these matters it is surprising to see such a high figure for the United Kingdom. Incidentally, the lowest concern to the British people was loss of sovereignty. However, there must be clear conditions if we go down that road.<lb/>
In practice, the question of imposing a single currency simply does not arise. There has been no amendment to any of the treaties that have been concluded without it first being debated and voted upon in both Houses of our national Parliament. We need only think back to the long debates, amendments and discussions we had on the provisions of the Single European Act before that was adopted. Firm criteria must be established in regard to the policies and powers of any central control system. As we know, and as we have been informed again this evening, central bankers have already met and are drawing up draft statutes for such a central bank. Therefore, there is nothing secret about that. The details are available and can be studied and discussed.<lb/>
Criteria must be laid down with particular regard to the state of the economy. Many noble Lords have discussed the convergence of the economy, the difference in interest rates and rates of inflation. I shall not labour those points. It is quite clear that some conditions must be laid down before one can advance to a single currency. I agree with many noble Lords who have said that it is idle to fix a date now. In the history of the Community many dates have been fixed for transitional periods. So far, the one characteristic has been that, as far as I can remember, none of the dates has been honoured. The only date which I hope will be honoured is the end of 1992, fixed by my noble friend Lord Cockfield for the creation of the single European market.<lb/>
If we contemplate a wider Europe, the thought of having six or seven new currencies from EFTA and at
<col>862</col>
least three or four from Eastern Europe is enough to convince one that over 20 currencies operating in a single market would be a nightmare. Perhaps it is too sensible and reasonable to be a reality for the world in which we live, but it would be far simpler to have one single currency; for instance, the ecu.<lb/>
The economic strength of the existing Community is already diluted in relation to the dollar and the yen. Yet for some time we have been the world's largest trading bloc whether in commodities or services. Therefore, why should world trade, including the price of oil, be dominated by the dollar? It will no longer be dominated by the pound, the French franc, the Italian lira or even perhaps by the deutschmark, although there is every chance of it being dominated by the ecu which would raise the standard of Europe in terms of world trade and the economy. If we are to contemplate a wider Europe the present institutional structures are clearly inadequate. They must be made more efficient and effective and subject to greater scrutiny and public accountability.<lb/>
I shall confine my closing remarks to one or two points concerning the European Parliament which the noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, mentioned. I also wish to comment on a remark made by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, who referred to the powers of the parliament concerning the expenditure of the Community budget. The fact is that contributions to the budget are laid down by treaty. The parliament has no power to increase that amount except by a margin agreed with the Council of Ministers. It can only amend about one-third of the whole of that budget which is known as the non-obligatory sector. The total budget amounts to about &#x00A3;36 billion which is approximately the amount that United Kingdom local authorities spend in one year. Therefore, I do not believe that anyone can accuse the European Parliament of having vast powers over the expenditure of the Community.<lb/>
It must be clear that the competence and the facility to scrutinise the ever-increasing discretionary powers of the Commission are essential. For example, concerning external treaty making, the adoption of secondary legislation or anti-dumping procedures, there is in many instances no public scrutiny. That is clearly unacceptable. As more matters are dealt with at European level, it must be quite clear that in proportion democratic control must be increased.<lb/>
It is also necessary to scrutinise more effectively Community expenditure which is largely carried out by the Commission. Here the budgetary control committee of the parliament needs strengthening and reinforcing. It requires a larger staff. It must also have a more responsible role in amending draft legislation. After all, it is the only elected body representing the views of the people of Europe. About 50 per cent. of the amendments tabled and voted on by the European Parliament are already adopted by the Council. There are still many aspects where the views of the parliament are not sufficiently taken into account.<lb/>
The opportunity must also be given for MEPs to work more efficiently and to be sited in Brussels near the Commission and the Council, preserving Strasbourg as a meeting place for political debates and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0471"/>
<col>863</col>
ceremonial occasions. It has already been mentioned but I think the point should be reinforced, strengthened and repeated. As decisions are increasingly being made at European level, national parliaments must be involved in the debates before the decisions are taken. It is up to the national parliaments.<lb/>
I plead with another place that it should look with more favour on MEPs and be prepared to work with them. They are representing the same electors and we have the same interests. Members serving in the European Parliament are representatives of the people of Britain as indeed are the Members of another place. It would be infinitely better for our country if both sets of parliamentarians were to meet, possibly within the ambit of select committees on the relevant subjects for which they are respectively responsible.<lb/>
I thank again my noble friend Lord Aldington for a report containing a great many recommendations which I fervently hope the Government will take to the IGC meetings and draw upon for inspiration and guidance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04213">9 14 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04214"><member>Lord Seebohm</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, will forgive me, I shall keep my compliments short in view of the lateness of the hour. Nevertheless they are very sincere. It must be over 20 years ago, when I was employed in the international money business, that I and my colleagues came to the conclusion that a common market did not make any sense without a common currency. We were very relieved when, a few years later, Great Britain joined the Common Market and was committed to monetary and economic union. The problem then, as now, was how and when to achieve it.<lb/>
The economic gains are obvious, although opponents of the idea say that transaction savings will be minimal. Nevertheless, the savings from a common currency, from the point of view of trading within the Community, will be absolutely enormous. There is no doubt whatever that the stimulus to trade when all prices and transactions can be quoted in the same currency will be quite amazing.<lb/>
There is enthusiasm for this from all those concerned with wealth creation, and I was surprised that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said there was no general enthusiasm for a common currency. In the world that I live in, I find that there is enormous enthusiasm for it. I do not know when it will come, but I think we all agree that it must be the ultimate goal.<lb/>
Those who object seem to do so solely on the grounds of loss of power, which they cloak under the more impressive word, "sovereignty". Nothing that has happened in the last three decades has convinced me that the power-seekers&#x2014;that is, the politicians&#x2014;have shown that they are capable of managing a money economy. I go further and say that they are not fit to manage the economy, and want to cling on to it in order to continue to mismanage it, by which I mean having the power to devalue and to inflate as they have regularly done in the past.<lb/>
<col>864</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Jay, was emphatic on this point. I do not think I need to follow his arguments at length, but he seemed to assume that, unless one can devalue and inflate regularly, there will be unemployment and a stagnating economy. That appears to me to be absolutely absurd. The conclusions that I draw from all this are that the sooner we return money management to the central bankers and take it away from politicians the better, and that a European central bank system will be of enormous value to the Community, including this country.<lb/>
There is an extraordinary feeling entertained by the Prime Minister about the sanctity of sterling. This question has already been dealt with by the noble Lords, Lord Thurlow and Lord Cobbold. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, submitted a very interesting memorandum, which appears right at the end of the volume on evidence. It is well worth reading.<lb/>
So far as coins are concerned we need not bother at all, because they do not enter into the international exchange, except at the level of tourism. So I do not think that coins need to have the EMU value on one side and the pound on the other. We can retain them more or less as they are now. But, having said that, I am in full agreement with the recommendation that one must wait till stage one is successful. Our entry into the ERM is still experimental and no one knows at this stage whether Great Britain has entered at the right rate. France took three or four years to settle down and, certainly, we shall not be secure until inflation is down to, say, 3 or 4 per cent.<lb/>
So, having stated my case for a single currency and a European central bank system, I agree that the method of getting there and the timing is still an open question. But various choices are appearing. The hard ecu might work as a temporary measure, though there are a lot of objections to it. But I rather favour following Sir Michael Butler's suggestion of pursuing the ERM route gradually, hoping that the margins will be reduced to a point where a move to a single currency will be almost an overnight matter.<lb/>
While I doubt whether it is wise for a date to be fixed now, I am a great believer in fixing date targets as soon as appears practicable; otherwise, nothing is likely to happen. After all, it was not until after&#x2014;thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield&#x2014;a deadline of 1992 was fixed for economic union that things really began to happen.<lb/>
I turn now to the question of sovereignty. By joining the ERM, we have already given away about 50 per cent. of our power of manoeuvre. Of course the rate is adjustable in theory, but that would be contrary to the undertakings at entry. If we move to the hard ecu, we shall have surrendered the balance of our so-called sovereignty.<lb/>
There is one other aspect of the single currency which has received little attention. I refer to the fact that the balance of payments disappears as an exchange rate problem. As Sam Brittan put it, the balance of payments between Sussex and Normandy would be the same as between Sussex and Yorkshire.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0472"/>
<col>865</col>
Similarly, the balance of payments with countries outside the Community would then be the responsibility of the Community as a whole.<lb/>
Finally, I should just like to mention the political union. Here I am 100 per cent. in agreement with the Bruges Group and trust that the principle of subsidiarity will be rigidly observed and that Community regulations are confined solely to those matters which are patently better carried out by the Community than by member states in co-operation.<lb/>
I was most interested to hear the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Benson. However, I sincerely hope that he is wrong. We are living in the twentieth century and not the twenty-first century. We must proceed as best we can with what we are doing. If the Bruges Group policy, as I call it, is followed, perhaps bureaucracy at the centre will not in fact prove to be too much of a menace. These days, contrary to the experience in, say, central Africa, the advances we have made in information technology, in satellite television and in travel make the situation completely different as regards harmonising the Twelve. In conclusion, I should like to say how strongly I support the report. It is a splendid job of work.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04215">9.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04216"><member>Lord Geddes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been a great honour to be a member of the ad hoc sub-committee under the esteemed chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Aldington. He steered us, and extracted information from witnesses, with the same supreme skills and finesse with which he opened the debate this afternoon. We all owe him a great debt of gratitude, as indeed we owe our clerk, William Sleath, and our advisers.<lb/>
So much of the discussion about EMU has in the past focused upon the negative aspects: what will happen if Britain does not participate? What about loss of sovereignty? Why should we abandon sterling? Instead, I urge concentration upon the positive benefits of EMU. I suggest that the objections raised are no more than political sensibilities which as we know&#x2014;it is to be hoped&#x2014;from our reading of Jane Austen should not be allowed to overrule political good sense.<lb/>
What can be said of such political sensibilities? There has been, and I am sure there will continue to be, much use of such phrases as, "loss of monetary sovereignty" and, "loss of unilateral control over economic policy". I am convinced&#x2014;I believe that the report supports this conviction&#x2014;that the use of such phrases in that context is at best misleading and at worst a distortion of reality.<lb/>
My right honourable friend Mr. Tebbit put a somewhat rhetorical question in another place on 14th November. In an interjection to Mr. John Smith of the Opposition he asked whether there were circumstances in which he would be willing to give up Britain's unilateral control of its own economic policy. In the context of EMU, sovereignty or unilateral control&#x2014;call it what you will&#x2014;was lost long ago if indeed it ever existed.<lb/>
<col>866</col>
The report considers that point at considerable length. The evidence given by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, on the subject was particularly significant. He said that the House of Commons was deluding itself if it thought that it had control over monetary policy. It did not in his day &#x2014;by which he meant when he was Chancellor&#x2014;and he did not think it had in anyone else's day. He continued by pointing out that monetary policy, interest rate policy and exchange rate policy were the supreme field in which one could cling on to the shadow of sovereignty although the substance had flown out of one's grasp some time previously.<lb/>
As the report points out and as has been mentioned by several noble Lords today, the word "sovereignty" can be used in several senses. The report offers three definitions. We must not allow the emotional overtones which it necessarily raises to cloud our judgment or to lead us to believe that which is not the case. The sense in which the word is correctly applied to EMU is defined by the report to be political rather than legal; that is, the extent to which a state has the power of effective or unfettered action. In that sense&#x2014;here I warmly support my noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley&#x2014;sovereignty can be, and has been, pooled in many areas as diverse as limiting fishing rights and the constraints imposed by the ERM.<lb/>
To make any sense at all, surely European economic and monetary union must inevitably result in a single currency. The sooner the Government come off the fence and make that statement the better. My noble friends Lord Caithness and Lord Selsdon understandably favoured the case of the hard ecu in itself. My noble friend Lord Butterworth somewhat less understandably took the same view. I say "somewhat less understandably" because he was a member of the committee who was at sharp variance with the committee's findings.<lb/>
I hope not to delay the House too long, but in that context paragraph 78 of the report states:
<quote>"But suspicions will persist for as long as the United Kingdom resists acceptance of a single currency as the goal&#x2026; Moreover, the Committee consider that the hard ecu would have little chance of wide acceptance unless it were seen as the forerunner to a single Community currency. If the Government accepted this goal, it would then be able to champion the hard ecu as the best way to prepare for the ultimate introduction of a single currency".</quote>
The so-called abandonment of sterling is yet another emotional rather than substantive issue. The report makes the proposal, which I wholeheartedly endorse, that in the fullness of time national currencies should be redenominated into round numbers which could then be printed on one side of a banknote or coin, with the single currency denominated on the other. In that way the pound could and would be retained. However, progress towards a single currency must and should be via long and meticulously detailed planning. United Kingdom decimalisation was given such planning and it was brought in with remarkably little fuss, bother or distortion. The same can be achieved for a single currency.<lb/>
The general objections raised are of form and not of substance. Much of the apparent reluctance felt by the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0473"/>
<col>867</col>
people of this country to commit themselves to Europe is, I am convinced, attributable to a woeful lack of knowledge and the bad press consistently given to the EC, not least by the Government themselves.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Elles mentioned the results of a survey carried out throughout the 12 EC countries. She mentioned the statistics. Across the board, 61 per cent. of all people questioned were in favour of a single currency, whereas in the United Kingdom the figure was 37 per cent. only and that for Denmark was 31 per cent. My noble friend drew a slightly different conclusion from the one I drew. I suggest that we should ask ourselves why the people of this country have such divergent views from those of all our European neighbours except Denmark. I submit that the reason is largely to be found in our political attempts to camouflage the real arguments with the emotional rhetoric of national pride and sovereignty, to which I have already referred. Much more needs to be done to improve public awareness and understanding and to remove the old prejudices which are proving so harmful and damaging to our industrial progress.<lb/>
The Government have a responsibility&#x2014;I was tempted to say a duty&#x2014;to change both their real and perceived stance on Europe. Again, I quote from paragraph 188 of the report:
<quote>"This Committee has consistently argued that the best way to maximise the influence of the United Kingdom is to show by word and deed that Britain in no way dissents from the Community's agreed objectives".</quote>
Cricketing analogies are much in vogue at the moment. If I may presume to follow the fashion, I suggest to your Lordships that if we wish to score runs it is quite important to be on the batting side.<lb/>
The Eurocrats themselves are by no means blameless in the context of public awareness. There needs to be more obvious control and accountability. Here I mention just two institutions, the European Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors, already often mentioned today, and the extreme importance of giving them the ability, both in financial terms and in terms of personnel, to do their job so that justice can not only be done but be seen to be done.<lb/>
Much has already been said on political union. I shall therefore restrict myself to one specific which has only received an airing today from my noble friend Lady Elks. I endorse the necessity for deciding on one location for the European Parliament. The report found that the parliament is heavily handicapped by the requirement to travel between Brussels and Strasbourg, with many of the staff living in Luxembourg. Inevitably, as my noble friend said, this adversely affects efficiency, quite apart from involving additional and unnecessary expense. It would undoubtedly be sensible if all legislative proceedings were concentrated in Brussels, thus granting MEPs the opportunity of taking a greater part in scrutinising the other Community institutions.<lb/>
The time has arrived when a positive approach to Europe in general and EMU in particular must be adopted as a matter of urgency. The committee concluded that the United Kingdom could only
<col>868</col>
remain outside a monetary union at substantial economic cost. Failure to be at the forefront of the negotiations will almost inevitably mean that London will lose the chance of being the operational centre of a European central bank, with all its attendant benefits.<lb/>
I sincerely believe that we have exhausted our European partners' patience and indulgence. We must seize the opportunity of the intergovernmental conferences to put that right. The present difficulties being experienced by the Conservative Party, of which I am proud to be a member, came to a head specifically on the subject of the EC. The credibility of this country with our European partners was clearly strained after the Rome meeting in late October.<lb/>
We have had, and I think have taken, a golden opportunity today to show that this House at least&#x2014;with one or two noted exceptions&#x2014;supports both the theory and the practice of the EC as outlined in this report. Our 11 partners in the EC need us and we need them. Within a week, the Conservative Party will have a new leader and the country a new Prime Minister. The intergovernmental conferences are only three weeks away. May that Prime Minister send the right&#x2014;by which I mean positive&#x2014;signals to our partners in advance of 14th December and may he not only give the right impression but also take the lead during those conferences and thereafter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04218"><member>Lord Grantchester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to start by expressing my admiration for and appreciation of the noble Lord, Lord Aldington. I also admire the concise and clearly expressed report which he and his committee produced with the aid of their support staff. As I am speaking rather late in the debate, I should be most unpopular if I did more than make a few observations which I hope have not been expressed before.<lb/>
It is clear from the report that monetary union follows on from economic union as night follows day. The entire policy of economic union in Europe is based on the premise of a level playing field. That is an in-phrase which may or may not be in the report but which is bandied about before sub-committees week after week. However, it is no good considering economic union when the 12 member states can from time to time, by adjusting their interest rates and their monetary policies, alter the terms of trade for their own benefit.<lb/>
Monetary union is now before us and is presented in the report as a desirable measure in the interests of a combined trading Community. There is no difficulty in approving monetary union but problems arise when we consider how to attain it and, when we have attained it, what controls we shall place over the Community institutions involved. Those are the two crucial questions which are not really dealt with by the report except in relation to the hard ecu. However, that is only relevant to the establishment of the single currency and is not really part of the present debate, which concerns whether or not we want monetary union.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0474"/>
<col>869</col>
We are facing the conversion of 12 national currencies into one European currency. I do not believe that that is entirely the simple process that the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, suggested. We start with 12 currencies, some of which are more exchangeable than others, and each of which is subject to market forces and dealers' appreciation of the rise and fall and the background of the relevant national market economy in the immediate short term.<lb/>
The United Kingdom has oil and gas reserves and a large international exchange system in London. Other countries have other assets and liabilities such as national debts and international loans and liabilities. We shall need to devote a lot of thought to achieving one currency out of that tangle. As the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, said, at the end of the day we shall need an Act which authorises the exchange of our currency (against the background of the exchange of the other 11 currencies) into the Community currency. It is that factor which we should now concentrate on. It is only right and proper that the Government should emphasise to the business world and to the population generally that this is the stage that is now being embarked upon. The Government should emphasise that people will not simply find ecus in their pockets instead of pounds in, say, a week's time, but that a great deal of background work will now be required over a long period of time.<lb/>
On that point, mention has been made in the debate of the suggestion of a convergence of values. When mentioned in the report, that does not mean, as some noble Lords have suggested, the equalisation of wealth within the 12 member states, or if it does that should be made abundantly clear at this stage. I suspect that it means nothing of the sort. I believe that the phrase is being misused to frighten people off the idea.<lb/>
Having achieved the second stage, and in due course having overcome the problems of the establishment of the Community currency, we shall then have a level playing field. We shall have that because the central bank will exercise interest rate and monetary control in the interests of the Community as a whole and not, as now in this country, for the benefit of our community here. That is a significant difference in practice which will emerge. Exactly the same position applies to other powers which are now being transferred to Europe, such as merger control. The Commission should exercise its merger control operations in the interests of the Community as a whole.<lb/>
Those limitations mean that, if there is to be political control, that political control should be exercised by a democratic Community organisation and not by the national governments and elected authorities of the 12 member states. It has been suggested&#x2014;by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#x2014;that the governments of the 12 member states will exercise control over the central bank. I do not think that that is right. I believe that the control has to be exercised on an entirely different basis. That should be made clear.<lb/>
<col>870</col>
The one remaining point that I should like to make is that if we accept monetary control on the basis of the doctrine of the level playing field there will also be control over direct and indirect taxation throughout the Community, partly through the necessary market forces but probably by the means of further community directives. I know that that concept is not being bandied about at present, but if one establishes a level playing field and one has a single currency and there is also transferability of money and of labour, then the labour and the money will move to those places where the most profit is to be made. Therefore it is no good one member state thinking that it can exercise its taxation policies, for example, for the equalisation of wealth within its boundaries. That would immediately cause an outflow of capital and an outflow of labour. The Community would then step in and say that it wanted a level playing field and that taxation must be organised and laid down within bands.<lb/>
I hope that I have issued a note of warning that we are going down a path which is leading into future difficulties and other matters which are far more complex than are mentioned in this report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04220"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although I commend its diligence and congratulate the Select Committee on a well written report, nevertheless I cannot welcome it. In my view its recommendations compromise the remaining freedom and independence of the United Kingdom. Too much power has already been ceded to institutions outside this country and not under the control of the British people. Too many decisions are being taken which are not in British interests but in favour of countries whose interests are inimical to ours.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Geddes, might very well consider those words to be emotional rhetoric. He will hear some more in a moment. I was most concerned to hear him say that the patience of our European partners is exhausted. I felt a nasty, cold clamp over my heart when I heard that phrase because the last person whom I heard use it was Adolf Hitler before he launched his Blitzkrieg on Poland. I must tell the noble Lord that I do not care two hoots if the patience of our European partners is exhausted. It is right and proper for the Ministers of this Government&#x2014;of any British government&#x2014;and in particular the Prime Minister to stand up for British interests no matter how much that may exhaust the patience of our European partners. I hope that future Prime Ministers will do that in the same manner as the present Prime Minister, who has been so shamefully deposed today by the Tory Party.<lb/>
Having got that off my chest, I must say that so far membership of the EC has brought only high costs in economic terms and few, if any, benefits. In his speech my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington described how we have reaped very few benefits from the EC, and so far as one can see there have been no benefits at all. We have been told of the benefits of trade. The only way in which there is any benefit in trade is when one makes a profit. At the moment, and indeed for the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0475"/>
<col>871</col>
past 10 years at least, we have been making a loss. Therefore there has been no benefit of trade. Last year our loss was &#x00A3;15 billion; this year the loss will be about &#x00A3;14 billion. That is not a benefit. It is detrimental to this country. Therefore, my noble friend Lord Bruce was right to draw that fact to your Lordships' attention.<lb/>
In political terms our membership of the EC has done little to enhance Britain's influence abroad and in some ways has diminished it. Furthermore, as we are now experiencing, the EC issue is causing severe political stresses and strains at home, splitting asunder the Tory Party and threatening to cause it permanent damage. I do not care particularly about that but I am sure that noble Lords opposite feel that that is not a good thing. Nevertheless that issue has caused the damage at the present time.<lb/>
My party, the Labour Party, while enjoying for the moment the spectacle of the Conservative Party at war with itself, is no more united over the European issue than its opponents. When Labour attains office at the next election, the Euro-conspiracy will cause havoc in its ranks too, as the Euro-fanatics try to force a Labour Government along the path of destroying Britain as a nation state and creating instead a monster Western European super-state through federation or a unitary state, complete with an overbearing centralised government. That is some emotional rhetoric, is it not, my Lords? I hope that the House enjoyed it. There is more to come&#x0021;<lb/>
If the movement towards ending our nationhood emanated from the grassroots, from a demand by the people of this country for complete integration into a Euro-state, it might have some respectability. But it does not come from the grassroots. It does not come from the people in this country. The demand is from a select group of people in high places whose self-interest takes first place over the real interests of Britain and her people.<lb/>
It is not surprising that there is no groundswell of opinion in favour of the moves recommended by the Select Committee. Ordinary folk are confused about the issue. As we have seen in the debate today, many people are themselves confused. God help the British people; they cannot help but be confused under the circumstances. They hear conflicting evidence.<lb/>
Let us take the ERM. Before we entered the exchange rate mechanism, the British people were told that we must do so if interest rates were to fall and inflation to be reduced. Nobody told them before entry that the long-term consequences would be lower living standards and higher unemployment. Certainly the fact that the economic crisis was caused by our <i>de facto</i> membership of the ERM since 1985 through the shadowing of the deutschmark by the pound was hidden from them.<lb/>
Now that Britain is locked into ERM, it is being made clear every day to ordinary people that it is they&#x2014;not the bankers and others in the City who forced ERM upon us&#x2014;who must bear the adverse consequences and cost of ERM membership. The Chancellor in his broadcast a week ago last Sunday
<col>872</col>
made it absolutely clear that the British people will bear not only the cost of ERM but the cost of a single currency and EMU. Working people in Britain will be made to pay the price in both economic and political terms.<lb/>
We are now being told that if we do not proceed along the lines proposed by the Select Committee and others we shall be isolated in Europe. That really is rubbish. Other European countries cannot afford to isolate Britain. With a trade deficit of &#x00A3;15 billion they need us more than we need them. Let us make no mistake about that. However, perhaps a little more isolation from the EC might help us re-integrate with the remainder of the world. After all, 53 per cent. of our trade is still with the remainder of the world outside Europe. There is a big world outside the EC and we ought to remember that. This concentration on the EC is helping to lose us markets elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04221"><member>Lord Aldington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that really is rubbish, if I may say so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04222"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not rubbish. It is far too easy to say, "There is Europe, there is your little market. Concentrate on that. Don't worry about anyone else". The wide world consists of 5,000 million people, not 330 million people.<lb/>
We have heard of convergence. The report refers to convergence. Convergence is a wonderful thing. The word rolls off the tongue more easily than ERM or a single currency. But what is convergence? We have not attained it in this country yet. There is no proper convergence between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom or between Scotland and England. There is depopulation in those two countries because convergence has not been attained. How are we to attain this convergence? How much is there to be? What will it cost? At the present time we contribute about &#x00A3;2.2 billion to the EC. Are we to contribute a lot more? Some estimates have put our future contributions at much more than that. We need to know the answers to those questions.<lb/>
In the last analysis&#x2014;this must be fully understood and it matters not whether we are in the EC or out of it&#x2014;if this country is to be successful there are no panaceas. There is no panacea in the ERM and no panacea through the EMU or a single currency. If we are not to be depopulated and impoverished there is only one cure for our ills; it is to pull ourselves up by our own bootlaces. That means taking the actions necessary to do so and for a British Government to put our economy right. It can be done no other way and it is about time that we started to do it.<lb/>
What of the view of the people? As things stand they will not be asked for their opinions. They will not be allowed to decide the issue any more than they were allowed to before Britain was dragged into the EC in 1973 by Edward Heath. Instead, the vital decisions will be taken by a Parliament which so far has shown itself all too ready to cede its decision-making powers to institutions alien to our traditions and by methods which bypass any democratic process. But Parliament has forgotten that in the last analysis it is a mere trustee of the people's sovereignty and not the owner.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0476"/>
<col>873</col>
It is not Parliament's to give away. In this context it must be seen as an amazing paradox that, at the same time as the countries of Eastern Europe have demanded and obtained a return of their nationhood after 40 years and in the Soviet Union after an even longer period the constituent republics are demanding independence, our Parliament should be contemplating measures to undermine our nationhood and compromise our independence.<lb/>
One of the problems for the people of this country at present is that there is no political party articulating firmly and clearly its fears about and basic opposition to EMU and political union&#x2014;although the Labour Party has serious and important reservations. A cross-party consensus is developing among those opposed to the present direction and speed of European integration. It will increase as time goes on, but that may not prove to be enough. There is a danger&#x2014;people may laugh at the suggestion&#x2014;that a new political party might emerge, perhaps of the extreme Right or even of the extreme Left. It may be a British independence party or, as the Scots do not like the idea of a British independence party, perhaps for the first time ever an English National Party.<lb/>
I believe that such a development would be unfortunate and undesirable. But if those who, on the one hand, swear allegiance to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, continue, on the other hand, to undermine the integrity and independence of Her Majesty's realm to the extent that there may be nothing left for her or her heirs and successors to rule, it might be the only course left to save the country that we serve and love. The noble Lord, Lord Aldington, said "Good Lord&#x0021;", but I believe in what I have said and I hope that he listened carefully.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04223">10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04224"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon. No doubt I shall pick up one or two of his themes. I join other noble Lords in congratulating the members of the Select Committee on the hours of hard work which they obviously must have put in. The report is well written and well produced. Its conclusions are perhaps another matter.<lb/>
I do not wish to say too much about the EMU, given the time of evening and the technicalities of the subject. However, a second potential big lie must be smartly knocked on the head before it has chance to take root. The first big lie was that before the advent of the modern nation state the whole of Europe was a haven of peace, tranquillity, harmony and brotherly love and that only the formation of the EC after the war, to supersede the supposedly wicked nation state, has prevented a third world war. That is absolute nonsense. If I had an hour to spare, I should develop the theme in great depth.<lb/>
The second big lie is that it was Mrs. Thatcher's robust defence of British self-determination in the face of creeping federalism which led to her becoming electorally unpopular. That is the precise opposite of
<col>874</col>
the truth, nowhere more forcibly demonstrated than in a MORI poll published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on 18th November.<lb/>
The poll set out the political consequences of each of three options. If Mrs. Thatcher remained Prime Minister with, by implication, no change in policies, the Labour lead would be 9 per cent. If Mr. Heseltine replaced Mrs. Thatcher and initiated the major modifications of the poll tax which he had publicly promised, the Conservative lead would be 1 per cent. However, if the poll tax were to be abolished with, by implication, no change in the leadership, the Conservative lead would leap to 10 per cent.<lb/>
In other words, it is not suspicion of federalism and other forms of Eurofanaticism which made Mrs. Thatcher unpopular among the public at large; quite the reverse. It was the wretched poll tax. In other words, the continuation of Mrs. Thatcher in office, shorn of the poll tax incubus, would have given the Tories a lead in the polls 10 times greater than that resulting from Mr. Heseltine stepping into her shoes.<lb/>
Of course outright abolition of the poll tax is now difficult and perhaps impossible. If it could have been made swiftly less of a burden upon those earning less than the average wage, perhaps with the shortfall made up from higher taxation of those who have done so well out of the abolition of the domestic rate&#x2014;by limiting tax relief on mortgage interest to the standard rate of tax or something along those lines&#x2014;Mrs. Thatcher would almost certainly still have been in office in 1991.<lb/>
It is too late for all that now. However, the point I wish to make is that it is not Europe&#x2014;as it is usually misdescribed&#x2014;which has dished Mrs. Thatcher. Indeed, the opposite appears to have been the case: her attitude as regards that seems to have been popular. It is the poll tax or, at any rate, the unfair manner in which it impinged on the lower paid.<lb/>
As to the EMU, there are many conflicting views among the experts as to its precise economic benefits. The noble Lord, Lord Aldington, cited the Cecchini Report. That report envisaged a growth in GDP of between 5 and 7 per cent. as a result of EMU. If that forecast is correct, it may well be worth throwing caution and tradition to the winds. On the other hand, the Treasury is much less optimistic about the advantages of joining the EMU. If the growth in GDP were to be only of the order of 1 per cent., the consequential disadvantages of joining might well outweigh the advantages.<lb/>
There are respected economists and others who believe that the EMU would be positively disadvantageous, as currently envisaged. They include Sir James Goldsmith. The fact that Sir James got out of equities totally in August and September 1987 proves him to be a man of acute intelligence and uncanny foresight. I suggest that that demonstrates that EMU should be approached with extreme caution.<lb/>
I turn to political union. Perhaps I may first ask why unity is automatically assumed to be a self-evidently desirable objective. Unity has nothing to do with friendship or co-operation. I have a great
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0477"/>
<col>875</col>
many friends and I co-operate with a great many people. But I do not want them living in my house; still less do I want them to tell me what to do in my life.<lb/>
A dozen years or so ago a well-known journalist wrote in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> that post-war West Germany had about as much personality as an airport lounge. We face the danger that Western Europe as a whole may end up with about as much personality as an airport lounge. Diversity is surely more interesting than unity.<lb/>
Why is there the determination for unity at all costs? The answer clearly lies in history. In an excellent speech on this subject last week, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, pointed out that we were the only country in the EC to have something like the Battle of Britain Sunday about which to feel proud. Continental countries have either been occupied by foreign powers or have been dictatorships. As Sir Fred Catherwood pointed out in his evidence to the committee at page 187 of Volume II:
<quote>"For almost all [member states] the war was a failure and the Community has been a success. For Britain the war was a success and &#x2026; the Community has seemed a failure".</quote>
Moreover, fully half of the EC countries are 19th or 20th century creations&#x2014;Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, Greece and the Republic of Ireland. Many of the other countries have centuries of creative achievement to look back upon in the fields of science, engineering medicine and architecture as well as in painting, literature and music. However, they have a good deal less to be proud of in the realm of government; in other words, in the political sphere. For example, France must face the excesses of the French Revolution and the fact of widespread collaboration during World War II. The Danes, who were formerly sceptics like ourselves, are now scared stiff by the idea of a united Germany.<lb/>
I must therefore suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, missed the point when he remarked that it cannot be true that Britain is right and the other 11 wrong on all issues&#x2014;I hope I copied correctly what he said. Of course that cannot be true. In the main we are right from our perspective and the other 11 are right from their perspective, and rarely the twain shall meet. Their perspective is formed by geography as well as history. Their very location turns them inward and gives them perhaps a subconscious hankering for the recreation of the Holy Roman Empire. By reason of history as well as geography we are essentially Atlanticists, as are the Portuguese, and we will always remain Atlanticists to a considerable degree. It is difficult to exaggerate the hostility and suspicion of the Continent towards Japan, despite its relatively small population of 122 million people. There is a similar hostility towards the United States, with a population of 227 million, as well as to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and so on.<lb/>
I love France. I go there frequently and have a good many friends there. It is the place I should most like to live if for any reason I could not live in Britain. But it must be said that while they generally much regret the killing of the Portuguese photographer, the majority of the French fully support the action of their
<col>876</col>
government in sending their secret service to sink the "Rainbow Warrior". They greatly resent the fact that on that issue, as on many others, the British support the New Zealanders rather than the French. The French consider our attitude to be not <i>communautaire,</i> and that it brands us as bad Europeans.<lb/>
It must be faced that for most Continentals the EC is almost a religion. Any fundamental criticism of it is heresy and about as welcome as a bevy of carol singers in Saudi Arabia. That is why all talk of Britain being able to influence events by jumping on the train is fanciful in the extreme. We would not be able to apply the brakes singlehandedly or to jump off at a moment when the train is trundling along in order to alter the points and switch us on to a different track. I am not talking about the gravy train&#x2014;we are discussing one aspect of that next Wednesday and the other aspect is properly condemned in paragraph 146 of the report&#x2014;but about the semi-sacred mystery train setting off to an unknown destination in pursuit of what my noble friend Lord Harris of High Cross termed the Holy Grail.<lb/>
Nothing better illustrates this than the naive assumption that had we joined the Common Market at the outset it would have prevented the excesses of the common agricultural policy. The CAP had virtually nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics. It was a piece of social engineering designed to keep inefficient peasant farmers on the land for fear that they would otherwise drift to the cities and form a potentially revolutionary proletariat who would vote for communists or other extreme Left-wing parties. Faced with that situation, Britain's advice would have counted for almost nothing. That is not my analysis, it is a matter of historical record.<lb/>
We should look with extreme suspicion at any suggestion of giving more powers to the European Parliament. One reason is that given by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. I am glad to be able to agree with him on at least one issue: that the European Parliament can vote for spending but has no responsibility for raising the money on which that spending is based. Another reason, as I pointed out on an earlier occasion&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04225"><member>Baroness Elles</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, did I hear the noble Lord say that the European Parliament was responsible for raising money in the European Community, or did I misunderstand what he was saying?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04226"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, indeed it is not responsible and that is the whole problem.

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04227"><member>Baroness Elles</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect to the noble Lord, the European Parliament has no power over spending. It has the power to amend one-third of the budget which is proposed by the Commission and agreed by the Council of Ministers. The power of the European Parliament is extremely limited in regard to expenditure.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0478"/>
<col>877</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04228"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I should have referred to indirect spending; in other words, the European Parliament can vote for policies which will cause member states of the EC to incur expenditure which, in the absence of resolutions or directives emanating directly or indirectly from the European Parliament, they would not have otherwise incurred. The taxpayers of the country concerned would not have had to fork out for those expenditures.<lb/>
Another reason, as I have pointed out on earlier occasions and as the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, will remember, is that because of the allocation of seats in the European Parliament Britain could be outvoted on a matter affecting our vital interests by a coalition of smaller countries whose total populations are less than 53 per cent. of our own. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, said that that came about because of a deal done many years ago, and I accept that, but it does not make it any more palatable.<lb/>
I was delighted to see that Mr. Andrew Duff&#x2014;who nobody can accuse of not being a Euro-enthusiast&#x2014;in his evidence to the committee said he believed that,
<quote>"Seats won must match broadly votes cast".</quote>
That is on page 263 of Volume II. Then again, the <i>Financial Times</i>&#x2014;nobody could possibly accuse that paper of being inimical to the EC in any way&#x2014;in its issue dated 27th October painted a vivid picture of the European Parliament. It described a visit to the European Parliament of Virgilio Barco, the drug fighting president of Colombia. The article states:
<quote>"Barco was perplexed to find half his audience wearing black arm bands and waving home made cardboard tombstones for people allegedly murdered by the Colombian Government".</quote>
The article later described the chamber:
<quote>"The left side is dotted with youth and colour. A German Green with spiky hennaed hair in a multicoloured kaftan kisses a like-minded Dane".</quote>
The <i>Financial Times</i> did not say whether the Dane was of the same sex as the German or the opposite sex. It continued:
<quote>"Near her a British leftie in a rugby shirt yawns over the sports page of the <i>Guardian</i>".</quote>
I know that there are also many splendid and hard-working members of the European Parliament, but to what extent should our future be in the hands of German punks in multicoloured kaftans?<lb/>
Paragraph 143 of the report speaks of,
<quote>"the spectre of arbitrary and unnecessary intervention from the centre",</quote>
implying that there is a great deal of fuss about nothing and that the "spectre" is not to be taken seriously. That is not so. Why should the people of one country have the right to interfere in the shooting seasons, the speed limits or the degree of water purity of any other country? Why should any outside or foreign body prevent the British Government from building a road across Twyford Down or building another road through a wood in order to complete the East London crossing? It is every concern of the British. We have every right to object and I do not like
<col>878</col>
some of these proposals myself. However, these matters are not the business of anybody else in any other country.<lb/>
I deplore the extension of the TGV line through virgin country from Mont&#x00E9;limar to Avignon, and Aix-en-Provence to Nice. I greatly sympathise with the people of Provence in their opposition to the construction of this line. But in the final analysis it is their business and absolutely none of mine. Therefore, I totally oppose the proposal for the extension of majority voting to environmental matters except in those rare instances such as acid rain, pollution of the oceans and smoke pollution, where the consequences transcend national frontiers.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04230"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, until one hour ago I intended to begin by saying that there had been remarkable uniformity in the support and praise for this report. However, recent speeches have led me to believe that there is more diversity of views in your Lordships' House than the earlier speeches had suggested. It will not surprise your Lordships that we on these Benches who claim to be the Stone Age Europeans and totally undivided supporters of the EC from its inception welcome this report wholeheartedly. I shall not take up too much time congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and his team because everybody else has done so. I am sure he will accept that our enthusiasm and gratitude are great. They have been much enhanced by the speeches made in the last hour, which have shown how great is the need for clarification of the kind that this report has given us.<lb/>
There are a number of points raised in the report. Among those who support it in general terms there is a great deal of agreement about those points. The rejection of the hard ecu, with the exception of the support for it from the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, has been widespread. The reasons given for the rejection have been extremely helpful to those of us who find the intricacies of the currency arguments not too easy to unravel.<lb/>
There is widespread agreement that there is a need for more democratic control over the developing institutions of the Community. Those views have been very well and valuably expressed and discussed in the report. I believe that all of us will agree that this is a very important feature to which great attention needs to be given.<lb/>
There are those of us who believe that the institutions of the Community must be developed and that enlargement will come. At the same time there must be a deepening of those institutions. There must also be concern about the democratic element. As the report has stressed, these measures have to be achieved in two directions; namely, in greater links between the national parliaments and the institutions of the Community and in more detailed suggestions about the way in which the Houses of Parliament and the MEPs can have closer contact. Those proposals are valuable and need to be followed up and put into practice as soon as possible.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0479"/>
<col>879</col>
There should be more power for the European Parliament, though there is considerable diversity of opinion about how much power it should be given. Those of us who are in favour of the report in general terms believe that the parliament needs to be strengthened and made more democratic.<lb/>
In making the parliament more democratic, one step that could be taken very quickly, and taken unilaterally by the Government in this country, is to change the voting system to the European Parliament so that at least it would be more democratic in its representation of the voters of this country. If that was done, it would be more in line with the requirements of the treaty, which have always laid down that elections for the parliament should be on a common basis. But that is, as it were, in parenthesis. There are developments for the increased democratisation of the Community which we would all very much support.<lb/>
The points raised by Members of your Lordships' House who have, to some degree at any rate, if not totally, supported the report, have centred around the question of sovereignty, and also around the way in which power is to be distributed throughout the Community and throughout the nation states within the Community. This is another aspect, I suppose, of the issue of sovereignty.<lb/>
I must say that as I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Benson, I could not believe my ears. When he described to us the edifice from which we would be retreating, or rather the edifice from which our great-grandchildren would be retreating, in 50 years' time, I could not begin to comprehend that that was the kind of organisation we were building. There is no suggestion, as I understand it, of a great super state with strong central powers which will dictate not only to the Twelve, but to all the other countries which are likely to join together. It would be a ludicrous conception, and I am quite certain that it is not the conception that was held by the members of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, or by any of the rest of us who are greatly in support of further developments inside the Community.<lb/>
But we have to think in more detail about how power is to be distributed. There are clues given in the report in terms of interpretations of the idea of subsidiarity. The noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, said that too much can be made of the idea of subsidiarity, and it has been said&#x2014;I forget whether the noble Lord himself said it, but it has certainly been said on a number of occasions&#x2014;that people who do not wish to see the Community develop hide behind the idea of subsidiarity to halt the kind of development which is necessary.<lb/>
However, there is more to it than that. We need to know what decisions are to be made and at what level. It is not only a question of what decisions are to be made by the parliament, by Brussels and by the Council of Ministers; of how power is to be distributed at that level; and what decisions are to be made by national governments. Also, surely, in the Community of the future, especially if it is enlarged,
<col>880</col>
there are likely to develop regional areas, perhaps regional groupings, which will themselves want to take decisions in respect of their own affairs.<lb/>
We see this happening inside the United Kingdom. In Scotland, there is an urgent demand for more control over their own affairs. The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, never loses an opportunity to tell us how important it is that the Welsh should be able to control what goes on in Wales, where something is relevant only to Wales. You have only to look across into continental Europe. There are problems to be settled with the Basques, the Catalonians and a whole variety of other groups who will demand that they have control over their own affairs. If the freed countries of Eastern Europe join, either directly or in some associated status, they, too, will make demands of the same kind. I was recently talking to an enthusiastic politician from Slovenia. He could not wait to get away from Belgrade. In the future, those regional groupings will be part of the Community, whatever kind of shape it takes. We too must think in such terms. We must consider the huge question of how power is to be distributed.<lb/>
I absolutely agree that we cannot here and now say how that power will be distributed. In contradiction of the nightmare put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Benson, that what will emerge is a highly centralised state trying to control by diktat throughout the whole European Continent, we can emphatically say that that would be madness and that it would receive no support. Moreover, it is not what any of us who have supported the European idea for decades have been working for. We cannot make that point too clear.<lb/>
The most disappointing speech, although perhaps not unexpectedly so, came from the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. The impression of the Government's attitude which we were given was that in reality what they want, and what they should always have settled for, is a free trade area. They see the Community as an economic community giving opportunities which arise through a large unified market; and that is the beginning and end of the matter. That is why the Government have been so unwilling to take the lead in going along with the development of the European Community along the lines which have been suggested and which are supported by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and his report.<lb/>
The idea of the single currency, having received widespread support in other areas, was turned down out of hand by the noble Earl. His attitude towards those who criticise the Government and towards those who support the development suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, was condescending and patronising.<lb/>
I have no doubt that the noble Earl's speech was written before today. Perhaps this is indeed an historic day on which to be discussing the Future of the European Community and our place in it. Whatever one may feel about the changes which have taken place today, it must be true that this gives us an opportunity for a new start in our relations with the European Community. Whoever it is who goes to Rome he will perhaps not be hamstrung by the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0480"/>
<col>881</col>
decisions and statements which have come from the Government in the past. It is to be hoped that what we heard today was in every sense yesterday's speech.<lb/>
One of the problems which we face is that the European Community is a totally new conception. There is no precedent in human history for the Community. We are always trying to find parallels where there are no parallels. We set out to create something which is new in terms of the way in which human beings organise themselves as nations and as communities. However, as we set out, we do not know where we shall arrive. We should do much better if we accepted that uncertainty as part of the conditions under which we are working. It is a little like Christopher Columbus setting out to find the East Indies and in fact discovering America. It was a much greater achievement than he anticipated and one which was totally unexpected.<lb/>
Because this is a new concept, the language we use to describe it is never quite right. I much regret&#x2014;and I speak now more for myself than for my party&#x2014;that the word "federal" is so much used. It conjures up in people's minds a picture which is false to the Community. On hearing the word "federal", the vast majority of people in this country think about the United States of America. The United States was made up of people who had voluntarily abandoned the old world and deliberately, and of their own volition, set out to reate a new country and a new nation. Nothing could be less like that than the European Community, which is the coming together of old cultures. They come together because they see a common interest and a common benefit in so doing. That has never happened before in human history.<lb/>
It is not surprising that we are confused. Let us not confuse ourselves further by using misleading language. As it is so difficult for us to know precisely where we are going, it is equally difficult for us to know the route by which we shall get there. As we struggle with the objectives and with the route, and as we work at the constructive conflicts that that journey involves, we shall learn what it is we are trying to create and the best way to create it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04232"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have come to the end of a long day's debate. I, as others have, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, and the committee on their report. He must be feeling somewhat less shy at the end of today than he proclaimed himself to be earlier this afternoon.<lb/>
I want to stress, as did the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, that this is possibly the most important issue in politics that we shall continue debating during the 1990s. The noble Lord was right to say that Members of another place should recognise, if they do not already recognise, that these are matters which affect and will affect their constituents directly, and that it is therefore of supreme importance that both Houses of Parliament take an intense interest in what is going on and what will develop over the next few years.<lb/>
<col>882</col>
I have only two small criticisms of the committee's report, and I offer them in the friendliest possible spirit. The first is that in view of the paragraph on convergence&#x2014;I shall come to convergence later&#x2014;I was disappointed that the committee did not take evidence&#x2014;I understand that it was under considerable time pressure&#x2014;from the Portuguese, the Greeks, the Spaniards and the Danes&#x2014;a Dane did give evidence but I understand that he was speaking for the Commission. Their countries are those on the periphery of the Community which may have a word to say about convergence if we go right through to the EMU single currency.<lb/>
My other slight criticism is that I believe that the operation of the monetary compensation allowances&#x2014;the green currencies&#x2014;in the Community might have given us some insight into how a common currency might work, because the monetary compensation allowances have had to be devised as a form of regional policy, and a form of regional policy will have to be devised with a single currency. I shall return to that point later. They are slender and small criticisms only, which I offer in the friendliest possible spirit to the noble Lord and his committee.<lb/>
I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hesketh, who is to follow me, that I appreciate the difficulty in which the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lord find themselves. I say that sincerely because they must respond for the Government, and yet within one or two weeks we shall have a new Prime Minister, a new Cabinet and a new Government. It is extremely difficult to make any commitments on behalf of any new Government which may be in office only two weeks from now. Whatever the noble Lord says, we shall have to take it with the due qualification that I am sure he would impose.<lb/>
I intend to deal more with economic than with political matters, although the two cannot, as the report rightly points out, properly be separated. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, was too emphatic when he said that he knew nothing about politics and was dealing with economics only. These are matters of politics and economics and it is a great mistake to try to separate the one from the other.<lb/>
It was a year ago only&#x2014;on 18th December, 1989&#x2014;that your Lordships debated the Select Committee's report on the Delors Report. On that occasion, we from these Benches said that, first, we were in favour of British entry into the exchange rate mechanism, but on the basis that there would be tough negotiation about the rate. We would not jump in blind. Our support was on the basis that the swap arrangements inside the mechanism would be increased to accommodate sterling, which is the second most highly traded currency in the Community. It was also on the basis that there would be emphasis on a growth pattern, a co-ordinated economic system within the Community.<lb/>
The first two conditions&#x2014;tough negotiations and swap arrangements increased&#x2014;were not envisaged by the Government. They jumped in blind at the wrong moment and there was no attempt to increase the swap arrangements. However, the third condition,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0481"/>
<col>883</col>
which is tantamount to mutual surveillance of economic policies, is starting to appear, if it is agreed. We are pleased about that. The second point we made in that debate from these Benches was that we did not regard the Delors model stages two and three as necessarily the right model for the future. We thought that both stages had serious disadvantages.<lb/>
The problem that most exercised us in that debate and still exercises us today is the so-called independence of the central monetary authority. The noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, rightly pointed out that one of the services the report had done us was to demonstrate that a number of the buzz words used were simply a substitute for thought. I tend to think that the word "independent", when we talk about a European central hank, is one of those words.<lb/>
If we consider the status of the Bundesbank, it does not take long to see, if I can rely on Mr. Schlesinger, who is the vice-president of the Bundesbank and to whom I talked the other day, that on only two occasions in the past 30 years has the Bundesbank gone against the advice of the finance ministry in Bonn in any of its actions in raising or lowering interest rates. It was quite clearly shown by the chancellor of the Federal Republic that when push came to shove on re-unification, the Bundestag could remove the independence of the Bundesbank by a simple vote. That was pointed out. The result was that the Bundesbank went along with something it had not advised. Furthermore, Dr P&#x00F6;hl is quite right when he says that the Bundesbank pays attention to the generality of economic and financial policy of the Federal Republic. It is quite proper that it should do so.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Murray of Epping Forest made an important point. It was that we cannot simply separate monetary policy from fiscal policy and from social policy. They all go together. There must be some method of accountability imposed upon whatever monetary authority runs the monetary unit, the single currency or whatever we get to: it must have some democratic legitimacy. I put it like that because it is an important concept. It is not simply accountability to the Council of Ministers; somebody must control it democratically.<lb/>
We do not think that government control of monetary policy started in 1946. I have a difference of opinion with the noble Lords, Lord Cockfield and Lord Plumb, on that matter. Governments have always been interested in monetary policy. After all, Mr Churchill put us on the gold standard in 1925. If that is not government interest in monetary policy, I do not know what is. As regards a European central bank, if I may use that catchphrase, one of the points on which we insist is that there must be some strong political control, not just accountability.<lb/>
I join with the noble Lords, Lord Cockfield and Lord Roll of Ipsden, and the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, in complaining about the phrase "imposition of a currency", which I believe the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, used three times in his speech. There is no means of imposing a currency on the United Kingdom. Such a proposition would have to pass
<col>884</col>
through your Lordships' House among other institutions and be subject to a vote taken in Parliament. However, I recognise that the debate on the single currency has moved on since we debated the measures of the Delors Committee almost a year ago. The debate has moved on in two respects: first, it has moved on because the political momentum has moved forward and gained pace and, secondly, because the Government have produced a hard ecu plan.<lb/>
I do not intend to spend a great deal of time discussing the hard ecu plan because the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, effectively put that to bed. Further, the noble Lords, Lord Roll of Ipsden and Lord Selsdon, pointed out that it would perhaps have been acceptable as a separate standard. I believe those were the words that were used. That might have been the case 10 or 15 years ago, but unless it can be demonstrated that it is not just an illusion or a trick produced by the Government and that it would lead quite quickly to a single currency, it does not seem to me to have any political merit as regards the discussions that are taking place. Until now no one has managed to demonstrate the contrary.<lb/>
However, the single currency argument which has moved forward has brought us up against the problem of convergence. Here the report is eloquent. As I have said, it is sad that evidence was not given by some of the countries in the Community whose people I would have thought would be most disadvantaged by a move towards either irrevocably fixed exchange rates or a single currency, for example, the Greeks, the Portuguese and perhaps the Spanish. Perhaps Dr. P&#x00F6;hl thinks we are on the fringe of those in the Community who might be disadvantaged by moving in that direction.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Briginshaw pointed out that the Eastern European countries would fall into the category of those who are not even near the edge of being convergent with us. When we talk about convergence I assume we mean upward convergence rather than downward convergence; in other words we are saying that we would all like to reach up to the highest level rather than drag the German economy, for example, down to the average level. I imagine that is right, but the point has not been hitherto stressed in the debate. As the report quite rightly points out, convergence is not just a question of convergence on inflation. It is convergence on all kinds of economic parameters. There may be a trade off between a slightly higher inflation rate and a slightly lower unemployment rate. We may have to consider all these matters.<lb/>
I am glad that at paragraph 92 the report sets out the possibility of what I call staggered entry. The report suggests that it might be possible to create something which was relevant to a number of countries at one particular time. However, until convergence was further advanced other countries might not wish to join immediately but would perhaps like to join within a set timetable. We would resist the idea, as other noble Lords have done, that one should impose absolute dates when this should happen. The date at which states wish to join in monetary union
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0482"/>
<col>885</col>
will depend on how well they do. The noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, made that point and I support him.<lb/>
I now return to the monetary compensation amounts. If EMU is to hold together, it will certainly require substantial transfer of resources from one country to another, either in the form of the structural funds or in the form of a rather more developed regional policy. There are obviously serious imbalances in the European economy and if we enter monetary union too fast the whole thing will fall apart because of those imbalances. It is better to make haste slowly, to try to get the thing right and to try to make sure that there is a system to stop the Scots, the Welsh, the Galicians or the Catalonians suffering just because of a haste to enter monetary union.<lb/>
It is the Federal Republic of Germany that will be in the firing line. Will the German economy, which will be the dominant economy in Europe in national terms over the next few years, be able to sustain not only the reunification of Germany but also the substantial transfer of resources to the poorer members of the Community which will have to take place? I have very serious doubts on that point. The Germans quite rightly believe that German reunification is the most important item on their financial agenda. Not just billions but trillions of deutschmarks are being poured into East Germany. There is not much point in asking Germany to take part in an EMU which includes the development of the structural funds and a regional policy involving inter-country transfers if it is so concerned about the reunification of Germany and the financial investment which that involves.<lb/>
We have to ask ourselves how that will operate. There are many questions to be answered. Noble Lords have put some of those questions, and there will be others which have to be answered before we can form a final view. No doubt the shape of those questions will come out in the two IGC conferences which are about to take place. However, it is perfectly clear to me and to us on these Benches that the other members of the Community will go ahead on the basis of their own timetable. We cannot be left behind. The problem we would then have to face would be not whether EMU is or is not desirable for us but to what extent an EMU which left us out would leave our economy in an impossible position. It is the recognition of that inevitability which should spur us to participate actively in shaping the course of events.<lb/>
It is just as important to ensure that our own economy moves out of its present weak position. That will require long-term policies to be put in place which are quite different from those of the past few years.<lb/>
In principle, to adopt the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, we believe that it is in our national interest to join actively in the process towards EMU. In principle we have no objection to a single currency on the assumption, as my noble friend Lord Barnett said, that it is a long way off. It will not happen tomorrow. We must obviously wait to see what form of single currency emerges from the
<col>886</col>
discussions. But if we want to be part of it - whatever it may turn out to be - we must put our own house in order first, and that we can only do ourselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04233">10.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04234"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Hesketh)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had an interesting and thoughtful debate this afternoon. However, if I were a betting man and had been asked before the start of the debate in your Lordships' House today whether or not we should be discussing the "Rainbow Warrior" or carol singers in Saudi Arabia I should have lost my money.<lb/>
I, too, should like to pay tribute to the work of the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Aldington. The committee's report reflects months of hard and productive labour. The committee has taken evidence from nearly all the key players in the EMU and political union debate. It has travelled to Europe. Through the course of the summer and early autumn it has had to contend almost daily with new developments in a continually shifting debate. Whatever happens in the course of the intergovernmental conferences which begin on 14th December, I am convinced that the report will be an important reference work for many years to come.<lb/>
There is much in the report with which the Government can agree. We agree that member states should retain control over budgetary policy and that there is a need for greater economic convergence. We agree that the next stage of the EMU process is of key importance; and that the single financial area should be completed. On the political side, we agree that there is a need for a pragmatic and consensual approach which will improve the efficiency of the Community. We also recognise that Community institutions should be democratically accountable, and that the principle of subsidiarity should be clarified at the IGC.<lb/>
But we cannot agree with the main recommendation of the report&#x2014;that the Government should accept the goal of a single currency. The imposition of a single currency would involve a considerable transfer of sovereignty over national monetary policy to a European central bank. I do not believe that this would be acceptable to this Parliament. Indeed, it was decisively rejected in another place.<lb/>
Moreover, we do not believe that the Community is ready for a single currency, for economic convergence among the 12 member states remains a long way off and we must consider their relative economic performance, as my noble friend Lord Selsdon pointed out in his notable speech.<lb/>
Inflation ranges from 3 per cent. to 22 per cent; short-term interest rates range from 8.5 per cent. to 19 per cent; long-term interest rates range from 9 per cent. to 24 per cent; budget balances range from a surplus of 1 per cent. of GDP to a deficit of 17 per cent; and unemployment, which is a good measure of labour market inflexibility, ranges from 1 per cent. to 16 per cent.<lb/>
For as long as such substantial divergences in the economies of member states exist, a move to a single
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0483"/>
<col>887</col>
currency and a single monetary authority for the Community would represent a massive leap in the dark, with potentially disastrous consequences.<lb/>
It is true that the imposition of a single currency might suppress some of the differences between these widely differing economies&#x2014;for a short time. But this would only be at the cost of rising unemployment in countries, especially in southern Europe, whose economies were not sufficiently flexible to adjust. That is not just the view of the British Government. Listen to Karl Otto P&#x00F6;hl, President of the Bundesbank, speaking in Munich in September:
<quote>"As long as divergences between EC countries exist&#x2014;as today&#x2014;it is hard to conceive how the exchange rate can be given up as a policy mechanism".</quote>
Dr. P&#x00F6;hl, of course, has first-hand experience of monetary union. Following the union of the German economies, Dr. P&#x00F6;hl is having to cope with running an integrated German monetary policy, at a time when the Eastern German economy is completely out of kilter with the Western half. And Dr. P&#x00F6;hl has pointed out quite bluntly that the price of German economic and monetary union will be paid for&#x2014;and these are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"either in terms of unemployment or in expenditure of public funds to prevent the worst".</quote>
So what could be the consequences of a premature move by the European Community to a single currency? There are four main possibilities, the first of which the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, pointed out to your Lordships. There would be demands for increasing transfers from the well-off northern member states to their poorer southern partners to compensate them. Taxpayers may well not welcome that, least of all in Germany where the full cost of its monetary union is only now becoming apparent. Even on present policies, the Community by 1993 will be spending &#x00A3;14 billion on structural policy. And all the evidence suggests that budgetary transfers are not an effective way of avoiding unemployment in the longer term.<lb/>
Secondly, the "independent" central bank could succumb to the inevitable political pressure and relax monetary policy. This would cause a significant increase in inflation and deteriorating economic performance right across the Community. Thirdly, there could be an ever-increasing flow of migration from the member states with less flexible economies as people go in search of jobs and prosperity. Fourthly, as the real costs of monetary union become apparent to governments and electorates, the monetary union could break up under the weight of increasing social and economic tension. That would set back the cause of closer economic integration by decades and would be enormously damaging to the Community both internally and in the eyes of the world.<lb/>
We believe that the facts are plain. Many member states will continue to need to use monetary and exchange rate policies to adjust to differences in economic circumstances. Moreover, so long as those circumstances remain as different as they are now, different counrtries' economies will react differently to
<col>888</col>
unexpected shocks. They need flexibility to deal with such shocks. And the costs of losing that flexibility could be devastating.<lb/>
However, if the costs of a premature move to a single currency are considerable, what are the benefits of a single currency? The publication of the Commission report <i>One Market, One Money</i> a month ago continues the important debate on the benefits and costs of EMU.<lb/>
That report, however, clearly exaggerates the reduction in transaction costs that would flow from a single currency. It does so by referring principally to the more costly methods of transferring money around the Community. There are cheaper mechanisms already available. Significant cost savings can certainly be made in the relatively short term without taking the drastic step of moving to a single currency.<lb/>
Nor does the Commission report take sufficient account of financial liberalisation and technological change. Those are both likely to reduce transaction costs significantly in the years ahead, whether or not a currency union takes place.<lb/>
We must not forget that transaction costs will by no means disappear with a single currency. Banks would still incur costs in transferring money from one country to another. One has only to look at the experience of the United States. Clearing cheques between different states is still an expensive business, despite America's long and distinguished history of a single currency.<lb/>
The costs of a premature move to monetary union could clearly outweigh the limited benefits. I again quote Karl Otto P&#x00F6;hl:
<quote>"The alleged savings in transactions costs are not in the least convincing"</quote>
As Dr. P&#x00F6;hl also said:
<quote>"John Major &#x2026; is quite right to point out that a joint monetary policy can be very much more expensive than the conceivable saving in transactions costs".</quote>
It is against that background that the Government have put forward an alternative, evolutionary approach&#x2014;the hard ecu and the European Monetary Fund. We have proposed a new common currency, to be introduced alongside national currencies. The hard ecu would by definition be a highly stable, anti-inflationary currency. That is because it would never devalue against the strongest currency on realignments of the exchange rate mechanism.<lb/>
We have proposed a new institution&#x2014;the European Monetary Fund&#x2014;to manage the hard ecu. The EMF would issue hard ecu only in exchange for community national currencies. Its own operations therefore would never result in an increase in the Community's monetary base.<lb/>
We believe the hard ecu would become widely used. It will provide a secure store of value for savers and the low rate of interest&#x2014;associated with a strong currency&#x2014;should prove attractive to borrowers. It will provide a good medium of exchange for intra-Community trade and could become widely used by businesses and tourists. In time, if peoples and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0484"/>
<col>889</col>
governments so choose, it could develop into a single currency. But we believe that that is not a decision that we should take now.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn to some of the points raised by noble Lords in the debate. From the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Caithness, the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, deduced that the Government were interested only in a free trade area. With the commitment that this country already has to 1992, and from my experiences at Brussels, I am clear that we are a member of a body that is a great deal more complex than simply a free trade area; and it will continue to become more integrated.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, referred to the fact that the currency of sterling had become very weak. However, the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, claimed at the same time that the currency was far too strong. Not for the first time and not for the last, I suspect that if I am in between the two the Government may have got it right.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Briginshaw, said that there was no such thing as free trade. He may be right. One thing is certain, however: the road to protectionism is also the road to ruin.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, felt that he might be committing an act of heresy when he rose to speak in your Lordships' House this afternoon. I listened with great interest to his speech. I fear that if he were in a position of suitable strength I should be the first that he would take to the stake to burn. However, what happened to this country in the decade of the 1980s must be remembered. His figures for Europe may well be correct but it must be remembered that the United Kingdom enjoyed a period of unprecedented economic growth within the Community.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Carr of Hadley rightly drew your Lordships' attention to his time as a Cabinet Minister when he was not made privy to every piece of financial information that came from the Treasury. I can assure him that little has changed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Butterworth, was right to point out that a single currency could damage other and weaker currencies. I agree entirely that it would create demands for massive transfers from structural funds, to which I referred earlier.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, raised the question of European expansion; the acquisition of more states coming into the Community. He inquired about the Government's commitment to expansion. If there are others who desire to come into the Community&#x2014;I believe that he was referring to the East&#x2014;the Government support that proposition.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cromer, was intriguing about the question of what currency would come into being. It is important to note that the advantage of the hard ecu is that it is a currency which can be brought into being quickly as compared with EMU, for which as yet no one has given a date.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, pointed out that by 1776 Adam Smith had clearly set
<col>890</col>
out the definition of a supreme and successful common market. I was grateful to the noble Lord for drawing that to the attention of the government spokesman.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Jay, referred to the 1939 Bank for International Settlements and to the &#x00A3;l2 million in Czechoslovakian gold. There was then some disagreement between the noble Lords, Lord Jay and Lord O'Brien. However, the noble Earl, Lord Bessborough, moved on to the subject of the sovereignty of our nation. He pointed out that this country had historically signed many treaties. It is true that more than 500 years ago we signed a treaty with Portugal. I suspect that his belief that all treaties meant an end to sovereignty would be disagreed with by the Government today.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Harris of High Cross and Lord Jay, described each other as economic liberals. I shall read <i>Hansard</i> to see whether I can find more elucidation. I heartily agree with the warnings given by the noble Lord, Lord Jay, about the potential dangers of a premature move into a single currency. I am grateful for his support.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, agreed that convergence was needed for monetary union but argued that it must not be an excuse for delay. I point out that the UK's proposals, which could be put into practice shortly, would promote convergence today.<lb/>
Much was made of the Bundesbank. As was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, for my education, only twice in its history has it acted against the advice of the Bundestag. It is important to remember that what is often offered to your Lordships as an example of financial freedom and independence is today paying a substantial price for German unity.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, argued that economic monetary union should not happen now but that we should commit ourselves to the final objective. If a single currency is a long way off&#x2014;perhaps decades away&#x2014;why should we commit ourselves to a blueprint of a central bank whose shape we do not know?<lb/>
I was interested to hear the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, suggesting an independent central bank which would have a monopoly of monetary rectitude. During the past decade Japan has had one of the lowest inflation rates in the industrial world and its central bank is probably the least independent in the world.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, asked about a reintroduction of the GLC. I draw your Lordships' attention to the development in the eastern part of our great capital city in Docklands, the commitment to the new Underground railway and the link to the Channel Tunnel as examples of the infrastructure which is taking place and which will be required for this country and this capital to be the financial capital.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, also referred to a merger between England and Wales. I draw his
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0485"/>
<col>891</col>
attention to a takeover when Henry Tudor returned from Wales. If there had been a Monopolies and Mergers Commission then, would it have succeeded?<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Benson, referred to a fever taking control in Europe and government by remote control. I listened to his argument with interest. I hope that what he believes may happen will not happen. My noble friend Lord Selsdon made an excellent speech. He not only acknowledged the hard ecu but pointed out that versions of it in various shapes and forms had existed for some 600 years.<lb/>
The most interesting remark in the debate was made by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. It is always an advantage for me to gain clarification. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, gave me clarification this evening, so when next I travel to Europe I can tell those who are interested that the Labour Party is committed to political control of any European bank.<lb/>
This Government's objective is evolution and not revolution. Also, we do not wish to interfere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04235">11.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04236"><member>Lord Aldington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be brief in closing the debate because I took up rather too much of your Lordships' time earlier. I thank all noble Lords who took part in the debate. I am grateful for all the kind observations made about the report and the committee and also for the flattering but quite unjustified remarks made about me personally.<lb/>
As I stressed at the beginning, these reports are part of the scrutiny process of Parliament. They are part of the system of accountability of the Community and particularly of the Council of Ministers to national parliaments. Therefore, to have a speech such as the one given by my noble friend Lord Hesketh is of enormous value. It completes the process. I should like to thank him for that, even though I sharply disagree with him on what he says is one nub, but not the only nub, of our report; that is, the acceptance by Her Majesty's Government of the goal of the single currency which every other nation believes it is committed to as a goal.<lb/>
My noble friend gave selective favourable quotations of President P&#x00F6;hl. However, I remind him
<col>892</col>
that if he looks at the evidence he will find that President P&#x00F6;hl told us that he believes that every member state is and has been committed to the single currency as a goal. I must say, as I said in my introductory statement when I tried to lay the carpet, that it appears to me that we have all been committed to it since we entered the Community in 1972. That is what economic and monetary union means. If it meant economic union only, it would say that. However, I shall not go over that again.<lb/>
I wish to declare my position and that of the committee less one, because I observed one defector in the course of the debate. We still strongly recommend to the Government that they should continue to look at this matter if they are to continue to play, as the whole House wants them to play, a leading part in working out the next stages towards full monetary union.<lb/>
I say that because some noble Lords here this evening do not believe at all in the Community. They have no interest in a report like this, the purpose of which is to strengthen the Community, its efficiency, its effectiveness and democratic accountability. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Monson, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, who wagged his finger and face at me, and the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, do not like the Community at all. We have got that message but I do not believe that that helps the discussion on this subject, the purpose of which is to strengthen the Community for the future. It is also to remind your Lordships and the country of the step-by-step approach on which the Community has thrived ever since it started and of the great benefits that can come to Britain, and the people of Britain, if we steadily continue with the process of strengthening the Community and its union.<lb/>
I once again thank your Lordships. I hope the House will accept the Motion which I moved earlier today.<lb/>
On Question, Motion agreed to.<lb/>
House adjourned at eleven minutes past eleven o'clock.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Channel Tunnel: Anti-Rabies Measures</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04241">2.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04242"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04243">What action they are taking to prevent animals infected with rabies entering the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04244"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Baroness Trumpington)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the State Veterinary Service and our wildlife scientists have been fully involved in devising the measures to be used once the tunnel is operational. Those have yet to be finalised but will include the use of sealed trains, physical barriers and grids, and the continuous use of baited traps in the tunnel and terminal areas, together with vigorous cleaning and inspection procedures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04245"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Is she aware that physical access through the tunnel is now possible? In view of that, is it not a little disturbing that she has said that precautions will be taken when the tunnel is operational? Will she assure the House that precautions are being taken now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04246"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the only reason that I did not include that information was that it would have made my Answer so long. Eurotunnel has implemented measures agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to prevent the possible entry of rabies-susceptible animals while the tunnel is being built. Those include fencing, staged security zones, visual observation at openings in fencing and a system to ensure that any animals which are seen in the tunnel are reported. Ministry staff visit the construction site regularly to ensure that standards are maintained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04247"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend assure us that the steps that she has mentioned will be
<col>894</col>
effective in preventing animals coming in not on their own feet, so to speak, but when carried on railway trains?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04248"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in other words, smuggled animals?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04249"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may be allowed, surely the important point is, for example, that there should not be rats or other wild animals on goods trains or vehicles bringing rabies into the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04250"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, forgive me for not understanding my noble friend's original question. It is important to remember that disease knows no boundaries. Outbreaks could have serious consequences anywhere. Checks must therefore be possible to safeguard human, animal and plant health. Our aim is to devise arrangements which limit the risk of disease outbreak without serious disruption of freight traffic through the tunnel or elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04251"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, which animals are carriers of rabies? For instance, are bats carriers of rabies?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04252"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer is a wide variety of animals. I have some interesting facts about bats. There is no evidence of natural transmission to terrestrial mammals of the rabies-related virus found in some species of insectivorous bats on the Continent. The general provisions for preventing animals from entering the tunnel will also stop colonisation by bats. This is so interesting, my Lords, that I shall continue. While it is possible that an infected bat could cross the Channel on strong winds, the threat is extremely small. Imported bats are subject to six months' quarantine or, in the case of vampire bats, life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04253"><member>Lord Gallacher</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Baroness say whether special arrangements for public health have been, or will be, made for the Folkestone and Dover areas, together with their hinterlands, so that if an outbreak occurs facilities will be in place to deal with it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04254"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord of that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04255"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that during the time of the last Labour Government very far-reaching precautions were set up to combat any possible outbreak of rabies? Will she confirm that these are still in place and that they have not been cut down or reduced for economy reasons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04256"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hesitate to suggest that there is any connection between the last Labour Government and rabies. The precautions are indeed there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04257"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the noble Baroness any evidence that these animals wish to enter the United Kingdom?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04258"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, everyone wishes to enter the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Metropolitan Police: Recruitment</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04259">2.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04260"><member>Lord Molloy</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04261">What steps they are taking to increase recruitment into the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04262"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, recruitment to the Metropolitan Police is on target for the year. The strength on 31st October 1990 was only 185 posts short of the establishment of 28,565; 111 new recruits started their initial training at Hendon on 29th October 1990. The strength of the Metropolitan Police is 6,100 higher than it was in 1979.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04263"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that reply. Is he aware that as we now have the highest rise in crime since the war, chief constables and commissioners feel that the permitted limit should be increased? Is he further aware that there is an additional problem for police forces in outer London where parking problems are immense and where burglaries and break-ins are increasing? Police officers have to be used to control parking. Can consideration be given to permitting traffic wardens to assist the outer boroughs and thus help their police colleagues?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04264"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, certainly crime has increased and that is regrettable. However, I remind the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, that the strength of the Metropolitan Police increased from 22,528 to 28,380 between 1979 and 1990. Whereas &#x00A3;300 million was spent on the Metropolitan Police in 1978&#x2013;79, the figure has now risen to &#x00A3;1,265 million. Seven hundred additional officers have been allocated to the police service as a whole in 1990&#x2013;91. A decision as to the allocation between forces will be made before the end of the year.<lb/>
The Metropolitan Police employ traffic wardens; there is a shortage and they are difficult to recruit. The Metropolitan Police are examining how to improve matters; there was a special pay rise this year in order to encourage recruitment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04265"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that no police force in the world can, on its own, prevent the commission of crime? What is necessary for the production of a law abiding society is a society which believes in abiding by the law. Does he therefore believe that the programmes for involving the community developed by the Metropolitan Police are the most fruitful way forward? Does he also consider that generally there is a great deal more work to be done to persuade people of the rule of fair play in observing the law?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04266"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend; I agree entirely with what he says. For the police to operate properly they must receive the constructive help of the locality. Much has been done, for example, with neighbourhood watch schemes in order to encourage people to take part in the protection of their locality and to help the police.<lb/>
My noble friend is quite right. If we wish for a law-abiding society it is up to individuals. Some of the
<col>896</col>
treatment which is meted out to police on certain occasions by the members of the public is quite shocking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04267"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Earl say how many of the new recruits to the Metropolitan Police have been women and how many members of the ethnic minorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04268"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, 462 members of the ethnic minorities were members of the Metropolitan Police on 31st October this year. During the year 42 officers were recruited from the ethnic minority communities. I cannot tell the noble Baroness how many were women, either of those or of the non-ethnic minority recruits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04269"><member>The Earl of Kimberley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether one of the reasons for the wastage in the Metropolitan Police is that until recently overtime was greatly limited? Is that still the case today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04270"><member>Earl Ferrets</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is a constraint on overtime. However, one of the main problems is that once Metropolitan Police officers have been recruited and have undergone training they often find it more convenient and cheaper to move out to a police authority in the country. That is a constant cause of the loss of manpower, and there is little one can do about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04271"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems now to be a ritual practice to compare present expenditure with that of 1979. When the noble Earl gives figures, will he indicate whether they are at constant prices or whether we should make a big discount in present figures for purposes of comparison due to the enormous inflation from which we suffer?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04272"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that was an astonishingly barbed question in a number of ways. I gave the figures for 1979 because I thought that would be helpful and that was the period for which the present Government were responsible. I did not draw attention particularly to the rate which then operated. The figures I gave were in money terms, but there has been a 55 per cent. increase in real terms in the money spent on the police.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04273"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware of the anxieties that have been expressed by people who understand the statistics? They believe that the Metropolitan Police are top heavy. There are far too many chiefs and not enough indians. There are far too many people in offices and not enough on the ground. Many people do not think that we are obtaining value for money from the way in which the existing finances are used and the existing personnel is deployed. Will the Minister consider conducting a review of that situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04274"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is perfectly true that nowadays policing tends to involve a lot of office work. Consequently the Metropolitan Police have been authorised to employ 13,900 staff in order to release on to the streets those officers who are necessarily employed on work inside buildings. They are authorised to employ 13,900 staff but the civilian strength is 13,400. However, the general point that the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0488"/>
<col>897</col>
noble Lord makes about the structure of policing is always a matter for concern. It is constantly under review.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04275"><member>Baroness Sharples</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how many neighbourhood watch schemes now exist within the Metropolitan Police area?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04276"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot give that information without notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04277"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the figures that the noble Earl has given as regards the increased funds available and the increase in the number of officers recruited, and the avowed intention of the Government to combat crime&#x2014;they have stated this in all their manifestos&#x2014;is it not clear that the present system has completely failed and that perhaps the time has come for a Royal Commission to investigate the whole question of the police and crime?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04278"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the experience of most people as regards Royal Commissions is that they sit for a long time and they digest for a long time. That may not be the best way to produce a solution to a matter that is of relative immediate importance. The structure of policing is of course an important matter and it is being considered at present. However, I do not believe that a Royal Commission is the right way to tackle that matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04279"><member>Lord Richard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may revert to one of the points that the noble Earl made. It is perfectly true, as the noble Earl will know, that last year 42 people from ethnic minorities were recruited. However, is the noble Earl also aware that of those 42 people 26 have now left the force? Does the noble Earl recognise that the number of applications from ethnic minorities decreased from 624 in 1988 to 577 in 1989? Is the noble Earl further aware that the Metropolitan Police force itself has admitted that this wastage is partly caused by the attitude of white officers towards their black colleagues? Does the Minister recognise that this is an extraordinarily serious matter? Will he tell us what the Government intend to do about it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04280"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there is any racial prejudice within the Metropolitan Police&#x2014;obviously from time to time there will be cases of racism&#x2014;it is a specific offence under the police discipline code and it is punishable with punishments ranging from caution to dismissal from the force. Certainly a number of officers from ethnic minorities were recruited. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, is right to say that some 27 of them left. The commissioner is committed to establishing a workforce which is more representative of the population of London. In order to facilitate this process, various steps have been taken such as the abolition of the minimum height requirement. I am sure that will please the noble Lord, Lord Molloy. There is a pre-employment course for those promising candidates who nevertheless fail the police initial recruitment test. A special research study is being conducted into why members of ethnic minorities do
<col>898</col>
not join the police force. The result of that study has been used to enhance the present media advertising campaign which is aimed at ethnic minority groups.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04281"><member>Lord Richard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that additional information. The Minister said that certain sanctions are available to the Metropolitan Police against officers who are convicted of racial prejudice. However, can the Minister tell us how many officers have been convicted of that offence and what the penalties have been?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04282"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot tell the noble Lord how many officers have been affected by the sanctions as there are various disciplinary charges which cover racially discriminatory behaviour, such as discreditable conduct. However, those offences do not require proof of racial motivation and therefore it is difficult to give an answer in terms of the number of people who have been convicted of offences which are racially motivated as such offences come under another heading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04283"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to get the position absolutely clear. Is it right to say that the vast majority of jobs carried out, for example, in the secretarial sector of the Metropolitan Police are carried out by civilians and not by the police at all?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04284"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is perfectly true and that is why I said that the civilian quota allowed for over 13,000 people. It is important that those jobs which can be done by people other than highly trained policemen should be done by civilians.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04285"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the remarks made by the noble Earl about my stature remind me of the incident when a Tory mayor said that Lloyd George was a very small man. Lloyd George, being a Welshman, told the mayor not to worry as in Wales people measure a man from the chin up&#x0021; Is the Minister aware of the report of the Association of Chief Police Officers who are somewhat concerned that not enough recruits are coming forward who are of the calibre to become, ultimately, medium grade officers? Will the Minister look at that matter as it is causing some concern?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04286"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I referred to the lowering of the height requirement because I believed it was of interest as some members of the ethnic minorities are smaller than some English men. However, if the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, had wished to enter the Metropolitan Police force I can assure him that he would have had to surmount other hurdles too. I say with the greatest respect to the noble Lord that those other hurdles might not have been quite so easy to overcome. As regards those who are capable of achieving the middle and higher ranks of the police force, I should say that there is a higher proportion of graduates in the police force now than ever before. I believe I am correct in saying that there are more graduates in the police force than in the army, the navy, and the air force combined.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Gulf</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04287">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04288"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04289">What is the present daily cost of the United Kingdom's military activity in the Middle East due to the illegal occupation of Kuwait.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04290"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (The Earl of Arran)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the current estimate of the full daily operating cost of our forces in the Gulf, including the latest enhancements, is &#x00A3;3.5 million per day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04291"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. However, is he aware that in annual terms that sum of money would amount roughly to &#x00A3;1.2 billion? Bearing in mind that our country is now in a rather serious recession by any standards, where do the Government envisage finding the money to continue to fund such an exercise? Would they find it at the cost of other social services, or would they find it from fresh sources?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04292"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, any future funding that may be required is a matter between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence. To counter blatant and naked aggression by Iraq against Kuwait through the deployment of over 30,000 of our service men and women in that area is an extremely expensive and costly operation. However, at the same time I am sure noble Lords will agree that that money is well and responsibly spent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04293"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the obliteration without excuse of one member of the United Nations by another contrary to the United Nations charter is something which must be prevented at all costs irrespective of purely financial considerations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04294"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I agree with my noble and learned friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04295"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that there was a general impression that Saudi Arabia and the Kuwait Government in exile would make contributions to the cost of the deployment of British and American troops? Can the Minister say whether negotiations have taken place and how near to completion they are?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04296"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards contributions to the cost of the operation in the Gulf, host nations are already making available a range of valuable assistance such as food, fuel and water. The West German Government have provided and are continuing to provide assistance with training. We in the United Kingdom are doing all that we can to persuade other countries to make a contribution towards the overall cost.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04297"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that thanks to the Gulf crisis and the rise in the price of oil increased revenue is available to the Treasury?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04298"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that may be so. However, we must consider the direct costs involved in the operation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04299"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Earl indicate whether the figures that he has quoted represent additional costs, bearing in mind that British troops incur costs all the time wherever they are in the world? Is the cost to which he referred over and above what would be required if the troops were in Germany?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04300"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is an additional cost of &#x00A3;3&#x00BD; million a day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04301"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Earl be more forthcoming in response to the question of my noble friend Lord Stoddart of Swindon? Have we not read in the press that the United States Government have made certain agreements with the Saudis and the Kuwaitis in exile and that the Japanese have contributed substantial sums in cash as well as in kind? How much of that money is coming to the British Government to pay for our costs in the Gulf operation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04302"><member>The Earl of Arran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, contributions to our costs in the operation in the Gulf are under discussion. The details have not yet been finalised.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Community Charge</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04303">3.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04304"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04305">Whether they intend to review the structure and operation of the community charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04306"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government carried out a review of the community charge earlier this year and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced a number of improvements, some of which are still not in place. We remain receptive to further improvements. In fact, refinements in arrangements are normal for any new major policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04307"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the review does not seem to have been very well received by all members of the Conservative Party or of the Government. Bearing in mind the revelation by Mr. Lawson that he had reported his view that the poll tax was both unworkable and electorally disastrous, will the noble Baroness say what alterations are likely to be made by the candidates for Prime Minister? Will she also say whether we are now to be faced with the ultimate paradox that having got rid of the thatcher the Government might now introduce a roof tax?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04308"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the changes which I believe will be well received are help for people who run a shop and live over the shop and for people living in tied accommodation for whom the multiplier is to be reduced to half; steps to remove anomalies in cases where people have difficulty selling their homes; and improved transitional relief for a number of people
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0490"/>
<col>901</col>
and the reduction of the period from five to three years. I do not intend to indulge in speculation about further improvements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04309"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister referred to a major new policy. Does that have any political connotations regarding what is happening today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04310"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may well have been prophetic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04311"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that to limit tax relief on mortgage interest to the standard rate&#x2014;something which should have happened a long time ago&#x2014;would make available almost &#x00A3;1 billion for additional poll tax rebates to those whose earnings are below the national average?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04312"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question that I am addressing concerns whether there is any intention to review the structure of the community charge. The noble Lord's question is therefore wide of the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04313"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Baroness tell me what happened to the promise made in an election address by the then candidate for St. Pancras North&#x2014;now the right honourable Member for Huntingdon&#x2014;that the Government would replace the rates with a just tax which would be levied on the basis of ability to pay?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04314"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government fulfilled that promise in the manifesto.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04315"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the present right honourable Member for Huntingdon is my successor. May I assure your Lordships that any undertaking that he has given can be relied upon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04316"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04317"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that it would be wise to listen to what people have to say, to consider it and to contemplate what might be done? Does she agree that we have to continue to do our utmost to make the community charge fairer and more acceptable in the eyes of those who have to pay it? Does she agree with the statement, "I have made it quite clear that there will be a fundamental review"? Finally, would she care to go for the jackpot and tell the House which of those statements was made by which of the men in grey suits?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04318"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the review undertaken this year the Government took into account some of the difficulties of implementing the community charge. I have listed some of them. Perhaps I may add that one community charge payer in four receives help from the Government. A sum of &#x00A3;2 billion is made available for relief of the community charge bills of 9 million people. That addresses the principle of ability to pay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04319"><member>Lord Ross of Newport</member><membercontribution>: My Lords,&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04320"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04321"><member>Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend accept that her refusal to indulge in speculation at this stage is to be heartily applauded not only on this side of the House?</membercontribution></p>
<col>902</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04322"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his remarks. It is not my duly to indulge in speculation; I have no intention of doing so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04323"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, without speculating, can the noble Baroness help the House by saying which of the three policies now being discussed by Mr. Heseltine, Mr. Hurd and Mr. Major is favoured by the right honourable lady, the Prime Minister?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04324"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the House will understand if I refuse to answer that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04325"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness take into consideration the difficulties faced by some severely disabled people who received rate relief before the introduction of the community charge? Will she take note of the information that is available from RADAR&#x2014;the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04326"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the number of adjustments made to the community charge this year prove that the Government have been receptive to information fed into the department about difficulties faced by some people in paying their charge. Therefore, if RADAR wishes to continue to supply information to the department I am sure that the department will be receptive to it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Planning and Compensation Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04335">3.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04336"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
The main purpose of the Bill can be simply stated. It is to make the planning system both fairer and more efficient. Essentially our present planning system has existed for over 40 years. Some elements of it go back much further. The system has for the most part served us well. In our densely-populated small island it is essential that we have an effective means of resolving how to use the land that we have available. We need houses, factories, offices, shops, roads, railways, football stadia and tennis courts; we need to regenerate rundown urban areas; to maintain our green belts, and to preserve our many beautiful and scientifically important areas of countryside and coastline and our unique historic towns and buildings. Development decisions must be made with care, taking account of these various conflicting needs and of the needs of people who will be directly affected by development.<lb/>
By and large the planning system, and the related provisions for compulsory purchase and compensation, ensure an acceptable balance. It is neither a developer's charter nor a preservationist's dream. Each individual decision contributes to the balance between conservation and development. The system must work efficiently and must be seen to operate fairly by the people whom it affects. This Bill addresses the problems which over recent years have become evident in this respect.<lb/>
Parts I and II of the Bill begin with important measures for strengthening and improving the enforcement provisions in our planning Acts in England and Wales and in Scotland. Clauses 1 to 11 for England and Wales and Clauses 27 to 36 for Scotland are based on the recommendations made by Mr. Robert Carnwath QC, in his report entitled <i>Enforcing Planning Control,</i> which my department published in April 1989.<lb/>
I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Carnwath's report. It gives a clear and succinct analysis of current enforcement problems. His recommendations provide a sound basis for amending legislation, as befits a distinguished planning barrister. I am also glad to say that the recommendations have been generally welcomed, as a package, in the extensive consultation exercise which followed publication of the report last year. It is as a balanced package of improvements that I commend this part of the Bill to your Lordships.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0493"/>
<col>907</col>
What the Carnwath report showed, and what many of us know from personal experience, is that there is a small minority of people who are determined contravenors of planning regulations. It is those people who bring the system into disrepute; and it is their damaging and unwelcome activities&#x2014;often making their neighbours' lives intolerable&#x2014;which the enforcement amendments are intended to deter or, failing that, to remedy through increased penalties; new methods for enforcing planning conditions; and improved powers for local authority officers to enter private land for enforcement purposes. But I should like to emphasise very strongly that these amendments are not directed at the ordinary, law-abiding citizen who makes a planning application to the council, has it approved and carries out the development permitted in accordance with the approved plans. People who follow the proper procedures have absolutely nothing to fear from stronger enforcement powers.<lb/>
The strengthened enforcement powers are balanced in the Bill&#x2014;as the Carnwath report recommended&#x2014;by other provisions which are intended to foster co-operation between people who want to develop their land and local planning authorities. For example, the new planning contravention notice, for which Clauses 1 and 27 provide, is meant to encourage developers and authorities to talk to each other in the early stages of the process; so that instead of formal enforcement action having to be taken when communications fail, there is a real prospect of initiating discussion which results in agreement on how land is to be developed.<lb/>
The proposals in Clauses 10 and 35 are also based on the Carnwath report's recommendations. Their main purpose is to do away with the present out-dated immunity and replace it with a modern and workable concept. I pay tribute to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Law Society for their part in initiating these revised procedures, which we believe will be generally beneficial to owners of land and to practitioners who have to advise their clients on the difficult question whether actual or proposed development is lawful. Later clauses (Clauses 19, 21, 39 and 41) make some parallel enforcement provisions in respect of tree preservation orders, listed buildings, conservation areas and hazardous substances. My final word on this part of the Bill is that it gives all planning authorities the opportunity to make the planning enforcement process work better than it does at present.<lb/>
I turn now to the changes relating to development control which are also covered by Parts I and II of the Bill. The provisions in Clause 12 were the subject of a consultation paper about planning agreements issued by the department last year. First, they would enable a developer to enter into a plannng obligation by undertaking unilaterally to carry out works or contribute to infrastructure, as an alternative to a planning agreement with the planning authority. This would enable developers to break the stalemate when local planning authorities play for time or hold out for excessive planning gain. Such undertakings would be
<col>908</col>
enforceable by the local authority concerned but would not require its agreement. They should be particularly useful in clarifying the position at appeal.<lb/>
Secondly, to ensure that planning obligations need not continue indefinitely where they no longer serve a useful purpose, the clause would enable a person who is bound by a planning obligation to apply for it to be modified or discharged. There would be a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
Thirdly, the Government intend to legislate to enable the Crown to enter into planning obligations. I regret that drafting of this technically rather difficult provision is not yet complete but I intend to introduce a suitable amendment in Committee.<lb/>
Clause 13 and several of the other development control proposals stem from the department's <i>Efficient Planning</i> consultation paper of July 1989. They are designed to streamline the planning system and make it work more effectively&#x2014;aims which I know have widespread support. They will enable us to simplify the arrangements for publicising and handling applications for bad neighbour development and for notifying owners and other interests about development proposals.<lb/>
In order to save the system from becoming clogged up by repetitive applications designed to wear down the resistance of local planning authorities and communities, Clauses 14 and 37 would give local planning authorities the power to decline to determine an application on the grounds that a similar one has been refused by the Secretary of State within the preceding two years where there has been no material change in circumstances.<lb/>
Clauses 15 and 38 would enable the Secretary of State to dismiss an appeal where the appellant delays unreasonably. Under Clause 24 the Secretary of State would be able to require someone who unreasonably insists that his appeal should be heard at a local inquiry or hearing to pay the costs of the other party to the hearing. We will be publishing for consultation the criteria to be used in deciding whether someone's insistence on an inquiry or hearing is unreasonable.<lb/>
Clause 16 rescinds the present requirement that all applications for county matter planning permissions&#x2014;that is, minerals and waste development&#x2014;should first go to the district planning authority. Applications will be submitted direct to the county council, and this should reduce handling times.<lb/>
Clause 17 provides the statutory framework for reforming the arrangements under which local planning authorities deem themselves planning permission. This was the subject of a consultation paper this year. The clause would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations governing development by local planning authorities or development of land owned by authorities, including arrangements for the discharge of authorities' functions. We intend in these regulations and other secondary legislation to require that all development proposals by local authorities, or on their land, must be fully advertised and decided in public by a committee not responsible for the management of the land concerned. If a proposal
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0494"/>
<col>909</col>
conflicts with the development plan, it must be reported to the Secretary of State so that he can consider calling in the proposals for his own decision.<lb/>
I believe that these are useful reforms. They will increase local authorities' accountability when deeming themselves planning permission, helping to correct for any possible bias which might arise from their direct financial interest; but they should not restrict authorities unnecessarily in carrying out their statutory functions.<lb/>
Clause 18 and Schedule 1 amend the provisions concerning mines and waste. They will enable aftercare conditions to be imposed on planning permissions and on revocation, discontinuance, prohibition and suspension orders so that better control can be exercised over mineral waste sites which are often unsightly. This will help to bring the tipping of minerals waste up to modern standards. The schedule would also provide for regulations to abate the compensation payable following revocation, discontinuance, prohibition or suspension orders made in respect of mineral waste sites. We believe that minerals planning authorities will then be more likely to take action to improve the operation of these sites.<lb/>
Schedule 1 would also extend to all waste disposal sites the power for local authorities to impose aftercare conditions in planning permissions and revocation and discontinuance orders&#x2014;a power already available for mineral working sites, and an important environmental improvement.<lb/>
Clauses 20 and 40 would remove doubt about whether certain forms of advertisement such as blinds and canopies on shop premises are within the scope of planning authorities' control of advertising.<lb/>
Clause 41 would enable Scottish local planning authorities to remove or obliterate illegal placards and posters. A similar power in England and Wales already enables authorities to deal with fly-posting.<lb/>
I turn now to the provisions in Schedules 3 and 4 to the Bill. The development plan provisions in Schedule 3 will end a long period of debate and uncertainty about the future of the planning system in England and Wales. It is almost exactly four years since the Government published their Green Paper on the Future of Development Plans. That was followed up by a White Paper in January 1989. Those proposals were further modified by my right honourable friend's announcement in September of our decision to retain county structure plans.<lb/>
At the end of this process we have a package on which I believe there is a wide measure of agreement. Given the many pressures on scarce land resources, we need a rational framework for land use planning which can look at the community's requirements in the round and balance development needs against the importance of conserving what is best in our heritage. The problem with the present system is that it is far too slow and cumbersome. For instance, it currently takes my department almost two and a half years on average to approve a county structure plan. Plans may be overtaken by events even before they come into force.<lb/>
<col>910</col>
The provisions in Schedule 3 address those issues, with the aim of simplifying and streamlining the system. We intend to retain county structure plans as an essential strategic element in the development plan framework. But the Bill will allow counties to adopt their own plans in future, after due public consultation, rather than have to submit them to the Secretary of State. Of course counties will have to have regard to national policies and regional guidance in drawing up their plans. My right honourable friend will retain the power to intervene if they fail to do so; for example, if the county concerned fails to take a realistic view of development needs. But self-adoption will give responsible counties the chance to revise and update their plans much more quickly than they can at present. We shall be requiring all counties to prepare one plan for the whole of their areas and to confine their plans to a prescribed range of key strategic issues.<lb/>
At the district level, the Bill will require all district councils to prepare local plans for the whole of their areas. At present the preparation of local plans is discretionary and only about 30 per cent. of the country is covered. This is an unsatisfactory situation. It means that in many areas there is no clear framework against which planning applications can be considered. It has also meant that many structure plans have included development control policies on matters which should properly be for local decision. Extending local plan coverage will help to ensure that county structure plans can focus on the key strategic planning issues. Again, there is provision to ensure consistency between national policy, structure plan and local plan, including reserve powers for the Secretary of State to direct modifications should it become necessary.<lb/>
Our intention is that counties should be asked to revise and update their structure plans in line with the new provisions within two years of their commencement. Districts will be required to prepare local plans for the whole of their areas within five years of commencement. Of course those who already have up-to-date local plans or who are working on them at the moment will be able to make full use of that existing material in producing the new district-wide plans. We shall be tabling appropriate transitional provisions at Committee stage.<lb/>
Schedule 3 also makes provisions for development plans in national parks. Structure planning arrangments there will be unchanged. But all national park boards and committees will have a new responsibility to prepare a local plan for the whole of the national park. Again present coverage of local plans in the national parks is very patchy. These new provisions will clarify plan-making responsibilities in the parks and put the basis for development control on a firmer footing.<lb/>
The Bill will require all counties and national park authorities to prepare minerals development plans for their areas. We are consulting at the moment on the possibility of introducing for Committee stage a similar requirement for waste disposal development plans.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0495"/>
<col>911</col>
Finally, Schedules 3 and 4 also include provisions which will simplify procedures for public consultation on both draft development plans and draft schemes for simplified planning zones. That is a brief sketch of the key provisions in these schedules. I believe that they are provisions which will be widely welcomed.<lb/>
We are proposing a firm timetable for the completion of development plans. Once the system is up and running we believe it will pay large dividends not only for planning authorities but for developers as well and for all who have an interest in the planning system. It will provide a firmer and clearer framework for decisions on individual planning applications avoiding the need for so many appeals.<lb/>
The last major component of the Bill concerns compulsory purchase and land compensation. Parts III and IV, like the remainder of the Bill, have the objective of improving both the basic fairness of the system and the efficiency with which it operates.<lb/>
Broadly speaking, compensation is payable when people's rights over land are taken away or damaged under statutory powers or under the threatened use of such powers. For many years now the statutory code governing the assessment of compensation in such circumstances has rested on the central principle that the claimant should be left neither better off nor worse off than he would have been if the question of compulsory purchase had not arisen. Compensation is accordingly calculated by reference to the proper value of the land in the open market, discounting, however, any effect on that value of the actual proposal for which the land is required.<lb/>
In continuing to uphold the basic structure of the compensation regime we none the less accept the need to give claimants a better deal. That is the main purpose of the provisions in Part III and IV. In particular, we have concluded that further provision is needed in respect of those who lose their homes as a result of compulsory purchase. Such people are of course compensated on the basis of the market value of their interest in the property and will continue also to be reimbursed in respect of their incidental expenses such as professional fees and removal costs. However, compensation purely for financial loss takes no account of the personal distress which can arise when someone is forced to move from his home in these circumstances. The additional home loss payment to which displaced householders are normally entitled helps.<lb/>
Clauses 47 and 49 provide a fairer approach by modifying the home loss payment rules so that in future owner-occupiers receive a straight percentage of the value of their property. This we propose should be 10 per cent., subject to a minimum of &#x00A3;1,500 and a maximum of &#x00A3;15,000. The payment for non-owner occupiers will remain at a flat rate of &#x00A3;1,500. However, we are reducing the residence qualification for all claimants from five years down to one, which will substantially increase the number of people entitled to payments. We are also broadening the entitlement in a number of other respects&#x2014;for example, to include those whose homes are acquired under the statutory
<col>912</col>
blight procedure. These changes are so significant that we have provided for them to take effect from 16th November, the day following the Bill's introduction in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I shall not at this stage go into detail on the other compensation provisions. They include, for instance, an extension of authorities' powers to purchase properties which are likely to be badly affected by public works and a significant broadening of entitlement to interest on compensation. No doubt we shall have an opportunity to look at these matters more closely when we reach Committee stage. It may be helpful to your Lordships if I say that for that stage we intend to bring forward certain additional provisions on compensation which because of their complexity are unfortunately not yet complete. One of these provisions will provide for additional compensation to owners in cases where the value of land increases as a result of a planning permission granted after compulsory acquisition. This provision, which involves the revival, with some amendments, of Part IV of the Land Compensation Act 1961, will be substantial. We shall ensure that your Lordships are given adequate time to study these provisions and that appropriate briefing notes are made available. I personally undertake to write to noble Lords on all Benches with as early notice as possible of both the amendment and explanatory notes to that amendment.<lb/>
As I have said, our main aim in the compensation provisions has been to make the system fairer. If these provisions also have the result of making people less inclined to oppose necessary public development projects so that those projects are less subject to delay, that will be an additional justification. Indeed, this is an instance when the interests of fairness and efficiency are not in conflict.<lb/>
This Bill applies to England, Wales and Scotland. I have sought to mention the Scottish clauses along with their counterparts for England and Wales. I have also already briefly described Clause 41, which is the only Scottish provision in the Bill which does not reflect provisions for England and Wales.<lb/>
On the other hand, I should draw your Lordships' attention to a number of areas in which there are no such parallel Scottish measures. Principal among those are the provisons for streamlining the development plan system, since the framework for that system in Scotland differs from England and Wales. The existing Scottish system works well, with complete structure plan coverage and 80 per cent. of local plans either adopted or already finalised. The time taken in preparing and processing structure plans has been halved in the last five years. We therefore propose to retain the existing regime unamended.<lb/>
Because the planning framework and planning practice differ in Scotland, we have concluded that no Scottish provision is needed in relation to some of the development control provisions, including those concerning planning obligations, local authorities' own developments, applications relating to county matters and the operation of the award of costs in appeal cases. The Bill also contains no Scottish
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0496"/>
<col>913</col>
provision relating to simplified planning zones or to the procedures involved in applications for planning permission. These have been the subject of recent public consultations, the outcome of which I would not want to prejudge.<lb/>
With the particular exceptions that I have mentioned, our general intention is to have our proposals take effect both north and south of the Border. Where the Bill does not yet achieve this we shall be bringing forward appropriate amendments.<lb/>
Fairness and efficiency are the themes of the Bill as a whole. We have consulted widely on its provisions and in the light of the responses received to those consultations we believe that our proposals command wide acceptance. Some respondents would have liked us to go further in one direction or another but the Government consider that the proposals in the Bill strike the right balance.<lb/>
I began this speech by remarking on the value of the planning system as an instrument for resolving difficult questions about land use. This Bill is designed to make the instrument work better. That is something we all want and it is in that spirit I commend the Bill to the House.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Baroness Blotch.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04337">3.31 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04338"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for the lucid way in which she expounded the major provisions of the Bill. It has been widely greeted as an uncontroversial Bill. I suggest to your Lordships that it is as remarkable for what it does not include as for what it does. That which it does not include takes two forms.<lb/>
First, we are glad that it does not include the widespread attack on land use planning and strategic land use planning which existed in Right-wing circles not many years ago. It was only in the early 1980s that government discouraged local authorities from producing local and structure plans unless they were essential for development purposes. We are pleased to see that the Minister and the Government have recognised the value of strategic land use planning and are now proposing that strategic land use plans and local plans be extended as rapidly as possible to cover the whole country. That is in accordance with the thinking in local authority and economic circles that has existed since the war and in some cases before then. After all, it was Lewis Silkin who in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 set the first framework for planning in this country.<lb/>
I turn now to the other aspect which is not included in the Bill. It is remarkable that planning legislation has been relatively stable compared with many other aspects of social policy. This Government in particular have found it necessary to bring forward almost annually Bills attacking local government and altering housing legislation. By comparison our planning legislation has been stable. The legislators of the 1968 Act are to be congratulated on the fact that this Bill is the first major revision of that legislation. It also shows that in many respects, which I do not
<col>914</col>
intend to minimise, land use planning is a matter of cross-party agreement on all sides of the House. We are pleased that the Bill does not contain the wilder attacks on strategic planning which have been expressed in some circles in recent years. We are also pleased that in this respect, if in no other, the Government have returned to consensus politics.<lb/>
There are two possible ways of looking at strategic planning. The first is a concern for development and the efficiency and economy of the process. That concern is paramount in the Government's minds in drafting the Bill. The second is concern for environmental protection. Again I pay tribute to the Government's environmental protection White Paper published in September which made clear that strategic planning is an essential tool of environmental protection. Those two aspects are not necessarily in conflict. However, in looking at the legislation that is required to reform the planning process we should have in mind the needs of the development process and environmental protection.<lb/>
With the exception of specific occasions, our approach to the Bill will not be to attack its proposals as regards enforcement and compensation. We certainly shall not attack those parts which seek to make enforcement and development control procedures more effective than they are now. However, our approach will be to seek to ensure that environmental considerations come to the forefront of the consideration of planning authorities, developers and all others concerned with the use of the precious land in this country.<lb/>
In considering environmental protection we shall be dealing with a number of specific points which are not included in the Bill but which must be introduced by way of amendment. For example, the Bill contains no reference to environmental assessment. Noble Lords who are aware of what is happening outside Winchester will know that the proposals put forward by the Department of Transport to drive a road through Twyford Down have gone to Brussels on the grounds that there was inadequate environmental assessment. We do not know the result of the case, but lying behind British law there is a requirement of the European Community that there should be environmental assessment for all major development programmes. The question that we must ask is why the opportunity was not taken to introduce that desirable concept into planning law. This is the first major planning Bill for more than 20 years. Surely it would have been possible to include that concept in the planning procedures and provide in the Bill that planning authorities must take account of their environmental assessment duties.<lb/>
Secondly, an issue that has come to the fore in recent years has been the need for better public participation in the planning process. Too often our planning process has been seen to be a private duel between local authorities and developers. It is not even a requirement on local authorities to notify the neighbours or surrounding occupiers of land which is the subject of a planning application. However, most local authorities, and all the good authorities, do so as
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0497"/>
<col>915</col>
a matter of course. Surely in drafting the Bill the opportunity should have been taken to introduce public participation as a statutory right. Surely, the opportunity should have been taken to ensure that not only notification in advance but participation in the process is available to everyone concerned with the use of the land in the area.<lb/>
Thirdly, there is the issue of the scope of the planning laws. There are too many exceptions to our existing planning laws. The main exception is agriculture and forestry, but I do not suggest that all changes of use under those headings should be brought under planning control. However, as our agriculture and forestry needs alter, some of those changes should be brought under planning control. The local planning planning authorities should have the opportunity to consider, for example, what happens to agricultural buildings&#x2014;not merely those of historical interest but those whose existing use is no longer relevant. Therefore, in that respect we shall seek to extend the scope of planning legislation.<lb/>
We shall seek also to eliminate some of the less justifiable exclusions from the Bill, notably urban development corporations. We shall seek to see to it that proper consideration is given to the specific needs of national parks, of national nature reserves, of the statutory obligations of the National Rivers Authority, of areas of outstanding natural beauty, of sites of special scientific interests and so on. While there is provision in legislation for overall plans by the national parks authorities, we believe that that could be strengthened with advantage.<lb/>
Therefore, there are many ways in which environmental considerations, in line with the Government's own statement of intent in their September White Paper, could and should be brought within the scope of the Bill.<lb/>
I want now to deal with some specific problems, not all of which have ready answers. However, they should be debated when considering this Bill. Of course, enforcement occupies a major part of the Bill and we welcome nearly all of the provisions which are made for improved enforcement. There are exceptions which are still unclear but it would not be valuable for me to go into a great deal of detail about those.<lb/>
As regards the whole issue of planning gain under Section 106, which local authorities still think of as Section 52, we welcome much of the provision made in the Bill and we particularly welcome what the Minister has just said; namely, that an amendment will be introduced to permit involvement of the Crown in those undertakings. However, we are very worried about one particular provision; that is, that developers will be able not only to negotiate planning agreements with local authorities but also to enter into unilateral undertakings which will be a material consideration in any appeal to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
There are many difficulties about such unilateral undertakings. The first is that local authorities will be excluded in the formulation of those unilateral undertakings. That is what "unilateral" means.
<col>916</col>
However they will not be excluded from their enforcement. Therefore, they will have to enforce undertakings to which they have not been party. Those undertakings are unlikely to pay adequate attention to the land use issues for which local authorities are responsible. They will not pay adequate attention to the complementary provision which may be required from a local authority to take advantage of the undertakings made by developers.<lb/>
For example, if a developer says, in order to obtain planning permission, that he is prepared to provide land for public open space, that sounds very well but a local authority must maintain that. That will involve expenditure. If he is to provide an access road, that sounds very well but the access road must be maintained by a local authority and the local authority must be sure that the access road is in the right place and is not damaging in other ways. Under the unilateral undertaking proposal, there is no provision for local authorities to perform their real duties in relation to development plans and to the kind of development which will be the subject of the old Section 52 agreement. Therefore, we shall certainly seek major modifications, if not the total elimination of those proposals for unilateral undertakings.<lb/>
A major cause of anxiety will always be the issue of deemed consent; that is, consent where the local authority owns the land and gives itself permission for some change of use. Some of the more damaging proposals which had been suggested on that subject are not included in the Bill and we are grateful for that. Certainly, the provision that a county council should have to seek consent from the relevant district council where a change of use of county land is proposed, and in particular when the change runs counter to the local plan, is of considerable value.<lb/>
Again, there is the problem that the restrictions on deemed consent do not apply to urban development corporations. We would wish that anomaly to be removed.<lb/>
However, there is a particular difficulty as regards metropolitan borough councils and district councils. They are the local planning authorities and have virtually all the powers and responsibilities. They must see to it that what they do with their own land conforms with what their own formulated and published plans provide.<lb/>
There seem to me to be only two ways to deal with that. The first, by stipulating that any development of that sort must be referred to the Secretary of State or to a third party, would give rise to a quite intolerable degree of centralisation. In effect that would mean that a district council would not be master in its own house.<lb/>
The other approach, which I prefer and which I think should be provided for in the Bill, is that there should be a measure of self regulation in the use of deemed planning consent. For example, there could be a requirement that the deemed planning consent should be given only after the matter has been considered by committees other than the user committee of the land. It could be a requirement that
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0498"/>
<col>917</col>
it should be considered only by the full council so that all interests concerned can be taken into account. It could well be a requirement that there should be particularly stringent requirements for public consultation when deemed planning consent is under consideration. It should certainly be a requirement that there should be a code of practice, possibly even a statutory code of practice, to make sure that there was no abuse of deemed planning consent.<lb/>
Another issue to which there is no easy answer, although it arises very strongly from the part of the Bill which is concerned with enforcement procedures, is criminalisation. That is a horrible word. However, here we are talking about the difference between making it an offence to carry out a development which is in conflict with planning permission and, as the Bill proposes, making it an offence to be in breach of an enforcement order.<lb/>
Let there be no mistake that the enforcement order procedure is better than that which we have at present. We believe this to be an improvement on existing provisions and we shall not oppose enforcement procedures. However, the Bill states that a local authority has a discretion as to whether to undertake enforcement. That has led some people, particularly in the town planning profession, to suggest that we do not require a voluntary discretionary enforcement procedure but compulsory enforcement procedures on local authorities. Those people argue&#x2014;and I see the point&#x2014;that in the end that would be a better use of local authority resources than the consideration which must be given now as to whether to go in for enforcement orders.<lb/>
The other approach which has been urged on us by quite a number of people, and which has considerable merit, is to say that it should be the non-conforming development which forms the offence. An analogy is given with building regulations, whereby it immediately becomes an offence to build something which is in conflict with the building regulations. In that case one need not wait for an enforcement order but one can prosecute immediately. I am not sure that the balance of that argument has been fully explored or that we are in a position to come to a conclusion about the matter. However, we can be sure that it will be a subject for debate in Committee and that noble Lords representing particular interests will wish to bring it to the attention of the House.<lb/>
I referred to the issue of public participation; I do not believe I need go over the ground again. There is still debate regarding compensation. We welcome the provision for increasing home loss payments. We are fully aware of the danger that in going too far along that road we may be damaging development rather than protecting conservation. At the same time, once a development has been agreed it is better that it should be completed quickly and painlessly rather than over a protracted period of time. Therefore we welcome the home loss payments that are proposed.<lb/>
We question whether the payments go far enough. In France, which has a reputation for sometimes riding roughshod over local opinion but more often for buying local opinion in favour of what it is trying
<col>918</col>
to do, there are compensatory payments of 20 or even 25 per cent. of the market value of the property. That certainly means that matters proceed more quickly. It may mean that there is a saving. Delays in major construction programmes are very expensive. Increased payments however expensive they may be&#x2014;I note the provision of &#x00A3;50 million for that in the Bill&#x2014;may be cheaper than unnecessary de lays in carrying out developments already agreed.<lb/>
Above all we want to examine the whole issue of structure and local plans. I have said how much we on these Benches welcome the Government's determination to see that structure plans and local plans cover the whole of the country as quickly as possible. We believe that at the same time we should be using those plans to better effect. The issue of whether or not a proposed development conforms to a plan should be a major consideration in whether planning procedures are eased or not. For example, whether a development is or is not in conformity with the local structure plan, the two must be in conformity with each other. If the development is in conformity it should go through more quickly and rights of appeal should perhaps be curtailed. Where it is not in conformity with the local plan extra obstacles should be placed upon it.<lb/>
Rights of appeal should be extended possibly even to the extent of there being a limited right of appeal against planning permission which has been granted; for example, a right of appeal to those who have been statutorily consulted in the planning process. That could include a parish council or town hall community council, the National Rivers Authority, the authorities of national parks or other organisations which must be consulted on the procedure and which, I suggest, should have a right to appeal when their representations are not given adequate consideration. In all those respects the existence of a complete network of plans is to be welcomed. But we must find ways of making those plans more effective than the Bill at present provides.<lb/>
The final issue which I wish to consider briefly is one which still comes up in the Government's thinking, whether or not they want it. It concerns the tendency towards greater centralisation. I mentioned urban development corporations. It may be that on occasion they have been instituted with the agreement of the local authorities concerned. They perhaps saw no other way of obtaining the money necessary to do the work in their area. Nevertheless, is it not now the case that the exemption from planning control given to urban development corporations has, to say the least, run its time? Perhaps we should now establish a time limit within which we shall get rid of it, making our structure and local plans complete rather than having black holes in them.<lb/>
Perhaps we should be taking the opportunity in Part I to reduce the role of the Secretary of State in regard to structure and local plans. It is possible that a Secretary of State of ill will&#x2014;I do not suggest the present Secretary of State is such a person&#x2014;could limit Part I in such a way that it was concerned only with land use planning and could not be concerned
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0499"/>
<col>919</col>
with other issues such as transport energy consumption, the viability of the local economy and so on. Perhaps now is the time for the Secretary of State to abandon the idea of regional planning guidance. Why should there not be encouragement, even, if necessary, enforcement, to see that local authorities get together in regional groups and produce their own regional plans which would be their own responsibility and not subject to the whim of the Secretary of State. It is wrong for such regional planning to come down from Marsham Street rather than being the responsibility of the local authorities in the area.<lb/>
I have taken up too much of your Lordships' time. There are other examples of centralisation. All I say is that where we find it on the face of the Bill we shall seek to eliminate it. In many ways the Bill, as described by the Minister in her opening speech, is a good Bill. Many parts of it will deserve and receive the support of noble Lords on these Benches. What is sad is the extent to which opportunities have been missed to make it a great Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04339">3.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04340"><member>Lord Ross of Newport</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I also thank the Minister for her explanation and welcome her indication of further amendments which, on the whole, we look forward to; they appear to be on the right lines. It is a Bill which for the most part appears to command almost universal approval among the various interested bodies. I suspect the Minister must be greatly relieved, following her ordeals with Part VII of the Environmental Protection Act, that this Bill is not so controversial.<lb/>
Planning at both local and county level is once again in favour, following four or more years of virtual blight during the course of which many experienced local planning officers either moved into the private sector or sought early retirement. While there are, no doubt, many excellent qualified people around&#x2014;there is a lot of redundancy in the professions at the moment&#x2014;who could be attracted back into local authority planning departments, the ability of the authorities adequately to finance such appointments and obtain the best people to take them up must be questioned, threatened as they are with charge-capping. That is a serious point.<lb/>
I know the Minister has great experience of local government. My knowledge of the situation is that it is not always easy to ensure that planning departments are adequately staffed. Too many experienced people have left, completely and utterly worn out and dispirited by what has happened over the past few years. That is just one of the many legacies of the former Secretary of State for the Environment.<lb/>
If enforcement is to succeed extra manpower will be needed. Of course I want it to succeed. One would have liked the scope of the Bill to be wider, particularly in respect of compulsory acquisition and the current code of practice regarding compensation. As a chartered surveyor practising 16 years ago on an offshore island I cannot claim much personal experience of major road and rail schemes. They were
<col>920</col>
not exactly the order of the day in the Isle of Wight, though that may be about to change. However, I know how bitter some owner occupiers may feel when their home or part of it is injuriously affected or due to be acquired through a compulsory purchase order.<lb/>
For many years in the other place I was pursued by a freeholder from Kent&#x2014;nothing whatever to do with the Channel Tunnel scheme&#x2014;who felt that he had been robbed of his home and his wife; she died during the course of the very protracted negotiations. To add insult to injury his property, having been acquired at a figure he thought was derisory, was not in the end demolished due to a change in the road scheme. The Minister spoke in those terms and I sympathise with what she said.<lb/>
At that time I initiated some research into what could be done to improve matters. For a Private Member's Bill, it is a far too complicated subject. Although I prepared a short three clause Bill I never had the opportunity to present it, and I do not believe it would have made much progress if I had. However, as the Minister said, in April 1989 the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors published a detailed case for simplifying and strengthening the compensation code. One or two of those recommendations, as was rightly indicated, appear in the Bill, particularly the clauses relating to blight. I would, however, be interested to know whether any further changes are envisaged, perhaps in future legislation or amendments to this Bill, following those representations by the RICS and others. They are well thought out and deserve a more serious response than we have had so far.<lb/>
The additional payment to home owners is very welcome. The fact that these payments will become operative immediately is a helpful and totally just decision. However, should not this concession be extended to all those whose property is compulsorily acquired and not just to home owners? For example, should not business premises be included, with their difficulty in moving staff, travel problems, compensation for people who lose their jobs, and so on? The Bill should be wider than it is but I recognise that the Government have gone a long way in this direction and are therefore to be congratulated.<lb/>
As one who strongly opposed the whole introduction of charges for planning applications when they were introduced in the other place&#x2014;I sat on the Committee&#x2014;I must say that I still feel that they are wrong in principle, more particularly now as they are of a substantial nature in some cases. I am grateful that at least the Government have not come forward with the proposed charges for planning appeals. That proposal has been abandoned, and I am grateful for that.<lb/>
I also very much agree with the two-year moratorium, but I am not entirely clear on the explanation given. Will it enable an applicant to go back to the local authority within the two years and try his luck again? The authority can say, "No, we are turning this down because it was turned down on appeal so many months ago", but he can come forward again with the application. I suggest that he
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0500"/>
<col>921</col>
should not be allowed to come forward with a planning application of any kind on that property while the two-year moratorium exists. To do so would be wasting time.<lb/>
I have seen cases which have staggered me. In one case a farmer was turned down on a local application for converting a barn into private residences. He failed on appeal but a year later he was selling properties for over &#x00A3;80,000, having gone back again and obtained permission. He must have twisted somebody's arm, but he succeeded. I do not think that he should have been allowed to do that. The local protection societies, the CPRE and other organisations, may possibly have attended the appeal and may even have instructed solicitors or counsel, but they suddenly find that all the arguments that they won on appeal have subsequently failed. Therefore, an amendment to deal with that aspect could be dealt with in Committee. Nevertheless, the moratorium is to be welcomed and it is long overdue. Incidentally, the RSPB would like to see a five-year moratorium.<lb/>
I am pleased to see that changes are proposed for applications made by local authorities in respect of land in their own ownership. I have never thought that to be right. It is an invitation to create financial resources for all the wrong reasons and should have been dealt with long ago. However, I still believe that the proposed regulations as outlined in the Bill do not appear to be strict enough, so I hope that we shall be able to stiffen up this part of the Bill in Committee.<lb/>
For my part, as one who supports the introduction of a regional tier of administration for England, I would leave decisions on such matters to such a tier, but I agree that it is a difficult area. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to the matter and I have some sympathy for his suggestion that regional structures, with a number of local authorities and counties getting together, might be one way of dealing with the matter. It is not an easy problem.<lb/>
I hope that I may be pertinent by saying that one of the contenders for the Prime Ministership&#x2014;I suspect it will be Mr. Heseltine&#x2014;has some interesting ideas for the future of local government which I totally support. His ideas for a directly elected chief executive is exactly on the right lines. That would give some power back to the towns and counties of this land.<lb/>
My colleague, my noble friend Lord Hampton, has a Motion down for debate on Wednesday week relating to problems of land use in Britain today. The subject is rightly exercising the minds of many professionals and politicians at present. Incidentally, it is to be featured by the National Housing Forum in National Housing Week next year. I happen to chair that organisation.<lb/>
In a recent important discussion paper the Town and Country Planning Association reminds us that during the last decade the regional economic planning councils have been abolished and the presumed role of the former metropolitan authorities has been left vacant. Apart from some regional guidance notes, there has been no update in the strategic plans for many parts of the country, including the North West
<col>922</col>
and, for that matter, London and the South East. That is particularly important and pertinent and goes back to 1970.<lb/>
The RICS has responded to the TCPA paper only this morning, and I have received a copy. The response endorses the concept put forward in the paper, though it makes some corrections. The RICS confirms the view that there needs to be strategic thinking and planning at all levels, including a European dimension, so that planning becomes more than a purely reactive process. It is the form of guidance which gives rise to the problem. Perhaps this is taking us into a field which ought to have been covered in the White Paper on the environment and is beyond the remit of this Bill; though I very much agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, on the lack of any provision for environmental assessments. I hope that that, even now, might be taken on board.<lb/>
Nevertheless, the intention of streamlining the county structure plans is a real step in the right direction and we must be grateful at least for that. However, I give notice that we intend to table amendments in Committee covering some of these matters at least in regard to London, the SSSIs and coastal zone planning. Here, I must refer back to some of the issues raised during the passage of the Environmental Protection Act, particularly in regard to SSSIs. I apologise for doing so, but it is an area which could be covered in this Bill.<lb/>
A brief given to me by the RSPB states that the NCC's 16th annual report is to be published tomorrow and it shows that over 4,000 acres of SSSI land were damaged by developments where planning permission had been granted. Perhaps we can do something in this Bill about that situation. I am told&#x2014;I have to be very careful when speaking about Scottish matters and I notice that the Minister was also somewhat cautious&#x2014;that under Scottish planning regulations any unresolved objections by the Nature Conservancy Council relating to planning proposals affecting certain kinds of SSSIs are to be referred to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The RSPB would welcome an amendment to the Bill which applies the call-in procedure for unresolved objections on any SSSI in the whole of Great Britain. That would enable development proposals affecting an SSSI to be considered in a national and international context.<lb/>
The report points out&#x2014;and I know this very well, now that I live in Shropshire&#x2014;that the NCC has spent some &#x00A3;1.6 million to purchase the Fens and Whixal Mosses SSSI in north Shropshire. In fact, I believe they are mostly in Clwyd in North Wales. That kind of expenditure might not have been needed if we had regulations providing a mechanism for reviewing planning permissions prior to the notification of an SSSI and providing funds to local authorities to enable them to compensate owners following withdrawal of planning permission.<lb/>
There is a serious case at present in South Wales&#x2014;whether this Bill will cover it, I do not know&#x2014;where local residents and small farmers have found that a nationally known minerals company is claiming that it has the right to extract minerals from all over their
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0501"/>
<col>923</col>
land arising from a consent given well prior to 1947. The case is going to the High Court and I made a contribution to the appeal made by those who are fighting it. Perhaps that situation could have been dealt with in the Bill. The situation is grossly unfair. The right of extraction did not appear in any of the searches when the people purchased their land. The lawyers and the local authorities are not to blame and it is wrong that the situation should exist.<lb/>
I also hope to table amendments in regard to coastal zone planning. This matter is of great concern to the country. Again, I understand that the Nature Conservancy Council, before it ceases operations in a Great Britain context, will be publishing a document on the subject, possibly in January. We should like to see a new clause in the Bill which places a duty on local authorities who border coastal and estuarine areas to prepare coastal zone plans to promote the sustainable use of the coasts and foreshores in the area. The pressure in that respect is now off because developers are now rather more cautious about the way they spend their money, but at one time there was an enormous number of applications for marinas, and so on, on our estuaries and coastal areas and there is great concern about the future.<lb/>
I have some sympathy for Clause 12 regarding planning agreements, but that could be abused with last minute attractive concessions being offered at planning appeals. One can envisage a form of plea bargaining in US terms. I agree that planning gain can produce excellent facilities for local organisations and provide receipts for local government.<lb/>
There was a case in my old town of Newport, on the Isle of Wight, where we had a brand new football pitch, a marvellous shopping area and about 70 or 80 acres given to the local authority. It worked extremely well and the local authority got what it wanted. However, it had to be properly tied up, which it was. Such schemes must be legally backed and adequate resources made available. That is one of the difficulties of these kinds of bargain. I certainly welcome the amendment which the Minister announced to the effect that Crown land is to be included in these provisions. I realise that in opposition one will always say that a Bill does not go far enough. However, this measure already has 55 clauses and 11 schedules so it is more than a minor Bill. I hope that during the Committee stage we shall make it into a major Bill. I welcome the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04342"><member>Lord Northbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intend to speak briefly to lay down markers in relation to certain amendments that will be tabled to Clauses 47 and 48, which relate to compensation. I apologise to the House in advance because I may have to leave before the end of the debate. I shall read the noble Baroness's summing-up with care if I have to leave.<lb/>
In a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller a price is agreed on the basis of three factors&#x2014;the existing use value, the hope value and what the noble Baroness has described as the personal
<col>924</col>
distress value of having to make a sale in certain cases. The main burden of compulsory compensation relates only to existing use value. There are provisions in the Land Compensation Act 1973 for covering the cost of displacement in relation to farms, businesses and other kinds of land. There is no provision for covering the development and hope value of the land under compulsory purchase or for personal distress value, except in so far as happily the Government have agreed to the principle of an increased level of home loss payments.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, has already asked whether there is justification for other kinds of loss payments such as farm loss. I believe that he also mentioned business loss payments. In the case of farms and woodlands there is an attachment which would make a reasonable vendor unwilling in many cases to sell at an existing use value.<lb/>
There is a more serious injustice than that. Land which is compulsorily purchased is often not entirely used to provide a public service for the use of a statutory undertaker. Often parts of the land are used for commercial activities. We all accept that compulsory purchase is absolutely necessary so that various activities can take place for the public good. Surely it is not intended to give windfall profits to commercial enterprises or that compulsory purchase should be used as a tool for cheating landowners of the benefits of the development value which they could reasonably have anticipated.<lb/>
Therefore, amendments will be tabled at Committee stage relating to land loss payments along the lines of the home loss payments, which will include an extension to farms and woodlands. Amendments will also be set down relating to land acquired by compulsory purchase order on behalf of a commercial enterprise, the whole or a part of which will be used for such an enterprise, suggesting that the vendor should in some way participate in the added value as well as the existing use value.<lb/>
Another amendment is being suggested, although it may be overtaken by a government amendment to which the noble Baroness referred, to the effect that within five years of acquisition, if planning permission is granted for certain kinds of development, additional compensation should be payable.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04344"><member>Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who over the past 30 years has suffered considerable problems with the eccentricities of planning and the resulting delays, I welcome this Bill. In declaring my interest as chairman of English Heritage, I note that the Bill is primarily concerned with mainstream planning and not at all with heritage protection. Therefore, while it does not provide an entirely appropriate home for heritage amendments, there are four points concerning the man-built environment which I wish to raise this afternoon. I also give warning that I intend to introduce amendments at Committee stage which I hope will prove non-controversial and acceptable to all parts of the House and the Government.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0502"/>
<col>925</col>
My first point is to seek to amend the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953, which allows English Heritage to assist financially local authorities and the National Trust to acquire buildings so as to secure their preservation. This has worked reasonably well, but it has become increasingly clear over the past 10 years or more that the main agencies for rescuing derelict historic buildings have been the local and county historic building preservation trusts. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we would like to assist these excellent bodies to acquire important historic buildings, but as the law stands today we are unable to do so. Without this power our work in rescuing buildings at risk is very severely hampered.<lb/>
English Heritage would like to be in a position to assist financially any person or body concerned with the acquisition, restoration and preservation of what we regard as a suitable building. It may suffice simply to generalise the relevant section of the 1953 Act by removing the reference to the National Trust and substituting a reference to "any person" or to "any building preservation trust".<lb/>
My second point concerns enforcement. My proposal would be to amend Section 38 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 which empowers a local planning authority to serve an enforcement notice where damaging works are being or have been carried out on a listed building without listed building consent. This power is used when an owner is removing doors, windows or whatever and thereby destroying the character of a building which is on the Goverment's list of protected buildings.<lb/>
However, as the law stands, the notice has no effect for 28 days after it has been served. Therefore, for 28 days the owner may legally continue with his destructive activities, and often does. English Heritage feels very strongly that it is essential to amend Section 38 to give immediate effect to the enforcement notice. In view of the irreversible nature of the damage which is likely to be caused to listed buildings by unauthorised works, and sometimes the undoubted advantages to the owner or the developer who wants to destroy a building, we consider that a Section 38 enforcement notice should require that the work to which it relates ceases on the date on which the notice is served and that there should be no right of compensation.<lb/>
My third proposed amendment is to Section 89 of the same Act which empowers local planning authorities and the Secretary of State to require the occupier of any premises to give information, including the names and addresses of all persons having an interest in the premises, to enable the service of a notice or an order under the provisions of the Act. However, historically such notices are not applicable in London. English Heritage requires this power in order to exercise a range of functions under the Act which have been conferred on it in greater London. We have in mind a simple amendment giving English Heritage Section 89 powers in London so that, for example, when we propose to take action over the
<col>926</col>
state of a particular historic building we may readily discover the names and addresses of the persons we should be pursuing.<lb/>
Lastly, I shall seek to move an amendment to the National Heritage Act 1983. That is the Act which set up English Heritage. As noble Lords will know, the official title is the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England. One of our principal duties, laid down by Parliament, is to secure the preservation of historic buildings and ancient monuments. That fact alone should justify giving power to English Heritage to bring legal proceedings in its own name. When English Heritage was first established, we also assumed that the right to initiate legal proceedings was implicit in the nature of the duties imposed upon us. However, after taking legal advice, we soon discovered that we were wrong in that assumption.<lb/>
The weapons available to us to defend the built heritage are varied and many; but the absence of this particular weapon from our armoury has proved to be a serious deficiency. What we have in mind is an amendment to Clause 33 giving English Heritage a power to seek injunctions and a general power to prosecute where it appears that unauthorised works have been or are being carried out to a listed building.<lb/>
Perhaps I may remind noble Lords that such powers are already conferred on local authorities by Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972. English Heritage, for its part, would seek to exercise the powers either jointly in collaboration with a local authority or, as would be necessary on occasions, in default of action by a local authority.<lb/>
When we reach the Committee stage, I hope that the Government will look sympathetically on these amendments and that the House will support them. The amendments are not fundamental, but they will certainly help English Heritage to do a better job, which I am sure is the wish of the whole House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04345">4.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04346"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, planning legislation is the ultimate expression of any government's attitude towards the environment. If the provisions in legislation are sensible, clear, comprehensive and are supported by strong sanctions against abuse, then it can be assumed that the intentions of the legislators are firm, clear and determined. General statements of intent are all very well, but it is the planning system which has to guide development, settle conflicts and ultimately ensure that we live in a sympathetic environment, whether that be in the town or in the country. In our over-crowded country it is planning control, or lack of it, which will determine our landscape, our supporting infrastructure and even the survival of our wildlife.<lb/>
The Government's White Paper <i>This Common Inheritance</i> endorses the principle of sustainable development. It is therefore disappointing that the Bill seems more concerned with efficiency in terms of speed of decision making and financial control than with an environmentally sound result. I welcome the measures to simplify and improve the provisions for the enforcement of planning control, as set out in Clauses
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0503"/>
<col>927</col>
1 to 11. As my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey said so eloquently, it is in everyone's interest that breaches should be avoided, and the existence of strong powers backed by appropriate sanctions is a useful deterrent. But it must be mandatory on local authorities to take action once a breach is identified, otherwise the sanctions become meaningless.<lb/>
There is a need to enhance the status of development plans. In 1988&#x2013;89 37 per cent. of all appeals were successful in overturning local authority decisions. The Bill should identify development plans as the primary material consideration in determining applications and appeals. That view is supported by the Council for the Protection of Rural England. It also believes that there should be a more positive approach to the issue of the awards of costs on planning inquiries. In its briefing the CPRE says that there should be,
<quote>"an expansion of the procedures to allow costs to be awarded against appellants who withdraw before a public inquiry opens. CPRE is greatly concerned by the current imbalance in the costs procedures. Between 1987 and 1990 local authorities were 6.5 times more likely to have costs awarded against them than appellants".</quote>
The implications of that statement in local authority terms are very clear.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord McIntosh said, it is important that structure plans and local plans should not be in conflict. That may appear to be stating the obvious but there have been occasions when local plans were issued with a certificate of compliance when this was clearly incorrect. Procedures for the examination of applications must be improved. There is a need to achieve a stronger and more coherent approach to nature conservation in the production of all development plans. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has recently completed a study of development plans in England and Wales. It analysed 56 county structure plans for nature conservation implications and it uncovered many shortcomings. The report (which I recommend to your Lordships for some weekend reading) reveals unevenness of approach between counties.<lb/>
Even sites with important designations, such as sites of special scientific interest, special protection areas and RAMSAR sites, were not assured of a consistent level of protection, and very few counties committed themselves to active conservation measures. Clearly there is a need to raise the profile of nature conservation and to try to achieve some equality of approach between authorities. We have been at pains to establish consistent criteria for the designation of important sites. We had long debates on this subject during the passage of Part VII of the Environmental Protection Bill. This effort will be wasted if consistency of planning protection is not available.<lb/>
I turn finally to marine areas. In her opening speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, mentioned coastal areas. I have been unable to find the relevant provisions in the Bill but I am sure the noble Baroness will tell me where they are. During the Report stage of the Environmental Protection Bill I introduced an
<col>928</col>
amendment (at col. 967 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 17th October 1990) which highlighted the need for coastline local authorities to introduce coastal zone plans. The amendment gained support from all sides of the House and was responded to sympathetically by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, who answered for the Government on that occasion. She indicated that a review of existing legislation on the marine environment was to be undertaken. This Bill could provide a vehicle for making a start on the unified approach which seems to be required. The Marine Conservation Society has produced a valuable report on the need to find a coherent way to protect the coast and coastal waters. In Committee I intend to pursue some of its suggestions which I hope will be acceptable to the Government.<lb/>
The Bill provides a rare opportunity to give substance to the Government's many statements about their concern for environmental conservation. We intend to suggest possible improvements in Committee and I hope that many of them will be acceptable to the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04347">4.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04348"><member>Lord Wade of Chorlton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is something of a coincidence that I should speak after the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, who is a delightful person. My emphasis in regard to the Bill will be different from hers. She has emphasised the need for the Bill to protect the environment. What I look for in a Bill of this kind is the encouragement of investment and development.<lb/>
The noble Baroness seeks to encourage environmental protection, although we probably do not differ so very much about that. I am anxious that we should use planning legislation to encourage rather than to discourage. Those who should decide on these matters are the district councils and the county councils. They will respond to the desires of their areas. As we hear different views on how towns and the rural economy should develop, we may very well find differing views in some county council and district council areas.<lb/>
People can now come and go more easily. Over the coming years there will be a tendency for some people to live in areas which encourage development and investment, and for others to live in those areas where there are wide open spaces and where the pace of life is a great deal slower. The people to decide that are, above all, the local authorities for the areas in which those people live, who represent, through elections, what people want to do. So I welcome the first part of this Bill relating to the power of local authorities to make their own decisions, and to those decisions not having to be made by the Minister.<lb/>
I have been one of those who have been unhappy about strategic structural plans. When I was a member of the Cheshire County Council in the early 1970s, I was involved in the formulation of that strategic structural plan which turned out to be exactly the opposite of what was wanted. That was because no one could tell in the early 1970s how matters would develop over the next 20 years. The effect was that that structural plan was set in aspic, by people who
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0504"/>
<col>929</col>
thought they knew what would happen, which caused many problems. So in addition to having structural plans which are the responsibility of the local authority, I hope that the plans will be allowed to ebb and flow as circumstances change, because those plans must not be established in such a way that the local community cannot adapt to what they see as changing circumstances and needs.<lb/>
The other important aspect of this Bill is the compensatory sector. I have been a strong believer that compensation is something which we ought to encourage very much more. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to it, as did the noble Lord, Lord Ross; I agree strongly with them that there is room to improve; to increase the compensatory allowance; and possibly to include some more flexibility, so that people can be encouraged to agree with what a local authority wants to do.<lb/>
That would reduce the enormous delays that are now brought into our planning and development systems because of a very small minority using every possible nook and cranny to cause a delay about something which the vast majority of people want, and more importantly need, for the development of their area. I also strongly support the noble Lord, Lord Ross, in his suggestion that compensation should be widened to include more land and industrial uses, as well as other sections, because that is equally important.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to agriculture and the need to look at planning in that area. If any changes are made in that area, I should like to see farms understood to be industrial units, so that in the event of a farm having to close&#x2014;and we shall see a lot of this happening over the coming years &#x2014;there is an automatic assumption that those buildings can be used for another industrial purpose, though not for housing, in order to maintain the economic viability of an area in one form or another. Only last week we debated the rural economy and the need to develop more wealth-creating opportunities in rural communities. Through this Bill, and flexibility in the use of buildings and existing structures in the countryside, we can ensure that extra wealth and development.<lb/>
I welcome this Bill; but I should like to emphasise that if we move away from the system of having the Minister approve local plans and county council structure plans, we must make sure that he does not interfere and that counties are allowed to proceed quickly. We must also see that the suggestion that he can still intervene, should he feel it necessary, is not used as another delaying process which allows a small minority group to find excuses and to stop a local community from doing what is needed. I hope that through the compensatory system we can improve matters, and take away a lot of the other reasons for people delaying these activities.</membercontribution></p>
<col>930</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04349">4.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04350"><member>The Earl of Lytton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in this Bill, which I warmly welcome, we have a great number of aspects to deal with and I want to concentrate on just a few of them.<lb/>
So far as it goes, this Bill puts forward some very valuable new measures; but town and country planning must first be seen as a concept of good and efficient administration, and I question whether in all circumstances that is the case today.<lb/>
First, there are problems with designations of one sort or another: restrictions that are imposed on uses of land. Those are very often imposed without a great deal of cohesion or unity of purpose. They may be for genuine planning reasons, which is to be greatly applauded and strengthened. But equally many noble Lords will know of circumstances where restrictions of one sort or another, under the terms of the various current planning codes, are imposed with quite ulterior motives in mind; perhaps even to disinvent legal uses without compensation. So the system is capable of being adversely manipulated at present.<lb/>
In many instances there is inadequate provision for appeals to be dealt with against certain types of designation. I should like to quote one example under Section 3 of the Wildlife and Countryside (Amendment) Act, whereby land can be designated as Section 3 woodland, moorland or foreshore. There is provision for consultation, but there is no provision for any appeal against a designation which a landowner feels is distinctly unfair and incorrect.<lb/>
There is a tendency these days for there to be creeping preservation, and this Bill adds a certain amount to that. This militates against a fair balance between private proprietorial interests and the undoubted public interest element. Many noble Lords will be aware that there are conflicts of interest which potentially lurk for planning authorities in the discharge of their functions. These can be overcome, and in many ways local authorities strive very hard to avoid them and they do an excellent job. But, with respect, the self-administration of a local planning authority's own planning applications, which is not something that is covered under the terms of this Bill, is something which creates a good deal of public unease.<lb/>
Local authorities will have to decide whether they are to be impartial promoters of the public good, as indeed they should be, and eschew any suggestion that they should be acting in some way along the lines of a property company. I trust that I do not put it in too uncharitable words if I say that the public perception in many instances is that local authorities in certain areas do exactly that. Forward planning, which I believe this Bill attempts to encourage, is something to be warmly supported, and I welcome the improvements to the structure plan system. But I question a local planning authority's ability to respond, and particularly its resourcing of that aspect of its work.<lb/>
On planning agreements, a unilateral undertaking, as mentioned in the Bill, is of fairly limited utility. The point behind all this is surely to get this murky
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0505"/>
<col>931</col>
business of local planning authorities' shopping lists out of the closet so it can be seen quite clearly that they are for genuine planning purposes and are not being used as some cross-subsidy, some local tax, and therefore something which is not transparent&#x2014;to use a taxation term. In short, on planning there is a very great deal of anxiety in my mind as to whether public confidence in the fairness with which the system is being administered is being eroded by current practices.<lb/>
On compensation, there are some extremely good points which will go a long way to alleviate some of the worst injustices that have occurred over many years. I refer to the provisions on home loss payments and the blight provisions in particular. But there are difficulties with the fundamentals of assessing valuations, and the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Newport, touched on these. The Bill cannot overcome those. There are also some significant gaps in, for instance, the designations and controls (to which I referred earlier in my reference to planning) which can very often be imposed without any compensation being payable. I fear that this may get worse under the terms of the Bill rather than better.<lb/>
The restrictions may be restrictions on what would otherwise be legitimate, legal activities. The noble Lord, Lord Wade, referred to farming. I agree with him wholeheartedly that one has to accept that there are certain base uses and existing user rights which must be treated as touchstones which trigger compensation if they are infringed. I do not see that happening under the Bill or under any other proposals which have been laid before your Lordships' House.<lb/>
On the issue which has been already mentioned about the other uses to which land which is compulsory acquired may be put if it is not needed for the original purpose, I have to put down a marker that there is a difference between philanthropic aims directed towards society's need and the commercial aim of selling on land for vast profit. That is an injustice which must be remedied. It is an injustice which I see as being identified under the principles of the Crichel Down code. We should do well to carry forward that principle into the realms of compulsory acquisition and compensation. In short, land should be treated as if there were a perpetual covenant limiting its use to a purpose similar to that for which it was acquired.<lb/>
In general, the Bill makes some significant advances which I support, but it is a question of balance and obtaining public confidence in the measures placed before your Lordships, which I hope will become part of our statute law. The Bill underestimates the degree of unease felt about the planning and compensation system as a whole. It is a matter of restoring public confidence as well as achieving economic efficiency and the abolition of unfair practices. By that I include those who take the law into their own hands and do things on their land for which they have no planning consent, flout the regulations and run rings around local planning authorities. That is wrong, and I
<col>932</col>
deplore that type of activity. In applying additional restraints, the legitimate aspirations of private and company land ownership must be respected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04351">4.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04352"><member>Lord Norrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill allows us to look afresh at the planning system&#x2014;an opportunity that has not arisen for almost 20 years. It confirms the Government's commitment to the planning system as a way of resolving conflicts over development. It will help restore public confidence in a system which often fails to meet their expectations.<lb/>
We cannot underestimate the importance of the planning system to this crowded island. By providing a secure means of controlling the development and use of that scarcest of resources&#x2014;land&#x2014;it will ensure that it is used in the best public interest. Day in, day out, the planning system is working away to resolve conflicts, acting as a hidden quality control mechanism able to protect the countryside and improve the standards of development.<lb/>
Although I welcome the Bill, I am disappointed by its limited scope. It moves us in the right direction but lacks the positive vision required to match accelerating public concern for the environment.<lb/>
The planning system is not just about controlling development or protecting the countryside. It is central to what are popularly known as green issues. Through the tens of thousands of decisions the planning system makes each year it is a key mechanism for converting environmental concern into development which is sustainable. Perhaps the single most important aspect of the Bill is its proposal for the mandatory preparation of county structure and district local plans. That I welcome unreservedly. It will give us a complete planning framework for the first time. Only about one quarter of rural England (by population) has an adopted local plan at the moment.<lb/>
The benefits of 100 per cent. coverage are unquestionable, but, the Bill could do more to ensure that those plans are implemented once prepared. Public confidence in the planning system reaches its lowest ebb when structure and local plans, agreed after extensive public consultation, are seemingly ignored when dealing with individual planning applications or on appeal. Too often they appear to be but one of many considerations, instead of the central guiding framework for decisions. A simple amendment to identify development plans as the primary material consideration when dealing with applications and appeals would ensure that the true benefits of the Bill's proposals could be secured.<lb/>
I should also like to see a clearer recognition of the special position of national park authorities in the planning system. The Bill restricts them to the preparation of local plans and minerals plans for their area. That is a step forward, but they need to become joint structure plan authorities with their county council if they are to ensure firm protection of their special landscapes, otherwise our national parks will continue to be subject to damaging pressure from road and other developments beyond their boundaries and outside their control.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0506"/>
<col>933</col>
I turn now to the complex matter of enforcement. The Bill is a welcome response to mounting public and professional concern about the problems of enforcing planning control. It will simplify and strengthen the procedures. However, enforcement action remains discretionary, despite the frequent reluctance of local planning authorities to take action where clear breaches of control have occurred. The Bill should reduce that problem, but it does not go far enough.<lb/>
I believe that the enforcement of planning control should be compulsory. There is nothing more likely to bring the planning system into disrepute than success for those who disregard it. Compulsory enforcement would ensure that local authorities gave the necessary priority to enforcement work and, most importantly, it would reduce the workload on local authorities in the long term because of its deterrent effect. Breaches would he less likely to occur if those committing them knew that they would be tackled firmly by the local authorities, using the new powers being placed at their disposal in the Bill.<lb/>
I should like to reassure the House that that would not be a draconian measure. Similar requirements already exist under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 for the control of litter and the Control of Pollution Act 1974 for the control of nuisances. Moreover, enforcement action need not result in demolition or financial penalties if a retrospective planning application were to resolve the problem. Local authorities faced with a breach of planning control should be able to choose whether to take firm action or to treat the development as if it were a planning application. That would allow them to approve non-damaging developments, but ensure that they passed through the normal planning procedures.<lb/>
In the simplest case where a house, for instance, is built without planning permission, it is important that the local authority is required to acknowledge that a breach of the planning system has occurred and either to require a planning application or to take necessary enforcement action.<lb/>
I am afraid that the Bill omits too much. Perhaps it is too conservative. It does not provide the new powers the planning machine needs to meet the environmental challenges of the future. Most important is the missed opportunity for broadening assessment of the environmental impact of development and introducing environmental assessment directly into the planning legislation. It is ironic that the word "environment" is barely mentioned in one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation we have.<lb/>
I shall be controversial for a moment. It is widely recognised that environmental assessment is one of the most important developments in environmental policy, and we are required by European directive to make it a formal part of our planning system. Would it not be more prudent, however, to introduce and extend those provisions for environmental assessment directly into our own legislation? That would allow us to extend the scope of environmental assessment throughout the United Kingdom and to lead the way in Europe. We could extend it beyond individual
<col>934</col>
projects to examine the environmental impact of structure and local plans and major environmental programmes.<lb/>
Such a course would allow decisions to be made over future patterns of development with a fuller understanding of their environmental impact. For instance, the relative merits of out-of-town shopping centres versus high street improvements, or new settlements versus development of urban derelict land could be better assessed in terms of energy consumption, landscape impact and the wide range of other environmental implications.<lb/>
It could also help to provide the integrated decisions over transport infrastructure with proposals for industrial and housing development recommended by the recent House of Commons Select Committee on Transport third special report entitled <i>Roads for the Future.</i> The environment and the location of development could determine necessary road building and not the other way around.<lb/>
I am also concerned that the Bill falls short in other areas. It has little to say about how the public might be more involved in the planning process. It is extraordinary that there is no requirement for the public to be notified of most of the planning applications which are made. It does not address the problem that the public has no right of appeal against the granting of planning permission, however bad, unpopular or controversial the decision may be.<lb/>
I must conclude with a note of concern about the continuing loopholes in the planning system through which major changes to the landscape as a result of agriculture and forestry operations can continue outside planning controls. The grubbing up of moorland, the ploughing of ancient meadows and the destruction of landscapes through large-scale afforestation and woodland clearance are each major land use changes, yet they fall outside the very system which is intended to control land use.<lb/>
Checks are now needed through the planning system to ensure that the public interest in the countryside is fully protected. Of course, there should be substantial permitted development rights granted for any of the development brought within the planning system to allow small-scale changes without the necessity to apply for planning permission. For example, a farmer wishing to plant a small shelter belt would not need to apply for planning permission, just as he would not need to apply to build a small extension to his house.<lb/>
I have covered a wide range of subjects. This is a reflection of the scope and importance of the planning system and this Bill. New solutions are needed which adjust our lifestyles more closely to the natural resources available to us. This Bill provides an early opportunity to introduce some of them. The planning machinery needs new oil, but it also needs new parts if we are to develop a responsive mechanism for making choices for a sustainable future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04354"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not keep the House long. With any luck, we shall all be able to go to the environment of the tearoom before tea stops being served. First, I wish to thank my noble friend Lady Blatch for the extraordinarily lucid way in which she put across what is to me a rather complicated Bill. I also wish to express the admiration which I always feel for the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, on his considerable knowledge of the subject, which, I must admit, I do not possess. My only excuse for rising today is that, like others, I wish to put down a marker for an amendment which I hope to bring forward myself or perhaps with others.<lb/>
I have no complaint at all about the Bill and what it contains. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, felt that it was an uncontroversial Bill, but I thought that a number of amendments might flow from his pen which could alter our view later in debate in Committee and on Report.<lb/>
Various clauses please me, ranging over planning obligations and replacing what I call Section 52 with a more flexible provision. As a beginner, I am not good at town planning and I saw that under Clause 10 one could ascertain what was permissible. As one who receives planning decisions, I find the whole process pregnant with doubt and difficulty, and the alteration must be useful to everybody. The extra payment for disturbance to a home must be right. Later I shall follow the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in taking the matter further.<lb/>
Arising from the debate, I wish to issue a word of warning. People should not get carried away and desire to plan everything. My noble friend who has just left the Chamber veers in that direction, as, with great respect, I believe the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, does.<lb/>
I agree that if a farm is abandoned, automatically there should be planning permission for the buildings to serve a sensible and useful purpose. However, let us keep planning out of the cultivation of crops, which is a business. That is a dangerous path to travel and I hope we shall not take it. We are near enough to planning trees, and that comes into the Bill. An amusing difficulty arose when a tree preservation order was placed on my land where there were no trees. The bureaucratic process took so long that Dutch elm disease had overtaken the situation, the trees were felled and there was a frightful stink about the matter. I am glad to say that it was happily resolved.<lb/>
I wish to raise two points, one of which has been mentioned and one of which has not, and I do not think it occurs in the Bill in any form. I have noticed that with planners and planning law practically everything is covered: the duty aspect, the number of people who might wish to live there, whether there should be factories and so on. However, one process which always seems to go wrong is the examination of the water resources available for developments. All over the country rivers may not be disappearing but they carry less and less water. This might be the
<col>936</col>
opportunity to place some control on the planning authority to take care to ensure that rivers have enough water&#x2014;that there will not just be another borehole in the chalk, thus reducing the flow of another chalk stream.<lb/>
In my area, water is syphoned off&#x2014;I do not know whether that is the right word&#x2014;and goes to Bath, which is a long way away, to the detriment of the River Wylye. I live on a small chalk stream; I fished on it all my life until I had to stop. It now contains only half the water it had in earlier days and it has ceased to be a suitable stream for fish. I am not sure whether to put an amendment down on the subject, but I thought it sensible to bring the matter up because it is not properly covered in the Bill. I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Crickhowell is not here because I am sure that he would have had an answer to the problem&#x2014;which may or may not have satisfied me.<lb/>
I wish to bring up a matter which came at the end of the speech of my noble friend Lord Northbourne and which I have brought up already in your Lordships' House in discussions on the Channel Tunnel Bill&#x2014;the compulsory purchase of land by the Government or the local authority. The land could subsequently be handed over, either through sale or lease, or however it is, with a third party using the asset to make money and profit from it. I brought the matter up and divided your Lordships' House on the subject on the Channel Tunnel Bill. Noble Lords who were there may remember that I received a dusty answer. That was perhaps understandable; it was difficult for me to debate the point at that time because I owned the portal of the tunnel and only three other people were involved. First, I had to declare a more than strong interest.<lb/>
Fortunately or unfortunately, all four of us were not paupers so we elicited little sympathy. I felt then that the underlying principle was not noticed. However, it is there. It must be wrong for a planning authority or other body to purchase land compulsorily at the value of its existing use and then to sell it or lease it to another concern that is to make money from it. I believe that my noble friend the Leader of the House referred to service stations on a former occasion and said how difficult the position was in that case as exactly the same situation as I have described arose. Why should the owner of a piece of land, who may not be well heeled or a large landowner, not take some advantage from the person who is to run a service station?<lb/>
I hope I have made my point clearly. That is the marker that I shall put down, or perhaps I shall add my name to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. The noble Lord is a trained surveyor and his amendment would probably be better worded than an amendment of mine. In other respects this is a good Bill. The planning legislation must need amendment now and again. Although this is a bulky document, I view it as a useful amendment to the existing legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04355">5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04356"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a welcome Bill. The House enjoyed a most helpful introduction from the Minister. The planning system in a mechanical sense is somewhat under strain. Despite the deregulation of planning, applications to local authorities increased by 12 per cent. in 1987&#x2013;88 and by 14 per cent. in 1988&#x2013;89. This increase may now be easing off, but such a number of applications delays decisions. As a result, only about 50 per cent. of local authority planning decisions are determined within the eight-week period. That is far short of the guidance offered by the Department of the Environment, which suggested that 80 per cent. of decisions should be made within that period.<lb/>
There has also been a surge in appeals. They have increased by 30 per cent. a year, with consequent pressure on planning inspectors, even though 40 per cent. of those appeals are subsequently withdrawn. This position means that local authority time is spent fighting appeals when it could be better used in determining applications.<lb/>
Further, the planning system itself comes somewhat into disrepute when local authorities have difficulty in making their local planning decisions "stick". I suggest that this position is due to the "fussiness" of planning law, to use Carnwath's phrase, and to the "fragmentation" of remedies. Carnwath suggests that too many decisions have fallen unreasonably at appeal on technicalities: for example, on the grounds that the local authority's decision to limit a market referred to summer time rather than the summer time as determined by the Summer Time Act 1972. There are grey areas where, for example, intensification of use becomes a material change.<lb/>
Planning decisions do not "stick" either because of the fragmented remedies. Stop notices, for example, require an enforcement notice but, as the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, said, that process introduces unacceptable delays which may not matter when one is trying to control retailing on an industrial site but clearly matter when a local authority is trying to stop demolition. The status of injunctions so far has been unclear. The fragmented responsibility for enforcement, which is shared at the moment by local authorities, the planning inspectorate and the civil and criminal courts, does not help the position. Further, some developers treat the puny fines that may be imposed as levies rather than as a deterrent. Essentially ordinary people do not see why they should be law-abiding citizens when others are not and get away with it.<lb/>
However, another reason why planning decisions have not always "stuck" is because they have been overturned by the Secretary of State on appeal. This happens largely because of the inadequacy of local plans. As the Minister herself said, these only cover some 30 per cent. of the population. That fault is reinforced by uncertain procedures and by the predilections of an individual Secretary of State: whether he is concerned with the green belt or out-of-town shopping.<lb/>
<col>938</col>
This Bill is especially welcome because it addresses all three of the issues I have referred to&#x2014;namely, the strain that the planning system is under; the inability to make planning decisions "stick" because of the fussiness of the law; and, finally, the role of the Secretary of State. The Bill inhibits repetitive planning applications, and should reduce the number of appeals. It strengthens enforcement procedures broadly along the lines of the Carnwath clauses by introducing planning contravention notices, breach of condition notices, injunctions, fines and the like. One should not exaggerate the problem. Carnwath suggests that of the average 500 alleged contraventions that a local authority will deal with, only 25 are likely not to be negotiated by reason and persuasion. Nonetheless we need the enforcement procedures as a back-up. The Bill is also welcome because it makes mandatory local plans, presumes in their favour and thus reduces to an appropriate and modest role the interventionist role of the Secretary of State. Therefore the Bill makes planning less whimsical and more predictable without losing much needed flexibility. Both local authorities and developers will know where they should stand.<lb/>
I should also like to add that I agree with the comments made by almost every other speaker today that the proposals on compensation payments are universally welcomed.<lb/>
However, I was intrigued by the Minister's reference to vendors participating in development gain. I hope she will indicate whether she hopes to reintroduce a development land tax. I am sure also that the House would support the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, as chairman of English Heritage, with which, as a commissioner, I associate myself. I hope they will be taken up in Committee.<lb/>
It is a welcome and much needed Bill. However, I wish to make suggestions on a couple of points and register unease on one or two others. My comments are intended to be helpful. I do not wish to sound churlish as there is so much to support in the Bill. Clauses 1 to 11 are the so-called Carnwath clauses. As regards Clause 1, will the Minister consider whether magistrates should have the power to require compliance with planning contravention notices? Clause 5 concerns enforcement notices. Detailed work may be required on its wording, for example on the naming of owners.<lb/>
Clause 9 concerns stop notices. We may need some help in clarifying the continued vulnerability of local authorities to compensation procedures. Clause 10 concerns certificates of lawful use, and I believe it will have almost universal support. However, it entails extensive work for local authorities. Carnwath proposed fees. The principle has already been accepted for development applications. I hope that the Minister will address that point.<lb/>
More profound difficulties arise when we leave Carnwath and move on to the clauses after Clause 11. Clause 12 gives most cause for concern. It deals with planning gain. At present the former Section 52, or the new Section 106, make planning gain a matter of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0509"/>
<col>939</col>
mutual negotiation between a local authority and a developer. The Minister said in her opening remarks that the Government seek to foster co-operation in this matter. I am sure she is entirely right in that, but there is no evidence that the former Section 52 is not working or is not successful.<lb/>
Clause 12 appears to run alongside the former Section 52 a new power for developers to make a unilateral offer of planning gain on a take it or leave it basis. I am sure that good developers will not go down that track because they recognise that local authorities have a wider perspective on land use, for example, than they themselves can hope to have. Most developers also value the process of negotiation which lies at the heart of local authority work. I suggest, however, that this clause will encourage less enlightened developers in their recalcitrance and undermine the process of negotiation. It repositions the emphasis towards the developer in a way that is against the public interest. I hope the Minister can be persuaded to think again on that issue.<lb/>
On Clause 16, which concerns mineral workings, I hope we can be given some evidence that the measure is necessary. However, I understand the philosophy behind it. Clause 22 concerns structure plans. Despite the Government's White Paper on the future of development plans, the clause reaffirms and almost reinvents the county planning function. Given the question marks that are currently in the air over local government structure, I wonder whether such heavy reliance is wise.<lb/>
As every speaker has said, it is obviously sensible to have mandatory district local plans and for those to be in conformity with county structure plans without obligatory scrutiny by the Secretary of State. The streamlining of the procedure in the Bill is welcome, as is the discouragement of structure plans becoming too dense and detailed.<lb/>
If structure plans are not to be scrutinised by the Secretary of State, it is essential that they are in the domain of public debate. I should be delighted to be corrected on this point by the Minister, but as it stands the examination in public of county plans appears to be a matter of county discretion. The Bill refers throughout to "may" rather than "shall". It is not a matter of public right: and surely it should be. If my reading of the Bill is correct, I hope that the Minister will bring forward amendments at the Committee stage.<lb/>
Regarding simplified planning zones, my noble friend Lord McIntosh referred to the "black hole" of UDCs. Given the research of the Centre for Local Economic Strategies which shows how vulnerable UDCs are to land and to development recession, I suggest that it is essential to integrate them properly into the planning process.<lb/>
If one accepts, as many noble Lords have suggested, that planning resolves conflicts and protects landscapes and streetscapes, and if it steers development and improves its quality in a way that enhances the environment, I suggest that the Bill has
<col>940</col>
missed some opportunities. The first is a point of natural justice. As it stands, the Bill does not permit any third party appeals. My noble friend Lord McIntosh referred to other statutory bodies, as did the noble Lord, Lord Montagu. The House may also wish to consider the standing of private individuals and companies in cases when, for example, a neighbour is seriously affected by an adjacent development, whether it be a private householder or a major business. At present recourse is only available through the courts.<lb/>
Secondly, while what is proposed in relation to planning controls is very welcome I believe that the range should be widened. It would be extremely helpful if we could inhibit the demolition of individual significant buildings which, though not listed and outside a conservation area, are important to streetscape. There is growing concern among local authorities up and down the land that within conservation areas all the buildings, including unlisted buildings, are protected from demolition. Victorian terraced housing, particularly which has significant streetscape value, should be protected from disfiguring alterations. If we as trustees wish to hand on our built heritage, we need additional powers to protect where appropriate, unlisted buildings in conservation areas from alterations and unlisted buildings outside conservation areas from demolition.<lb/>
It may be opportune to mention that satellite dishes should also be brought within the planning regime until technology makes them transparent or recession makes them redundant.<lb/>
Thirdly, the Bill does not address the issue of twin-tracking&#x2014;where an applicant simultaneously submits an application and an appeal on the presumption that the application will be rejected. As the planning inspectors have themselves noted, the same local authority officers try to resolve the application while simultaneously trying to fight the appeal. That puts huge pressure on staff and injects major delay into the determination of applications by other applicants.<lb/>
Fourthly, the Bill places additional responsibilities on local government. The certificates of lawful use or statutory local plans have resource implications for local authorities, as have the measures debated in previous Sessions of your Lordships' House relating to food, litter and dogs. There is no evidence that those additional duties have been foreseen in the recent local authority financial settlement, which is less than inflation. It is not fair to impose new duties, some of which represent a direct saving to the Secretary of State&#x2014;some &#x00A3;200,000 will be saved as a result of not having to consider structure plans&#x2014;without either reimbursing local authorities through RSG or allowing local government to charge appropriate fees. We all want developers to have speedy, sensitive and fair handling of their applications, to which they are entitled. However, that costs money and it is not reasonable that that cost should be borne by the poll tax payer.<lb/>
Finally, I turn to issues raised very effectively by my noble friend Lady Nicol and the noble Lord, Lord
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0510"/>
<col>941</col>
Norrie, concerning the missed opportunity regarding the wider concept of planning. The Bill reaffirms the belief in planning. It clarifies the processes and calibrates the procedures. That is all highly welcome, but it is still a concept of planning shaped by the attitudes of the 1970s. The material considerations that a local authority can bring to bear upon a planning application that are deemed relevant are too narrowly drawn. Much of the vocabulary of "Common Inheritance" is missing from the Bill. For example, it does not allow local authorities to take proper account of energy considerations, whether in terms of location or of design. There is insufficient consideration of wider transportation issues, or, as my noble friend Lord McIntosh said, of the implications for the local economy. Nor does it permit local authorities in rural areas to have particular regard to low cost, affordable or social housing.<lb/>
We need a stronger commitment to access for the disabled. Above all, as my noble friend Lady Nicol and the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, said, we need a proper environmental assessment built into the Bill. It is not fully green. It does not allow local authorities to consider the no-growth option. It does not properly protect landscape from visually disturbing changes; for example, from pasture to arable or afforestation. In passing, I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Wade, whether, if agricultural buildings were treated as though they were industrial buildings he would welcome the application of UBR to them.<lb/>
In conclusion, all Members of the House must surely welcome a Bill of this kind. It has been supported by all the professional associations and by local government. In our view it has one bad clause, Clause 12, other clauses which need strengthening and some significant omissions. However, we give it a warm welcome and hope very much that the Minister will allow us to help her improve the Bill even further.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04358"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may begin by welcoming the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, to the Dispatch Box. I believe that it is the first occasion on which she has spoken from the Dispatch Box and I should like to say from this side of the House what an impressive performance it was. We look forward to meeting her across the Dispatch Box on other occasions. I lost count when she reached her fifteenth question. Therefore, perhaps the noble Baroness will forgive me if I do not pick up all of the points in replying to the debate. I shall make sure that answers are given to most of the questions that have been posed during the debate.<lb/>
This has been a stimulating debate. It has demonstrated yet again the wealth of experience which your Lordships possess on planning matters. I thank all noble Lords for the general welcome which they have given the Bill. I shall address some of the anxieties that have been raised during the course of the debate.<lb/>
Let me first reiterate what the Bill is about. It is about making the existing planning process more
<col>942</col>
certain, more efficient and fairer. As has been said by many noble Lords, that need has been generally recognised.<lb/>
When the Bill was published the Council for the Protection of Rural England leapt in with comments to the effect that it was not green enough and more was needed to protect those parts of our environment which are perceived to be at risk. This is a green measure in every respect.<lb/>
The enforcement provisions will help to deter unauthorised development. That is essential for the protection of environmentally precious areas. Against a background of full coverage by structure and local plans, the provisions on development control will create greater certainty about what development is acceptable after local consultation and debate. The compensation provisions will ensure that where, after proper consideration, people's property has to be acquired for development those people are sufficiently compensated. In other words, the Bill strengthens the framework in which the environmental concerns of organisations like the CPRE can be considered against the competing claims of developers and others. That can only help the proper consideration of environmental issues arising in the context of development needs and proposals.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, and my noble friend Lord Wade illustrated beautifully the tensions which exist between environmental considerations and considerations of economic development. When my noble friend referred to plans being set in aspic I rather think that he meant set in concrete. My noble friend referred to their lack of flexibility and the need for them to be updated constantly because they should be dynamic documents for an air of realism in their development.<lb/>
The environment has been a major anxiety. It is argued that there is no case for including provisions on environmental assessment in the Bill. Existing regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972 fully implement the directive and require environmental assessments for projects likely to have significant effects on the environment. We consider that the procedures are generally working satisfactorily. We are also in touch with the House authorities about a new standing order which would require environmental assessments for projects in Private Bills, as proposed by the Joint Select Committee on Private Bill Procedure. That was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ross.<lb/>
The planning system is an instrument for resolving issues and conflicts between development and conservation. How they are resolved depends not upon the law but on the policies applied within it by both central and local government. For example, my department is currently consulting on policy guidance relating to countryside issues. The environmental White Paper also foreshadowed new planning guidance on heritage, wildlife and pollution issues.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to regional guidance. I do not share his anxiety that the county council should be required to prepare regional
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0511"/>
<col>943</col>
guidance. It is important that the guidance is seen as an explicit statement of government policy for the region rather than simply an endorsement of material produced by others. The advice prepared by local planning authorities is a crucially important input; but I think it right that the final guidance should come from the Government. We have been giving careful thought to the consultation process leading to the preparation of regional planning guidance. In the South East we propose to hold a conference early next year which will give us the opportunity to hear the views of invited parties before the regional guidance is drafted.<lb/>
On strategic planning in the national parks&#x2014;a point raised by my noble friend Lord Norrie&#x2014;we felt it right that structure plan responsibility should remain with the county councils, but we intend to require those councils to consult the national park authorities in the process of formulating and reviewing their plans. That consultative approach is likely to be more appropriate than elaborate arrangements for joint working. Where there is disagreement on strategic issues, it will be open to the National Parks Authority to seek to have them raised at the public examination of the structure plan. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to direct that specified matters shall be considered at the examination in public.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, suggested that plans should be given greater weight. It is true that the first material consideration in relation to any planning application (though not the only one) is the development plan. As recent policy guidance has emphasised, the Secretary of State will be guided by up-to-date development plans in his decisions on appeal. But even where a refusal would be in line with the development plan, the authority cannot rely on that fact as a knock-down argument. It is required to take account of all the material planning considerations, and plans cannot be expected to anticipate positively every need or opportunity for economic development that might arise. We need to guard against over-rigidity. One of the strengths of our planning system is that it permits greater flexibility in the individual case than do systems which operate on more rigid zoning principles. For that reason, I am not attracted by the noble Lord's suggestion that the right of appeal should be curtailed where proposals are not in accordance with the plan.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was also anxious about UDCs and their relationship with development plans. There was much criticism of the proposal in the 1989 White Paper that UDCs, which are essentially temporary creations, should be excluded from the development plan framework. In the light of that, we now propose that UDCs should normally be included in plans after appropriate consultation between the planning authority and the corporation. We have dropped the black hole proposition, as the noble Lord and the noble Baroness put it. The power to exclude UDCs from plans is essentially a reserve power to deal
<col>944</col>
with special cases whereby a planning authority is seeking to thwart a UDC. We hope that power will rarely be used.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, also spoke about planning and agriculture. We have recently published for consultation proposals for extending prior notification arrangements for farm buildings and increasing the minimum size of holding which qualifies for permitted development rights. We have invited views on the possibility of extending these controls to new farm and forestry roads. If we decide to go ahead with these arrangements, they will be the first major extension of planning controls to agriculture and forestry for over 40 years.<lb/>
However, the Government are not convinced that new controls for agriculture and forestry operations are needed. That was a point made by my noble friend Lord Radnor. The planning system has to recognise the special operational needs of farming and forestry businesses. All proposals for large-scale afforestation in sensitive areas have been subject to environmental assessment since 1988 under the arrangements introduced by the Forestry Commission to comply with the European directive.<lb/>
The noble Lord also referred to the re-use of agricultural buildings. When the use is for nonagricultural purposes&#x2014;for instance, for higher industry&#x2014;planning permission is already required and the planning authority has an opportunity to consider the appropriateness of the new use.<lb/>
On compensation, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and many other noble Lords, were keen that the principle of compensation could be extended. The principle of a payment on top of market value compensation should apply in all cases, not just those affecting householders. This is not an argument which commends itself to the Government. The concept of the home loss payment is intended to reflect, as I have already said, the particular problems faced by those who are displaced from their own homes.<lb/>
The law also provides for farm loss and other payments to assist particular cases, and indeed the Bill improves some of these provisions. But we see no justification for a general supplement over and above market value. For this purpose, market value includes hope value. However, it does not include the value of the scheme for which the land is being taken. We consider this to be right whether or not the scheme generates income for the acquiring body. My noble friend's suggestion could result in huge variations in the amount of compensation paid for different sites of similar size, type and location and would thus appear wholly arbitrary from the point of view of owners. In the Government's view the approach already enshrined in the current legislation is inherently a fair one, and we see no case for abandoning it.<lb/>
My noble friend mentioned a proposal for additional compensation when a developing body obtains a more valuable planning permission after acquiring the land. The amendment that I have foreshadowed will, I believe, achieve this objective.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0512"/>
<col>945</col>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and other noble Lords, referred to the French land compensation system. There is a myth in this country that the French pay a vast percentage over market value for all land. The French system is different but not necessarily better. The percentages are usually lower than those quoted. They may in some cases pay as much as 25 per cent.&#x2014;but on the first 100,000 French francs, which is &#x00A3;10,000. Otherwise, the percentage which varies from case to case is much more like 10 per cent. They do not reimburse many of the costs which are specifically covered by our provisions&#x2014;for example, lawyers' and surveyors' fees&#x2014;and they do not pay home loss or farm loss payments. It is by no means clear that the claimants do better in France. While help is given with remedial measures, like double-glazing, no compensation is paid for depreciation as a result of nearby developments, as we do in this country.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, argued that planning restrictions should give rise to compensation rights. The law already provides such protection, and therefore we do not believe there is a need to make such provision in this Bill. Compensation is payable if planning permission is revoked or a use is discontinued by order. That also applies, for example, when permission is refused following an article for direction. The Bill repeals some out-dated compensation provisions in this area, and with these changes we consider that the balance between authorities and developers is about right.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, also referred to the resourcing of local planning authorities' development plan activities. There will be extra demands on authorities as they extend local plan coverage to the whole of their areas, but there is a lot of enthusiasm for this task. I should like to make two practical points. Where up-to-date plans are in existence, it will be open to authorities to build on them and to incorporate them into their new plans rather than having to start from scratch. Secondly, there will be a pay-off for authorities once plans are in place in terms of a much firmer framework for handling planning applications and appeals. That was a point well made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Montagu raised a number of matters relating to heritage. On the general point, I am happy to discuss amendments in Committee. However, apart from some technical changes to listed building enforcement procedures consequent to the main provisions on planning enforcement, the Bill is not concerned with matters relating to listed buildings, conservation areas or the powers of English Heritage.<lb/>
With regard to power for English Heritage to grant-aid persons, bodies or trusts for purposes of acquiring listed buildings in need of restoration, we are broadly sympathetic. But that may not be within the scope of the Bill or of the planning Acts.<lb/>
His second point related to listed building enforcement notices taking immediate effect, not 28 days after service. Again breach of listed building control is a criminal offence. The noble Lord's proposal would not affect that. His third point referred to powers for English Heritage to require
<col>946</col>
information on ownership of buildings on which it wishes to take enforcement action. The question of how far it is appropriate for English Heritage to have concurrent powers with local planning authorities needs further discussion and thought.<lb/>
The noble Lord's fourth point related to the power for English Heritage to bring prosecutions or to seek injunctions in its own name. We are sympathetic and hope that, following consultation, it may be possible to give effect to the proposal, if not in the present Bill at least at some convenient future opportunity.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, referred to the consistency between structure plans and local plans. The present procedure under which a local plan must be certified by the county before it can be placed on deposit is not a satisfactory arrangement. It can and does cause serious delay to the processing of some local plans. In its place Schedule 3 proposes a new procedure which will allow local plans to go forward on deposit when the district council chooses but will require them to be accompanied by a statement of conformity from the county council. This statement will say whether or not in the county's view the local plan conforms with the structure plan; and, if not, in what respects there is an inconsistency. That process gives the council ample opportunity to highlight inconsistencies without causing delay to the processing of the local plan.<lb/>
The noble Baroness was also anxious about nature conservation policies in county structure plans. Again we issued guidance last May on the content of structure and local plans in <i>Planning Policy Guidance Note 15.</i> That refers specifically to conservation in town and country as one of the topics for structure plans. It urges authorities to ensure that full account is taken of the environmental effects of their policies. My department will be commissioning research on best practice in the preparation of structure plans. That should enable us to issue guidance later next year on the best way of approaching particular issues in plans; and environmental issues will be one aspect.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, spoke about stopping applications from being made during the two-year moratorium. We cannot completely stop an applicant from applying. What would be the sanction on presenting the application? However, the Bill provides a simple procedure to throw out repetitive applications without the painstaking and costly care that needs to be given to the first application.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, tacked about the criminalising of unlawful development. "Criminalisation" is a word that neither he nor I like. I realise that a strong tide is flowing, especially among some elected members of planning authorities, in favour of legislating to make unlawful development a criminal offence. It is not a simple issue where all the arguments lead in only one direction. One of the merits of Mr. Robert Carnwath's report on <i>Enforcing Planning Control</i> is that he analysed the issue very thoroughly in Chapter 6, paragraphs 2.1 to 2.17 before concluding that he could not recommend that change. We find his analysis compelling and his conclusion entirely persuasive.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0513"/>
<col>947</col>
Those who support criminalisation do so mainly because they wish to punish people who deliberately and flagrantly carry out development which they know is unlawful without obtaining planning permission required for it. I can sympathise with that aim. However, it is important to note that the flagrant contravenors are a small minority. While it is true that their activities catch the public eye and make members of planning committees despair, the result of criminalisation would be to bring many others&#x2014;often very innocent people&#x2014;within the scope of criminal behaviour. That would include, for example, the houseowner who goes ahead with improvements to his house, perhaps on advice that he does not require specific planning permission, only to find that he has exceeded the permitted development rights. If unlawful development becomes an offence, the innocent person who had <i>prima facie</i> carried out technically unlawful development, would be open to prosecution.<lb/>
Secondly, we must ask whether criminalisation would in practice be an effective deterrent. Unless the maximum penalty were so substantial, it is doubtful whether the flagrant contravenor would be deterred. That would give us the worst of all worlds. That was a point again well made by the noble Baroness.<lb/>
That is one reason why we have preferred the alternative approach exemplified in Clause 3 of the Bill of a planning injunction to restrain the most serious breaches of control. If an injunction were granted, the eventual penalty for contempt of court is likely to be far more effective than any other remedy.<lb/>
I know that I have not touched on a number of other points. My noble friend Lord Radnor, made a point about the NRA and planning concerning water. The NRA is consulted by planning authorities where an application affects them. However, I believe that he was referring to planning concerning water. That is a matter for the NRA. Therefore I have no doubt that it will be taking a very close interest in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04359"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. However, before she moves to her peroration&#x2014;I appreciate that she has been very fair in dealing with as many points as she can&#x2014;a number of noble Lords, including myself, raised the issue of unilateral undertakings as opposed to Section 52 agreements. It would be helpful if she could give the Government's response to those matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04360"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that unilateral arrangements cause concern. I suspect that at the end of the Bill's progress through the House we shall find ourselves agreeing to differ about the issue. There are many examples where local authorities continue to negotiate. The noble Baroness pressed me on the point of negotiating for planning gain where negotiations are prolonged to the extent that local authorities hang out for greater benefits under Section 52 or Section 106 as it now is. Those prolong and delay a project to the point where a developer can make the decision to act unilaterally. At the end of the day that is also subject to judicial review. If the developer has acted precipitately, if he has acted unreasonably, there
<col>948</col>
would be a mechanism to ensure that a judgment was made about the reasonableness or unreasonableness of that action.<lb/>
I hope that the noble Lord will allow me to rest on that explanation. On looking at his face, I believe that he is not entirely satisfied with it. However, I know that we shall be coming back to the matter in much greater detail at Committee stage.<lb/>
Perhaps I shall be forgiven for passing over many other points that have been raised during the debate. It is a varied Bill, as the range of points with which I have dealt testifies. It is an important Bill in matters of detail on many issues, and especially on compensation. There has been no updating of the law for many years. The twin themes of efficiency and fairness which I have emphasised throughout the debate require that detailed attention be given to legislation from time to time. That does not detract from the importance of the themes. I believe that the Bill will improve both fairness and efficiency, and I commend it to the House.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Statistics of Trade Act 1947 (Amendment of Schedule) Order 1990</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04361">5.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04362"><member>The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne</member> rose to move, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the order be made in the form of the draft laid before the House on 7th November [<i>1st Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#x2014;<i>(The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04363">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the purpose of this draft order is to allow the Central Statistical Office to collect quarterly data on companies' profits under statute. This is one component of a package of measures being taken by the Government that will help to improve the quality of economic statistics.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04364">First, I should like briefly to explain the technical aspects of the order. The Statistics of Trade Act is the main authority by which the Government collect statistics from companies. It allows competent authorities&#x2014;that is, certain government departments including the Central Statistical Office&#x2014;to require companies to supply information on specific aspects of their business. The Act contains a schedule listing the topics on which the Government can request information. Section 5 of the Act allows additions to be made to this schedule by Order in Council. Such an Order in Council is before your Lordships this evening. The order would add a paragraph to the schedule to the Statistics of Trade Act. This paragraph appears in the schedule to the draft order. The paragraph contains the words "profits" and "losses", which are not covered by the existing schedule. It also contains other phrases. I shall explain shortly why this is necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04365">Before doing so, however, perhaps I may put into context our proposal to make this change. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that the Government
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0514"/>
<col>949</col>
need good economic statistics both for monitoring and forecasting the UK economy and as the basis for fiscal and economic policy. That almost goes without saying. Your Lordships will be aware, however, that there have been severe problems with the quality of our economic statistics. These have given rise to real difficulties for economic policy makers and indeed for all users of the statistics both inside and outside government. That is why we are here this evening.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04366">I now turn to the specific topic of statistics on company profits. The Government need quarterly data on profits for four reasons. First, they make an important contribution to the income measure of gross domestic product; secondly, they provide the base from which corporation tax receipts are forecast; thirdly, they help provide the Government with an assessment of the financial position of companies; and fourthly, they are used by Treasury in analysing, modelling and forecasting the economy. Therefore, I hope that your Lordships will agree that it is important to have these figures as securely based as possible. As I have mentioned, the schedule to the Statistics of Trade Act does not currently cover profits and so the Government cannot collect data on company profits under the Act. Of course the Government nevertheless compile statistics on company profits. However, there are significant weaknesses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04367">The basic source of statistics on the profits of industrial and commercial companies is Inland Revenue data on assessments for corporation tax. These statistics are thought to be soundly based. Inevitably, however, these data are not available until some time after the profits are earned and they also relate to whole years, not to quarters. Quarterly data are needed for monitoring, forecasting and policy purposes. The tax assessments data are, therefore, supplemented by a quarterly inquiry asking a sample of companies for information on their profits. Results from this inquiry are used to provide figures for the national accounts for the past two or three years. The inquiry is voluntary and many large companies exercise their right not to provide data. Despite several efforts that have been made to recruit more companies to the inquiry, it remains unrepresentative and lacks a number of large company groups. The estimates derived from the current quarterly inquiry are, therefore, weak. It is no real surprise that there tend to be large revisions to the statistics when the tax assessments data become available two or three years later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04368">Adding the phrases "profits" and "losses" to the schedule, as proposed, will permit CSO to collect up-to-date quarterly information from industrial and commercial companies about their profits on a statutory basis. It will be able to collect these statistics from all large company groups in the country not just those who agree to report voluntarily. The resulting figures would be more accurate because the inquiry would be larger and more representative. Statutory inquiries are also more equitable than voluntary ones. Companies which respond to voluntary inquiries do
<col>950</col>
so from a sense of public responsibility. The costs that they incur may be small but they are still costs that will not be incurred by their non-responding competitors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04369">I am sure that your Lordships are concerned about the possible increase in reporting burdens. As part of its preparation for this measure the Government consulted the CBI and the Stock Exchange about the possibility of introducing a quarterly statutory inquiry into profits. While neither body could be expected to welcome additional reporting burdens both accept the need for accurate statistics. The CBI is of the opinion that the reporting burden will not be too great as most of the required information can easily be provided from existing sources within most companies. The Government also discussed the availability of quarterly profits figures with some large companies last winter. The impression gained from these discussions is in line with the CBI opinion. In this instance, therefore, the Government believe that the prospective improvement to the statistics is worth the slight increase in the reporting burdens involved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04370">This covers the words "profits" and "losses" in the proposed additional paragraph. As I mentioned earlier, the paragraph also covers income received, dividends and interest paid and taxes paid. This is because of a particular problem in compiling statistics of the profits of financial companies. Such companies would naturally see their profits as including turns on interest rates or on the prices of traded instruments. For the national accounts, however, such earnings are not included as profits. There would, therefore, be no point in attempting to collect statistics from financial companies on such a basis. The only wary to obtain the appropriate statistics is to collect data from financial companies on particular items of their income and expenditure, and for CSO to compile the required profits figures itself. This is the approach adopted in existing inquiries of financial companies. However, most of the inquiries collect only annual figures. Figures for the latest quarters are projections and substantial revisions can occur when the figures for the latest year become available. The further additions to the schedule will enable CSO to collect income and expenditure data from financial companies on a quarterly basis. As with industrial and commercial companies the Government are satisfied that the required information is readily available for most companies. Finally, the phrase in the proposed paragraph dealing with services is included to remove any possible doubt that such information falls within the scope of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04371">The proposed amendment to the schedule will enable CSO to compile better statistics on company profits without an undue increase in reporting burdens. As part of the package of improvements announced by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, this will help in eliminating the three major problems with economic statistics. It will help to reduce the gaps between the measure of GDP; it will reduce the scope for revisions; and it will lead to more coherent statistics and reduce the balancing items. This will be an important
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0515"/>
<col>951</col>
contribution to improving the statistical base used for economic monitoring, forecasting and policy making. I commend the Motion to the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04372">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the order be made in the form of the draft laid before the House on 7th November. [<i>1st Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#x2014;<i>(The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04373">5.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04374"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Earl for introducing the order. Generally speaking, it has our support. We believe it is right that the collection of such statistics should be on a statutory basis and not on a voluntary basis. To that extent we support the Government's action.<lb/>
We also note and support the comments made by the noble Earl about the criticisms that have been made of the quality of government statistics. Indeed, we have joined in some of the criticisms. We have also criticised the Government for the way in which they use the statistics, but that is a different and more political question. The Pickford Committee recently reported on statistics, and on national income statistics in particular, and the order before the House follows its recommendation.<lb/>
I have one or two questions that I should like to ask the noble Earl, given our general support. Forecasting has recently come under much criticism. After all, the Treasury does not have a very good record on forecasting either the balance of payments or inflation. Anything which will improve that ability to forecast will be welcome both to your Lordships, and, indeed, to the country as a whole.<lb/>
In those circumstances, why have the Government drastically cut the grant in connection with the consortium consisting of the Economic and Social Research Council, the Bank of England and the Treasury for funding of econometric models outside the Treasury from &#x00A3;1.5 million to &#x00A3;0.5 million next year? I should be grateful if the noble Earl can explain how that is consonant with the view that he has just expressed that economic forecasting should be improved.<lb/>
Secondly, were the Financial Reporting Council and the accounting standards board consulted about the contents of the order, particularly as regards the definition of "profits"? Profits are extremely difficult to define and the accounting standards board now has the legal obligation to lay out the accounting standards and principles which companies should adopt. Was that body consulted by the Government on the expression "income receivable by the undertaking"? Was that expression satisfactory to the accounting standards board? Are we to assume that all accounts which are reported under this order must be made up according to the principles of the ASB or are small companies in some way exempt?<lb/>
Thirdly, how often do the Government propose to publish profit and income statistics which are to be collected under this order? Are they to be published
<col>952</col>
quarterly, annually or are they to be published only when the national income statistics are published, and then subsequently revised?<lb/>
Fourthly, is it not much more important for the purpose of national accounts and, indeed, for the purposes of this order to specify the form and content of company accounts? After all, the Government have that power under Section 228 of the Companies Act 1985. It seems to me to be sensible, if statistics of this nature are to be collected, that they should be uniform and that uniformity should be imposed by the Government under powers which they already have.<lb/>
I have not given notice to the noble Earl of my last question, but it is of fundamental importance. How do the definitions contained in this order square with international definitions? It seems to me immensely important that when compiling our national income statistics we should align ourselves at least alongside our fellow members of the EC and also alongside members of OECD. I should be grateful for an assurance from the noble Earl that we are following practices generally adopted in OECD.<lb/>
We have a long way to go in improving our economic statistics. I am very glad to see that my noble friend Lord Wilson is here. As a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, he has a particular interest in this matter. I hope that he and other noble friends will ask the Government to apply their mind seriously to the question of the quality of statistics which come from the Government. Over the years we have seen a fall off in quality and standards. We welcome this order as far as it goes but there is still quite a long way to go. We hope that the Government will take the matter very seriously indeed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04375">5.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04376"><member>The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following this debate I hope that the House will agree with the Government's view that the statistics of company profits need improving and that the way to achieve that is through a quarterly statutory inquiry. The Government believe that the best way to enable that is to approve this draft order before the House. It will amend the Statistics of Trade Act so that it covers profits.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, asked a number of questions which I shall attempt to answer. He asked why the Government have drastically cut the consortium funding for econometric models. The answer to that is threefold. Treasury contributions for the next round of consortium funding will continue at 20 per cent. of the total as for the current round. Secondly, it is true that there will be a substantial cut back in the total funding for the next round compared to the current round, but pressure for that did not come from the Treasury. Throughout negotiations with the ESRC, the Treasury has said that it will contribute 20 per cent. of the total and was prepared to support a much higher level of total funding. Thirdly, the increase in Treasury contributions in percentage terms cannot be justified.<lb/>
The second point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, was whether the ASB and the FRC were
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0516"/>
<col>953</col>
consulted on the order. The answer is that they were not. Officials felt that it was sufficient to consult the CBI, the organisation representing those completing the returns. The Stock Exchange was also consulted. The CSO needs to compile figures according to international accounts conventions which are internationally agreed. The definitions used within commercial accounting in general provide the building blocks which the CSO need. That means that most companies will be able to provide the information from existing sources. Accountants and accounting standards boards have not been able to agree on many aspects of accounting.<lb/>
The third question which the noble Lord asked was how frequently profit and income statistics collected under the order would be published. That will be done quarterly.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams, asked about the form and context of company accounts. It would be nice to have a single set of company accounts rather than separate accounts for corporate reporting, tax returns and statistics. That is simply not practical; for example, company accounts include the overseas activities of United Kingdom groups whereas those activities must be excluded from the national accounts figures for profits. I fear that the requirements of shareholders and national accountants will never be identical.<lb/>
The noble Lord also raised the question about the burden on small businesses. I also raised that question when I was being briefed on this order. We plan that the new inquiry will be directed only at the largest company groups.<lb/>
Finally, the noble Lord asked about Eurostat and whether that would have access to the data for individual companies. It will not. The recent regulation on the transmission of confidential data to Eurostat is a preliminary enabling measure only. A further regulation will be necessary to specify any information which may be transmitted. In any event, company names and addresses will not be supplied and Eurostat must maintain the same degree of data security as in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I repeat my assurances that as far as we can tell, this order will not impose a substantial reporting burden on companies. We shall be as accommodating as possible to companies which have difficulty in supplying the data as long as the accuracy of the aggregate figures is not reduced. I hope that the House agrees that the draft order before the House is not a controversial matter.<lb/>
On Question, Motion agreed to, and it was ordered that the Address be presented by the Lords with White Staves.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (Amendment) Order 1990</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04377">6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04378"><member>The Lord Advocate (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 7th November be approved. [<i>1st Report from the Joint Committee.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04379">The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of this Order in Council is to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the convention by which Spain and Portugal acceded to the 1968 Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, as well as to the 1971 protocol.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04380">The Brussels Convention was drawn up between the six original member states of the European Community under Article 220 of the treaty. That article provides that member states shall enter into negotiations with each other with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals, <i>inter alia,</i> the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals. The convention established a scheme to determine the international jurisdiction of the courts of the member states; to facilitate recognition, and to introduce an expeditious procedure for securing the enforcement of judgments within the Community. The 1971 Protocol confers jurisdiction on the Court of Justice of the Community to interpret the convention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04381">On becoming a member of the Community each state undertakes to accede to the Brussels Convention and to the protocol: this is acknowledged in Article 63 of the convention and in Article 9 of the protocol respectively. The United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland acceded by a convention signed on the 9th October 1978, and the Brussels Convention is now in force in each of those states. It has been in force in the United Kingdom since 1st January 1987 by virtue of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. In turn, on joining the Community, Greece acceded by a convention signed on 25th October 1982; that convention was ratified by the United Kingdom last year and came into force on 1st October 1989.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04382">The convention on the accession of Spain and Portugal, the two final states, was signed on 26th May 1989. In a joint declaration made at the same time, the member states declared themselves ready to take every appropriate measure with a view to ensuring that national procedures for the ratification of the convention are completed, at the latest, by 31st December 1992. So far only the Netherlands has done so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04383">Section 14 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act provides that Her Majesty may by Order in Council make such modifications of the Act as Her Majesty considers appropriate in consequence of any revision of the Brussels Convention or to the protocol. Such revisions include,
<quote>"in particular any revision connected with the accession to the 1968 Convention of one or more further States".</quote></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0517"/>
<col>955</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04384">The length, in terms of printed pages, of the order before your Lordships today is perhaps disproportionate to the amount of new material it contains. The greater part of the printed order consists of schedules, replacing those presently in the 1982 Act. The amended text of the 1968 convention, and of the protocol, is reproduced in its entirety in Schedules 1 and 2. This practice has been welcomed in the past. The remaining schedules contain the amended text, so far as is relevant, of the 1978 accession convention, the convention by which the United Kingdom acceded; and the relevant provisions of the Spanish and Portuguese accession convention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04385">I would draw attention to Article 8 of the order which amends Section 3 of the Act to permit consideration by United Kingdom courts, in ascertaining the meaning or effect of any provision of the Brussels convention or the accession conventions, to consider the report on the Spanish and Portuguese accession convention drawn up by three eminent lawyers: a Portuguese, a Spaniard and the honorary director of administration at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Monsieur Paul Jenard. Section 3 already permits reference to the corresponding reports on the Brussels convention and on the earlier accession conventions. The amendments to Sections 39 and 52, in Articles 10 and 11 respectively, will enable either corresponding provisions to be applied, or the 1968 convention itself to be extended, not only to Gibraltar and the sovereign base areas but to "any colony".</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04386">As your Lordships will be aware, the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Bill was introduced before your Lordships' House on the 15th November. The object of that Bill is to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Lugano convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments. That convention was drawn up between the member states of the European Community and the member states of the European Free Trade Association, and creates a regime between the states of those two organisations parallel to that of the Brussels convention. Although the provisions of the Lugano convention follow, so far as is appropriate, those of the Brussels convention, the opportunity was taken to incorporate some changes deemed to be necessary in the light of 20 years' experience of the practical operation of the Brussels regime.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04387">Given the parallel nature of these two conventions it was considered desirable by the working party negotiating the Spanish and Portuguese accession convention to take that opportunity to reflect, if I might so call them, the "Lugano improvements", back into the 1968 Brussels convention. Most of those changes are of a minor nature, and I shall not detain your Lordships more than to highlight three of the more significant of them. They affect, in matters of detail, the rules on jurisdiction in Title II of the 1968 convention. The relevant articles in that convention are Articles 5, 6 and 16 relating respectively to contracts of employment; matters relating to a contract where the action may be combined with an
<col>956</col>
action relating to rights <i>in rem,</i> and proceedings having as their object tenancies of property for temporary private use.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04388">Having by those means effected the alignment of the Brussels convention with the Lugano convention, it remains to be considered, as a separate exercise, whether we should now make corresponding adjustments to Parts II and III of the 1982 Act which deal with jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments within the United Kingdom, and jurisdiction in Scotland. Consideration of those matters will begin shortly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04389">For the present, however, I commend the order to your Lordships as a step towards the creation of a common market in judgments, not only within the Community, but also within western Europe as a whole.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04390">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 7th November be approved. <i>[1st Report from the Joint Committee.]&#x2014;(Lord Fraser of Carmyllie.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04391"><member>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships' House is grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate for his explanation of the order. From this side of the House there is no objection in principle to what is regarded as being a useful piece of legislation governing many aspects of enforcement of rights between contracting states, as the noble and learned Lord outlined. The new Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Bill, soon to go through your Lordships' House, will incorporate most of the order in the schedules.<lb/>
I ask the Government whether they would be prepared, from a practitioner's point of view, to issue guidelines as to where the appropriate law can be found. It is not an order which stands on its own. There has been a succession of orders, and practitioners advise me that it takes a long time to set the application to the court in motion. An example of that can be seen in Article 32, which deals with the application.<lb/>
If one puts oneself in the position of a solicitor or counsel being asked what should be done about the application, one turns to Article 32 and finds that it reads as follows:
<quote>"The application shall be submitted&#x2014;in Belgium, to the <i>tribunal de premi&#x00E8;re instance</i> or <i>rechtbank van eerste aanleg</i>".</quote>
Who is that and where is that? Goodness knows&#x0021; It continues,
<quote>"in Denmark, to the <i>byret</i>".</quote>
One could be trivial about that and ask if that is a small cowshed. The article continues,
<quote>"in the Federal Republic of Germany, to the presiding judge of a chamber of the <i>Landgericht</i>".</quote>
I am no linguist, as will no doubt become evident as I go through the clause. The article continues, "in Greece, to the", and then there follow two Greek words which I am totally incapable of translating. I cannot see how any solicitor or counsel could advise his client who to make the application to in Greece. Presumably one sends it by carrier pigeon, hopes it lands somewhere and is accepted.<lb/>
The article further reads,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0518"/>
<col>957</col>
<ul>
<li>"&#x2014;in Spain, to the <i>Juzgado de Primera Instancia,</i></li>
<li>&#x2014;in France, to the presiding judge of the <i>tribunal de grande instance,</i></li>
<li>&#x2014;in Ireland, to the High Court, [no specification]</li>
<li>&#x2014;in Italy, to the <i>carte d'appello,</i></li>
<li>&#x2014;in Luxembourg, to the presiding judge of the <i>tribunal d'arrondissement,</i></li>
<li>&#x2014;in the Netherlands, to the presiding judge of the <i>arrondissementsrechtbank,</i></li>
<li>&#x2014;in Portugal, to the <i>Tribunal Judicial de Circulo".</i></li>
</ul>
The solicitor can advise his client that those are all the places to which the application will be sent in due course, and no doubt disappear for all time. Those phrases are repeated, and I shall not bore your Lordships by repeating them again. I spoke to the noble and learned Lord regarding the matter and the Government have some sympathy with practitioners in that regard. It would be useful if at least the names and addresses of those places detailed in Articles 32, 37 and 40, and Schedule 2, Article 2 could be supplied to practitioners for use when advising clients to whom they should apply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04392"><member>Lord Fraser of Carmyllie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may respond briefly to the point raised by the noble Lord. I am grateful for the general welcome he gave to this useful order. In addition, the Government are most anxious that conventions such as this, once ratified, should achieve the best possible effect in practice, and he is right to highlight that. I am accordingly grateful
<col>958</col>
to the noble Lord for raising a point which is of fundamental importance in the operation of the convention.<lb/>
It might be suggested to the editors of <i>Supreme Court Practice</i>&#x2014;the white book, as it is known&#x2014;that they should consider listing in their commentary to Order 11 the addresses of the courts referred to in the convention. That might be a good way of reaching the widest audience. Certainly that would be true of English practitioners, and it parallels the suggestion that could be made for such a publication in Scotland.<lb/>
However, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord that, in a sense, that is only one side of the problem. It is also necessary that continental practitioners should know the whereabouts of the relevant courts in the United Kingdom. As this is a matter of interest to all the contracting parties, I suggest that the best way forward would be for the United Kingdom to seek to pursue a solution within the Community's working group on judicial co-operation.<lb/>
With those brief remarks, I repeat my thanks to the noble Lord for his comments on the order.<lb/>
On Question, Motion agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Race Relations Complaints: Army Procedure</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04397"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04398">What procedural changes the army board proposes to make when considering complaints under the Race Relations Act 1976 following the judgment of the Divisional Court in the case of <i>Regina</i> v. <i>Army Board of Defence Council, ex parte Anderson.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04399"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are considering in detail what procedural changes are necessary in the light of the judgment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04400"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. Does he agree that it is absolutely essential that the Ministry of Defence should do its best to ensure that young blacks serving in the army are treated with fairness? Is he aware that many of us are seriously concerned about the case?<lb/>
I wish to ask two questions. First, did the Ministry of Defence army board receive legal advice before deciding how to handle the case? Secondly, is it not a matter of serious concern that Mr. Anderson and his representatives were not shown the information which was available to the army board? Is it not worrying that the army board decided, for reasons best known to itself, to adopt a policy of inflexibly refusing to accept oral hearings in such cases? Can the noble Lord assure us that the case will be dealt with expeditiously so that matters are put right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04401"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept entirely the noble Lord's first remarks. It is essential that black soldiers should be treated fairly. In this case, the court found a number of faults in the procedures of the army board. In the reconsideration of the case, procedures will be applied which are consistent with the judgment given. Changes in procedure for any future cases are under consideration. I was asked a specific question concerning legal advice. Legal advice was provided as the case worked its way up the command chain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04402"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the case that, as Lord Justice Taylor reported, the army board not only refused to accept oral evidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, said, but did not meet on this occasion? If so, are there not serious implications in the procedures of the army board which the Government need to address?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04403"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is correct. It is one of the criticisms made of the procedure that the members of the army board did not meet. The intention now is to set up the board of inquiry as quickly as possible.
<col>960</col>
It will conduct a very thorough investigation into all the facts and the different army board members will meet to reconsider the case.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04404">2.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04405"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04406">Whether their pledge to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions is still conditional on the commitments of other nations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04407"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was announced on 25th May that provided other countries took their full share, the Government were prepared to set the demanding target of returning our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to their present levels by the year 2005. This approach recognises that an effective response to climate change can only be achieved through concerted international action. Our target and approach have been recognised both in the agreement reached in the European Community on 29th October and in the Ministerial Declaration of the Second World Climate Conference on 8th November.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04408"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was aware of that. Does the noble Baroness recall that on 12th November when she answered part of the debate on the gracious Speech, she said:
<quote>"This Government made a firm target and will deliver that target". [<i>Official Report,</i> 12/11/90; col. 183.]</quote>
Is that firm target dependent on what other countries do, or is this country prepared to make its firm target irrespective of what the other nations in the international community decide to do?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04409"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is addressing the point about global emissions. Our contribution to those emissions needs to be seen in perspective. It is only 3 per cent. of the total; therefore 97 per cent. of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the responsibility of other countries. I have too short a time at my disposal to catalogue all that is being done by this country. It is a great deal. But unless there is a global approach to the problem, whatever we do in this country will be insignificant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04410"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while fully accepting what my noble friend has said, would there not be an advantage in this country setting an example to the rest of the world in this matter as in some others?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04411"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe this country is setting an example in that we have put global warming firmly on the agenda. My right honourable friend the immediate past Prime Minister called the first conference on this matter. That was followed by a number of other conferences. My right honourable friend pressed&#x2014;I am sure that her successor will continue to do so&#x2014;for the United Nations to agree to an international convention before 1992. That, together with all the practical measures which have been taken, not least those contained within the Environmental Protection Act which has just been put on the statute book, show that a great deal is being
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0520"/>
<col>961</col>
done by this country to establish this matter as an important issue. The steps we have taken show our belief, however, that the only way to resolve this problem is through an international global response.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04412"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do we have a programme for monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the United Kingdom? If there is such a programme, will the Minister tell us about it? Is the Minister aware of a world programme for monitoring emissions? Do we propose to hold regular meetings to discuss this matter, perhaps every two or three years? If Germany can achieve a target of a 15 to 20 per cent. reduction in emissions by the year 2005, why is this country only seeking to stabilise emissions by that time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04413"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by this country between now and the year 2005 is deemed to be 30 per cent. Therefore, even to stabilise at 1990 levels means that a great deal will have to be done. Considerable demands will be made of industry, commerce and all of us to meet this challenge and there will be an impact on the economy of the country. We must keep in mind the balance between sustaining the economy and making a real effort to reduce emissions. I believe that the figures for Germany given by the noble Baroness which predict a level of 7 per cent. are unrealistic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04414"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not everyone is impressed by the argument that we should set an example. We need to obtain results on this issue for the good of the world. It may well be that in promising to meet certain targets by the year mentioned by my noble friend, providing others follow our example, we may achieve what the world really needs in the most practical way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04415"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend makes an interesting point. It is argued that we have set a realistic target which is achievable but which will make demands on industry and commerce. However, the Government are concerned that the economy of the United Kingdom should not be disproportionately affected in achieving those targets if the rest of the world is not going to co-operate in a global response to the issue. I am absolutely convinced that the Government will continue to press for international co-operation. The Government will also in a practical way do what they can to achieve a realistic target without upsetting disproportionately industry and commerce in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04416"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the noble Baroness agree that another reason for the UK to take an initiative is that such an initiative could give rise to useful technical developments which, in view of the worldwide interest in this matter, could have export prospects?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04417"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that again is an interesting point. We have determined a target that is tough but achievable. We believe that an orderly reduction in emissions gives us time to continue research and the promotion of innovative thinking to resolve this matter. Some of the aspirational targets, as I prefer to call them, are rather glibly talked about.
<col>962</col>
They would require almost all our cars being taken off the road; they would require industry to stop producing goods almost overnight. That would be unrealistic and disproportionately disruptive to industry and commerce.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04418"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I right in thinking that the Answer of the Minister to the Question on the Order Paper is yes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04419"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my Answer was not a straightforward yes. I wished to assure noble Lords and people outside the House that the Government are taking a practical and firm approach to stabilising emissions at 1990 levels. As I have outlined, that is a tough target which will make demands on industry and commerce. At the same time I must emphasise that one country alone whose contribution to global warming is only 3 per cent. of the total cannot tackle the problem by itself. Other countries together account for 97 per cent. of emissions. An international co-operative effort is required to make an impact on global warming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04420"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister answer my question about monitoring arrangements?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04421"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot say specifically whether there is one monitoring body. If I obtain any other information, I shall write to the noble Baroness. However, I am sure that monitoring is taking place all the time in order to define what point we have reached and whether we are making progress on reductions. I shall write to the noble Baroness with more details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04422"><member>Lord Hankey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government bear in mind that nuclear power production produces no carbon dioxide?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04423"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right. The figures for France are so impressive because the French have been courageous and have a buoyant nuclear programme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04424"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two points arise from the response of the noble Baroness. First, the figure which she gave about a 30 per cent. increase is directly challenged by all the scientists involved in this matter. The Government have been giving the figure of 30 per cent., but the scientists have found that carbon dioxide per capita in this country stabilised during the 1980s.<lb/>
Secondly&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04425"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04426"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister did not answer the question which I asked. I repeat that question. Although we know that it is necessary to have international co-operation, in view of the fact that other governments have set their targets will the British Government do what the Minister said on 12th November that they would do, namely, make a firm target and deliver that target irrespective of what targets are set in other countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04427"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, regarding the noble Lord's first point, we shall have to differ on the scientific basis on which the prediction of a 30 per cent. increase in emissions was made. If we do nothing
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0521"/>
<col>963</col>
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase. We can argue about whether or not that increase will be 30 per cent., but we know that there will be an increase. It is our intention that that figure should not increase and that emissions should be stabilised at 1990 levels. However, if the figure turns out to be much lower, as the noble Lord has indicated, as a result of our efforts on the basis of a 30 per cent. increase we shall have achieved more than our target by the year 2005 or even earlier. That can only be good. We intend to adopt a realistic target.<lb/>
In answer to the second part of the noble Lord's question, I have said more than once that no stone will be left unturned in the practical efforts that this Government are making to bring CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the 1990 level. This means that considerable demands will be placed on commerce and industry. We shall attempt to achieve that objective in a way that is not disproportionately disruptive for commerce and industry in the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Occupational Pensions: European Court Judgment</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04428">2.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04429"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04430">What steps they intend to take to deal with the confusion that has arisen about occupational pension provision following the European Court judgment in the <i>Barber</i> case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04431"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security (Lord Henley)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are no simple means by which an individual national government can resolve uncertainties to which particular European Court judgments give rise. We are aware of the difficulties facing occupational pension providers following the European Court judgment in the <i>Barber</i> case and are continuing to give close consideration to ways in which its implications may be clarified. In the meantime we recommend that those responsible for occupational pension schemes take legal advice on the implications for their scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04432"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that response. However, is he aware that the legal advice received by pensions consultants has been conflicting? Is he also aware that there seems to be a great deal of difference of opinion as to whether or not the effect of the judgment is retroactive? There is also confusion as to what schemes should now do. If they equalise their pension ages at 60 they could face difficulties because they are not allowed to introduce bridging pensions for men between the ages of 60 and 65. If they try to equalise the ages at 65 there will be difficulties with respect to women employees because many women will consider that their conditions have become worse. Is it possible to issue guidance to resolve the situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04433"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness that the ruling has left some areas unclear, particularly the extent to which it has retrospective
<col>964</col>
effect. The Government are considering carefully what needs to be done about the <i>Barber</i> judgment. We do not believe that it is for the Government to make pronouncements about the interpretation of the judgment. In the final resort it must be a matter for the European Court itself to clarify its own judgments. The Government will consider supporting any case which might provide clarification of the ruling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04434"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that that is not a very satisfactory reply? It is almost the same reply that he gave many months ago when the issue was raised for the first time. If, as a result of the judgment, occupational pension schemes have to provide equal treatment for men and women and in particular equal pension ages, is it not essential that the state scheme should give a lead? What discussions are taking place about the equalisation of retirement ages in the state pension scheme and when will the Government be in a position to announce their decision?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04435"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord knows perfectly well that the <i>Barber</i> case has nothing to do with the state scheme. The state scheme is specifically excluded under European law: the <i>Barber</i> case concerned occupational pension schemes and defined occupational schemes as pay rather than pensions. The noble Lord said that the judgment did, however, affect the state scheme because of the position regarding bridging pensions mentioned by his noble friend Lady Turner. The United Kingdom's permanent representative to the European Community has written to the Commission on behalf of the Government on this matter. We have not yet received a reply. When we receive a reply and the Commission's views are known we shall arrange for them to be made known to interested parties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04436"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must come back to the point. The noble Lord says that the issue has nothing to do with the state pension scheme. The two cannot be divorced. It is almost impossible for occupational pension schemes to operate without taking account of the state pension scheme. The two are interlinked. Because pensions are a long-term business and need a lot of planning, pension schemes have to know what the Government plan to do about the state pension scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04437"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I simply do not accept what the noble Lord says. They are totally separate. The <i>Barber</i> case made it quite clear that occupational pensions were deferred pay and therefore under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome men and women had to be treated equally. Under European law it is possible to maintain separate pension ages. The noble Lord knows perfectly well what the Government's attitude is on the question of the state pension because I spoke on that matter earlier this year in response to the Select Committee report. I said that we recognised the arguments in favour of equalisation but stressed that nevertheless there were many problems relating to demographic and other matters which required careful consideration before we could come to a conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0522"/>
<col>965</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04438"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord accept that this is a matter of very great importance to a great many people? It is not a party matter. We fully understand the Government's difficulties; on the other hand the whole position is extremely confused. The outcome will affect a great many people and it is very difficult for people planning occupational pension schemes to make sensible decisions. When will the Government be able to say that the position is clear enough for us to have a full debate on this extremely important matter? Will they please expedite the matter on a non-party basis?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04439"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was trying to respond on a non-party basis. I am trying to make it clear that it is not for the Government to clarify a decision of the European Court of Justice. Only the European Court itself can clarify what was meant by the decision in the <i>Barber</i> case. As I said, we are quite prepared to involve ourselves if a suitable case can be found which would enable us to seek clarification from the European Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04440"><member>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister address this further point? Do the Government not owe an obligation, as the government of a member state, always to consider the judgments of the European Court and to make sure that our domestic law is not out of line with what they understand to be the overriding obligations of the Community? The Minister admitted that the Government have considered the matter very carefully when he said that the <i>Barber</i> case applies to occupational pensions and not to the state scheme. Can the Government not give some indication of their general view of the case?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04441"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that the decision of the court in the <i>Barber</i> case&#x2014;and I recommend that the noble Lord looks at it&#x2014;is unclear, particularly as it affects the degree of retrospection. That is not a matter on which the Government can pronounce. It is for the court itself to clarify the extent to which the judgment is retrospective. In the meantime, as I have said, we advise all pension schemes to take advice as to how it affects individual schemes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04442"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord realise that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and my noble friends on these Benches have said, this is a matter of great concern to a great many people? Does he not understand that it is not good enough to answer that only the European Court can define precisely what it meant and say whether its judgment is retrospective? The Government should take the initiative and bring the matter before the European Court, either by asking for a declaration or seeking some test case. Is he prepared to look into that and provide clarification of an issue which is at present confused?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04443"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suspect that the noble Lord did not listen to me. I said quite clearly that the Government would seek clarification from the court if a suitable case could be found. The Government cannot go to the court and ask for a declaration.
<col>966</col>
Another case will have to come before the European Court. The Government will consider supporting such a case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04444"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for returning to the Dispatch Box. This is an important matter. Is the noble Lord aware that there is a procedure by which one can obtain a declaration from the European Court on an issue which one puts before the European Court? Is it possible to create a test case immediately if that is the route by which he wants to go?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04445"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me repeat that my understanding is that we can seek clarification if a suitable case can be found. We shall support that case if such a case can be found.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04446"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend the Minister prepared to consider that perhaps there is an area here of serious misconception? Is he prepared to reconsider the position so that the matter is not just left to contradictory advice between individual advisements and that at least some authoritative interpretation, albeit temporary, is made by the Government in order that people understand until the situation changes? Does he agree that the present situation is far from satisfactory?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04447"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I made it quite clear that the Government accept that the present situation is unsatisfactory. As I said, the Government are considering carefully what needs to be done. We are in consultation with all the interested parties and with the European Commission. However, in the end, the matter must be clarified by the European Court itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04448"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord opposite, who is learned in these matters, indicated that a procedure exists whereby we can call upon the European Court to interpret its ruling, short of having a case. Will my noble friend confirm that there is such a procedure as indicated by the noble Lord?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04449"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept, as my noble friend said, that the noble Lord is learned in the law. My understanding is that we could only seek clarification by means of a test case. If I am wrong, I shall be the first to come back to the noble Lord and make the matter quite clear. However, my understanding is that we can only seek clarification by means of a test case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04450">3.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04451"><member>The Earl of Shrewsbury</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04452">Whether the Bank of England has issued or proposes to issue guidelines to recognised banks on the recovery of loans to property companies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04453"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no formal guidelines have been issued by the Bank of England but I understand that the Bank discusses with individual banks the risks associated with loans to property companies as part of their routine, prudential supervision under the Banking Act.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04454"><member>The Earl of Shrewsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that informative reply. I should first declare an interest in that I work in the property sector. Is he aware that some foreign owned banks which operate within the United Kingdom and which took advantage during the 1980s of the boom in commercial property values to lend to companies when the Bank of England was urging caution are now severely lowering their exposure in that sector, with the consequence that borrowers who still have the support of their other bankers are often faced with premature and unnecessary receiverships?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04455"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note the concerns of my noble friend but feel that the terms under which a loan is made and when that loan should be repayable must be matters for the banks and their customers. It would not be right to attempt to influence the banks' commercial judgment in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04456"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister accept that the noble Earl has raised a very serious problem? The property sector is in deep trouble as a result of the recession. It may have overborrowed in times of boom, but that does not mean that banks should foreclose on their loans automatically and suddenly. Such action will land us in exactly the situation both in the property sector and in the banks that we had in the early 1970s. Therefore will he urge the Bank of England to be a little more active in trying to encourage the commercial banks to nurse companies back to health rather than trying to bring them down on a strict commercial basis?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04457"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note the noble Lord's concerns. The situation is different from that in the early 1970s. Banks now have a far lower proportion of their capital invested in property than they had in those days. As I said in answer to my noble friend, I believe that it should be a matter for the banks and their customers as to the terms under which the money is lent and when it should be repayable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04458"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that this is not just a matter of a contract between the banks and the customers? Is it not a very proper role for the Bank of England to issue broad guidelines particularly to foreign banks as to how and in what circumstances they act before they pull the rug from under their customers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04459"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not accept that that is the case. As I said, it should be a matter for the banks themselves and their customers. The Bank of England will intervene on other matters, but not here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04460"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister not accept that it is not in the commercial banks' interest to pull these loans? Does he not think that it is up to the banks, together with the Bank of England&#x2014;they need the reassurance of the Bank of England if they are to nurse companies back to health&#x2014;in their own interest and the national interest to do this on a gradual and orderly basis? It is not just a question of a contract and closing the contract just like that.</membercontribution></p>
<col>968</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04461"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it is not in the banks' interest to pull the loans, I am sure that the banks will take advice from someone as respected in that field as the noble Lord himself and not pull the loans.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04462"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Bank of England has already issued notes of guidance to the commercial banks on the lines that have been suggested?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04463"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. Under the Banking Act the Bank has a duty to ask the incorporated banks to give notice of exposure of capital over a certain percentage. It does not have a duty to give guidelines to the banks on when they should ask property companies to repay their loans or whatever.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04465"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the short debate on the volume of fraud in the conduct of affairs in the European Communities and before the short debate on the future of the Commonwealth, my noble friend Lord Caithness will, with the leave of the House, repeat a Statement that is to be made in another place on the Middle East.<lb/>
With the leave of the House, I should like to say a word about the two short debates standing in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Benson and Lord Greenhill of Harrow. As the mover is allowed 15 minutes and the Minister should rise to reply not less than 20 minutes before the scheduled end of the debate, in the case of the debate in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Benson, that means that all other speeches should be limited to a maximum of 14 minutes and in the case of the debate in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, they should be limited to six minutes.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Fraud in the European Communities</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04466">3.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04467"><member>Lord Benson</member> rose to call attention to the volume of fraud which continues to take place in the conduct of affairs in the European Communities and the case for specific programmes of reform in a number of areas if fraud is to be curtailed; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04468">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the substance of today's debate is well summarised in the Select Committee's report, <i>Fraud against tire Community,</i> dated 21st February 1989. The report reads as follows:
<quote>"The Committee are deeply concerned by the disclosures in this Report. In brief, these are: the loss of huge sums of Community money each year due to fraud and irregularity; weak financial administration, and the absence of adequate controls in so many areas; the failure to detect fraud and to take criminal and civil action when corrupt practices are brought to light, so that fraudsters are allowed to continue to trade; the failure to deploy the audit function properly; and above all, the absence of political will to correct a damaging situation which has existed for years".</quote>
There can scarcely have been a more damaging criticism of a governmental organisation which speaks for 12 first-world countries.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0524"/>
<col>969</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04469">To the best of my knowledge, fraud within the Commission is negligible. The fraud about which we speak takes place in the 12 member states which carry out the Community policies. The Commission has never bothered to ascertain the amount of such fraud but it has been going on for a great many years and various estimates of the amount have been made by different people. They vary between &#x00A3;2 billion and &#x00A3;10 billion every year. The United Kingdom is no better and no worse than the other 11 states.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04470">There is no need for fraud. Each of the big industrial organisations in this country, such as Unilever, ICI, the oil groups and many others, carry on business without fraud taking place within them. They do not carry on business in 12 member states; they carry on business in scores of different countries all over the world. Their transactions are not riddled with fraud because they are carried out by people of integrity and competence, and the audit coverage of their transactions is adequate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04471">Fraud in the Community is rampant because the competence of the people who carry out Community policies is inadequate and audit coverage is unsatisfactory. The basic reason for that state of affairs is the absence of the political will to stop it in the Council of Ministers. Her Majesty's Government have pointed out many times that they are anxious to combat and contain fraud; but they draw attention to the fact that they are only one of the 12 member states and that it is difficult to persuade the other 11 states to take action. There is truth in that. It is due in some degree to the disjointed and uncoordinated structure of the government organisation in Brussels. In particular, it is exacerbated because we are not told of the intentions or decisions of the Council of Ministers. It is further exacerbated because the European Parliament has a mouth but no teeth.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04472">That is not the only reason. It is true, as I shall explain later, that concerted action from the top is necessary in many cases, but any one of the 12 member states could easily take the initiative in their own territory to, in some degree, contain the fraud that is taking place in their areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04473">Those persons who inhabit the corridors of power may take refuge in the fact that in 1988 an anti-fraud co-ordination unit was set up in the Community. The Select Committee pointed out that it could not possibly deal with the subject because the fraud unit has neither the power nor the authority to make the changes necessary. I hope that no one in the course of the debate will suggest that the anti-fraud coordination unit will eradicate fraud in the Community. If anyone were to do so, I fear that they would be misleading themselves and, worse still, they would be misleading the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04474">Fraud and irregularity in the Community can be stopped only by concerted action taken by the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the 12 member states working together on an agreed programme. There is nothing vague or doubtful about the nature of that programme. The Select Committee pointed out with unassailable logic that if fraud is to be contained,
<col>970</col>
the causes of fraud must be removed. By analogy, if aeroplane crashes arise because there are structural weaknesses in the aeroplane, the structural weaknesses must be removed or the crashes will continue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04475">The Select Committee itself identified 13 major causes of fraud in the Community, and there are others. All will have to be tackled separately and eradicated. It is a most considerable problem. It will take a year to prepare the programme, and about five years to implement it. It should also be the subject of an annual report by the Court of Auditors to inform the public and the Community as to whether the programme is up to date. No government department, no Minister, no institution, no member state, no individual has, as far as I know, ever formulated the outline of such a programme and put it before the Council of Ministers and the other institutions affected so that the appropriate decisions can be made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04476">On 13th April 1989 the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, said in this Chamber that he hoped that such a programme would be devised and its implementation monitored. Nothing has been done. It is a formidable task and it needs the help and skill of professional lawyers and accountants. I gravely doubt whether the Commission or any of the member states, including this country, have the necessary administrative skills to handle the job properly. Perhaps I may therefore put a question to the Minister who will answer the debate: when will such a programme be prepared? Will it be monitored by the Court of Auditors, as suggested by the Select Committee?</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04477">What I have described so far is only one reason why fraud is rampant in the Community. Every organisation which engages in financial transactions finds it necessary to have those transactions reviewed by independent auditors at least once a year. The Court of Auditors in the Community was set up in 1977, largely on the initiative of the United Kingdom, and it has done good work; but both resources and objectives now need to be restructured. What is of imperative importance is that the Court of Auditors should have the right, and exercise the right, to pursue its inquiries in the member states and then to report accordingly. If it cannot do that on its own account, it should do it through the medium of the Audit Office in the territory concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04478">The precise changes needed in the structure of the Court of Auditors are set out in paragraphs 196 to 203 of the Select Committee's report. The House will also have noticed last week when we debated the report prepared by the committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, that it drew special attention to the need to restructure the Court of Auditors to remove the present deficiencies. Perhaps I may now put a second question to the Minister: will he tell the House when that restructuring of the Court of Auditors will take place?</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04479">There is a third reason why fraud is rampant in the Community. For years the Council of Ministers has not dealt properly, or at all, with the serious criticisms which appear in every report that the Court of Auditors writes. If directors of industrial organisations in this country behaved in a similar way their
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0525"/>
<col>971</col>
efforts would soon be the subject of a DTI inquiry or possibly even of the Serious Fraud Office. Perhaps I may put a third question to the Minister: will he tell us when the Council of Ministers will be prepared to accept that basic responsibility for financial administration which rests on its shoulders, and when will it be willing to alter its ways?</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04480">Fraud in the Community is a growth industry. It will not stop of its own accord. It will not go away. It is like a cancer eating into the body of the Community. It needs relentless determination to get rid of it. I shall quote the short penultimate paragraph of the report:
<quote>"The huge sums which are being lost due to fraud and irregularity against the Community are losses borne by all the taxpayers and traders of Europe. This strikes at the roots of democratic societies, bound as they are on the rule of law and its enforcement, and is a public scandal".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04481">In the past two years while the subject has been before the House, I have gained the impression that no fewer than four or five Ministers have been dealing with it. Indeed, the evidence given to the Select Committee was that there was no consistency in the individuals who represented the United Kingdom in Europe when the matter was under consideration in Brussels. I cannot help feeling that this subject is being shunted about from department to department and from Minister to Minister because nobody is prepared to handle a hot potato. I shall put a fourth question to the Minister. Which government department and which Minister has been responsible during the past two years for cleaning up this public scandal?</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04482">It may help to focus the debate if I repeat the four questions that I have asked. I do not do so because I wish to weary the House with repetition but for a particular reason. On numerous occasions during the past two years the Government have been asked to publish a White Paper and they have resolutely refused to do so. That was an unwise and imprudent decision because, if we are on notice of a public scandal which has been continuing for many years, both the public and Parliament are entitled to know how the Government intend to deal with the matter. It follows that, if the Minister is able to give strong and affirmative answers to my questions, the House can be assured that in due time fraud will be contained, although it may take years. However, if the answers are weak and indeterminate, the House will be on notice that fraud and the public scandal will continue unabated for many years to come.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04483">I shall repeat the four questions that I asked. When will a comprehensive programme of reform and an annual report from the Court of Auditors upon that be introduced? When will the necessary changes in the powers and functions of the Court of Auditors be introduced? When will the Council of Ministers observe accepted standards of financial administration and deal properly with the auditors' criticisms? During the past two years, which department and which Minister has been charged with the task of eliminating this public scandal? My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<col>972</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04484">3.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04485"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Benson, for his authoritative exposition and for introducing the debate. He explained the formidable professional task which lies ahead in preparing a programme and he gave an estimate or five years for implementation. It is my purpose to concentrate only on certain aspects of that programme.<lb/>
Before doing so, it is with respect that I suggest to the noble Lord that any criticism of Her Majesty's Government in this regard, or any particular department of state, is wholly wide of the mark. On any objective analysis, the true criticism lies with the Council of Ministers for lack of political will without which no single member state can make any progress.<lb/>
The debate takes place in the wake of last Thursday's main debate on this 27th Report. For the sake of accuracy, today's debate is concerned with paragraphs 130, 166 and 167 and recommendation 217 of that report. In last Thursday's debate they were endorsed by the Minister who said that the roles of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors should be strengthened and that national parliaments need to be more involved in national life. For want of time only the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition assented to that suggestion <i>sub silentio.</i> In that context, my noble friend Lord Aldington said that the Court of Auditors and the European Court of Justice must be given the resources and structure to do their job properly.<lb/>
This subject raises no political issue which divides your Lordships' House or another place. The singular and strenuous initiative on Community fraud taken by my right honourable friend the immediate past Prime Minister commands a tribute from all sides of your Lordships' House, and from all subjects and citizens in all the member states of the European Community. I shall deal with the reason why that initiative failed in a moment. In this context, it is not to the point what form of monetary system or systems may evolve in the European Community. The point is that the foundations of any monetary system are eroded unless steps are taken to tackle and debilitate the hydra; that is, Community fraud.<lb/>
Over the years my right honourable friend saw that as of the order of priorities together with agreed cuts in farm subsidies&#x2014;that fertile field for Community fraud&#x2014;and rightly so. The hope must be that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister will bring that initiative to a speedy and successful conclusion. The report of the Select Committee stresses the urgency of the situation and refers to three previous reports of your Lordships' Select Committees: the Sixth Report of 1986&#x2013;87, the Court of Auditors' Report of 1988&#x2013;89 and the Fraud Against the Community Report of 21st February 1989. That is the report to which the noble Lord, Lord Benson, referred and which vents deep anxiety about the losses borne by all taxpayers and traders in Europe occasioned year by year by fraud, irregularity, weak financial administration and absence of adequate controls. In its 27th Report your Lordships' committee concluded that none of the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0526"/>
<col>973</col>
evidence heard conflicted with the evidence given to the Court of Auditors' Select Committee. When the Council of Ministers reports to the European Parliament, as it must each year, on the Court of Auditors&#x2014;and I quote,
<quote>"they should state what action should be taken and if none, why not".</quote>
Why not, indeed? The reason why the Council of Ministers spurned the initiative of my right honourable friend in this regard, and on occasions juggled with the agenda, is not shrouded in the mist of speculation. As the noble Lord, Lord Benson, truly stated, fraud takes place in the member states. The reason is all too plain. The member states are unwilling to foot the Bill to set up the requisite structure and resources or indeed to accept on behalf of each member state the substantial cost of sanctions in default.<lb/>
Therefore, the immediate priority is to generate at the Council of Ministers the political will to which the noble Lord, Lord Benson, referred. Unless that is done, it is no use complaining that Her Majesty's Government under this, that or any other administration have not done enough because one cannot do anything at that Council of Ministers' level unless the political will is generated. The criticism lies there.<lb/>
Also, there must be the will to set up an effective system of administration and control, and to establish a system of effective sanctions against member states whose institutions are found to be in default. To that end, subordinate legislation, directives and regulations must be introduced at Community level, and primary implementing legislation must be enacted in each of the member states.<lb/>
No doubt other noble Lords will consider in some detail the recommendations in paragraph 183 of the <i>Fraud Against the Community</i> Report and paragraphs 166 and 167 of the 27th Report. It would not be right to weary your Lordships with the details, and I do not propose to do so. However, it is plain beyond doubt that in order to control that criminal and highly profitable activity, sanctions must be introduced which bite on the budgets of the defaulting member states. Also, the Court of Auditors must be able to implead defaulting institutions and member states in the Court of Justice. Powers of investigation of the Commission into the operation with the Court of Auditors and the national authorities must be increased. The national authorities must have sufficient resources and trained staff to afford effective supervision of domestic controls.<lb/>
I ask the Minister to confirm that the magnificent initiative, although it failed, which was taken by the Thatcher administration will not be allowed to abate or lie fallow under this Administration, and that it will now be pursued with the utmost vigour at Council of Ministers' level. I ask also, because it is such an important subject, that progress or lack of it may from time to time be reported to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<col>974</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04486">3.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04487"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will have good cause to thank the noble Lord, Lord Benson, for taking this opportunity once again to raise the question of fraud which was dealt with nearly two years ago by the Select Committee under the able chairmanship of the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Benson, has been a tower of strength in these matters. In this House during the past 18 months he has consistently raised this question and I feel confident &#x2014;and I offer my own support to the noble Lord in this respect&#x2014;that he will not rest until some effective action is seen to be taken in this sphere.<lb/>
In his remarks the noble Lord mentioned, as did the report to which he referred, the crucial importance of the reports produced from time to time by the Court of Auditors. Perhaps it is rather unfortunate that by the time those reports are eventually available, it is one year after the year to which they refer. The matters have then tended to become somewhat obsolete. Immediate steps should be taken to ensure that the Court of Auditors' report is published immediately on completion rather than having to wait for many months for the observations of the Commission on the report. That takes many months to prepare and it ensures that the report is always long delayed. There is no reason why the Court of Auditors' report, damning as some of those have been, should not be made available immediately. In this country when a committee reports, the report is published and the Government submit their own observations somewhat later in a separate document. That practice would mean that every auditor's report could be considered on its own merits without having to wait for the replies of the Commission.<lb/>
I do not wish to go into the matters already covered by the noble Lord, Lord Benson, because time does not permit. However, one matter is certain and is revealed in the Select Committee's report. The greater part of fraud, running into billions of pounds, arises from the operation of the common agricultural policy, and in particular that section of it which deals with export rebates; that is, compensation is given to exporters, to third countries outside the Community, at a rate which will not compete internally with the price of the food which is exported. Those export rebates paid to producers in this country are frequently many times the world price at which they are sold. That creates consequences, which are impossible to deal with in the limited time, on the food markets of the world and in particular on the part played by developing countries in those markets.<lb/>
It is sufficient to say that as long as the common agricultural policy system operates, and in particular the system of export rebates, there is an open invitation to fraud. That has not in any way mitigated since the Select Committee's report was published over 18 months ago in February 1989. We learn from <i>The Times</i> on 10th November that food mountains are once again accumulating. I shall not read out the figures because that takes time but those figures can be
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0527"/>
<col>975</col>
studied in the edition of <i>The Times</i> to which I have referred. Beef, butter and all kinds of food mountains are beginning to accumulate on a scale similar to that which existed three or four years ago, before the Select Committee's report was published. Once again the opportunities for fraud arise.<lb/>
One matter that exasperates the noble Lord, Lord Benson, and me is the apparent inactivity that has existed since the matter was first drawn to the Government's attention. It was drawn to the Government's attention long before the setting up of the Select Committee on fraud. Your Lordships will recall that I raised the question of fraud in the Community with the noble Lord, Lord Young. His reaction was to minimise it. When the Commission was visited in Brussels as part of the investigation, its reaction was also to minimise the significance of the matter.<lb/>
What is required is for Her Majesty's Government to treat the fraud that takes place within the territory of the United Kingdom as a serious crime worthy of serious investigation and with a view to the strict enforcement of the law. That is what is required, and what occurs when fraud arises in other fields; for example, in social security. Some of the poorer sections of our community are quite rightly prosecuted for fraud in connection with social security payments. The whole might of the state descends upon them. Hundreds of new inspectors are appointed.<lb/>
What happens in the European Community? I discern that so far the attitude of the Government towards fraud in the Community and in regard to the common agricultural policy involving billions of pounds is not to treat it with the same degree of seriousness with which minor crimes in the country are treated. It is time some effort was made involving expense and the reinforcement of the police and prosecution authorities in order that that attitude may be changed. Instead, as we are likely to hear again this afternoon&#x2014;I do not wish to anticipate the noble Lord&#x2014;we shall hear soothing words regarding the kind of organisational arrangements that are likely to be put in motion in the next year or so, the kind of governmental consultations that are taking place, and the kind of new committees that are being considered. What is required is action.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Benson, referred to political will. I do not believe, and I challenge contradiction, that there is the political will in the Council of Ministers necessary to tackle the problem. There is a tendency among member states to regard the frauds committees within their territory and enjoyed by their citizens, corrupt though they may be, as part of their own national pay-off out of the CAP.<lb/>
In that connection, it is of particular interest to the United Kingdom. There is a two-tier Europe that is not mentioned. The first tier are countries that pay. The Federal Republic of Germany contributes between &#x00A3;3.5 billion to &#x00A3;4 billion per annum to the Community budget, and the United Kingdom contributes &#x00A3;2.2 billion every year. The second tier
<col>976</col>
comprises the remainder that receive. I have no doubt that the enthusiasm in the countries that receive is not as intense as that among the countries which pay.<lb/>
The problem is long-standing. It did not even begin at the time of the meetings that took place, and which were commented upon by the Select Committee, on the control of Community finance. At that time it was proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the council, as a council, had no real will to control Community expenditure. It is time that the problem was taken seriously. I sincerely hope that the Government will at long last pay attention. They may not pay attention to me even though I, together with my colleague Sir Michael Shaw, drew it to the notice of the European Parliament as long ago as 1978 and 1979 in a report to which I can draw the attention of noble Lords. Something must be done now. I hope that at last the Government will be able to give some satisfactory reply to the very important contribution made to the debate by the noble Lord, Lord Benson.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04488">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04489"><member>Lord Templeman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the members of the judicial committee of your Lordships' House have a good deal of practical experience of fraud, of its ramifications both in this country and abroad and of its serious effects on the innocent people who suffer from it. I hope therefore it will be thought appropriate that I should rise to support the work of the sub-committee and express the hope that the many necessary reforms indicated in the report will be actively pursued.<lb/>
The suspected scale of fraud in the Community is shattering. The estimates vary from &#x00A3;2 billion to &#x00A3;6 billion a year, or 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the Community budget, although one characteristic of fraud is that its scope is incapable of measurement. Moreover, fraud begets fraud. Unless detention and punishment are swift and sure the problem is bound to become worse.<lb/>
In the report there are four principal reforms for the containment and reduction of fraud in the Community to which I should like to draw attention. The first is the reduction of the incentives and opportunities for fraud by a reduction in the expenditure of the Community and the need to raise revenue. Fraud is practised in connection with expenditure and also in connection with revenue. Therefore a reduction of both is bound to lead to a reduction of fraud. In most cases the reduction of expenditure will have the effect of removing an obstacle to free trade and fair competition.<lb/>
In the report the remarks of Mr. Carey, the United Kingdom member of the Court of Auditors, and Mr. Tomlinson of the European Parliament drew attention to frauds practised in connection with export refunds. In paragraph 74 they say that the solution lies in lowering Community support prices. The report continues:
<quote>"It was the fact that these were so much higher than world prices that determined the huge sums involved in export refunds. This created the incentive to manipulate the system. A huge proportion of a trader's income could be made up of export refunds".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0528"/>
<col>977</col>
As long as support prices continue at the same level, administration of export refunds will continue to entail a significant risk of fraud as well as substantial budgetary costs. They say that if we reduce the incentive we shall reduce the fraud.<lb/>
The second main reform proposed in the report is the simplification of regulations. Paragraph 27 on page 12 deals with the common customs tariff. There are 4,000 product codes for agricultural goods alone; for processed goods there are 932 product codes, 1,416 standard recipes and 14,000 non-standard recipes. That degree of precision allows different levies for biscuits depending on the cereal, milk, fat and sugar content. But it also increases the complexity of the system for customs authorities and traders alike and the scope for fraud due to misdescription. One can imagine the traders picking their way through the regulations trying to find something to enable them to pretend to fall into one category rather than another.<lb/>
The same is true of export refunds. They vary between 11 zones. In paragraph 60, on page 70, the committee comments that four companies in Denmark were estimated to have netted &#x00A3;530,000 by pretending to send goods to one zone&#x2014;namely, the Caribbean&#x2014;but in fact sending them to the United States. The report refers, at paragraph 63, to 3,000 regulations giving, in the words of Mr. Tomlinson,
<quote>"a 'flood of legislation' leading to a 'chaos of ill-understood paper'".</quote>
It is perhaps not surprising that if the United Kingdom Customs and Excise advice to traders was placed in a pile it would be seven inches high. It is inevitable that there will be discrepancies and inconsistencies between member states and that the opportunities for fraud and irregularities will be enhanced. In other words, the more complicated the system, the more the fraudster can pick his way between one return and the next.<lb/>
The third principal reform is the improvement of machinery for the detection and punishment of frauds. Paragraphs 33 and 66 refer to the need for more frequent and more detailed customs examination, though it must be said that that would cause delay and resentment. It is always difficult to strike the right balance between sufficient examination, particularly at the borders of states, and causing more resentment than the inspections are worth.<lb/>
Paragraph 94 draws attention to the criticisms made by the European Court of Auditors on the checks on documents made by member states. For example, in 1987 some 80 irregularities were discovered in Italy but practically none in Denmark or Greece. The charming picture conjured up by that statistic of all the innocent Danes and Greeks basking on the beach while only the wicked Italians are practising fraud is quite misleading. The statistics on what is reported bear no resemblance to the actual incidence of fraud in any one country. I do not suggest that Denmark and Greece are any worse than others, but I decline on that evidence to believe that they are necessarily much better than others. In that respect, as the noble Lord, Lord Benson, pointed out, there is
<col>978</col>
substantial fraud in this country. It does not extend (as most evils always extend in the Community) to all the other member states except the one to which one belongs.<lb/>
Paragraph 97 refers to the need for the exchange of information between member states. The Serious Fraud Office describes speedy co-operation as absolutely essential. There is no real drive in the machinery to ensure that what one member state discovers another is informed about. Therefore, one fraudster may be under investigation and regarded with heavy suspicion in one state while another state is handing out subsidies to him with a free hand as though he were as white as snow.<lb/>
The fourth proposed reform is an increase and improvement in surveillance by the European Court of Auditors, the Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments. It is clear that the whole of this work of detection and punishment depends on everybody using their best endeavours and playing their part. I do not accept the words of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, who was inclined to think that the world is divided into 11 fraudsters and two innocent member states. Fraud is endemic throughout the Community, in countries which pay and in countries which receive. I agree with the noble Lord that it is a great pity that we should pay more than we receive, but that does not measure the long-term benefits arising from the Community. The Community is our ticket; we pay for it and we receive extraordinary benefits from it.<lb/>
Paragraphs 183 and 186 to 203 summarise the main proposals. It is fair to say that if all those proposals were carried out with the speed for which the noble Lord, Lord Benson, is pressing a very great improvement would take place. I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Benson, who spoke of fraud as a cancer eating away at society. Fraud and corruption go hand in hand and we can see in many parts of the world whole societies being ruined, not only economically but morally and materially, by corruption and fraud which it is impossible to stop. The more fraud there is, the more tempting it is and the more difficult it is for states to assert themselves and restore an element of order.<lb/>
I commend this report to your Lordships and I sincerely hope that it will be put into effect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04491"><member>Lord Bethell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with noble Lords in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Benson, on his initiative in introducing this debate on a vital subject affecting every citizen in the European Community. The noble Lord indicated that European Community fraud could be as high as &#x00A3;10 billion a year. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Templeman, suggested that it might be as high as &#x00A3;6 billion a year. The discrepancy in the figures indicates the enormity of the problem and the fact that we do not know how large it is. Certainly, however, it is very large and every possible effort must be made to combat it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Benson, said that the European Parliament has a voice but no teeth in this
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0529"/>
<col>979</col>
matter. With respect, it would be appropriate for me to clarify the European Parliament's role in this problem, as I see it, and to show that in Strasbourg and Brussels we have certain ways of assisting the other institutions and national parliaments in the struggle against European fraud.<lb/>
Many noble Lords will recall the result of the hearings held in the European Parliament in January 1989 which gave widespread publicity to the problem throughout this country and the Continent. The estimates given in the debate of the billions of pounds a year and the 10 or 15 per cent. which may be lost through fraud gave an impetus&#x2014;a burr under the saddle, so to speak&#x2014;to those who are endeavouring to bring this matter from the back burner to the desk where it needs to be tackled.<lb/>
The European Parliament, therefore, has a role in invigilating and in supervising the institutions of the Community; to some extent the Commission, but mainly the Council of Ministers which does, after all, report to the European Parliament on a regular basis in this regard. The European Parliament has a role in forming the legislation which is often misused by the fraudsters. Together with the Council of Ministers' working groups and the Ministers, who eventually have the last word in most of the laws, the European Parliament can make sure that laws are put together in such a way as to make fraud more difficult. I hope your Lordships agree that what is required is not so much detection and punishment but prevention. At present the laws are so complicated that it is difficult to deal with fraudsters and much easier for the criminal to exploit loopholes.<lb/>
It will not be easy for the European Parliament or, indeed, for the Commission, to deal with any problem of detection and prosecution. The unit for the fight against fraud, set up by the Commission in the wake of the European Parliament hearings, is a step forward, but it has only 20 people working for it. It has had some successes, in particular in dealing with fraud that involved fish passing through Greenland and machinery that was diverted from Bulgaria via Malta. That involved hundreds of thousands of pounds rather than the millions or billions of pounds mentioned by previous speakers.<lb/>
A small unit such as the one that the Commission has set up cannot be a kind of super-European FBI, a troubleshooter to deal with the criminals and to put them where they belong. It should be the main function of the Commission in this area, helped by the European Parliament, to make the laws more simple and appropriate for dealing with fraud and for making it harder to commit.<lb/>
For instance, there should be provision in law for the checking of documents in order that fraudsters may be more easily caught. It should be possible to check suspicious cargoes and transactions against bank accounts; it should be possible to check suspicious transactions against manifests and movement orders involving ships, aircraft and trains. In this way it would be possible to prosecute certain criminals. The knowledge that such checks were
<col>980</col>
taking place would, I hope, be a deterrent to the criminal and discourage him or her from embarking on fraud in the first place.<lb/>
Previous speakers have rightly indicated that the main duty lies with the Council of Ministers. It is a fair point that one cannot look at a country's list of criminals and prosecutions and say that that country is more guilty than another because it has so many more cases. The opposite may be the case. The absence of cases of fraud may simply mean that the authorities in the country in question are doing nothing about it.<lb/>
As regards the forces of law and order, there is a limit to what the national parliament or government can do about the problem in each country. The legislature is not charged with the enforcement of law and order. It can invigilate, supervise, and encourage and press Ministers. The main burden in this country must be on HM Customs and Excise and, in the final analysis, on the police. I hope that at the end of this debate the Minister will be able to give some information about how the customs and the police are faring in their struggle against European Community fraud in this country. If there are any hints or tips that he can suggest that might be brought to the attention of other governments about how their forces of law and order can tackle this kind of crime, that would be very useful as well.<lb/>
I have some sympathy with the previous speaker who said that the problem will not go away until we have finally settled the question of serious agricultural surpluses. When there is opportunity for serious crime and for the making of huge illegal profits, then criminals will always be found who will exploit it. In a similar way, it is hard to see how the drug traffic will be stamped out. So much money is available to be used in that traffic. It is not easy to see how the agricultural aspects of EC fraud can be done away with so long as the export rebate system remains as it is.<lb/>
I am encouraged by the thought that certain steps along the road to doing away with massive export refunds are being taken even though the agricultural surpluses have now unhappily returned. I believe that member states have come round to the view that a system of extremely generous export refunds in agriculture is inappropriate and that over a period of years it should be phased down or even phased out. Then the incentive for large-scale EC fraud in agriculture would no longer exist.<lb/>
I believe that the European Parliament does have a role to play in this important matter. EC fraud shocks the people who elect us to the Strasbourg parliament. As taxpayers they are quite right to be shocked at the thought of their hard-earned money going into the pockets of criminals. I hope that we shall work together with the other institutions and national parliaments in order to see that this scourge is finally done away with.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04493"><member>Lord Seebohm</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has already been pointed out that the question of fraud and negligence&#x2014;there is very little difference between them&#x2014;was
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0530"/>
<col>981</col>
considered by the Select Committee in 1988. There was a debate in your Lordships' House in April 1989. There is no point in having a rerun of that debate today. It may be thought that it is a little early to raise the matter again. However, the subject is so serious that it cannot be allowed to drift any longer. Therefore, I am sure that my noble friend Lord Benson is absolutely right in raising it once more.<lb/>
By way of introduction I shall quote a short extract from evidence given to the Select Committee by Mr. John Tomlinson, MEP, in answer to a question put by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. Mr. Tomlinson said:
<quote>"When I see the extent to which governments can find the time and the will and all the other ingredients to pursue arguments over relatively small amounts, I feel it amazing that they cannot find the same degree of time, energy and effort over the amount of money that is leaking from the Community budget to the detriment of member states and individual taxpayers".</quote>
He went on to say:
<quote>"I would particularly refer to a study that was done in Sweden by the National Crime Prevention Board where they examined the whole import and export trade through a number of custom points over a period of time and their estimation was that there was 50 per cent. of fraud or negligence in the transactions".</quote>
Admittedly, Sweden is not a member of the Community, but most of its trade is with the Community. If fraud continues on that scale in Sweden, it is likely to be even greater elsewhere.<lb/>
What was more illuminating was the evidence given by Professor Tiedemann, who had made a special study of fraud in Germany. He estimated that the equivalent of &#x00A3;3 billion to &#x00A3;5 billion of fraud took place in that country annually. It appears that as the loss is to the Community budget and not to the member state there is no incentive or will to attack the problem or even to convict criminals when they are caught. I suppose that there is a natural tendency in all countries to cheat the public sector, whether it is transport, taxation, or whatever, and to treat it as fair game. The practices in the Community are completely unacceptable.<lb/>
At the time of the inquiry the total complement of the European Court of Auditors was 300, and of those 65 were totally occupied in translating documents into the nine languages of the Community. It also included secretarial and administrative staff. What has happened since? An additional inspectorate of 100 would cost peanuts in comparison with the money at stake. Another powerful weapon that could and should be used is maximum publicity for the findings of the inspectorate. Such information should be given to the press. I can imagine an interesting regular column in the <i>Financial Times</i> and perhaps even in the <i>Daily Mirror.</i> However, internationally this vast monetary problem must be tackled systematically.<lb/>
I suggest that figures should be reported monthly to ECOFIN and to the appropriate committee of the European Parliament. I also hope that a full report will be given annually to both Houses of Parliament. I trust that similar action will be taken by other member states and that possibly references will be
<col>982</col>
made to the IGC. According to the figures given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Templeman, we are talking about frauds which could amount to 15 per cent. of the total Community budget. I believe that the figure could be far higher. Member states should be required to give the court whatever information it requires from the national audit bodies and the relevant departments to carry out its task. I look forward to hearing the Government's reply to the debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04494">4.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04495"><member>The Earl of Perth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when the noble Lord, Lord Benson, asked me whether I would take part in the debate I hesitated. He is a very old friend of mine; he and I used to work together when he was head of Cooper Brothers. I felt that I had to take him seriously. That being the case I read the report and its proposals for putting a stop to the vast frauds which go on in the Community and which hitherto have gone on virtually unpunished. I am speaking today because the noble Lord, Lord Benson, asked me to do so and because it is clear that something must be done, and done soon.<lb/>
I have a second reason for speaking. I am a strong supporter of and believer in the European Community. I worked closely with Jean Monnet&#x2014;the father of Europe&#x2014;before the war. After the war, although I no longer worked with him in the same capacity, I was naturally anxious to see his good work succeed. I am sure that, if he were now alive, he, who was essentially a practical man, would back all that has been said today on the need for the Community and the member states to put their house in order. I knew, as many noble Lords knew, that some kind of racket&#x2014;I use the word advisedly&#x2014;was going on in the agricultural world. One heard about cattle being driven across a border and then being driven back again. It was perhaps something to joke about.<lb/>
Most people in this country and in the Community have no conception of the degree of damage and the cost to the taxpayer resulting from such fraud. If they did know&#x2014;and they ought to know&#x2014;we might expect a much stronger reaction. One has the feeling, as the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, and other speakers have said, that member states do not care too much. I hope that the noble Lord is wrong. I am sure that if we could make clear what is happening there is a good chance that the problems could be put right. One of the real troubles is the complexity of the regulations. I suggest that the European Community and all its parts should pause in the good work they are doing and look at what is happening now. If they did so, a great deal could be done in the way of simplification. We should simplify matters and make the regulations less complicated and more easily understood.<lb/>
The top priority must be to stop corruption. The Council should consider pausing for a moment and getting down to this important business. The noble Lord, Lord Bethell, said that a fraud squad of 20 members has recently been appointed. That figure is a joke. We do not want to see unnecessary staff and bureaucracy, but that consideration does not apply in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0531"/>
<col>983</col>
this case. What does it mean? If the fraud squad does its work properly&#x2014;and I feel confident that it will&#x2014;we shall benefit greatly.<lb/>
I only wish that the media would pay more attention to this question. It is perhaps unfortunate that there has been so much on other affairs to occupy them over the past week. I do not blame the media for that but we must try in every way to ensure that what is happening is widely known. This debate should help matters along. Perhaps the new Prime Minister, hot from the Treasury, with the help of, let us say, Mr. Hurd, if he is Foreign Secretary, will agree that in this area we should do all we can for the member states and for the Community.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Benson, and others referred to the need for political will. I am sure that that is right. The noble Lord asked four questions of the Government. I believe that a fifth question should be asked. Will the Government give an undertaking that they will make an annual report to both Houses on the progress being made, or not being made, in relation to fraud matters? If they do so, I hope that they will be able to give us many facts and figures. That is one of the problems. We have insufficient information about what is happening, and, as these matters are criminal, the information is kept under the blanket.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04496">4.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04497"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the report of your Lordships' Select Committee on fraud against the Community, published in February 1989 and debated in this House on 13th April 1989, put forward far-reaching proposals as to the remedies needed to deal with the problem. It also set a timetable of two to five years for the implementation of those proposals. When introducing the report for debate in the House, I concluded with the words:
<quote>"I suggest that within a year or 18 months a further debate &#x2026; should take place to see where the Community has reached and what our further contributions should be".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 13/4/89; col. 432.]</quote>
I am therefore deeply grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Benson, for giving us this opportunity today to review progress exactly 18 months after our last debate.<lb/>
I was sad not to be able to be present in the House last Thursday when the Select Committee report on European monetary and political union was debated. I was abroad at the time. I have read very carefully the speeches made in the debate. I particularly welcome the proposals in the report in relation to the Court of Auditors. The report on monetary and political union contained an additional proposal which did not appear in the report on fraud in the Community. I refer to the recommendation that the Court of Auditors should be asked for advice on how, when drafting new legislation for implementation by member states, the risk of fraud can best be avoided.<lb/>
I agree 100 per cent. with the noble Lord, Lord Benson, that the causes of fraud, where they exist today, must be removed. However, we must also be careful that we do not create new causes of fraud by introducing legislation which contains loopholes. Incidentally, the practice of consulting qualified chartered accountants and auditors is a practice which
<col>984</col>
takes place in this country when the Treasury consults the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the Finance Bill. Therefore, there is a precedent for following that exact procedure.<lb/>
Initially, after the publication of the fraud report, in meetings with the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, there seemed to be real concern about the problem and some remedial measures were taken. One of them was the reduction in the number of product classifications in the field of agricultural goods from the ludicrous 14,000 non-standard codes mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Templeman, to 4,000 codes. Nevertheless, by no means enough has been achieved.<lb/>
However, it is not only classification; something must be done about the export refunds which are paid at different levels when the export takes place in different countries. Mr. Carey, the British member of the Court of Auditors mentioned the following ludicrous situation in a speech on 19th April 1990. If a country exports cheese&#x2014;for example, Parmigiano Reggiano, a special kind of cheese&#x2014;which is,
<quote>"not grated or powdered of a fat content by weight not exceeding 40&#x0025; and a water content calculated by weight, of the non-fatty matter not exceeding 47&#x0025; [it] would attract a refund weight of 190 ECU per 100 kg if exported to Sweden but zero if exported to Norway and Finland".</quote>
If anyone can tell me what is the difference between Sweden, Finland and Norway&#x2014;and I come from one of those countries &#x2014;I should like to know. This is a situation which we must remedy.<lb/>
Some most important proposals in the fraud report have not been implemented. There does not seem to have been any increased use of publicity when cases of fraud are detected. Many recommendations in the report may necessitate legislation, but an increase in the level of publicity when fraud is detected would not necessitate legislation. Such measures could be taken as from this moment. However, this has not happened. I suggest that one of the greatest forms of deterrent to fraud is the risk of it being publicised. Moreover, so far as I know, no move has been made to reform the system of advance payment for FEOGA guarantee expenditure. These advance payments act as a disincentive for member states to pursue fraud, as the state suffers a loss if the fraudster goes bankrupt or cannot be traced.<lb/>
Above all, as the noble Lord, Lord Benson, so ably stated, there seems to be no evidence that the Community has initiated any real re-thinking about the audit function within the Community. There is a crying need for an increase of staff in the Court of Auditors if it is to be able properly to monitor the reports of the national audit authorities.<lb/>
As many noble Lords have said, the Council of Ministers still seems to lack the political will to take proper note of criticisms and recommendations made in the reports of the Court of Auditors; for example, giving reasons why no action is to be taken in certain cases. I should have thought that that was the least we could expect. Although the Commission is now committed to preparing an annual report on fraud, I
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0532"/>
<col>985</col>
believe that it would have been preferable, and much more appropriate, if a strengthened Court of Auditors had carried out that task.<lb/>
The possible enlargement of the Community by entry applications from the EFTA countries puts new pressure on the need for a thorough review of the remedies required to combat fraud against the Community. I have just returned from an eight-day visit to Stockholm. The change in attitude in the countries of the North towards entry into the European Community was very much in evidence. I believe that within the very near future an application will be submitted by Sweden to join the Community. When we enlarge the Community, we must ensure that we have a Community which is financially sound and one where the accounting of its resources is not subject to fraud.<lb/>
Finally, we are approaching 1992 and the completion of the open market in Europe. Therefore, it is most imperative that the problems of fraud against the Community are tackled with all the energy that we can muster. Unless all the Community countries have adequate systems for the control and detection of fraud by that date, the problem will only increase when the borders are removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04498">4.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04499"><member>Lord Williams Of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Benson, for bringing this very important matter to your Lordships' attention. As other noble Lords pointed out, the subject was debated in the House on 13th April 1989. The central point behind the noble Lord's Motion is to ask what has taken place since that time. We look forward to hearing the Minister's reply and hope that he will be able to tell us exactly what has happened.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Benson, rightly pointed out, fraud against the Community is not an abstract matter; it is fraud against taxpayers in the Community. In other words, someone has to pick up the bill. That is why it is qualitatively of great importance. However, it is also quantitatively of great importance, as the noble Lord and others pointed out. The Community budget now stands at something over &#x00A3;30 billion per annum. If any of the estimates advanced this afternoon&#x2014;that is, anything between &#x00A3;2 billion and &#x00A3;10 billion per annum&#x2014;are right, we are talking about fraud which represents something between 8 per cent. and 30 per cent. of the total Community budget. I cannot conceive that any of your Lordships would wish to work for a commercial undertaking where 8 to 30 per cent. of its profit and loss account was entirely due to surreptitious and illegal transactions of which no one was aware. That is the scale of the problem. Perhaps I may take the point a little further. Even the lower estimate of &#x00A3;2 billion per annum is one-and-a-half times the total net income of British agriculture. Therefore, it is a major problem and one which the noble Lord, Lord Benson, is quite right to bring to our attention.<lb/>
As noble Lords have pointed out&#x2014;especially my
<col>986</col>
noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington&#x2014;the majority of incidents of fraud take place within the common agricultural policy. It is a curious feature of the policy that farming incomes are falling but consumer prices are still well above world prices. That itself is a very astonishing achievement. Worse than that, and worse than the opportunities it gives for fraud, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Templeman, pointed out, is the threat to world free trade. It is a fact that the progress of the Uruguay round in GATT will very much depend on some sort of reduction in the long term in subsidies to European agriculture. That may well be one of the ways out of the fraud problem which we are confronting today.<lb/>
Cheating on export refunds can be achieved by a variety of methods. In a large bureaucracy many people get to know beforehand of a change in the rate or the timing of a subsidy, and traders can take advantage of that. Experts know to what extent documents, the destination of shipments and classification are inspected and controlled and how far these matters are subjected to proper audit: so they can take advantage of all that. There can be swindles in the nature of the product: diluted olive oil, grain which is mostly sand, and offal which is exported as prime quality beef. All are swindles that we know about and which are on the record.<lb/>
The only cure is to have a proper audit procedure combined with simplification of the classification of products. Although the majority of fraud takes place within the context of the common agricultural policy it would be wrong to ignore what was said by the report to your Lordships' House by the Select Committee: that virtually no form of Community finance is untouched by fraud. That is a serious indictment, to which your Lordships must pay proper attention.<lb/>
What should be done? What must be done? As many noble Lords have pointed out, there is a question of political will. The noble Lord, Lord Bethell, drew our attention to the role of the European Parliament; his was a very valuable contribution. However, as all noble Lords who have spoken recognise, ultimately it is a question for the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers must sit down and say collectively, "This is a problem which we seriously wish to tackle and"&#x2014;as my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington said&#x2014;"wish to tackle now": not tomorrow, next year or the year after, but now.<lb/>
Specifically, we need to reform the role of the Court of Auditors. The recommendations of the report which we debated last Thursday are quite clear. The Court of Auditors has functions under the Treaty of Rome and must be allowed the resources which will permit it to carry out those functions. It must have powers of inspection in member states and more staff. All Community operations in member states should be audited; in our case that means close co-operation between the Court of Auditors and the National Audit Office. There must also be power to ensure that the Community itself issues accounts which incorporate a true and fair view and not just notes that the accounts have been established according to the law.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0533"/>
<col>987</col>
In turn, member states have to respond with their own programmes. The problem with the anti-fraud co-ordination unit, as the Commission has pointed out, is that its role is essentially limited. It can control, stimulate, co-ordinate and reinforce. These are all very nice words. But, with management power vested in the member states, the unit cannot possibly be strong enough. I should like the Minister to consider whether we should not return, as my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington has said, to the proposal made in 1976 that all states incorporate in their law provisions that make it a crime to cause the unlawful reduction of Community revenue or the unlawful collection of public subsidies, refunds or financial aid.<lb/>
There may be technical problems; if so I am sure the Minister will explain them. There may be difficulties in the status of such a directive coming out of the Community. I am sure however that my noble friend was right when he said that until we make this activity a crime, in exactly the same way as we have crimes of fraud in this country, we are not going to make much progress throughout the Community. As the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, pointed out, as we move into 1992 the opportunities for fraud, unless there is greater and more effective control, will be enlarged.<lb/>
We recognise that the United Kingdom Government have in the past made an effort. The past Prime Minister launched an initiative and, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, said, it appears to have failed. I should be grateful, if I may have the attention of the noble Lord, for an explanation of how and why that initiative failed. What happened? Why did it run into the ground and lose momentum?<lb/>
There seem to me three things the Government have to do urgently. First, they should press, and continue to press, other member states for action in the Council of Ministers. That seems to be the consensus of noble Lords today. Secondly, the Government should publish a White Paper setting out a programme of action and should report regularly on that programme to your Lordships' House and to another place. Thirdly, they should recognise that the matter merits being placed on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference on European monetary union. As the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, rightly pointed out, in the event of a possible Swedish application to join the European Community, who wants to be a member of a Community or join in an economic and monetary union with an organisation that cannot get its accounts in order? That is why it should be discussed by the next IGC. If they do these three things I can assure the noble Lord that the Government will have the Opposition's full support.</membercontribution></p>

I should like to join other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Benson, for introducing this debate, following up the debate some 18 months ago on the report by the noble Baroness's Select Committee, which was published in February
<col>988</col>
1989. The Government share the House's concern and are in the forefront of efforts to maintain the momentum of the Community's anti-fraud programme. I can assure my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway that we shall continue in that position.<lb/>
I should like to bring the House up to date on recent progress with this programme and to indicate our priorities for the future. I would also stress that there has not been any inactivity, as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. Perhaps I may first say that the 13-point action plan in your Lordships' Select Committee's report of February 1989 on EC fraud has provided valuable assistance to the Government in deciding how best fraud might be tackled in the Community. That assistance has not been just to the Government. The European Commission's 45-point work programme, developed in early 1989 at United Kingdom prompting by an EC committee of experts on fraud (COCOLAF), broadly covers the same areas as the 13-point action plan in the report of the Select Committee. ECOFIN and the European Council endorsed this programme in June 1989 and welcomed the Commission's undertaking to follow it up with an annual progress report.<lb/>
Work on the programme went ahead during 1989 under the co-ordination of a new Commission anti-fraud unit (UCLAF), reporting direct to M. Delors, and the Commission produced its first annual report on 7th February 1990. The Commission rightly began the report by stating the need for political determination to combat fraud in the Community. At the meeting of ECOFIN on 12th March this year we welcomed the Commission report and stressed the priority to be given to initiatives on the simplification of EC legislation, improved investigation and reporting by member states, and agreement by member states on appropriate administrative sanctions. This prioritisation reflects the fact that, as the Select Committee recognised, there are no quick fixes against fraud, and any programme will take a number of years to implement.<lb/>
So, while recognising that much remains to be done, let me now turn to the main achievements under the Commission's programme in the past year and a half, and set them in the context of the 13 points set out in the Select Committee report of February last year.<lb/>
The first point, which has been touched on by various noble Lords, was the need to simplify Community regulations. Her Majesty's Government are keen to do as much as possible for their part to make regulations which are easier to understand and operate. At Community level, an <i>ad hoc</i> committee known as the Lachaux group has been established to study the scope for simplifying the mechanisms of agricultural support. This will provide an opportunity to remedy the defects in current regulations which can work to fraudsters' advantage, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Templeman, quite rightly said; though we shall clearly need to strike a balance between the goals of simplicity and the need to keep
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0534"/>
<col>989</col>
the system watertight. As the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington, said, incautious removal of controls can create more opportunities for fraud.<lb/>
The second, related point concerns reduction in the number of product classifications. The Commission is undertaking a review of differentiated refunds, with a view to reducing the complexity and so the opportunities for fraud. Action has so far been taken in the beef, fruit and vegetable sectors. While again we must guard against the danger that oversimplification of the system could lay it open to abuse and so prove more expensive, we remain convinced that some streamlining is both possible and desirable, and the United Kingdom has suggested a number of reforms to the Commission.<lb/>
The Government support your Lordships' third point that lucid instructions are necessary at all levels. To this end we have supported Commission action to convert directives concerned with Customs controls into regulations as a means of introducing greater precision of meaning and conformity of application. We have also supported Commission efforts to introduce greater clarity into the regulations&#x2014;for example, by the proposed Community Customs code&#x2014;which will come into force with the single market on 1st January 1993. Measures have also been taken within the United Kingdom to assist in providing lucid instructions. Among other measures, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise will shortly reissue its CAP export instructions after a comprehensive review.<lb/>
The fourth point in the report concerned the need to establish effective internal controls, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Williams. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has during the past three years introduced improved arrangements for examinations, reviews and inspections. In the area of CAP exports, our 7 per cent. national target examination rate for all CAP export consignments is now underpinned by an important new EC regulation which sets minimum examination rates for exports attracting export refunds for each Customs region. Customs is already achieving an examination rate by consignment of over 8 per cent.<lb/>
The next point in the Select Committee's report concerned the need for better training of staff. Steps have recently been taken by Her Majesty's Customs to improve staff training, from which 600 officers have already benefited, designed in particular to equip staff with the basic knowledge and skills required for their control duties.<lb/>
Improved exchange of information was the sixth recommendation. Since that recommendation was made there has been a considerable investment of effort in this area both by member states and by the Commission. There has been an encouraging increase in the flow of information over recent years, not least by means of more frequent <i>ad hoc</i> meetings between national officials. The Commission has been playing an effective role in bringing together investigators of the various national Customs services.<lb/>
<col>990</col>
Abolition of advance payment under the agriculture guarantee was the seventh point in the Select Committee report and it was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson. As early as October 1987 a decision had been taken to abolish advances. I am glad to say that this has now been implemented, with the result that member states' expenditure is now funded two months in arrears.<lb/>
The next point in the programme concerned the need for intensified efforts by member states to detect fraud. Among measures taken to achieve this in the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Customs now has an additional 15 posts for CAP export control on top of the existing departmental total of 100 available in 1990&#x2013;91. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, laughs, but 15 out of 100 is an increase of 15 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04502"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord would agree that it would be far more advantageous if the increase had been 100 per cent., which is what the position should be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04503"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry that we cannot go so far as the noble Lord would like. I said that the increase was 15 per cent. and I do not believe that it merited the noble Lord's laughter, especially as it complements other efforts at a national level and the Commission's own inspection powers to detect irregularities of expenditure, about which I shall say more in a moment.<lb/>
As to the vigorous pursuit of criminal prosecutions which both the noble Lords, Lord Bruce and Lord Williams, desired, and civil claims&#x2014;the report's ninth recommendation&#x2014;the Select Committee observed that the failure to conclude a Community crimes treaty was a cause of difficulty in instituting criminal prosecutions against fraudsters. However, since EC fraud was last debated in your Lordships' House a judgment made by the European Court of Justice would appear to have removed in part the need for such a treaty. The so-called Greek maize case reaffirmed the requirement on member states to treat fraud against the Community budget as seriously as fraud against their national budgets. M. Delors wrote to heads of government earlier this year asking them to ensure that proper regard was paid to the ECJ decision.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the Prime Minister stated in reply&#x2014;the UK was, as so often, the first to respond&#x2014;that United Kingdom arrangements were in line with the ECJ ruling. So far, only four other member states have replied. Once all replies have been received, the Commission will consider in the light of the responses whether there is a continuing need for a Community crimes treaty.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Perth, touched on the recommendation to improve publicity and quite rightly mentioned that the media might offer a little more help. However, possibly the media have been concerned with other matters during the past week. In respect of the recommendation to improve publicity where fraud has been successfully dealt with, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise press office now works
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0535"/>
<col>991</col>
closely with the investigation division and frequently gains good coverage for successfully exposed and prosecuted cases of fraud.<lb/>
The Government entirely agree with the importance of reporting fraud and irregularities to the Commission&#x2014;the Select Committee's eleventh recommendation. Standards of reporting by member states have undoubtedly been variable. However, there have been recent signs that the obligation to report fraud and irregularities is being taken more seriously. Spain and Greece, for instance, have started reporting for the first time, and the overall number and value of irregularities reported have increased under a new regulation on traditional own resources and under a regulation on reporting of irregularities in agriculture currently under emendation.<lb/>
In order to assist in this process of reporting, the Select Committee suggested that there should be a clarification of the definition of fraud and irregularity. This essential basic requirement was fulfilled in April 1989 when member states agreed and adopted a working definition in the form of an explanatory document which covers what is understood by an irregularity and in what circumstances it should be notified to the Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04504"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend allow me to intervene on this subject? How are we getting on with the matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel&#x2014;the concept of Community fraud as a Community offence which is justiciable in the Court of Justice at the suit of the Court of Auditors? How is that going? Where are we getting to; or are we getting nowhere?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04505"><member>Lord Henley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought I dealt with that earlier when I talked about the Greek maize case, which reaffirmed the requirement on member states to treat fraud against the Community budget as seriously as fraud against their national budgets. In the light of responses from member governments, a community crimes treaty may still be needed, but we felt that the case I referred to removed the greatest need for such a treaty. I hope that that goes some way towards helping the noble Lord.<lb/>
The final recommendation in the report was for closer Commission surveillance within member states. The Government consider that the Commission has a major role to play in co-ordinating the anti-fraud activities of member states. Existing provisions give the Commission important rights of access and oversight in the agriculture and own resources areas to ensure even-handed administration by member states in the wider Community interests. Proposals are under discussion in Brussels to amend the CAP irregularity regulation and to enhance the power of the Commission to be associated with national investigations. The United Kingdom is supporting such Commission involvement, even with criminal investigations, provided that national law so allows and provided that sensitive areas such as search of premises and questioning of suspects are excluded. In fact a United Kingdom amendment to this effect has been accepted and we very much hope that speedy agreement can now be reached.
<col>992</col>
I shall now turn to the four questions that the noble Lord, Lord Benson, put to me in his opening speech. He first asked when an action programme would be prepared for annual review by the Court of Auditors. The Commission's 45-point plan, developed in 1989 and endorsed by the Council in 1989, was reported to the House of Commons by my honourable friend the Paymaster General earlier this year. The Commons took note of and approved the Government's efforts. The Commission makes public an annual report on the fight against fraud. I shall return to that matter in a moment.<lb/>
I was also questioned about the role of the Court of Auditors. That body already produces an annual report which comments on fraud, as appropriate. The 1988 report was debated in the Commons in February 1990. The European Court of Auditors also produces special reports on topics of interest such as export refunds. Therefore the court takes a leading role in highlighting fraud and other irregularities by use of its existing powers. However, I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, felt that it might be possible for the court to report somewhat earlier than is now the case. At the moment the timetable is established in Community legislation. The Commission's right to reply to the Court of Auditor's annual report is enshrined in Article 206 of the treaty.<lb/>
Under Article 88 of the financial regulation, the court must transmit the annual report by 15th July. The Commission must then respond by 31st October and the report must be submitted in its final form by 30th November, that is 11 months after the financial year in question. Her Majesty's Government believe that the replies of the institutions are valuable to ECOFIN when it considers the ECA's report.<lb/>
There is no doubt that the structure and powers of the court will figure in the intergovernmental conference on political union. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, asked me about that point. The United Kingdom will propose enhanced powers to improve the effective scrutiny of the EC budget by increasing the effectiveness of the Court of Auditors, clarifying responsibilities as to financial control and enhancing the European Parliament's role in scrutinising the budget. These measures should make an effective contribution to the fight against fraud. I welcomed the contribution made by my noble friend Lord Bethell on this matter. The Government welcome the active role taken by the European Parliament. As the joint arm of budgetary authority, the European Parliament has a direct interest. Its involvement helps to maintain the political impetus.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Benson, also asked when the Council of Ministers would accept responsibility for this matter. It already does so. Written progress to date on the 45-point plan is reviewed annually by ECOFIN. The noble Lord also asked about responsibility within the Government. That is clearly defined. Her Majesty's Treasury is responsible for the EC budget and for co-ordinating anti-fraud policy. Customs and Excise and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are in league on enforcement.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0536"/>
<col>993</col>
I have endeavoured to show noble Lords that the Select Committee's work has provided a solid and influential start to a practical and continuing drive to deal more effectively with the virus of fraud within the Community. This is a battle which may never be conclusively won, but by examining every area of possible abuse and by taking practical and effective measures, such as those I have described today, to counteract and close off opportunities for fraud and by the constant exercise of vigilance we can make and keep it a hard and unprofitable option to be dishonest or inefficient at the expense of the Community taxpayer. Her Majesty's Government are determined that what has been achieved should be only the start. We shall not flag in our determination to bring the same high standards to Community finances as we exercise domestically.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04506">4.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04507"><member>Lord Benson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Members of the House who have spoken in this debate. I think it is fair to say that there is general agreement that there is a public scandal which has not yet been eradicated. There is also agreement that there is an absence of political will to correct it. I am grateful to the Minister for seeking to answer the various points that have been raised and the four questions that I put to him.<lb/>
As regards my first question, it is quite plain from the answers given that no comprehensive report comprising responses from the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the member states has yet been prepared. Until that is done this public scandal will continue. It is very unsatisfactory in a debate of this kind to have to drag out, so to speak&#x2014;I use that phrase politely as I am sure it is no part of the Minister's duty not to help us&#x2014;bit by bit what is happening. It is rather like the situation of Churchill's porcupine, which had to be plucked quill by quill.<lb/>
I draw the attention of the Minister to the proposals that have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and the noble Earl, Lord Perth, for a White Paper to be prepared to show the Government's intentions. They further propose that an annual report should be made to both Houses to show exactly what is taking place. Until that is done the problem will continue unabated.<lb/>
Secondly, I asked what was happening about the reform of the Court of Auditors. Alas, all we have had is a series of promises of goodies yet to come. I suppose it is impossible for the Government to promise more than that as nothing more has yet been done. What those goodies will be remains to be seen.<lb/>
Thirdly, I asked when the Council of Ministers would accept its responsibilities to deal properly with the criticisms made by the Court of Auditors. I understood the Minister to say that the Council of Ministers has accepted those responsibilities. However, I deny that that is the case unless it has happened in the past few days. It has certainly never happened up to this point. The Council of Ministers has never properly replied to the criticisms made by
<col>994</col>
the Court of Auditors. I hope the Minister will re-examine that point and make proper inquiries on it as the answer given to the House was not satisfactory.<lb/>
On my fourth point, I am obliged to the Minister for his remarks. I need not detain the House any longer. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.<lb/>

<section>
<title>The Middle East</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04508">5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04509"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The Statement is as follows:
"With permission Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on developments in the Middle East since my Statement on 24th October.<lb/>
"The international coalition is holding firm. Our objectives remain: the full and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait; the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait; and the release of all hostages. President Saddam Hussein continues to show little sign that he intends to comply with the will of the international community and withdraw. He continues to rebuff the United Nations, to strengthen his military position in Kuwait, to destroy Kuwait's fabric and national identity, and to manipulate the fate of British and other citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.<lb/>
"Only by intensifying all the pressures at our disposal&#x2014;diplomatic, economic and military&#x2014;can we persuade Saddam Hussein that he has no alternative to withdrawal. Sanctions are being applied rigorously. We hope that the existing pressures will be sufficient to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw. If they are not sufficient we need to convince Saddam that the military option is a serious one. The option for peace is in his hands. No one does any service by blurring the choice before him.<lb/>
"For that military option to be fully credible, the international community must show that it has the political will to exercise it. The Security Council is expected to meet at ministerial level within the next few days and vote on a resolution authorising "all necessary means"&#x2014;that is to say, including force&#x2014;to be used to ensure Iraqi compliance with Security Council Resolution 660 and later resolutions. The resolution will include a date&#x2014;probably in the first half of January&#x2014;by which time Iraq is required to comply in full with these resolutions. It does not follow from this that military action will follow immediately thereafter&#x2014;nor indeed that military action will necessarily take place at all. Rather, the purpose of the grace period is to allow Saddam Hussein an opportunity in which he can safely withdraw from Kuwait and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0537"/>
<col>995</col>
release the hostages. If he does not do so, he must face the possibility of military action and certain defeat.<lb/>
"We remain anxious for the well-being of the many hundreds of British hostages who remain in Iraq and Kuwait. Some have been released through the intervention of political figures and relatives. We understand the suffering of the families and the humanitarian motives of those who go to Iraq. But Saddam Hussein exploits these visits for his own unacceptable ends. The international community is united in resisting that blackmail.<lb/>
"With tension increasing in the region we are keeping under constant review our advice to British communities in other parts of the Gulf. We advise those living in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain with children in Britain not to bring them to the area, but to spend the Christmas holiday here, and for dependants to remain outside the Gulf until the situation becomes clearer. This does not mean that we foresee hostilities around that time: but it is sensible to minimise the number of dependants when we are entering such a critical phase.<lb/>
"I am able to report some positive political steps. On 27th September we announced the resumption of relations with Iran. Today I can tell the House that we are resuming relations with Syria with immediate effect. The respective heads of the Interests Sections in London and Damascus will be charg&#x00E9;s d'affaires pending the exchange, as soon as practicable, of ambassadors. We have received from the Syrian Government assurances that Syria will continue its strenuous efforts to obtain the release of Western, including British, hostages in Lebanon and confirmation that Syria rejects acts of international terrorism and will take action against the perpetrators of such acts which are supported by convincing evidence, and a confidential account of the Syrian position on the Hindawi affair. I am glad that it has proved possible to overcome the differences between the UK and Syria."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04510">5.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04511"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Lord for repeating the Statement. As the House knows, we have broadly supported the Government's handling of the crisis throughout. We appreciate this further clarification of policy. We note with great interest that a new resolution is to be considered shortly in the Security Council with a view to ensuring Iraqi compliance with Resolution 660 and the other resolutions. We also note the important new element in it; namely, that a date by which Iraq is required to comply with the resolutions will be set. We further observe that it is still hoped that existing pressures will suffice to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw, and that military action need not necessarily take place on the appointed date. Can the Minister say whether any further diplomatic action is proposed in order to underline the determination of the United Nations to secure the withdrawal? We
<col>996</col>
know that Mr. Perez de Cuellar has visited Baghdad on one occasion. Is there any arrangement for him to visit Iraq again?<lb/>
We note that the Statement says,
<quote>"sanctions are being applied rigorously".</quote>
Can the noble Lord say whether they are working, and working in such a way as to bring the maximum pressure upon Saddam Hussein? Are the Government satisfied that the reality of a military operation and the consequences of military action are fully appreciated by Saddam Hussein and his regime?<lb/>
We agree entirely with the Statement in its reference to hostages and the disgraceful way in which they are being manipulated. We further note and support the advice to British communities in the area, and also the steps taken to resume diplomatic relations with Iran and Syria. We welcome the Syrian assurances about hostages elsewhere.<lb/>
Finally, is the Minister able to tell us whether the representative of the Soviet Union who has been travelling back and forth between Moscow and Baghdad has also conveyed to Saddam Hussein the implications of his continuing obduracy with all the consequences of that obstinacy?<lb/>
Once more, we support the United Nations initiative and the Government's approach to this grave problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04512"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from these Benches also we thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. It is a very serious Statement. Can the Minister be more specific about the date to be included in the proposed United Nations resolution than "probably in the first half of January"? I take it that negotiations are still taking place between the members of the Security Council, but a more specific date would be helpful. Once such a resolution has been passed we could find ourselves engaging in military activity very quickly afterwards. Can the Minister say what further steps will be taken to involve Parliament before such action was taken, and indeed to involve the United States Congress?<lb/>
I draw the attention of the House to the comment made by my noble friend Lord Mayhew in the debate on the Address to the gracious Speech that:
<quote>"there may also come a time when we have to remind ourselves that sanctions are a merciful alternative to war".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 13/11/90; col. 310.]</quote>
It is in that spirit that I hope that the timing and the usefulness of sanctions will be viewed. In other words, sanctions must be pursued for so long as possible. Nevertheless, one understands the need to make it quite clear to the Iraqi dictator that we are serious about a military option at the end of the day when all other avenues have been fully explored.<lb/>
The resumption of relations with Syria will bring considerable relief in many quarters. However, I am quite sure that it will be criticised because Syria has been accused of supporting terrorism and that there will be some dubiety as to whether Syria has pulled back fully from that position. Nevertheless, one welcomes the assurances contained in the Statement
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0538"/>
<col>997</col>
that Syria now rejects acts of international terrorism and will take action against the perpetrators of such action. I am very pleased that that is happening.<lb/>
As one of the four Members of the United Kingdom Parliament who went to Teheran four years ago to attempt, among other things, to seek the release of hostages held in Lebanon, I am now convinced that if Syria will use its good offices and Iran continues to use its good offices there is a reasonable chance that our hostages may be released in good time. If this is a step in that direction everyone will be pleased. To renew diplomatic relations is a positive step. I take it that the restoration of diplomatic relations signifies a return to the traditional British practice of regarding diplomatic relations not as a matter of approval or disapproval of a particular regime but as a matter of fact.<lb/>
With those qualifications and comments I welcome the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04513"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, the Leader of the Opposition, and the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, for the welcome that they have given to the Statement. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, said that it was a serious Statement. Indeed it is. We are in serious times. I am grateful for the support that the Opposition have given to the Government on this matter. As I said at an earlier date, we shall keep Parliament informed, as we are doing today.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, asked about further diplomatic action. Yes, we shall take whatever action we can to bring reality to Saddam Hussein. But sometimes it is quite difficult if he does not want to receive the information.<lb/>
With regard to sanctions and whether they are working, we believe that they are beginning to bite in Iraq. All the oil outlets are effectively blockaded. The neighbouring countries of Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have announced that they are implementing sanctions. But on the evidence available it is hard to argue the sanctions alone will reverse Iraqi policy.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, about the appalling way in which members of the British community and others are being treated as hostages. I am grateful to both noble Lords for their welcome to the opening up of diplomatic relations with Syria. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, asked whether I could be more specific about the date. No, I cannot. That is still, as he so rightly said, a matter for discussion. On the question of terrorism from Syria, we believe that the assurances given on Syria's future conduct are indeed satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04514">5.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04515"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend clarify one matter? In view of the fact that it appears that Saddam Hussein has removed from Kuwait much of that country's wealth and many of its assets, would it be regarded as compliance with the United Nations resolution if he simply withdrew but did not restore the stolen property?</membercontribution></p>
<col>998</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04516"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend takes the debate further than the withdrawal of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The first and most important matter is that complete and utter withdrawal. As regards the other matters, I should like to think about them a little further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04517"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while obviously the restoration of diplomatic relations with Syria is to be welcomed in principle, can the noble Earl confirm that Her Majesty's Government are totally satisfied that the Syrian authorities bear no responsibility whatever, either direct or indirect, for the Lockerbie disaster?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04518"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, police investigations are continuing with regard to Lockerbie. I know that the noble Lord will understand that I am limited in what I can say. But let me reassure him and the House that the Syrians have said that they will take action against the perpetrators of any acts of terrorism where there is convincing evidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04519"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, every Member of this House and of another place agrees that the withdrawal of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait is an essential element in reinforcing the authority of the United Nations. Indeed some argue that the authority of the United Nations should have been reinforced earlier over many other aspects. The object of the United Nations is to solve international problems by peaceful means, is it not? In that case, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, when he quoted the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, the use of sanctions is the alternative to the use of military force, which would be disastrous not just for Saddam Hussein but for the whole of the Middle East and probably for the whole world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04520"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful that the noble Lord has given way. I did not say that sanctions were the alternative. I said that sanctions and other means should be used to the ultimate before force is used. I was not suggesting&#x2014;and I am sure that my noble friend Lord Mayhew was not suggesting&#x2014;that sanctions were the alternative force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04521"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept that correction. It was a misunderstanding. I intended to convey exactly the same meaning as the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew. However, if that is the case, does the noble Earl agree, on behalf of the Government, with the wise words spoken recently by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury to the effect that sanctions should be given a period of around 12 months to prove themselves before military action is taken?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04522"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I repeat that on the evidence available it is hard to argue that sanctions alone will reverse Iraqi policy. We need every means at our disposal to make Saddam Hussein realise that he has the opportunity to maintain peace by withdrawing all his troops fully and completely from his invasion of a fellow member of the United Nations. It was he who perpetrated that act. It is up to him now to withdraw.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04523"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl remember in the memoirs of his noble friend Lord Carrington an interesting passage about sanctions in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0539"/>

<title>The Commonwealth</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04525">5.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04526"><member>Lord Greenhill of Harrow</member> rose to call attention to the future of the Commonwealth; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04527">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. In the light of the great changes in the international scene, I believe that it is an appropriate time to test the opinion of the House on the future of the Commonwealth. Interest in this matter is rising. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Alport, raised the issue in the debate on the Address on 13th November. I had hoped that in this debate this afternoon he would enlarge on his remarks, but I am sorry to say that he is unwell and will not be speaking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04528">Although it might be more useful to seek the views of a younger group of persons than this House, there are Members who are particularly well qualified to speak. I want to look at the questions from a purely British point of view. I am no expert on the Commonwealth but at one time or another I have visited and travelled in the larger members of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04529">In this country opinion on the Commonwealth, without doubt, has become increasingly divided. I daresay that to a greater or less extent that division is shared by several other member countries. In this country interest has certainly declined. I am told that in Canada it has somewhat increased in the wake of the development of closer US-Canadian trade relations. But everywhere the generations and leaders who witnessed the birth of the Commonwealth have passed from the stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04530">Shortly before the recent Commonwealth conference in Kuala Lumpur last year, a headline in one of the leading British papers read: "The Commonwealth: a network of friends or a forum of phoneys". It was the realisation that there is such confusion that led the heads of government at the conference in Kuala Lumpur to set up a working party to prepare a report for their meeting next year in Harari. Just as the European Community invented Eurospeak, the Commonwealth is using a special Commonwealthspeak.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04531">The working party is called a high level appraisals group, just as the earlier unsuccessful mission to South Africa went under the name of the Eminent Persons Group. I mention that because I find much of the writing on the Commonwealth uses an obscure and woolly language of its own. The high level group is
<col>1000</col>
meeting again next week in Malaysia, and the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, is appropriately the United Kingdom representative. He apologises for his absence this afternoon and greatly regrets that he cannot speak today, and so do we. He has asked for <i>Hansard</i> to be sent to him in Malaysia soon after the debate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04532">How the Commonwealth has evolved is familiar to your Lordships. It arose with the natural coming together before the war of the independent English-speaking dominions, including South Africa. Throughout World War II members of the Commonwealth formed an essential and a notably gallant element in the allied forces and were among the first to respond in Korea and in the present Gulf crisis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04533">Immediately post-war, the Commonwealth group struck out on a new and unprecedented course with the inclusion of republican Pakistan and India. Their inclusion was a necessary factor in the peaceful settlement of their independence. It seemed a natural and proper thing to do, especially to those who had served in the Middle East and in South-East Asia alongside forces from the Indian subcontinent. The happy device of Her Majesty the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth made it all the more acceptable to British opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04534">It can be argued that it might have been better if expansion had stopped there, and, if so, the United Kingdom might have commercially and industrially been brought face to face with the reality of its post-war situation and therefore competed more strenuously for a change in our pattern of trade. No one anticipated the rapid run-down of the Empire, nor the continued call for the expansion of the membership to over 50 now, which, without too much thought, changed the whole position of the United Kingdom. More than a quarter of the world's population is now included, stretching right across the globe, and the proportion is increasing. No one should underestimate the mutual value of such a network of friends, if, indeed, they are true friends.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04535">We must ask ourselves whether it makes sense to belong to, and to develop, such a grouping at a time when we are assured that our true friends are not necessarily the English-speaking world but those nations of Europe with whom we have been in conflict for far too long. Does our first loyalty lie with them or with our Commonwealth partners? Do we need to make a choice at all? There can be little doubt that the future organisation of Europe must inevitably be of more importance materially to us than the Commonwealth can ever be, but that does not mean that the Commonwealth must be neglected or abandoned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04536">The aim of the European Community is to match, politically and economically, the power of the United States and Japan. Our cultural and family links with many of the Commonwealth countries are strong and those links will remain and be made firmer by facilities for world travel. Can we not have it both ways? I believe that we can, and that it is in our interest to do so.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0540"/>
<col>1001</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04537">I should guess that the great majority of young people in this country will have little difficulty in reconciling worldwide friendship across the Commonwealth with whatever form of European union emerges from the coming negotiations. But the Commonwealth cannot go on just as it has in the past. We have been made well aware of its imperfections. In international affairs our partners have done much to try to embarrass us; for example, in the days of decolonisation debates at the United Nations and over our policy of confrontation East/West. Some of them have waged vicious war among themselves, and many members have conducted their affairs with systems of government far divorced from democracy and with features repugnant to us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04538">The world is changing dramatically, and if the Commonwealth is to survive it must make fundamental changes for the future. Despite events, it has not withered away and indeed has held together and attracted new members. The fact that it is doing so owes a great deal to the dedication and beneficial, and frequently decisive, role played by Her Majesty the Queen and members of the Royal Family. The respect and affection in which our monarchy is held is one of the strongest bonds which unites it. Her Majesty's reception at the Commonwealth Games in New Zealand last year was convincing evidence of that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04539">We have now reached a critical point in our relations with Europe and the promise of greater understanding between the power blocs. Can the Commonwealth play any practical role over a wider field than the European Community? The Community may eventually share the advantages of a common currency, but the Commonwealth now enjoys the advantages of a common language, a shared culture and a long history of many friendly and intimate contacts at all levels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04540">It is that question we should now address. My conclusion is that it is worth taking more than a casual interest and a limited investment only in that unique group which includes countries of growing wealth and potential political importance. We should remember that within a generation the population of Pakistan and Nigeria together will far exceed an expanded European Community. We should usefully proceed without delay along the following lines: first, there is a requirement from the British point of view for the Government to make clear their unequivocal support for the Commonwealth, if necessary, by a statement on an appropriate occasion. Any such statement has been lacking in recent times.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04541">In summing up during the foreign affairs debate on 13th November, the noble Earl, Lord Arran, said that we were "committed" to the Commonwealth. The word "committed" is used when one is sent to prison. Something more enthusiastic is required. Such a statement might commend itself to the new Prime Minister, who in the past has worked in some Commonwealth territories. Secondly, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is the lead department in Whitehall for Commonwealth affairs, but all departments of state, especially trade and industry
<col>1002</col>
and environment, must also be involved. I understand that in the recent past the Minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office who concerns himself with those matters tries to combine them with the Middle East&#x2014;a rather one-sided portfolio. What is required is someone who regularly visits the member territories and shows our interest and learns theirs. Mrs. Lynda Chalker of the ODA has done splendid work in that respect, but there is room for another Minister who is not concerned primarily with aid and has a wider brief.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04542">Thirdly, the number and purpose of Commonwealth meetings should be reconsidered. As well as the formal meetings between heads of government every two years, there should be meetings at lower levels on practical problems of mutual trade, poverty, indebtedness, human rights, environment, medical and scientific problems and democratic organisation. Some such meetings take place, but are they followed up?</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04543">The area in which the most useful initiatives can be taken is education, in its widest sense, both by governments and non-governmental organisations. There are many Members of the House who know about that, and in the academic world there are people such as the noble Lord, Lord Briggs, and Professor Dilkes of Leeds University who have skills and ideas ready to be applied. Some will cost money but expenditure will be an investment with a high return. The aim would be to create as many mutually profitable links as possible in the widest variety of subjects.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04544">Lastly I turn now to the Commonwealth Secretariat here in London. It has never quite fulfilled expectations and has sometimes ventured too far into British politics. Now we have the good fortune to welcome a new secretary general. He is Chief Anyaoku of Nigeria, a man of talent and experience who deserves our full support. He will have his own ideas on how to discharge his responsibilities. He is particularly suited to exercise a healing touch on many problems within the Commonwealth. Indeed, he has already taken an interest in South Africa, which may well become a subject that unites the Commonwealth where once it divided it. The secretary general is supported by his secretariat. It does good work but perhaps it is too much inclined to hide its light under a bushel. The British Government give it considerable financial support and should continue to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04545">The sum allocated by the ODA to technical assistance runs into tens of millions per annum and compares favourably with the new know-how fund for Eastern Europe, with which I am afraid in due course it must compete. The secretariat can, I am told, find great scope for expanding its co-operation with the non-governmental organisations, and this should be encouraged.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04546">Finally, no doubt the Government will want to wait for the report of the high level appraisal group. The discussion of its recommendations next year at Harare will be important. We must remember that this country is only one voice among many of our partners.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0541"/>
<col>1003</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04547">In summary, I believe this country has a historic responsibility to energise Commonwealth co-operation at this time. I hope that many of your Lordships share this view and can suggest constructive ways in which it can be achieved. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04548">5.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04549"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, has done a considerable service to the House and to the Commonwealth by raising this subject this afternoon. This House frequently discusses Europe, but it is a lamentably long time since it has discussed the Commonwealth. Therefore, it is good to make a contribution towards restoring the balance. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, will not take it amiss when I say that a two-and-a-half-hour debate is a wholly inadequate period for discussing this immensely important and complicated subject. I hope that the Government Whips will decide that before too long we shall have a whole day in which to discuss the Commonwealth. The subject is so important that it is better to spend a day discussing the affairs of the Commonwealth than, for example, having a blank Monday from time to time. I hope that the Whips' Office will bear that in mind.<lb/>
There is little that one can say on this immense subject in so limited a time. The British Commonwealth is one of the most remarkable organisations that the world has seen. It contains an extraordinary mixture. There are wealthy, modern countries such as Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. There are huge Asian countries such as India and Pakistan. There are large and small African countries and tiny outposts such as the Seychelles, the Falkland Islands or Gibraltar. All are united by certain common ideas and by the English language. The Commonwealth is a remarkable example of international co-operation between countries at totally different levels of economic wealth, civilised advance, living standards, and so forth. Surely it must make an enormously valuable contribution towards the working of the world.<lb/>
However, it is not only that. The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, mentioned the fact that when this country has been involved in war the Commonwealth has come to our assistance. Without wishing to make too invidious a comparison, I believe that the Commonwealth's contribution to our victory in 1945 was infinitely greater than that of the present members of the European Community. Some of them were on the other side and most of the rest were defeated. Therefore, there is not merely a sentimental and emotional feeling towards the Commonwealth&#x2014;although that exists&#x2014;but there is also a practical feeling that our being at the centre of it adds considerably to our physical power and influence in the world. It would be the greatest pity if the Commonwealth were allowed to decline or to decay. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, that it must evolve and change. However, it is most encouraging that, for example, Pakistan believes it worthwhile to return to the Commonwealth. I hope
<col>1004</col>
that similarly Fiji will return before too long. Both are extremely interesting countries with considerable influence in their parts of the world.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, mentioned (and I wish to emphasise this fact) that the strength of the Commonwealth and its survival derives from the personal efforts of the Head of the Commonwealth, Her Majesty the Queen. Her Majesty has spent a great deal of time and effort in attending Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conferences in all kinds of inconvenient parts of the world. It is probable that she knows personally more of the leaders of Commonwealth countries than do any of those leaders. She has paid great attention to her role as head of the Commonwealth, and as such has made a major contribution to the history of the world. It is fitting that your Lordships' House should recognise that and seek to express its real gratitude.<lb/>
I hope that the Commonwealth will continue. However, I strongly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, that the Government should state publicly that they attach the greatest importance to the Commonwealth. The fact that they are involved with the EC does not in any way detract from their concern with the Commonwealth, their desire to co-operate with it and to see it prosper, grow and strengthen. For one reason or another, there has been a lack of government statements on the subject. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Caithness will make appropriate comments this afternoon. However, it calls for the new head of the British Government to state firmly that the Commonwealth is important to us and that the British Government will do their utmost to secure that it continues, develops and prospers. Furthermore, that we shall try to bring together that variety of countries, co-operating with a good civilisation, high standards, increasing contacts with each other and shall ensure that during the next century the British Commonwealth contributes something of what it contributed during the past century.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04551"><member>Lord Bottomley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, in paying tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill. My first government appointment was as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions. Before entering Parliament in 1945 I had gained vast experience in local government. When I could speak freely to the Prime Minister, Mr. Attlee, I said that with all my local government experience I could not understand why he had not sent me to a local government department. He said that the explanation was simple. It was time that I got away from drains and dustbins, and he wanted a young Minister to specialise in the Commonwealth.<lb/>
Soon after I was appointed, I joined the United Kingdom delegation to the United Nations. My job was to sit on the committee dealing with the colonies and to keep in touch with other Commonwealth delegates. On the committee I sat next to Field Marshal Smuts and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gromyko. My private secretary was John
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0542"/>
<col>1005</col>
Hunt, now the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who I am pleased to see is here this evening. He was the ex-secretary of the Cabinet.<lb/>
At the end of the United Nations meeting, Field Marshal Smuts said that he was very pleased that a young Labour Minister was so interested in southern Africa. However, he said that I could not understand a problem unless I was face to face with it at first hand. He said that he would ask the Prime Minister to send me to South Africa to see things at first hand. In due course, Prime Minister Attlee told me that Field Marshal Smuts was sending me an invitation and I could accept and go to South Africa. John Hunt (as he then was) accompanied me and we spent some weeks in South Africa. Not only did we visit the Union, but also the protectorates and Southern Rhodesia. That visit served me well in facing up to Commonwealth problems, especially in handling the rebellion in Southern Rhodesia.<lb/>
I have taken an active part in the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, having been chairman of the UK branch and treasurer of the whole organisation. The CPA brings together members of parliament from all countries in the Commonwealth. There is an annual meeting when about 300 members of parliament assemble to discuss current affairs and items affecting the Commonwealth.<lb/>
The United Kingdom branch also organises a seminar each year when about 30 members of Parliament come together to talk politics generally and particularly as regards their own countries. Many who attended in the past are now distinguished prime ministers and ex-presidents. The President of Kenya is still in office. The Prime Minister of St. Lucia is still in office. All told there have been over 30 speakers attending the seminar.<lb/>
The United Kingdom branch also organises an annual parliamentary visit. The members of parliament, who come from all over the Commonwealth, go to different parts of the country. They meet together here, visit one of the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man and usually visit a local authority in this country. The seminars have established personal contacts throughout the Commonwealth.<lb/>
When I was Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, I took an active part in creating the Commonwealth Secretariat. A Canadian civil servant, Arnold Smith, was appointed and he was followed by Shridath Ramphal whom I knew as foreign minister for Guyana. He has just retired having given 15 years excellent service to the Commonwealth. He has been followed by Chief Emeka Anyaoku who received his education not only in this country, but also in France and in his own country. At the secretariat he was a director of international affairs. I am sure that we wish him many years of happiness, good health and success.<lb/>
The Commonwealth Secretariat is responsible for organising the biennial heads of government meeting.
<col>1006</col>
Those are held in different Commonwealth countries. Summit meetings are private and are known for their frankness and lack of formality.<lb/>
Over the 40 years of its existence at all levels of economic development and embracing peoples of many different races, religions, and cultures, the Commonwealth has been able to bridge racial, ideological and economic divides and inequalities assisted by a common language and heritage.<lb/>
In 1971 Commonwealth governments set up the Fund for Technical Co-operation. That fund has low overheads and can provide experts at less cost than other agencies. The fund provides expertise and training in all areas of economic and social advance. Science and technology today are the basis for an improved quality of life.<lb/>
The Commonwealth Science Council has been established. Its main emphasis is on the application of science. Commonwealth scientists work together in such areas as biological resources, agriculture, energy, mineral and water resources and environmental planning. The majority of Commonwealth countries are in their first generation of independence. The Commonwealth began when the independence of the dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa were given legal expression in the Statute of Westminster 1931. It is the only international group outside the United Nations to form a cross-section of world community by bringing together developed and developing countries across the globe. Over one quarter of the world's population&#x2014;1 billion people&#x2014;live in the 50 countries which make up the Commonwealth. It is an example to the wider international community that there can be co-operation and understanding across the major divides of the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04552">5.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04553"><member>Lord Shaughnessy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the last general debate on the Commonwealth in your Lordships' House was held more than 11 years ago in March 1979. That is an inordinately long interval, as the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, said; and I should like to join in expressing gratitude to my noble friend Lord Greenhill of Harrow for giving us the opportunity to discuss what has transpired in Commonwealth affairs during that long interval.<lb/>
In introducing the debate, my noble friend, with his long experience of these matters, gave a characteristically trenchant summary of where the Commonwealth now stands in world affairs. At the time of the 1979 debate, membership of the Commonwealth was 40 countries and has now increased to 50. That indicates that as an association of independent nations, the Commonwealth continues to be seen as a potent factor in the resolution of world problems.<lb/>
It is also significant that its membership includes no superpowers and consequently provides a forum for smaller nations to express their aims and aspirations free from the overshadowing presence of world-power diplomacy. Furthermore, the geographical diversity of the Commonwealth, spanning as it does some seven
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0543"/>
<col>1007</col>
continents and sub-continents and almost all the seas and oceans, brings together nations of a vast variety of races, colours and religions.<lb/>
Regarding the possible directions in which the Commonwealth might go to make future contributions to the developments in this expanding technological world, I should like to refer briefly to two specific institutions within the Commonwealth. They are making valuable contributions to the dissemination of learning; the pursuit of democratic government and the advancement of global un-derstanding in this technological world.<lb/>
At their meeting in Vancouver B.C. in 1987, the Commonwealth heads of government agreed to the creation of the Commonwealth of Learning. This was to be an agency to create and widen access to education and to improve its quality by using distant education techniques and associated communication technologies to meet the specific requirements of member countries. This proposal grew out of the anxiety felt by governments at the introduction of economic fees at metropolitan centres of education to which students from developing countries had traditionally gone for higher education.<lb/>
The agency became operational in 1989 with its headquarters in Vancouver, and with the noble Lord, Lord Briggs of Lewes, &#x2014;who headed the committee to study the problem&#x2014;as its founding chairman, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill. Dr. James Moraj is the founding president. Funds to carry forward the enterprise have been pledged by a number of Commonwealth member countries, including generous contributions from the Province of British Columbia. A modest staff is in place in Vancouver, and in a number of participating countries. I hope that this imaginative initiative will prosper, since it provides an excellent example of the role the Commonwealth can play in the promotion of education on an international level.<lb/>
The second institution I should also like to applaud is what might be termed our own trade association; namely, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to which the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, referred earlier. The CPA has been around for a long time. It has played a pre-eminent role in strengthening parliamentary democracy and democratic institutions, and in cementing friendship and understanding among members of elected Commonwealth parliaments, not only at the national level but reaching down to state and provincial legislatures within member countries. By means of its regional conferences the CPA facilitates a dialogue between members of the legislatures of smaller countries and dependencies. It also has the existing machinery to fulfil additional responsibilities; in particular, the strengthening of democratic institutions by the provision of observer missions to supervise and report upon the electoral process. That is a function which I hope the CPA will be increasingly called upon to perform where the appropriate need arises.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to suggest some other endeavours with which the Commonwealth could be usefully and legitimately concerned, and which I
<col>1008</col>
believe it is well equipped to perform. I mentioned the Commonwealth of Learning. However, there are other social world problems which must be addressed if we are not to destroy this planet with our own rapacity. Time does not permit me to elaborate. But I believe the nations of the Commonwealth could usefully act together in attacking the international drug trade which continues to erode the social fabric of so many countries. There is also the serious ecological problem of preserving the world rain forests, many of which are located in Commonwealth countries. Lastly, there is the spread of the scourge of AIDS which is reaching epidemic proportions in many countries of the developing world.<lb/>
I am satisfied that because of the diversity of its members, many of which are facing the depredation of these menaces, the Commonwealth is in a unique position to take concerted action to help arrest the damage they are doing to mankind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04554">5.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04555"><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after three very powerful speeches I find it difficult to know what points to deal with. We are all fortunate to be members of the most remarkable political organisation this world has ever known. I challenge anyone to contradict that. I do not believe that going back to the earliest history anything else of this character has ever existed. People all over the world are still proud and happy to know each other and learn from each other.<lb/>
Perhaps I may say that the origin of the Commonwealth was the growth of standards which rested originally in this country. Members are always eager to come back and speak with us, and indeed we are delighted when they do. They sent some superb young men in the Second World War. I was perhaps fortunate in that they came mostly to the Royal Air Force. I remember being on one station when we had the pleasure of a royal visit. I was able to take people from 23 different parts of the world to be introduced to the Duke of Gloucester&#x2014;I believe it was he. That is the quality of the Commonwealth. The people live in many places but mean an awful lot to each other.<lb/>
I do not wish to speak for too long so I shall be brief. There used to be a curious antagonism between the Americans and India. I shall relate a story. There was a bit of trouble in the Himalayas. Two Americans from the embassy were driving through the Punjab and saw two Indian soldiers on the road. They thought it would be interesting to speak to them. They said, "Tell me, what do you really want?" They were thinking of guns, weapons and stuff like that. The reply was, "Give us British officers". That astounded the Americans. They did not believe it possible in the face of what they used to think of as our ill-treatment of the Indians.<lb/>
That is an interesting difference between the European Community and the Commonwealth. We ruled. It was life which brought us together. The Community is full of regulations of every kind. This is the third time the topic has been discussed in the past week or so. I am tempted to give a German quotation from Goethe:
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0544"/>
<col>1009</col>
<quote><i>"Grau alter Freund ist alle Theorie and Gr&#x00DC;n des Lebens goldener Baum".</i></quote>
That means,
<quote>"The theories are all dead, but life is what gives us the green and golden world in which we live".</quote>
That is one thing we must try and do. We must attempt to bring the Commonwealth and the Community closer together so that they begin to understand each other and can benefit by each other. That is a great task. Let us remember that we believe we live in a peaceful time&#x2014;in spite of what my noble friend referred to this afternoon. But we have lived through probably the bloodiest century this world has ever known, littered with all kinds of dictators which alas we see still growing up. That is the world in which we live. We must not count on continuing peace in the world.<lb/>
I was watching a programme on television the other evening in which they showed how the little animals, ants, beetles and wasps all fight. Fighting is not unusual in any form of life. If we are to have peace we must work hard to ensure that those things which can be drawn together are drawn together. The theorists of the European Community will probably say that it is impossible: I believe that it can be done. The versatility and ease of the Commonwealth will enable a close and valuable connection to be formed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04556">6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04557"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for giving the House the opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that we are better served discussing the Commonwealth than having the day off, because the Commonwealth is of the utmost importance in this world.<lb/>
It has already been said that the Commonwealth today consists of 50 countries&#x2014;four developed countries and 46 countries in various stages of development. Two of the developed countries&#x2014;it is important to note this&#x2014;are members of a group of seven industrial countries that now meet each year at summit level in effect to seek to manage the world economy. The problem of development, therefore, has loomed, and will continue to loom, large in the concern of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will need to increase its activities in this field.<lb/>
The Commonwealth's stand on racism is equally important. The Commonwealth is multiracial and must therefore have a multiracial ethic. The Commonwealth has had to face the racism which was prevalent in southern Africa, and will continue to have to do so. It is a great pity that there has been a difference between this country and the other members of the Commonwealth on the question of sanctions against South Africa. I hope that the change of Prime Minister will lead to a change of attitude on this issue. I also hope that developments in South Africa will make the issue unnecessary.<lb/>
The post of Secretary General of the Commonwealth was established in 1965. As we have
<col>1010</col>
been told, Arnold Smith, a Canadian civil servant, was the first secretary general and held office until 1975. He had to build the secretariat from scratch. He did a very fine job in laying the foundations for its future development. Sir Shrideth Ramphal was secretary general from 1975 until June of this year. He has been an outstanding international civil servant. During his period of office the Commonwealth grew in stature and importance as it endeavoured to come to grips with its obligation to seek to bridge the gap between the "haves" and the "have nots" and to combat racism. He has been succeeded by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, who has been deputy secretary general and therefore at the centre of activities in the Commonwealth during the whole of the 1980s except for a short period in 1983 when he was Foreign Secretary for Nigeria. He is therefore well fitted to continue the programme of work initiated during that period, to build on the foundation laid by his predecessors and to carry the Commonwealth into the next century.<lb/>
In that respect Chief Emeka Anyaoku has been assisted by the decision taken in Kuala Lumpur to have a high level group under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister of Malaysia to consider the role of the Commonwealth in the 1990s and beyond. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, that we shall await the group's report with interest. In the meantime, the Commonwealth will continue to have to cope with the problem of South Africa by giving as much support as it can to the parties negotiating a new constitution in order to create a democratic society in that country and to enable it to rejoin the Commonwealth.<lb/>
There is also the question of Europe and 1992. In that respect, this country has an important role to play. The single market is not a threat to the Commonwealth; it is an opportunity. The Commonwealth's original trade links with Britain will become links with the largest unified market&#x2014;larger even than the United States&#x2014;and thus provide opportunities for the Commonwealth. Therefore, our efforts towards the creation of a single market should be accompanied by policy measures to provide support to poor members of the Commonwealth so that they may be able to take advantage of those opportunities. The structures of Lom&#x00E9; provide one such method, but it is not the only one.<lb/>
As we work towards the completion of a single European market there is increasing concern on the part of some members of the Commonwealth as to whether the existing bilateral protection, or import guarantees, can be made compatible with a common market in which there are no controls on the movement of goods across its frontiers. There is particular concern about the future of the special arrangements for such products as bananas, rum, beef and rice. The current arrangements for the import of sugar from Commonwealth countries into the EC may also be affected. Clearly, these are matters of deep concern to our Commonwealth partners, who look towards Britain to take the lead in addressing these issues.<lb/>

The future of many poor peasants and small farmers depends on the skill of the British Government in negotiating on their behalf with the EC. I hope that the Government will remember that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04559"><member>Lord Moran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise to the Minister and to the House as I shall have to leave before the end of the debate to attend a long-standing engagement.<lb/>
I am glad that my old chief, my noble friend Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for whose views I have the greatest respect, has given the House an opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth. I intend to speak mainly about the view of the Commonwealth in this country. Despite one or two losses&#x2014;the Republic of Ireland, South Africa and Fiji, and some former British territories which, on becoming independent, decided not to join: Jordan, Burma, the Sudan and some others&#x2014;the Commonwealth is unique, remarkable and still very much in being, as some noble Lords have said. Although more than half of its members are republics the Commonwealth has the Queen at its head as a symbol of unity&#x2014;no mere symbol but the most tireless and dedicated of its supporters.<lb/>
The Commonwealth is, of course, a loose association of countries&#x2014;so much so that two members (India and Pakistan) fought a small but bitter war in 1965. However, it has a dense and elaborate network of relationships: meetings of heads of government every two years; meetings of Commonwealth finance ministers, other ministers and officials; Commonwealth parliamentary conferences; the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation; Commonwealth scholarships, and much else. A great deal of that activity is of real value.<lb/>
As a tiny part of that network I used to enjoy the regular lunchtime meetings of Commonwealth high commissioners in Ottawa. They were lively occasions with only three white faces&#x2014;our Australian and New Zealand colleagues and myself. My wife found the parallel meetings of high commissioners' wives even livelier. Nevertheless, the sad fact remains that the public attitude in this country to the Commonwealth is now, it seems to me, one of indifference. All three candidates for the leadership of the Conservative Party were asked in the past few days about their attitude to Europe. No one thought of asking what they thought of the Commonwealth. Effectively, the people of this country have turned their backs on the Commonwealth. If it were not so, the signs directing incoming passengers approaching passport control at Heathrow would not divide passengers into those holding EC passports and others, thus lumping Australians, Canadians and New Zealanders together with Libyans or Iranians.<lb/>
Why has this happened? I believe it has happened for two reasons. First, when the present Commonwealth was devised after the Second World War, replacing the former British Commonwealth of Nations, we rolled together the old Dominions, largely inhabited by our own people with whom there was a very close family relationship (they had fought
<col>1012</col>
with us in two world wars) and the recently independent former colonies and dependencies with which we had a new, very important but quite different relationship. We insisted that all should be treated exactly alike.<lb/>
That arrangement was not grounded in reality. It inevitably caused some resentments in the old Commonwealth. What was originally an ingenious arrangement to keep India in the Commonwealth when it became a republic ultimately became a source of weakness. Secondly, Commonwealth heads of government meetings became the occasion, as we all remember, for ferocious and sustained attacks on the British over Rhodesia and South Africa. At the posts where I served we looked forward to them with about the same enthusiasm as we looked forward to visits from British football teams.<lb/>
The British people do not react vigorously to such attacks; they just shrug their shoulders and go down another road. That is what they did. There is some danger now of the same thing happening with Europe. Some of our partners are making the same mistake as our Commonwealth partners. It is a little ominous that, after the departure of Mrs. Thatcher, they are expressing the hope that her successor will be more flexible. If they go on criticising the British Government the British people's enthusiasm for Europe will go the way of their enthusiasm for the Commonwealth and, as we are one of the two main contributors, that may be sad not just for us but also for them.<lb/>
Although during my time in the diplomatic service I had a lot to do with Commonwealth countries, particularly in Africa, I served in only one. I had three very happy and interesting years as high commissioner in Canada. I did not find the job different in essentials from that of an ambassador. The only real difference was that an ambassador represents the Queen and looks after visiting members of the Royal Family whereas a high commissioner represents the Prime Minister. In Canada officials went to surprising lengths to prevent visiting members of the Royal Family encountering the British high commissioner.<lb/>
However, I was immensely struck by the close networks of family relationships; the Scots in Ontario and the Atlantic provinces, the Irish in Newfoundland, Quebec and Ontario, including, notably, the family of my noble friend Lord Shaughnessy. The English and Welsh are all over. Where else would one find a minister for external affairs who spoke fluent Gaelic. When we brought Mr. MacEachan to Edinburgh we had to scour the Western Isles for Gaelic speakers to talk to him.<lb/>
I had the good fortune to encounter an amazing demonstration of this family relationship during the Falklands War. The Canadians knew then that we were in the right, defending a small territory with a mandatory United Nations resolution behind us. They could give free rein to their feelings. I shall never forget the letters and telephone calls that flooded in offering help, and the practical help that we had from so many Canadians from Mr. Trudea a down. It was a marvellous demonstration of solidarity. I believe
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0546"/>
<col>1013</col>
that it owed everything to the family and historic relationships and hardly anything to common membership of the Commonwealth.<lb/>
Nevertheless, I believe that we should hold on to what we have. In practical terms there is a good deal to be said for the suggestions made by the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill. I hope that they will be seriously considered.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04561"><member>Lord Auckland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House is deeply indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, not only for initiating this debate but for a most impressive speech. Where are our priorities? We have had debate after debate on the European Community, and I have no quarrel with that. It is an extremely important organisation at the present time. However, after 32 years in your Lordships' House I think I can count on a finger the number of debates about the Commonwealth. I shall be rather partial in discussing primarily one country in the short time at my disposal.<lb/>
Many of your Lordships have strong links with the Commonwealth. I have strong links with New Zealand. I was there last March. Like the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, I have the honour of being a vice-president of the Great Britain in New Zealand Year 1990. It is a year which has brought New Zealand to the fore. The Treaty of Waitanki has been a historic occasion. As a result of it, in the current year much money has been raised for the foundation of an educational research establishment in New Zealand.<lb/>
I am also a long-standing member of the New Zealand Society and chairman of the Anglo-South Pacific Group of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I join in the hope that Fiji, which my wife and I visited in 1971 prior to an official visit to the city of Auckland, will return to the Commonwealth. I have had the privilege recently, through the good offices of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, to visit both Australia and New Zealand. Anyone who goes to the Domain in Auckland and sees the names of 4,000 New Zealanders who fell in Crete, and who visits the war graves centre in Canberra, will realise the debt that we owe to the Commonwealth.<lb/>
We owe a debt particularly to the Maoris. I have had the privilege of three Maori welcomes in New Zealand. The Maoris have contributed enormously not only to the fight for freedom but in the education and general running of organisations in New Zealand. If ever there were an example of good race relations it is between the Maoris and what they call the Pakeha, the white population in New Zealand. There are shortcomings, but if one looks at race relations generally that is something to be commended.<lb/>
While I was in New Zealand in March the delegation which comprised five Members from the other place and myself visited the Bay of Islands, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, all within seven days. It was a fairly heavily organised trip but well worth it. We saw a country which has strong links here. There may be a distance of 13,000 miles, but
<col>1014</col>
there are few families in this country who have not a friend or an acquaintance living in either Australia or New Zealand.<lb/>
The time has come for the Government to spend far more time on the subject of the Commonwealth. Trade with New Zealand and Australia continues to flourish but there are many problems. I confess to never having been a very enthusiastic supporter of the European Community. I acknowledge, as do the Commonwealth countries, the need for collaboration between Europe and the Commonwealth, particularly New Zealand. However, having visited a kiwi fruit farm in Kerikeri in the Bay of Islands last March, I am appalled to see in our shops kiwi fruit imported from Italy. I do not know whether my noble friend has any information as to what preferences are given to the Commonwealth over the European Community, particularly concerning butter and fruit. That is vital.<lb/>
I have also had the privilege, through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, of visiting Jamaica, another country to which we owe an enormous debt in two world wars. Noble Lords with far more knowledge than I of the Commonwealth have been allocated six minutes to speak. I shall say no more but I plead with the Government to allow proper time to discuss matters with our real friends.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04562">6.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04563"><member>Lord Hunt of Tanworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have personal reasons for welcoming the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, in introducing this debate. I began my Civil Service career in 1946 in the old Dominions' Office. Very shortly afterwards, as the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, has said, I had the pleasure of carrying his ministerial bag around parts of the world. Over the following 35 years I had regular contacts with my opposite numbers in Commonwealth countries and I accompanied four different Prime Ministers to heads of government meetings in different parts of the world. I mention that simply because experience over a long period gives one a feeling for what the Commonwealth is and what it is not.<lb/>
The Commonwealth is often talked about as a club, despite the fact that it has as its members more than a quarter of the world's population, people from large and small countries and from developed and developing countries. It certainly belies Groucho Marx's famous remark: "I wouldn't want to belong to any club which would have me as a member". The Commonwealth has no rules of membership and is based only on the principles of partnership and equality. Despite very great differences of size, prosperity and culture, all its members seem to value the association and want it to continue. The club connotation perhaps relates to the informality and the chemistry of its proceedings.<lb/>
We should remember what the Commonwealth is and what it is not. It is not a regional grouping, a security network or a trade area. All its members belong to other regional, political and economic bodies. It is as much a red herring to say that our membership of the Commonwealth is inconsistent with our primary role as a member of the European
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0547"/>
<col>1015</col>
Community as to say that the Commonwealth's Caribbean members should not belong to the Association of American States. The real question is whether the Commonwealth stands for good or for bad and whether it is in our interests to continue an active membership of it.<lb/>
We should remember that it is the only international grouping outside the United Nations which brings together developed and developing countries from across the world, irrespective of power or culture. Unlike members of the United Nations, these different countries have certain things in common. In what is now an association of 50 independent countries, Her Majesty the Queen, in her role as head of the Commonwealth, is the only formal link with the past. But the fact remains that all 50 independent Commonwealth countries share certain things derived originally from the United Kingdom. We should not be ashamed of that. They derive from us their independence, their common language, much of their legal, educational and parliamentary systems, and so on. That is why they share so many interests and find it so easy to communicate. It is also why there are so many thriving unofficial Commonwealth bodies which owe nothing to the promptings of the Commonwealth Secretariat or governments.<lb/>
But if this legacy&#x2014;I deliberately say "legacy" rather than memory&#x2014;of a shared colonial past makes it easy for them to find community in diversity, it also means that in this country we have a major interest in the Commonwealth's health, not as a buttress to our prestige or in thinking of it as a British Commonwealth still instead of a Commonwealth of Nations, but as a cross-section of the world in which we have special links and through which we can influence, learn and, in the case of undeveloped countries, help.<lb/>
None of this is very dramatic stuff. The Commonwealth is at its best when pursuing educational co-operation and mobility rather than issuing high-flown declarations which may sound fine to those who sign them but are often forgotten. The danger is that because of the emphasis on Europe people in this country are growing up without some of the old links and do not understand what the Commonwealth means, what it is and why it is to our advantage still to be an active member of it. I very much hope that the high level group, which is preparing the report to be considered at the next Commonwealth heads of government meeting, will concentrate on what I call the practical rather than the high-flown side of the Commonwealth. I hope the Government will reassure us not only today but in their subsequent actions that the Commonwealth, despite all its imperfections, still matters to them. There is a great reservoir of friendship in the Commonwealth which we should not neglect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04565"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I have personal reasons for thanking the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, for introducing the debate. As he knows, I have been involved for most of my life in Commonwealth
<col>1016</col>
activities of one kind or another. I look back with great affection to my work with the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, and before that, with Clem Attlee, Jim Griffiths, Nye Bevan and Jim Callaghan. At that time&#x2014;the time when the modern Commonwealth was being created&#x2014;there were passing through my office Pandit Nehru, Julius Nyerere, Kenneth Kaunda, Dr. Evatt, Seretse Khama, Lee Kuan Yew, Norman Manley and many others. This was the formative period of the modern Commonwealth. I have been covering Commonwealth conferences ever since, either writing for the <i>New Statesman</i> and other magazines or acting as adviser. I draw the attention of the House to the statement of principles on which the Commonwealth has been based since 1971. I have a particular prejudice in favour of that statement because I was author of the first draft.<lb/>
In this short debate I want to concentrate on two issues concerning the future of the Commonwealth. One has already been mentioned by my noble friend Lord Pitt. I refer to ethnic relations. One hardly need say it but in no institution or organisation in the world can the relations between ethnic communities be better worked out than in this multi-racial Commonwealth. The focal point is the attitude of the Commonwealth to South Africa. The decision to impose sanctions on South Africa has borne fruit. As Mr. de Klerk and his colleagues have admitted, it was largely the imposition of sanctions which brought the South African Government to the negotiating table with Nelson Mandela. The Eminent Persons Group of a few years ago played an immensely constructive role in pointing the way forward although its recommendations were turned down by the Government.<lb/>
The Commonwealth played a vital part in the creation of the new Zimbabwe. The tie I am wearing was presented to me as one of those who collaborated with the Commonwealth delegation to the Rhodesian elections of 1980. The Commonwealth played a vital role during those elections and during the transition period. Can it not do the same or something similar in the new situation in South Africa? I believe that it can. I believe that it can help to give confidence in the building of a new constitution in that country.<lb/>
However, there is another vital aspect in the future of South Africa which concerns the Commonwealth. I refer to the fact that apartheid has left that country denuded of skilled workers and with half of the black population illiterate. Where are we to turn to supply the skills which will be needed in a new democratic South Africa, and how are we to rectify that discrimination against the black population? The Commonwealth has already set up an expert group on education to undertake precisely that task. I do not believe that any other institution in the world is capable of effectively doing so.<lb/>
The second issue is that of population and resources. As has already been pointed out, the present Commonwealth consists of about one quarter of the entire population of the world; that is, 1.48 billion people. It is estimated that by the year 2025 the number will have increased to 2.8 billion. That is nearly one third of the total population of the world.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0548"/>
<col>1017</col>
What does that mean as regards the use of the resources of the world? At present the top billion of the people in the world uses about 70 per cent. of the total energy of the world and the bottom billion uses virtually nothing. However, the situation will change; but if it is to be changed without causing disaster to the planet, it can only be changed by the use of cleaner technologies, by energy efficiency and by resource conservation.<lb/>
Last year the Commonwealth secretariat produced its analysis entitled, <i>A Climate Change.</i> I was in Jamaica last year for the Finance Ministers' conference when the then Secretary General Sonny Ramphal made a rousing speech in the midst of the hurricane season in the Caribbean on the dangers of climate warming and the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The secretariat has now taken that factor on board and is making what I believe to be an essential contribution to this immense, crucial problem which faces us all: how to help the developing peoples of the world to create a standard of living which will just sustain life, without destroying the planet.<lb/>
Mention has already been made of the fact that we are concentrating upon our membership of the European Community. We are in the Community and we shall not leave it. However, let us not forget our long-standing membership of the Commonwealth. Let us echo what has been said from all Benches this afternoon and plead with the Government to make an unreserved statement that they will constructively contribute at all times to the development and expansion of Commonwealth work in association with the European Community and not as an alternative to it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04567"><member>Lord Thurlow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, introduced the vital question of the race between resources and population in the context of the Commonwealth relationship. Later in my brief remarks I shall return to that issue as I believe it to be of foremost importance.<lb/>
I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that we must try to clarify what the Commonwealth is and what it is not. Like the noble Lord, I have experienced a certain immersion in Commonwealth affairs. The vast majority of our relations with Commonwealth countries, and the relationships between those countries, are conducted on a bilateral basis on broadly similar lines to those of our diplomatic relations with other foreign countries.<lb/>
The collective side of the Commonwealth relationship is something which in relative terms has always been very small. I do not mean to diminish in any way the significance of what we share; indeed, this is in some ways the decade of networking&#x2014;I believe that is the "in" word. The Commonwealth is the supernetwork. It has a web which criss-crosses across every type of relationship&#x2014;that is, commercial, professional, governmental, parliamentary, and so on. As noble Lords have said, this side of the Commonwealth is
<col>1018</col>
immensely important and I hope that the Government will put their shoulders to doing everything they can to develop this admittedly rather tenuous and intangible field of effort.<lb/>
The Commonwealth is not some kind of treaty organisation. It is not an association for defined legal, political, commercial or security commitments; it is a totally different area of international affairs. That is what makes the antithesis with the European Community a false one. I agree with the view which has been expressed that our increased sharing of sovereignty in Europe provides an opportunity and not a threat to Commonwealth countries, provided that we can bring about a greater understanding and sympathy among our European partners with the problems and interests of other Commonwealth countries. Alas, in the past that consideration has been very much ignored, although I shall not mention any names.<lb/>
I return now to the issue of the main global problem of our time; namely, the race between population and resources. I believe that this is an area in which a collective Commonwealth effort could make a significant contribution. At present, under the umbrella of the Commonwealth secretariat, a modest effort is being made in the field of education and technical assistance. It covers a wide range of valuable exchanges but on a modest scale. Most international aid and most of our aid&#x2014;rightly, in my view &#x2014;flows on a bilateral basis or through international agencies.<lb/>
The particular kind of easy, informal relationship and the collective framework which we have in the Commonwealth provide a good opportunity for pilot projects. It is timely that at this juncture the senior Commonwealth officials are focusing on the potential and the possibilities of future Commonwealth collective effort.<lb/>
I have no doubt that the answer to the problem of resources versus population lies in the educational field. A crash programme of accelerated education must be introduced to enable the peoples of the developing Commonwealth countries to help themselves. No amount of available resources from the West can meet the needs of Africa and Asia, leaving aside the new claims of Eastern Europe.<lb/>
It is by helping the developing countries to acquire the skills themselves in fields of agricultural techniques, health and family planning that a solution can be found, and I hope that the studies being made by this high-level group will identify this area of education as a suitable point for collective effort. Studies are at present being made at the London Business School in this particular field. When concrete plans are available, I hope that the Commonwealth collectively will come behind them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04569"><member>Lord Moore of Wolvercote</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the first opportunity I have had of speaking about the Commonwealth since becoming a Member of your Lordships' House. I am therefore most grateful to the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0549"/>
<col>1019</col>
noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for having initiated this debate. I strongly support the valuable suggestions he made at the end of his speech.<lb/>
During a period of 20 years I had the privilege of visiting over 40 Commonwealth countries in the service of the head of the Commonwealth. I was always deeply moved by the sight of tens of thousands of English-speaking peoples in all five continents coming out into the streets to cheer the Queen. It is not possible to undergo this experience without pondering long and hard on the significance of such a remarkable phenomenon, surely unique in the history of international politics.<lb/>
I came to the conclusion that there is enormous underlying strength in the Commonwealth. Shared history, common institutions and traditions, the English language, economic links and the stature of the Queen as head of the Commonwealth&#x2014;all these have contributed towards making the Commonwealth a constructive and stabilising influence in world affairs. The problem that arises is how, in this fast-changing world, to make the best use of the Commonwealth in Britain's interest, in the interests of other Commonwealth countries and as an international organisation.<lb/>
By and large the Commonwealth has not received a good press in Britain in recent years, largely due to the view that Britain's future lies only in the European Community. We must answer the question: what is the relevance of the Commonwealth to a Britain committed to membership of a free trade area in Europe and being pressed to join a more closely knit economic and political union?<lb/>
Political integration does not seem to me to be a starter. The history of political federations is a story of disappointed hopes. Language, history and geography all make it very unlikely that Britain will join a federal political union in Europe; but, economically, the European Community is vital to Britain. Since Britain joined, the Community's share of our trade has risen from about one-third to one-half&#x2014;a very significant shift. However, we have to remember that the balance of our trade with the Community is negative whereas the balance with the Commonwealth continues to be positive. In other words, what we sell to the Commonwealth enables us to buy more than we could otherwise from Europe, and our ties with the rest of the world are becoming more important to Europe as the centre of gravity in the world economy moves towards the Pacific. Our links with Australia and New Zealand, as well as with Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Brunei give us special opportunities to play a part in the dramatic growth of trade in that region.<lb/>
So there is no need for Britain to choose between the Commonwealth and the Community. Our ties with the countries that share our history can help us to maintain our individuality and identity in an increasingly integrated Europe and to make our own contribution to this evolving community of nations. But the Commonwealth will not prosper in the 21st century unless there are new and constructive initiatives. It was heartening that in Kuala Lumpur the heads of government decided to set up a high-level
<col>1020</col>
appraisal group to bring the Commonwealth more into play on current world problems. I sincerely hope they will produce some new ideas to be considered at Harare next year, with, I trust, the British Prime Minister playing a prominent role.<lb/>
However, this is not only a commonwealth of governments. It is also a commonwealth of peoples. We need much closer co-operation between governments and voluntary organisations working together and sharing responsibility. Sometimes one wonders whether Commonwealth governments fully appreciate the enormous potential of the non-governmental organisations and the spirit and drive which motivate them. An excellent lead has been given by the Commonwealth Foundation in the setting up of Commonwealth liaison units to co-ordinate the activities of non-governmental organisations and to underline the regional interdependence of Commonwealth countries.<lb/>
Some of the NGOs are well known and have for long been carrying out invaluable work, many on shoestring budgets. To mention just one or two, there is Commonwealth Day, organised by the Joint Commonwealth Societies Council, with the Queen's Commonwealth Day Message to young people. That is marked by a variety of Commonwealth Day activities throughout the Commonwealth. There is the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council, which does invaluable work. Then there is the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, now called Sightsavers, the Commonwealth Press Union, and many others. All do very important work.<lb/>
Do not imagine, my Lords, that the NGOs are all London based. Non-governmental organisations are emerging all over the Commonwealth. I give just three examples. There is the Self-Employed Women's Association of India, which is a formidable body; the Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya and, a particularly interesting one, the African NGO Environmental Network, which is seeking to bring home to African countries the dangers to the environment of ill-considered development. These voluntary organisations are the lifeblood of the Commonwealth. Much of what the Commonwealth is able to do would be more effectively and persuasively done if the unofficial Commonwealth were mobilised and enabled to play its full part.<lb/>
The Commonwealth heads of government meeting at Harare next year has a wonderful opportunity to establish a new relationship with the NGOs. The Commonwealth Foundation has already taken a valuable initiative in setting up an NGO forum, the first meeting of which is to take place in Harare some months before the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. I trust that the heads of government will give serious consideration to its recommendations. NGOs can help governments to bring the Commonwealth into the mainstream of world development and can help to build a constructive and creative partnership without parallel in the world's history. I hope that the noble Lord the Minister will be able to confirm that Her Majesty's Government

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04571"><member>Lord St.John of Bletso</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Greenhill of Harrow for introducing this debate and endorse the sentiments voiced by the noble Lords, Lord Boyd-Carpenter and Lord Pitt of Hampstead, that it is a pity we could not have had much longer to debate this extremely important subject today. Certainly my speech was planned for around 12 minutes and to curtail it substantially to six minutes gives me quite a problem.<lb/>
My noble friend in drawing attention to the role and future of the Commonwealth has also drawn attention to the need for a collective refocusing of the energies of its members. I am encouraged that these objectives have been echoed by the new Secretary General to the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, who has committed himself to the strengthening of democracy in the organisation which over the last few years would appear to have devoted itself to a large degree to combating apartheid in South Africa.<lb/>
It is on the subject of South Africa that I wish to concentrate my remarks today. As noble Lords may be aware, I have spent most of my life based there and thus have the benefit of first-hand experience. At the outset I wish to voice my total support for the objectives and existence of the Commonwealth and join in welcoming the recent membership of Namibia.<lb/>
That being said, some of the contradictory elements in the nature of the Commonwealth were highlighted in the events of last year and particularly at the Kuala Lumpur heads of government meeting. The organisation's public face emerged as one which sanctimoniously decried the evils of apartheid in South Africa while, in my opinion, ignoring the contempt shown by some prominent and vocal members for the principles of democracy and individual liberties and freedoms in their own countries. I am encouraged by the extremely balanced approach taken by the new secretary general, particularly to the establishment of a Commonwealth expert group, on human resources and development needs for a post-apartheid South Africa, a point which was alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby. It is noteworthy that this group includes a member of the ANC and a prominent South African economist.<lb/>
In August this year, at the 10th anniversary summit meeting of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Committee (otherwise known as the SADCC) in Gaberone, Botswana, the secretary general said:
<quote>"The Commonwealth stands ready to provide all the practical assistance towards the success of the negotiations and thereafter to contribute to the socio-economic construction of a post apartheid South Africa".</quote>
I do not know how he managed to get all that out in one breath&#x0021;<lb/>

Since the Kuala Lumpur meeting last year we have seen dramatic political change in South Africa, particularly following State President de Klerk's momentous speech on 2nd February. Indeed, most of the preconditions to the lifting of sanctions laid down in the Eminent Persons Group report in 1986, and following last year's Kuala Lumpur meeting, have been met. The Commonwealth Heads of Government statement last year said, when justifying sanctions:
<quote>"Their purpose was not punitive, but to abolish apartheid by bringing Pretoria to the negotiating table and keeping it there until that change was irreversibly secured".</quote>
I would argue that South Africa is now well on the road to irreversible change. While I would not expect a total lifting of sanctions, I believe that now is the time for selective international sanctions to be lifted. This would promote much needed economic growth in the country.<lb/>
All the political parties in the negotiating process for a new constitution in South Africa agree that the key to a successful and secure post-apartheid state is a strong and stable economy. This is particularly pertinent in respect of the startling demographic characteristics of the country which I have often mentioned in previous speeches in your Lordships' House. I shall repeat them briefly. It has a population growth rate in excess of 3 per cent. Over 60 per cent. of the population are under the age of 23; over 1 million blacks are migrating into the towns every year; and unemployment is over 50 per cent. These factors place considerable strains on the infrastructure and the economy.<lb/>
I understand that in recognising these challenges facing South Africa, as well as the recent political reforms, the ANC will shortly ease its stand on sanctions. Clearly, however, even if sanctions were to be lifted totally now, it would not precipitate a major inflow of foreign investment into the country.<lb/>
World attention has recently focused on the tragic violence in the townships. There will have to be not just a cessation of violence but a visibly stable economic, social and political environment before committed funds will flow back into South Africa. In my recent speech in the foreign affairs and defence debate I outlined what I believed were the key reasons for the unrest in South Africa. Without repeating myself, I believe that the root causes for the violence can be overcome. Just as with the rest of Africa, education, housing and health care are major issues to be addressed in South Africa. It is noteworthy that the South African Government have this year allocated substantial extra funds to tackling these matters.<lb/>
To bring our focus back to the issue of this debate, I firmly believe that a non-racial, democratic South Africa can be achieved out of the current process. Such an outcome would place the country as one of the future powerhouses of the continent. Even in its beleaguered state, South Africa currently accounts for 4 per cent. of the continent's population yet produces 54 per cent. of Africa's energy, 50 per cent. of the motor vehicles, 81 per cent. of all rail freight and 30 per cent. of the continent's exports.<lb/>

In conclusion, while the possibility of South Africa applying to rejoin the Commonwealth is not high on its agenda, I endorse the secretary general's stated wish to see the return of South Africa to the Commonwealth by the end of his term of office; that would be by the middle of 1995. In that event, I can foresee the rather ironic outcome whereby a country which has been the cause of so much division within the Commonwealth will ultimately be able to provide an example of democracy and racial harmony, thereby becoming a major contributor to the strengthening of the Commonwealth.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04573"><member>Viscount Buckmaster</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, I apologise to my noble friend Lord Greenhill for missing the first few minutes of his speech. Like other noble Lords who have spoken, I warmly welcome this opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth. I shall confine my remarks entirely to Uganda because it is the country in the Commonwealth that I know best. I have addressed your Lordships on it on several occasions.<lb/>
I was recently given the opportunity to visit the country again thanks to a warm invitation from the Ugandan Government which came in the name of the President himself. The Government welcomed me most warmly; it was an extremely worth while and interesting visit. I must record my warm thanks to the Government for their invitation.<lb/>
On previous occasions when I spoke in the days of Obote and Amin the situation in Uganda was pretty black. There was a great deal of torture, terrorism and so on. Now I am glad to say&#x2014;I wish to make this point as strongly as I can&#x2014;the situation is much better. President Museveni is firmly in control and I formed the overall impression of growing peace and prosperity.<lb/>
The only area of which your Lordships may have heard where there is a certain amount of trouble is in the north, in the province of Teso. I shall speak about it in a minute.<lb/>
I started my tour in Kampala, where I spent four days at the Sheraton Hotel&#x2014;an excellent place, well up to the standard of Sheratons all over the world. I would say that it is even better than the best hotels in Nairobi. In 1971, the year in which I left Uganda, there was a great deal of trouble caused by armed bandits known as Kondos. It was difficult to walk around in Kampala without being conscious of these people. On one occasion I saw two half-dead men lying by the roadside; it was quite a normal occurrence. No one bothered about it at all. Now I am glad to say that one can walk the streets of Kampala without any difficulty at all, even at night. That contrasts with the situation in Nairobi, where I was warned not to walk even 200 yards at half-past six in the evening for fear of being beaten up.<lb/>
I was received warmly in Entebbe by the President. He told me how pleased he was that Great Britain is now the leading aid donor to Uganda to the tune of &#x00A3;28 million annually. That is a substantial sum. Unfortunately inflation is running at 25 per cent. and the currency situation is also serious. There are now
<col>1024</col>
1,200 Ugandan shillings to the pound sterling and there is no note larger than a 100 shilling note. Consequently one has to carry a whole sack of money about.<lb/>
The President is anxious to develop what used to be called the three "C"s and the three "T"s. The three "C"s stand for coffee, cotton and copper. The copper is now exhausted but the other two commodities are being developed. The three "T"s stand for tourism, tea and tobacco.<lb/>
After my stay in Kampala I was taken up by air to the north to Gulu, where I met a most active and energetic Minister who is in charge of the north of the country. That Minister, Mrs. Betty Bigombe, has many of the qualities that Ministers in your Lordships' House have. The situation there is peaceful, and under the Minister's active guidance everything is being done to refurbish and develop those areas that have been devastated by the war. Various agricultural projects are in hand and projects have also been established to help the former boy soldiers to obtain employment. One such project comprises the manufacture of bowls and similar metal objects.<lb/>
The standard of living unfortunately remains low. In one area that we visited by helicopter people were appealing for blankets. Blankets are a pretty basic commodity and it is sad that people have to appeal for them. Even officials find it difficult to make ends meet. An excellent senior official showed me around. He was a man of great intelligence and he spoke perfect English. Nevertheless, he has to run a farm just to keep himself going.<lb/>
I was also taken to Jinja to see various industries, particularly the fisheries industry, which is going very well. I also saw the textile and sugar factories, among others. Ugandans hope that in two or three years time they will be independent in the production of sugar. I hope with the start that has been made under such Ministers as Mrs. Bigombe and others Uganda will be able to take its place in the Commonwealth. It always has had the reputation of being the jewel of East Africa as it has an abundantly fertile soil and an able and active population. We look forward to a bright future for this country. I recommend British businessmen to invest in it, if they can find the opportunity to do so, particularly in the sphere of agricultural machinery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04574">7.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04575"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for initiating the debate. I thank him particularly for taking less than his allotted time for his speech. He and the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, were two of the few speakers who did so. I wish to echo the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, on the Royal Air Force when he said that it was a particularly good place to study members of the Commonwealth during the war. I served in bomber command during the war, and every crew that I flew with contained a member of the Commonwealth. I remember with great affection and joy their vigour in flying, and afterwards in the various
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0552"/>
<col>1025</col>
bars around East Anglia which the Royal Air Force frequented. However, that was the old-style Commonwealth. That Commonwealth has done us enormous good. We were all familiar with that Commonwealth and had relations with it.<lb/>
As regards our present position in Europe, it must be obvious that we should remain in Europe as it should be a base from which we can do an enormous amount to increase our wealth and use it in the Commonwealth. At the present time the most important thing that we can do to help the Commonwealth is to reduce the agricultural surpluses which we dump on the world market at prices which ruin many third world farmers. I say that as a farmer. I expect to see the income of farmers and of the population in the countryside kept up by using the money in the budget in a wiser way.<lb/>
We are neglecting the enormous areas and the enormous populations that exist throughout the Commonwealth. There are 110 million people in Nigeria, 100 million people in Pakistan and 800 million people in India. As every speaker has said, that represents an enormous proportion of the world's population. By a happy chance I had lunch today with a distinguished lawyer from Nigeria who is an old friend of mine. He gave me a lot of information on the current situation in Nigeria. We are neglecting that great country.<lb/>
I have a certain knowledge of the French as I am married to a French lady. They are carrying out a far greater number of projects in Nigeria than we are. They are developing the gas industry. Elf and Dutch Shell have established projects in that country but there has been no move from British Gas. That is extraordinary in my opinion. In addition, the French are cultivating the Nigerians in all areas of the country. People who help France are rewarded with French decorations. We appear to be falling behind, even in education. The Government did a great deal of harm when they cut the grants for overseas students and forced up their fees. The Government forced students to seek courses in other parts of the world. The Government can and should put that position right. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance on that. My friend also told me that some army officers now go to West Point in the United States for training rather than to Sandhurst. That is an instance of the many areas where we need to make improvements in order to improve the whole situation.<lb/>
The Commonwealth Secretariat is situated in London. Compliments have been made from all sides of the House to both the past and present secretaries general of the Commonwealth Secretariat. That body is being used to enormous advantage throughout the whole Commonwealth. However, I know that this country does not provide the entire budget for the secretariat. I understand that the budget for the running of the secretariat is about &#x00A3;7.9 million. The budget for the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation which is an enormously important body, is about &#x00A3;30 million. In this country the Rural
<col>1026</col>
Development Council &#x2014;an excellent body&#x2014;has a budget of &#x00A3;34 million. The Highlands and Islands Development Board has a budget for administration alone of over &#x00A3;6 million. While nobody wants to encourage bureaucracy, a body of such immense value, which represents over a quarter of the world's population, should be given the tools to do the job, particularly in the field of technical development.<lb/>
Many noble Lords have mentioned the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Its work is enormously valuable. It has probably done more good through its contacts than the meetings of the heads of states. There are also many other non-government bodies which ought to be encouraged. I attended a conference in Kenya organised by the Society of Royal Agricultural Societies, which is headed by and was started up and encouraged by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. The goodwill and knowledge engendered in such conferences offers an example of what can be done with this enormously valuable Commonwealth to which we belong. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us today not of the Government's commitment but of their enthusiastic support for the growth of good feeling and contact between all members of the Commonwealth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04576">7.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04577"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, must be very satisfied with the very positive response that noble Lords have given to his Motion today. He must also be happy with the proposals that have been put forward for its future.<lb/>
The noble Lord has chosen a very appropriate time for the debate: first, because of the imminent meeting of the High Level Appraisal Group; and, secondly, because the role of the Commonwealth is growing and developing and its existence is of the greatest importance in the world today. Many people are grateful for its existence.<lb/>
I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the recent membership of Pakistan and, more recently, of Namibia. I look forward to the day when changes in South Africa's political system make it possible for it to return to the Commonwealth. In that context, I was very interested by the very positive speech made by the noble Lord, Lord St. John, today.<lb/>
It is important to recognise why the Commonwealth is such a key international organisation. As noble Lords have said, it does not receive much press attention. That may be because things are going quite well. I believe that the Commonwealth's unique position was very well expressed in the words of the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Anyaoku, when he addressed the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Harare:
<quote>"a central attribute of the Commonwealth is its ability to bridge racial, ideological and economic divides and inequalities, assisted by its common language and common professional and institutional heritage. It is an attribute that will be of increasing value to a world in which new tensions within racially and culturally mixed communities and new threats to the stability and cohesion of established nation states are appearing".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0553"/>
<col>1027</col>
Like other noble Lords, I should like to pay tribute to the secretary general and wish him great success in his work. I should also like to pay my respects to the secretariat.<lb/>
It can be argued that the style adopted by the Commonwealth of negotiation, consensus and networking is a more appropriate and effective style than that of the majority vote and political power game characteristic of many regional and international organisations which are also trying to solve world problems.<lb/>
The relationship between the United Kingdom and her partners in the Commonwealth has had its up and downs in recent years. It must be said that Commonwealth countries have been supportive of Her Majesty's Government over European Community matters, which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said quite rightly is Britain's main preoccupation. The Commonwealth also showed loyal support to the Government in the Falklands war. However, looking back at recent meetings of Commonwealth heads of government it would appear that the United Kingdom was out of step with the other members, particularly appearing not to share the other members' sense of vision and confidence in that body. That has sometimes meant that Britain has looked isolated within the community. Therefore, I should like to join other noble Lords who have asked for a very strong commitment by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, tonight.<lb/>
I believe that it would be true to say that the Labour Party has had a more positive attitude towards the Commonwealth. It sees the Commonwealth in terms of a modern Commonwealth rather than a British Commonwealth. It sees it as made up of free and independent nations with diversity as its great strength. It should be borne in mind that it is a group of countries which could probably survive without Britain.<lb/>
I should like to put forward two ideas for the future of the Commonwealth and how its framework could be used further. The first concerns the burden of debt from which the least developed members of the Commonwealth suffer. I suggest that there might be a debtors' forum as part of the Commonwealth mechanism. As the Commonwealth is made up of countries from both the North and the South, unlike other international bodies, it is well placed to take the initiative to set up such a body and to assist those debtor countries. After all, the donor countries of the North have the World Bank to represent them. I see the establishment of a debtors' forum for the countries to the South of the North-South divide as a helpful and necessary initiative.<lb/>
Secondly, the West has shown a great deal of interest in democracy in Eastern Europe. Why have we not shown so much interest in the countries of the Commonwealth which are struggling with democracy? I believe that we should show more interest in how they could achieve that rather than merely castigating them when they fail. The communiqu&#x00E9; of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting held in Kuala Lumpur stated that:
<col>1028</col>
<quote>"one of the Commonwealth's contributions to strengthening democracy might be the provision of Commonwealth assistance in helping member countries to reinforce their election and other constitutional processes through a facility for mounting observer missions at the request of member governments".</quote>
I believe that that would be a very helpful way not only of assisting those countries in running fair elections but also of confirming that those governments have conformed to the democraiic process and are thus legitimate. I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether Her Majesty's Government support the idea of a permanent service which might be offered by the Commonwealth Secretary-General to provide a team of observers carrying his authority to oversee elections when requested.<lb/>
While on the subject of human rights, a more significant role that the Commonwealth could play in upholding and developing human rights, which would be seen as an important move forward, would be to recognise the significance of the NGOs concerned with human rights. They have a very important role to play, improving awareness of and education in human rights. Also the Commonwealth Foundation should respond to the grant applications of the NGOs, as has been mentioned today. I feel that that is a very important role. Moreover, as proposed at the Kuala Lumpur meeting, it is vital that all governments which have not ratified the international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights should do so as soon as possible.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, has allowed us a few extra minutes so perhaps I could ask the Minister a few questions. Will he say what recommendations Her Majesty's Government will be making at the forthcoming group meeting in Kuala Lumpur to review the future of the Commonwealth? Following the recent meeting of Commonwealth education Ministers in Barbados, can he give us the extent of Her Majesty's Government's commitment to the new higher education support scheme? Can he tell us whether the Government will increase funding to raise basic education standards in the Commonwealth? Can he say whether he is satisfied with the level of overseas students from the Commonwealth countries and does he accept that they have decreased since 1980?<lb/>
To conclude, we on this side of the House wish the Commonwealth continued strength. My honourable friend George Robertson, in a speech in All Souls, Oxford, describing the Commonwealth, said that it was not some formal, stiff institution but:
<quote>"a permanent living network of people of common background enriching each other, teaching and learning from each other and broadening the minds and experience of each other".</quote>
I should very much like to support that concept of the Commonwealth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04578">7.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04579"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this has been a well-informed debate on a very important organisation. We are all indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for giving us an opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0554"/>
<col>1029</col>
occupies a unique place in Britain's affairs. I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate for their interest and ideas. I shall give them careful study.<lb/>
The creation of the Commonwealth out of Britain's colonial past was indeed a proud achievement. At the prime ministers conference which established the modern Commonwealth 41 years ago only eight countries were present. Since then the organisation has grown into maturity with a current membership of 50.<lb/>
The Commonwealth has always been an entirely voluntary association of sovereign nations. Their common denominators are historical links to the United Kingdom and recognition of Her Majesty the Queen as the head of the Commonwealth. It was the noble Lord, Lord Moore of Wolvercote, who reminded the House of the admiration in which Her Majesty is held and indeed the excellent and admirable way in which she performs her duties.<lb/>
The principles on which the Commonwealth is based and which we wholeheartedly support are set out in the 1971 Singapore declaration. They include the promotion of representative institutions and guarantees of freedom under the law, the fight against racial discrimination, the importance of economic development to narrow the gap between rich and poor and the fostering of international co-operation in the cause of peace, tolerance and justice. Approximately one quarter of the world's population lives in Commonwealth countries. Therefore we must not lose sight of the fact that ties between peoples, be they linguistic, cultural, educational, institutional or sporting, are as important as the ties between governments. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Tanworth, said&#x2014;I hope I quote him accurately&#x2014;there is a reservoir of friendship from which all members can learn and benefit.<lb/>
The last 12 months have seen massive changes in the world. A period of adjustment in international relations is inevitable. The Commonwealth was among the first of international organisations to recognise the need to set a new course for the future. As the shackles of communism were being discarded in Eastern Europe in the autumn of last year, the Commonwealth heads of government were meeting in Kuala Lumpur. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, reminded the House, Commonwealth leaders agreed to set up a high level group to identify possible roles which the Commonwealth might need to play in the 1990s and beyond. The review would also examine whether Commonwealth institutions, including the secretariat, were adequately equipped for the task.<lb/>
The 10 heads of government of Australia, the Bahamas, Britain, Canada, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, Nigeria, Singapore and Zambia were invited to form a high level appraisal group. Under Malaysian chairmanship they will meet early in 1991 to prepare a report for presentation to the Commonwealth heads of government next autumn. In the meantime a group of senior officials on which the United Kingdom is represented by the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of
<col>1030</col>
Ilminster, has been meeting to prepare draft recommendations for consideration by the 10 heads of government. Noble Lords will not expect me to try to pre-empt the report, but the Government hope that certain areas of activity will figure in their recommendations. Our top priorities are democracy and human rights. We welcome the strong endorsement of observance of human rights given by the Commonwealth governmental working group of experts in their report published last July. I shall have something to say later about the way in which the Commonwealth can help in that area.<lb/>
Our other priorities include economic and social development with special emphasis on the need of small Commonwealth states, the problems arising from trafficking in narcotics and the illicit use of drugs, the future needs of South Africa, the problems of the third world and the environment. The noble Lord, Lord Shaughnessy, will be pleased to hear that my right honourable friend Mrs. Thatcher, when Prime Minister, wrote in a paper to the previous secretary general of the Commonwealth:
<quote>"First amongst the practical problems is the threat to the global environment".</quote>
The House is clearly concerned about the Commonwealth's future role. We believe that that role in the 1990s should be built on the success of its first 40 years. The Commonwealth should not try to duplicate the work of other international organisations. It should continue to provide a forum in which countries from many different regions of the world come together to discuss international issues. It should provide help and mutual support to members in tackling the practical problems which face them and should encourage the network of contacts between professional, educational and voluntary organisations throughout member countries.<lb/>
It surprised me that very few noble Lords mentioned costs. The noble Viscount, Lord Buckmaster, did so when he mentioned our aid programme in his interesting update of the situation in Uganda. The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, wanted us to do more but did not offer any idea of where the money should come from to carry out the programmes that he wished to see. The noble Lord will therefore be interested to know that at present we meet 30 per cent. and will continue to meet 30 per cent. both of the secretariat's running costs and its multilateral aid programme.<lb/>
Our contribution to Commonwealth institutions currently amounts to some &#x00A3;15 million per annum. In addition, our bilateral aid to Commonwealth countries in 1989 was over &#x00A3;700 million&#x2014;nearly three-quarters of our total bilateral aid. We also contribute substantial sums to Commonwealth countries through our multilateral aid programmes. Britain's contribution to the European Development Fund and the Lom&#x00E9; IV loan will be &#x00A3;1.36 billion over the next five years, a good proportion of which will go to help those 35 Commonwealth countries which are parties to the Lom&#x00E9; Convention.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0555"/>
<col>1031</col>
Over the years the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has provided the means for parliamentarians from Commonwealth countries to meet and exchange views. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, that the CPA's United Kingdom branch, through its seminars and visits programme, has made an important contribution to parliamentary democracy throughout the Commonwealth. It was my noble friend Lord Selkirk who reminded us that recent events might lull us into a false sense of confidence in the inevitable triumph of democracy. We must not fall into that trap. Its institutions must be guarded carefully.<lb/>
We were all deeply shocked by the traumatic events which began on 22nd July this year in Port of Spain when a minority group under Abu Bakir attempted to overthrow the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Robinson. The Trinidad and Tobago security forces and those Ministers not held hostage coped admirably with a difficult situation. Democracy was upheld. The Abu Bakir affair demonstrated the vulnerability of small states to a determined attack by a small band of well armed and well organised extremists. To counter such incidents there is an urgent need for closer regional co-operation between security forces and the police of those small countries. That is especially important when one considers that many countries, unlike Trinidad and Tobago, do not have the benefit of a standing military force.<lb/>
I have mentioned that democracy and human rights are our top priorities. We therefore welcome the decision of President Hoyte of Guyana to invite the Commonwealth, together with the Carter Centre of the United States, to monitor the forthcoming Guyanese elections. The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, will be pleased to hear that we have offered to make a significant contribution towards the costs of the Commonwealth observer team. Agreement has now been reached on Opposition demands for a preliminary count at the place of polling and the compilation of a new voters' list, based on a house-to-house enumeration survey. Those developments give cause for optimism that the forthcoming elections will be held on an open and democratic basis.<lb/>
The Commonwealth profile has been highest in recent years in connection with events in southern Africa. As the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, reminded us, we welcomed Namibia as the Commonwealth's 50th member earlier this year. The Government of Namibia have made a sensible, pragmatic start. The new Administration include and reconcile elements formerly at odds with one another. Britain has made a major contribution to the stability of Namibia through the training of the defence force and the police. We intend to continue military training for a second year. We have pledged an additional &#x00A3;10 million in development aid which will be devoted to police training, English language training, education and health. We understand that Namibians intend to
<col>1032</col>
negotiate the important question of the administration of Walvis Bay bilaterally with the South Africans. If asked, we stand ready to provide diplomatic support.<lb/>
On South Africa, the Commonwealth has yet to take sufficient account of the remarkable changes which have taken place this year. President de Klerk's bold steps to restore normal political life and begin the ending of apartheid have opened the way to constitutional negotiations. We believe that the Commonwealth should acknowledge what he has done and help to achieve more. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, said, we believe that the time is right to reduce sanctions.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, was of course right to say that economic growth is essential if the reform process in South Africa is to be successful. For that, South Africa needs outside help, but sadly the Commonwealth has yet to implement the heads of government decision taken at Kuala Lumpur last year to ask international financial institutions to study the help that they may give South Africa in the future.<lb/>
On the positive side, I am glad to say that the Committee of Foreign Ministers has set up an expert group to study the human resource needs of post-apartheid South Africa. The noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, and the House will be pleased to note that that is a priority for our &#x00A3;8 million bilateral aid programme this year.<lb/>
The Gulf crisis has had a severe impact on Commonwealth countries in Asia. Many tens of thousands of workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Malaysia have had to flee from Iraq and Kuwait. Many of them suffered real hardship as refugees trapped in the region until their evacuation could be arranged. By the end of October more than 700,000 refugees, mainly from Asian Commonwealth countries, had left the area. That is not just a human tragedy: it is a financial catastrophe for some of the countries concerned.<lb/>
The political response of the Commonwealth countries has been unanimous in support of the international coalition against Iraq and the full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Gulf crisis. My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter reminded the House of the special role that Commonwealth countries played in the Second World War. The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, reminded us of their role, which we shall not forget, in the Falklands. Let us also not forget their present contribution. A. number of Commonwealth countries have contributed to the multinational forces in the Gulf. Australia, Bangladesh, Canada and Pakistan currently have forces deployed in the Gulf region, and others have offered their help. In addition to the practical benefits, those contributions, especially from Islamic countries, will have sent important signals to Iraq to reinforce the message that the crisis is not divided along social, economic, political or religious lines but merely concerns perceptions of right and wrong.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0556"/>
<col>1033</col>
I should like to answer one or two other points that were raised. My noble friends Lord Boyd-Carpenter and Lord Auckland both said that they would like to see Fiji returned to the Commonwealth. Having just had the pleasure of visiting the country, like the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, to learn at first hand how some of the countries work&#x2014;I also went to Tonga and Vanuatu which are currently members of the Commonwealth&#x2014;I can only endorse their remarks and say that I hope that Fiji will soon return to the Commonwealth.<lb/>
A number of your Lordships mentioned Britain's role in the Community and in the Commonwealth. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Tanworth, that there is no incompatibility in membership of both. He asked how our membership of the Community could help Commonwealth countries. The right thing to say at the moment may be that we can offer enormous help by bringing the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations to a successful conclusion. We have the advantage of being in the Community and possessing the knowledge of how the Commonwealth feels. Having lunched at New Zealand House today, I am well aware of how strongly New Zealand feels about some parts of the GATT round.<lb/>
We must keep trade free. We must not resort to protectionism. In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, the best thing that we can do for developing countries in the Commmonwealth and outside is to keep trade free because protectionism will harm them today just as it harmed them before the Second World War.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Moore of Wolvercote, mentioned the excellent work being carried out by NGOs and the Commonwealth Foundation in encouraging closer links between Commonwealth NGOs, especially through the establishment of national Commonwealth liaison units. In Kuala Lumpur, the Commonwealth heads of government welcomed the proposal to establish a regular Commonwealth forum of NGOs to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern. We are pleased to note that the first such forum is to be held in Zimbabwe in August 1991 at the invitation of the Government of Zimbabwe. Such initiatives can help only to develop closer Commonwealth understanding and cooperation to the benefit of all member states.<lb/>
The Commonwealth agenda is a long and complex one. Senior officials are meeting today in Port Moresby to discuss those issues. It is a regular meeting which takes place between Commonwealth heads of government meetings. Next year's heads of government meeting will of course take place in Harare as many of your Lordships have reminded the House.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, asked me to take on board a number of his suggestions. He asked for a clear statement of the Government's support for the Commonwealth. I make that gladly now. He asked about a Minister for the Commonwealth. I can assure him that although my honourable friend Mr. Hogg is much preoccupied,
<col>1034</col>
and rightly preoccupied, with the situation in the Gulf, he has not forgotten his responsibility for the Commonwealth. He asked that we reconsider the number and purpose of Commonwealth meetings. That is one of the tasks of the high level appraisal group.<lb/>
I join all of your Lordships in welcoming the appointment of Chief Anyaoku. His efforts to meet the challenges of the next decade have our full support. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, will agree that our commitment is not a burden, a sadness, to us. We are not committed by the judge of history to a gaolhouse called the Commonwealth. Rather we support willingly and fully one of the most dynamic international organisations in the world today.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Code of Local Government Audit Practice for England and Wales</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04582">7.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04583"><member>Viscount Astor</member> rose to move, That the draft code laid before the House of 15th October be approved [<i>28th Report from the Joint Committee, Session 1989&#x2013;90</i>].</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04584">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, the Audit Commission was established under the Local Government Finance Act 1982 as an independent body responsible for the appointment of external auditors for local authorities and for assisting all such authorities in securing value for money in the services which they provide. Under Section 14 of the 1982 Act the Audit Commission is required to prepare and keep under review a code of audit practice prescribing the way in which auditors are to carry out their functions under Part III of the Act. The functions of the commission were extended to cover health authorities under the provisions of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04585">The new code which is necessary as a result has been prepared by the commission. My role in the matter is limited to bringing the code before the House for consideration and, I hope, approval. The commission believes that the new code should be a single document covering both the audit of local and health authorities so they have revised and extended the existing version. The code must receive parliamentary approval at least every five years, although the commission can make alterations to the code in the intervals between its being approved. The present code, which came into effect on 9th February 1988, was revised by the commission on 7th July 1988
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0557"/>
<col>1035</col>
to deal with the new powers on prohibition orders and judicial review introduced by the Local Government Act 1988.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04586">I believe that the existing code has helped to ensure that auditors' functions under Part III of the 1982 Act have been carried out effectively. The Audit Commission has now prepared this revised code which is before the House. As this revision deals with health service bodies for the first time, the commission considered that the code should be brought before Parliament for approval, even though less than five years have elapsed since the code was last approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04587">The commission has consulted the bodies most directly concerned&#x2014;local authority associations, the accountancy profession and for the first time organisations connected with the health service&#x2014;as required by the 1982 Act. In addition, the code has been the subject of consultation with the commission's own auditors (the National Audit Office), the District Audit Service and the private accountancy firms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04588">The new code in essence extends the existing code which applied to local authorities so as to cover the National Health Service, with the exception of those matters where extending is simply not possible. The principles of local authority audit have been well established and the code itself is well regarded. In the circumstances, I believe that the commission is right to stick to a proven formula.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04589">Before going any further perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the main features of the new code and outline the principal changes from the existing code, particularly those features which the commission itself regards as important. First, the introduction explains why the commission has framed the code as it has done and points out that not all aspects of code will be appropriate for the audit of what the code calls "non-principal" authorities. These authorities include parish and community councils and in the National Health Service general practice fund holders.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04590">Perhaps I may now turn to the main body of the code. Although this is considerably rearranged compared with the existing code, much of it is effectively unchanged other than for changes necessitated by the extension of the commission's role to the health service. The code is now divided into five parts. The first part sets out the general duties of the auditor and includes a new section at paragraphs 13 and 14 dealing with audit objectives. The second part of the code contains new matters in paragraphs 17 to 23 inclusive dealing with the carrying out of the audit and identifies matters to which the auditor should pay particularly close attention; for instance, fraud, corruption and value for money. Paragraphs 24 to 39 of the second part and the whole of the third part bring together the auditor's reporting responsibilities and are for all practical purposes an unchanged rearrangement of the existing code. Part 4 is specific to the audit of local authorities and is merely a rearrangement of the existing code. Finally, Part 5 is entirely new and is headed "Audit of Health Service Bodies". In this part of the code the commission stresses that auditors of health service bodies have
<col>1036</col>
particular responsibilities in addition to those which are common to both local government and the health service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04591">Under Section 20(3) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 the auditor has a duty to report to the Secretary of State where it is believed that an authority's or officer's action would be unlawful and cause a loss or deficiency or an authority's or officer's decision would involve unlawful expenditure. The procedure differs from that in local government where the auditor faced with similar matters has to decide whether to issue a prohibition order or apply to the court for a judicial review of the decision taken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04592">The new code of practice, which I stress once again is the work of the commission and not of government, is simply an additional part of this process of extending the commission's role to the health service. I hope that the House will agree that the commission has performed its task in a thoroughly professional manner and produced a code which sets out a sensible and practical approach for auditors to follow. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04593">Moved, That the draft code laid before the House of 15th October be approved. [<i>28th Report from the Joint Committee, Session 1989&#x2013;90</i>]&#x2014;<i>(Viscount Astor.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04594"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of Members on these Benches I do not intend to say a great deal about the code. As my honourable friend Mr. David Blunkett said in another place, it is not a matter about which we wish to divide the House because there is common agreement among all parties about the value of the Audit Commission and <i>ipso facto</i> its papers, documents and recommendations. The idea of the Audit Commission raises no dispute. It deals with the proper manner in which local government can be monitored and be seen to be acting correctly, and that is in order.<lb/>
The Minister rightly drew attention to the possibility of fraud or corruption. Local government is no different from any other type of government or company, private or public. There is no more fraud or corruption in local government than there is in any other organisation. Indeed, there may not be as much. In our view the Government and the Audit Commission sometimes unfairly belabour a point when they find examples of cases which must be dealt with severely, although Members on this side of the House have no brief for any practice which is detrimental to the welfare, well-being or good order of the local and national populace.<lb/>
We hope that those who have power in such matters will use their nous and look at the situation sensibly. We hope that they will try to understand the nexus in which local government operates in 1990. There are present in the House Members with as much experience as myself. We know that councillors and council officers have a horrendous job in keeping out of trouble&#x2014;not criminal trouble&#x2014;and difficulty because of the vastness of their burden and the shortage of resources&#x2014;problems which have been visited upon them by the Government.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0558"/>
<col>1037</col>
I support the views put forward by my honourable friend Mr. Blunkett, who said that following the 1988 and 1989 Acts there are whistle blowers and regulations to ensure that people do not step over the boundaries of the law. That is entirely sensible and in the circumstances based very much on his experience.<lb/>
It is right and proper that there is the Audit Commission and the code of practice. However, the code needs to be operated and exercised with some understanding of the realities for the people who have a great deal of work to do for their communities in very difficult circumstances. My noble friend Lord McIntosh is not able to be here to deal with this matter but on his behalf I say that we believe that the Audit Commission and its work is to be supported and this code of practice should be approved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04595"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I endorse what the noble Lord has said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04596"><member>Viscount Astor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, for his support for the commission's role. The code of practice of which I have spoken reflects the Audit Commission's decision to extend the scope of the successful code supplied to local authorities to cover health service bodies. Therefore, I hope that your Lordships can accept this Motion and I commend it to the House.<lb/>

<title>Overseas Domestic Workers</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04597">7.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04598"><member>Lord Hylton</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they will take to prevent exploitation of, and reduce the hardships suffered by, overseas domestic workers admitted to this country under the Home Office concession of 1980.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04599">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the redress of grievances is a prime function of Parliament. My Question this evening addresses the grievances of a limited group of people; namely, those admitted to this country without work permits to accompany or join an existing employer who intends to visit or reside in Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04600">Since 1980, employers have come from Greece, Hong Kong, Nigeria, Singapore, the United States and many mid-Eastern countries including Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, the Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The employees who have suffered injustice and exploitation have come mainly from developing countries in the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, West Africa, Morocco, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South America and in considerable numbers from the Philippines. In many cases workers were originally recruited in or for the Middle East.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04601">Since 1986, some 600 cases of exploitation have been documented. Therefore, cases have been occurring at the rate of about three per week and I am sorry to say that matters have worsened since the invasion of Kuwait. Many domestics, perhaps a majority, experience the confiscation of their passports. The result of that is that they do not know
<col>1038</col>
their exact immigration status, which is usually that of a visitor or a person named to work for a specified employer. Many such workers have no written contracts of employment or their contracts are arbitrarily changed. Their wages are often withheld or paid in kind. They are compelled to work excessive hours and numerous examples can be quoted of deprivation of food and privacy or denial of access to friends or indeed to the outside world at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04602">It has been rightly said that some servants only see the airport, the employer's house and the road between the two. Many have been physically abused or attacked by employers or their children. Most domestics are women and many have suffered sexual abuse, including actual, attempted or threatened rape.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04603">If, in response to appalling treatment in a supposedly free and democratic country, a domestic runs away from the employer, he or she remains in great difficulties. Such people are frequently without money, personal possessions or accommodation. No passport may mean no health care and they are wide open to further exploitation by subsequent employers or landlords. They become illegal persons as unauthorised immigrants or overstayers. Therefore, they are liable to deportation without a right of appeal from within the United Kingdom unless they have already been here for seven years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04604">Here I should like to pay a warm tribute to the work of organisations such as the Asian Women's Resource Centre, the Commission for Filipino Migrant Workers, and Kalayaan, which incidentally is a Malay word meaning freedom. Without those bodies the suffering of abused and exploited workers would have been much greater. The Anti-Slavery Society has also been most helpful on all the human rights aspects of this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04605">Rather than after-care, we now need the prevention of abuse. My attention was drawn to this matter originally by the case of Mrs. Laxmi Swami. That Indian lady was falsely imprisoned and barbarously ill-treated by two Arab princesses over a four-year period. She escaped from her employers and after a five-year legal struggle was awarded damages of &#x00A3;300,000 by the High Court last December. That resounding victory for British justice coincided with an Early Day Motion signed by 104 honourable Members of another place. There was also a petition to the Home Secretary which attracted some 4,000 signatures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04606">I am glad to say that since then there has been modest progress. In March this year the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, who I am glad to see will be speaking this evening, and I met the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, at the Department of Employment, together with officials representing the Home Office. Consultation then followed with the Foreign Office and on 24th July the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, was able to announce in reply to a Written Question that entry clearance procedures would be reformed and improved and that information leaflets would in future be issued to both employers and domestics at the entry clearance stage.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0559"/>
<col>1039</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04607">I have seen the leaflets in draft and they try to set out the legal rights of domestics and the protection available to them under United Kingdom law. I very much hope that the leaflets will clear away many illusions and will be effective in protecting domestics coming to Britain in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04608">That welcome governmental action does not solve the problems of domestics who are already here. They fall into two classes: first, those who are still with their original employer; and, secondly, those who have left their employer, usually because of exploitation, maltreatment or abuse. Perhaps I may give two examples. Cherry is a Nepalese woman. She was not paid her wages and her employer kept her in captivity in London. She was at first refused medical treatment and was only later allowed to go to hospital. After a partial recovery there, she left her employer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04609">My second example concerns Sally. She is aged 26 and comes from the Philippines. For three years she endured harassment, verbal abuse and aggression caused by children. In London she was never paid; her passport was withheld and she was locked in. Eventually she climbed out of the third floor window only to fall from a drainpipe, breaking her pelvis and arm in the process. I am glad to say that she is now free.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04610">I urge Her Majesty's Government to act immediately to help people such as those in the examples I have given. They did not come to England to submit to virtual slavery. The concession made in 1980 to employers needs to be matched by a parallel concession to the employed. In the past the Department of Employment has argued that domestics who are exploited should make use of industrial tribunals and civil and criminal litigation in order to protect their rights. I regret to say that that view is totally unrealistic. Few resident domestics will dare to use those procedures while they are still in employment. If they leave or are sacked, they immediately breach their conditions of entry and become liable to deportation. Again, in that situation few will risk embarking on proceedings for which legal aid may not be readily available. Rights are a pure illusion unless they can in practice be fully exercised.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04611">What is the remedy? I ask Her Majesty's Government to provide these domestic workers with an immigration status which enables them to work and above all to change employers. That is the remedy asked for by the Early Day Motion, by a meeting organised through the Commission for Racial Equality in July this year, and by the voluntary bodies closely involved. Even if a change of employer is limited to the same category of work, it will be a cheap and effective remedy. Employers will stand to lose their employees if they do not treat them properly. Employees will have an alternative to exploitation. Such a change would be consistent with existing immigration practice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04612">I ask the Government to consider other safeguards. They could insist on written contracts of employment signed by both parties for all domestics coming to this country for more than a month or two. That is the Canadian practice. They could arrange for regular
<col>1040</col>
spot checks on employers by authorised inspectors who must be able to see each domestic in conditions of privacy. I understand that that is what happens in the Netherlands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04613">Finally, there is the question of those who entered under the concession and are now overstaying. Will the Government regularise their position provided they remain in employment? Will those people be allowed to apply for settlement once they have lived here for four years? That would do much to reduce the hardship suffered by separated families, the hardship that stems from economic necessity and the pressure of intractable circumstances.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04614">I am grateful to all those taking part in the debate and thank them in advance. I believe we have identified urgent grievances. I have attempted to outline remedies. If the Government have better solutions I look forward to hearing them. Meanwhile, let us remember the famous judgment of Lord Mansfield in the case of <i>Somersett</i> in 1772, when he said:
<quote>"Every man who comes to England is entitled to the protection of English law".</quote>
The poet Cowper wrote:
<quote>"Slaves cannot breathe in England. They touch our country, and their shackles fall".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04615">The time has come to apply those maxims to the present situation. I look forward to hearing the debate and in particular the Government's reply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04616">8.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04617"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in this Question. I have had my attention drawn to this problem and cases have been mentioned to me regarding people who have been treated badly.<lb/>
I know that the Government feel that people coming to this country from abroad with a household and employees should be allowed to bring those employees, otherwise they may find themselves in difficulty. I understand that. But the Government should lay down conditions so that when those employees are brought into the country they are entitled to certain forms of treatment. The contract suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, which I understand is used in the Netherlands, is one way of doing that. Another method of dealing with the problem is laying down conditions at the port of entry and providing a means of inspection. The inspectors would know the address and be entitled to visit the employees and ensure that their living conditions are lawful. To allow the problem to continue is quite wrong.<lb/>
It is wrong of the Government to allow people to be brought into the country and virtually treated as slaves. It is not enough to say, as the Department of Employment says, that they should use the industrial tribunals. That is ridiculous. Once they leave their employer they in effect become immigrants with no right to be here. Therefore they could be deported. If, when they went to the tribunal, the tribunal or the Home Office had the right to allow them to remain in this country, that would be another way to solve the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0560"/>
<col>1041</col>
problem. I do not know whether the Government would wish to use that. Merely to say that they should go to an industrial tribunal is nonsense.<lb/>
I know the Minister has a brief, but I should like him in the course of replying to bear in mind the suggestions made. I ask him to look at the matter from the point of view of an individual who entered employment and as a consequence is brought into a strange country and kept as a virtual prisoner. No government could regard that as right; it must be wrong. Therefore for the Government to find a solution that is capable of application&#x2014;not a spurious suggestion such as going to the industrial tribunal&#x2014;is vital. I hope that the Minister will say that he has accepted the suggestions made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton.<lb/>
Finally, I wish to raise the question of wiping the slate clean. It is a fact that some people living in those conditions have run away from their employer. If we are to start afresh and ensure that we resolve the problem, we should make it possible for those people to register. If they have lived in this country for a certain period they may perhaps be allowed to stay. We need to clear the matter up. I hope that the Government will tell us that in some way or other they will deal with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04618">8.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04619"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like everybody else who has looked at this problem I was deeply shocked by the cases quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, to which my noble friend Lord Pitt also referred. I have seen a good many more examples written down. I shall not quote them; the evidence we heard was enough for us to insist on action. It is incredible that such abuses should be occurring in our country in 1990. I am certain that the Minister and his colleagues must feel as I do. Therefore it is a question of deciding not that something should be done if possible but that something must be done at once.<lb/>
I do not want to go through the particulars again because the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, made them very clear. I am informed&#x2014;perhaps the Minister will confirm this estimated figure&#x2014;that there are around 3,000 situations of this kind, with one and sometimes more domestic workers working for an employer, usually a family, who have moved in for reasons considered acceptable to this country, sometimes for a visit and sometimes for a very much longer stay.<lb/>
When these families come here they bring with them a domestic worker who is given a visa for six months if it is a short stay; it may be for a year. The visa is on a passport which almost always is held, sometimes in a perfectly honest and decent way for convenience, by the employer. Therefore, if something goes wrong the domestic worker has absolutely no redress. I am told that the Commission for Filipino Migrant Workers to which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred has dealt with over 200 cases a year which have gone wrong in one way or another. An employer can be, and in some cases has proved to be, extremely ruthless.<lb/>
<col>1042</col>
If we agree that the situation must be rectified, I suggest that it is a simple matter, with a simple solution involving only two changes. I am merely repeating what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said but in slightly different terms. The first change has already been proposed by the Minister in his Answer in July to the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton; namely, the issue of information leaflets to employers and employees at what the Civil Service calls the entry clearance stage. I suppose that means when the family enters the country and obtains clearance&#x2014;setting out the legal rights of domestic workers and the protection available to them.<lb/>
Incidentally, that action was promised for the autumn but as the autumn officially becomes winter in November it is already overdue. A delay from July to November cannot be accepted. I ask that the Government certainly get this action, which is the easiest part of our recommendations, into operation by Christmas. I know that the Minister cannot make promises, but I hope that he will tell the House that he will try to do that.<lb/>
There is an important point in that connection which was made by my noble friend Lord Pitt. It is not enough just to send these information leaflets to people as they come into the country. They must be sent to every person who has already come into the country; at any rate to each family. If workers are not with a family, the Home Office must endeavour to ascertain where they are and, as my noble friend Lord Pitt said, at least put matters right on a temporary basis.<lb/>
The second stage to which the noble Lord referred will need more ministerial determination to get through. It will not get through because we say that it ought to. I believe that the authorities would rather not do it. There are difficulties. Therefore, I ask Ministers&#x2014;our representative here, his newly appointed chief and everyone else concerned&#x2014;to acknowledge that the position cannot continue and that if the authorities see difficulties they will have to find a way out of them. That is the kind of order I expect Ministers to give.<lb/>
In order that these workers who enter the country are allowed to change their jobs, on proper notice, and to leave their employer to find another more congenial position&#x2014;provided they do not go outside the domestic worker field&#x2014;they must be given something like official immigration status, independent from their employer. That is the issue and clearly there are a number of different ways of doing that. One such way would be to give the worker a permit with a certain limitation, but I do not want to go into details. However, they must have official immigration status independent from the employer.<lb/>
As regards workers leaving one employer and going to another, there is a good demand for domestic workers. A worker who is unhappy should be allowed to give notice and go to an employment office where similar work can easily be obtained. The new employer would have to renew the visa. I suppose the immigration authorities would fear that such a scheme could constitute a simple path to increased
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0561"/>
<col>1043</col>
immigration, but I believe that their fears are exaggerated. The worker would be told that it is essential to obtain a new visa. The authorities would be advised because the employer would have to notify them that notice had been given. That could be tied up by any competent civil servant. It should be a rule that due notice should be given by the worker and that the employer should advise the immigration authorities, who could then check with the worker. That sort of checking is done every day all over the world and there is no difficulty whatever.<lb/>
However, nothing is foolproof. As matters stand today, workers can leave and find work privately. By doing so they stay on in this country on an unauthorised basis. A worker who suits a new employer will never be heard of again by the authorities. Therefore, the plan I am putting forward would stop illegal arrivals from staying and put the whole situation onto a proper basis. In any case, we must bear in mind that the numbers are very small. It is worth risking one or two unauthorised workers slipping in so that we can put right some of the terrible things that have been described.<lb/>
I am told that there are over 3,000 of these domestic workers, and of those only about 200 a year give any trouble. When compared with immigration as a whole, the numbers are trivial but the damage that is being done is not trivial. Therefore, I earnestly request the Government to take some action. The bad cases are so bad that we cannot accept anything from the Government but effective action. We have said exactly what should be done and there is no difficulty in doing it.<lb/>
There is one further point, to which my noble friend Lord Pitt referred. The next step should be to allow a worker who has worked with a visa for four years to have indefinite leave as a resident in Britain. At the moment that is granted to anyone who holds a work permit and who stays for four years. I believe that it should apply to the workers we have been discussing but who at present have no work permits.<lb/>
In this country 100 years ago domestic workers&#x2014;or servants as they were called&#x2014;were liable to treatment which was better than the stories we have been hearing though in some cases it was nearly as bad. Most family households lived happily in a way which was almost feudal. However, servants could sometimes be very badly treated when things went wrong. Thank goodness the position today has been reversed. Only the rich have servants who live in, and they live in terror of losing them. Those of us who can afford a daily lady, even once a week, are very much at her mercy, as most of us know very well. I can see that there could be a case for allowing foreign families to enter the country, but they must not bring the bad habits of 1850 into the 1990s.<lb/>
I want to hear from the Minister that he will make perfectly clear to his colleagues that no answer will satisfy us except that immediate action will be taken on the lines I have described, or action which will have exactly the same effect.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1044</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04620">8.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04621"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. He possesses the quality of gracious indomitability which I think derives from his great-grandfather, Mr. Asquith, as he was when Prime Minister. Of course in his later days Mr. Asquith acquired a somewhat negative image. He was associated with the phrase, "Wait and see". However, the noble Lord is not asking us to wait and see but to look at the situation and to do something about it.<lb/>
In fact, Mr. Asquith was described rather better by Sir Winston Churchill in a famous essay in which he explained how tough he was. He used the phrase that his achievements were not all done with rosewater. That, I believe, is underlying the genial exterior of the noble Lord and his certain toughness&#x2014;ruthlessness perhaps. I hope that the Minister will take the message that he is not dealing with a lot of wets but with people who are going to threaten his career. I have not seen the tape but I hope that the Minister has gained some promotion. He deserves promotion but he must first achieve something in this field.<lb/>
I know that he cannot just announce the new policy. There is a new Minister and he is a gentleman whom we wish well, as we do the many Home Secretaries under whom some of us have had to suffer in years past. I had better be careful because his predecessor is a gentleman with whom we shall have many contacts. We shall want to obtain many favours in the immediate future so we do not want to say anything disparaging about him.<lb/>
The new Home Secretary is a gentleman who is clearly anxious to please. I hope that he will realise that there is a very easy way of pleasing us. As the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, said in his statesmanlike speech, it is a very small problem. According to my information, about 3,000 people are involved. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Reay, will not simply put us off with sweet endearments. I hope he will inform the Minister that there is an easy way for him to make his name quickly although he may not have very long to do so of course. I hope all these matters will be brought home to him in the most forceful way possible.<lb/>
The main points have been very well made by the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson. However, one note that he struck made me feel anxious. He described the almost privation under which he is living. Apparently, it is only with difficulty that he can afford a lady to come in once a week and who tyrannises him. I know that old Etonians like the noble Lord, myself and Mr. Hurd, are inclined now to explain that we are really very impoverished and that we went to Eton because of a scholarship. The noble Lord and I have had comfortable lives. I am sure that the noble Lord would be the first to point out that the people we are concerned with have had very uncomfortable lives. The noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, referred to a state of affairs which one would consider incredible for this country.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0562"/>
<col>1045</col>
I got involved with this matter partly through the activities of my endlessly active daughter. Since then I have learnt some of the facts. A few months ago I would have said that all the problems were just bilge invented by the communists or suchlike people. Yet these events are taking place. There is no doubt that slavery is taking place in England. Who would have thought that such a state of affairs was possible? The main points have been covered and I shall not go over them again. I support the arguments which have been well-stated by earlier speakers.<lb/>
In order to give a little first-hand vividness, I shall refer to two young women to whom I shall not give their true names. They have been to see me here. Sanda (though that is not her real name) is a 30 year-old Filipino. She was brought into this country by two employers, a Palestinian male and an Englishwoman. She was not allowed out. For three months she lived in a small room without heating and very little food. She was left scraps. I do not say that they were the actual crumbs that the dogs ate under the table. She was hit with ashtrays when the employers became displeased with her.<lb/>
She was caring for a four year-old child and at one point both of them fell down stairs, no doubt accidentally. I am sure that these facts can be verified. I am not joking when I say that the woman employer took a knife to kill this wretched Filipino lady. Luckily, there were guests in the house who pulled the employer away. That is a true story and anyone who doubts it can no doubt have it verified. The woman had no rights whatever which is the position brought up by earlier speakers. If she tried to escape she would be picked up and no doubt sent back to the Phillipines where she would try to support her family. That story was told me just a few yards from here by the woman.<lb/>
Another story involves a woman I shall call Cely. She was a machinist. She needed a job to help support her mother, brothers and sisters in the Phillipines. For four months she was not paid any money at all. The children were hitting her, spitting at her and pulling her hair. She slept on the floor in the lavatory. She escaped out of a window and fell down two floors. She broke her pelvis and her arm. She showed me her broken arm so I have no doubt about that. In a way that incident enabled her to escape because she was picked up by kindly persons and taken to hospital. She stayed in hospital for two months. Then she went to one of the excellent organisations which help people in distress.<lb/>
I have related those two stories because they illustrate what we are talking about. As the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, said, it is incredible that such events should be happening in Britain. When I say that there is no sign of it being stopped, I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, would agree with that. I think he said that some improvement is being made. These events, or others very much like them, are taking place at the present time.<lb/>
I do not need to deal with the remedies because they have been well-explained. The most crucial factor is to enable these people to leave their employers and work
<col>1046</col>
for someone else. I believe the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, has called for them to have a state of independence from their employers. The solution is fairly obvious. I beg the Minister not to make a pronouncement tonight which he cannot stand by, but to bring home to his new chief the extreme feeling which has been aroused already and which I am sure will grow even more intense in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04622">8.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04623"><member>Lord Wilberforce</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in opening this debate was good enough to refer to the Anti-Slavery Society, of which I have the honour of being the joint-president, perhaps I may be allowed to add a few words. The society is very much concerned with this problem internationally. It is worth bearing in mind that it is an international problem and it is not peculiar to this country. The same kind of situation is known to exist in a number of European countries. The Anti-Slavery Society has been looking into it and it has put in a quite detailed report to the working group on contemporary forms of slavery.<lb/>
However, this evening we are only concerned with this country where undoubtedly a very serious and tragic number of events have taken place. We do not know exactly what is the scale of the problem. Our society asked the Home Office how many people there were in the category of domestic workers. We were told that no figures exist for the number of domestic servants admitted as visitors each year and who have employers. That is hardly good enough. One should know how many of these people there are and where they are. One wants to know the scale of the problem and the locations of the people so that the welfare organisations can make contact with them.<lb/>
Some quite simple administrative action at the entry and clearance place should enable the Government to have a proper record of the scale of the problem. Undoubtedly the problem does exist. Noble Lords may be fairly near the mark in estimating the total number to be between 2,000 and 3,000. That is only a guesstimate at the moment although an intelligent one. Undoubtedly there are some cases of what is known as debt bondage. People have incurred expenses either through their flights or the agencies and they are not given any wages until the money is repaid. As a result girls who come here with the intention of supporting their families in the Phillipines or in Manila are unable to send any money back until the debt is repaid. The debt is a millstone around her neck. Noble Lords know perfectly well that debt bondage is itself contrary to the slavery conventions quite apart from other forms of deprivation of liberty which may be called quasi-slavery. However, apart from that, as many noble Lords have said, there are cases which can be described as in effect cases of slavery. If someone from a hypothetical country in Africa or Asia said, "I am willing to come to Britain. If I do so, I shall bring a good deal of money but I must bring my slaves with me", no government would dream of letting him come. If he came, the moment he set foot on English soil the slaves would be free. That opens the door to the point made by the noble Lord,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0563"/>
<col>1047</col>
Lord Pitt, that the Government would be perfectly entitled to impose requirements on people coming here to ensure that conditions of actual slavery, quasi-slavery or debt bondage did not exist.<lb/>
The detailed remedies have been well explained, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson. I should like to comment on the scheme being introduced by the Home Office for the issue of information leaflets to employers and domestics at the entry clearance stage. That is all very well but it is not much use if all it does is set out the legal rights of domestics working here. The whole problem is the giving of a visa limiting employment to one person only and thereby not allowing a change of employment. If the person concerned leaves the employment, she becomes an illegal immigrant, she is immediately criminalised and under the 1988 Act can be deported without any possibility of appeal. The matter must be tackled through the form of the visa. It must be open to those coming in to seek employment within the same category. They should not be put into a criminal category. If they are here for a certain time they must be given the right of settlement.<lb/>
I need not expand further on those points. I wish to emphasise the great interest of our society in this matter. We owe a debt to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for taking the issue up and for making such efforts in bringing the problem to the notice of the authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04624">8.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04625"><member>Lord Monkswell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not planned to speak in the debate, but the subject before us is one of great importance. I am angry about the plight of domestic workers, which has been reported in our newspapers and described by noble Lords during the debate. I completely endorse what has been said by other speakers. I am sure that the Government would agree with what has been said.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, pointed to the key problem of the immigration status of these people. I have two proposals. The first is fairly practical. There is a need for a widespread understanding of what we mean by acceptable employment standards. It is all very well to hand out leaflets at points of entry, but that is not enough. The vast majority of people living in this country obtain from television information about the social mores of society.<lb/>
I would hope that the BBC, ITV and the independent television production companies could make television programmes for peak viewing times to explain the importance of acceptable employment standards for domestic workers. They should further explain the revulsion felt by British people to the excesses referred to during the debate. I hope that my remarks will be drawn to the attention of the television authorities.<lb/>
I turn to my second proposal. We have heard how in one incident redress was sought through the law courts. A sum of &#x00A3;300,000 was mentioned. That is all very well for people who can take part in our legal system. One needs to be fairly well off or be able to
<col>1048</col>
find a well-off patron in order to take part in our legal system. From my experience as a local councillor and from knowing Members of another place and of the European Parliament I feel that the avenues of democracy could be useful in trying to tackle this problem. It is important that democratic representatives&#x2014;people who have a degree of power in our society&#x2014;should be made aware of what is going on and in some senses be made responsible for doing something about it. While most local councillors, MPs and MEPs would react sensitively, sympathetically and supportively to cases of maltreatment of domestics employed by visitors to this country, there is not the bond of voting.<lb/>
I believe that those who have been resident in this country for a year should automatically qualify for the vote and should be able to take part in elections. They would then have a relationship with society and would be able to say that they have a local councillor, an MP or an MEP. The concept of everyone in a particular area having a vote is very important. It would link the oppressed domestic worker with the organs of power in our democratic state. It is important to build those links. I accept that the ideas I am expressing will not come to fruition in the near future but I put them forward as a means of building links between the dispossessed in our community and the people with power. We should be trying to find ways of helping ordinary people to live together without abusing each other.<lb/>
Perhaps I may return to my main points. I stress the importance of television as a medium of communication. We should use television to express our society's standards of acceptable behaviour in terms of employment practice, to highlight the unacceptable and to explain to everyone in the community the difference between right and wrong. We need to build links between people who live in our society and the elected representatives. I hope that the Government will take action soon in regard to this sad reflection on British society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04626">8.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04627"><member>Lord Richard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may begin by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for initiating the debate. The issue clearly needed airing and it needed open discussion. It also needs a response from the Government. We are extremely grateful to the noble Lord for launching the debate.<lb/>
I do not think that anyone listening to the debate can fail to have been struck by the unanimity of view expressed by all speakers. There is a problem here which clearly needs redress. Inevitably, one looks to the Government for such redress. The individual stories we have heard&#x2014;and there are many more of which noble Lords will be aware&#x2014;are hair-raising. We have heard histories of abuse and ill-treatment. The picture which emerges is one of the extreme vulnerability of these domestic servants, lacking, as they do, status, independence and access to the remedies which are available to our own citizens and, indeed, to many people working in this country who are not citizens of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0564"/>
<col>1049</col>
The starting point for discussion of the problem must be the concession which the Government have made in respect of these domestic workers. I have with me a copy of <i>Hansard</i> dated 24th July of this year. On that date the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, answered a Question put by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, on the scope of the concession. He said:
<quote>"We very much regret that any cases of abuse and exploitation of overseas resident domestics should have occurred in this country, but we have concluded that in most cases the current arrangement benefits the servants themselves, who might otherwise lose their jobs if they were unable to come here with their employers. It is also important for the United Kingdom not to discourage those people with a substantial contribution to make to our prosperity who expect to be accompanied by their households when travelling here. We have therefore decided to continue the concession and allow domestic servants working as a member of their employer's household abroad to accompany or join their employer, or a member of his immediate family".</quote>
The noble Earl outlined certain controls which would be imposed:
<quote>"All domestic servants will be required to obtain entry clearance before coming here &#x2026; the domestic servant must have been in continuous, paid employment with the employer abroad for at least the previous 12 months before coming &#x2026; the minimum age is 17 years &#x2026; information leaflets will be issued".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27/7/90; cols. 1449&#x2013;50.]</quote>
I should point out to the Government that those four controls seem to me to be minimal. I am sure that information leaflets are valuable, provided: first, that they reach the domestics; secondly, that the domestics are capable of reading them; and thirdly&#x2014;most important of all&#x2014;that domestics who find themselves in difficulty are capable of enforcing the remedies which are set out in the information leaflets.<lb/>
The real problem is explicit in one sentence. It arises from the fact that we admit people who are in fact workers but that when we admit them we insist on pretending that they are coming into the country as visitors. That pretence is the basis of many of the difficulties which have been highlighted this evening. It is wrong in principle to treat people coming into this country to work as if they were visitors and then treat them as illegal entrants when they cease working and try to leave employment.<lb/>
Perhaps I may briefly run through some of the difficulties to which this pretence gives rise. I begin with the position beforehand of a potential immigrant to this country; that is, the situation in which he or she is placed prior to arrival. The first stage of immigration control is obviously the acquisition of a visa. As I understand it, most people in this category come from countries where visas are required if citizens wish to visit the United Kingdom. The visas are issued for a specific purpose. This normally means that they are issued for a category defined by the immigration rules. However, as domestic workers do not fit into any of those categories, it seems that they are given "visit" visas. Moreover, if such people wish to work in this country they must obtain a work permit. These must be obtained prior to travelling to the United Kingdom in addition to any visa requirement.<lb/>
<col>1050</col>
The late 1970s saw a phasing out of quotas as regards work permits for unskilled workers, including domestics. The quota was abolished at the end of 1979. Since that time, there are no work permits available for domestics coming into the UK. Therefore, there is no way&#x2014;<i>prima facie,</i> at any rate&#x2014;for a domestic wishing to work in this country in that capacity to obtain a work permit. That places her in a totally different capacity.<lb/>
While there are provisions within the immigration rules for workers and for business (permit-free categories) and self-employed persons, there are no provisions for domestics except one which relates only to the domestics of members of staffs of diplomatic missions. Therefore, that is the basis &#x2014;and, I suppose, it explains the need&#x2014;for this systematic departure from the immigration rules to admit domestics and hence the so-called "concession" which, as I understand it, has been operating throughout the 1980s. That is what these people have to do before they come to the United Kingdom.<lb/>
What happens to most domestics when they arrive in this country? They either receive six months' leave to enter with a prohibition on employment or they receive leave to enter for a longer period with employment restricted to a particular employer. That usually depends on whether the employer is coming for a short or longer period of time; in other words, they either come in as visitors or they come in bonded. What happens at the end of the six months? Applications for extension of leave to remain with the original employer who brought them in are normally granted. However, applications to change employers are routinely refused on the basis that no work permit was held on entry. Thus, such people are caught both ways. They cannot obtain a work permit because there is no quota for them, but if they come in as a visitor, at the end of the time allowed&#x2014;although they have in fact been working and everyone knows that this is so&#x2014;when they seek to gain alternative employment, their status reverts to that of a person who has been working in the country who is not entitled to do so and therefore the extension is refused.<lb/>
It is true that there are no clear provisions in the rules which deal with changes in employment. However, as I understand it, the practice has been to allow applicants to change employment within the same category. A change of job within the same occupation and skills category is allowed and will usually be approved by the Department of Employment, but changes in category are not allowed. Therefore, the domestic servant finds herself in the situation where, first, she is in this country as a visitor; secondly, she is bonded to a particular family; thirdly, she cannot find alternative employment because of the immigration rules; and, fourthly, if she tries to leave, she is liable to be deported.<lb/>
Other disadvantages are experienced by these people. Work permit holders are allowed to have their families with them provided that they can be maintained and accommodated without recourse to public funds. However, there are no such provisions for domestic workers. Noble Lords have already
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0565"/>
<col>1051</col>
raised the point about the acquisition of permanent residence. Work permit holders qualify for settlement after four years in that capacity, but, again, there are no such provisions for domestic workers. So far as concerns other provisions, if a domestic servant runs away from her employment she is immediately liable to deportation. Moreover, unless she has been here for more than seven years, her appeal rights in deportation proceedings are extremely limited under the Immigration Act.<lb/>
Clearly there is a problem. One should not overstate it; at the same time one should not understate it. It is a fact that a group of people in this country are being subjected to extreme abuse. It is not a situation about which we as a nation should be proud. The problem may not be large in terms of numbers; it is however large in terms of inequity and exploitation.<lb/>
What can be done about the problem? There are two approaches. One, which has been aired by a number of noble Lords this evening, is to treat them as if they have a work permit; namely, let them move jobs within the same category, and after four years let them be able to claim residence. The other approach would be not to admit them on a concessionary basis but on a more regular basis and in their own right. This would avoid the problem of their coming to Britain and being bonded to one family. They would have an independent status and a legal status before actually coming here. I await the Government's response on this.<lb/>
It may be that the cleaner, neater and quicker solution is perceived to be the first of those two alternatives; namely, that once in the country one should treat them as if they had a work permit and therefore have the same rights as other people who have work permits. My only qualification there is that it involves a secondary concession outside the scope of normal immigration rules. As a matter of principle, immigration policy should not be based on concessions but rather on properly understood and universally applied principles. But whichever approach the Government take, I would conclude by saying to the noble Lord who is to reply that clearly here is a problem which has been highlighted in this debate tonight. It needs to be looked at with sympathy by the Government; and action in respect of it is grossly overdue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04628">8.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04629"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for the opportunity he has provided for us to debate what can be done to help people who come here from overseas as domestic workers. I should first like to say that the Government are just as concerned as he is and as other noble Lords are about the reports of mistreatment and exploitation of overseas domestic workers. I should like to pay tribute to the leading role the noble Lord has played in drawing attention to this problem.<lb/>
In July we announced some changes aimed at reducing the kind of abuse described by the noble Lord and others, but with the permission of your
<col>1052</col>
Lordships I should like to return to this subject later. The arrangement under which some domestic workers come to this country is a concession outside our normal immigration arrangements, and it is one made in the interests of the workers themselves. It has been the clear and consistent policy of the Government to keep new primary immigration under tight control. As a key part of that control, work permits are issued by the Department of Employment only to those overseas nationals with high levels of skill and experience to come here to jobs which require those qualifications and which cannot be filled by people already here or elsewhere in the European Community. Thus, since 1980 no work permits have been issued for any type of domestic work.<lb/>
However, the Government thought that it would be unreasonable for a domestic worker who had worked for an employer and formed part of his household abroad to be prevented from coming to the United Kingdom if the employer came here. This is both humanitarian and pragmatic. Domestic workers who were unable to accompany the household to the United Kingdom could well lose their jobs, their homes and their livelihoods. Looking at our national interest, if wealthy investors, skilled workers and others with the potential to benefit our economy were unable to be accompanied by their domestic staff they might not come here at all but take their money and skills to other countries only too keen to welcome them.<lb/>
The concession operates in two ways. Domestic workers accompanying an employer who is visiting the United Kingdom can come here also as visitors and, like any other visitor, may stay no more than six months. Domestic workers accompanying an employer who comes here on a longer term or a permanent basis are admitted for 12 months in the first instance; but if their employer stays longer they may remain with him. After four years working here for the employer they become eligible to apply for settlement, at which point the restrictions and conditions on their future stay are removed.<lb/>
We believe that the concession has generally worked well and that the great majority of domestic workers who have come here under these arrangements have been much helped by the concession. After all, they would otherwise have been excluded from the United Kingdom and might well have faced a most uncertain future. The relatively few cases where an overseas domestic worker has been badly treated in the United Kingdom rightly attract attention, but we do not believe that these in any way reflect the general treatment which overseas domestic workers receive.<lb/>
The Government do not accept the suggestion that it is the concession itself which in some way creates the problems that have arisen. The conditions which apply to domestic workers are in practice just like those which apply to any other worker from overseas. The standard arrangement is for overseas workers to come here with work permits. These are issued only for specific jobs with named employers and are valid for a limited period only. Work permit holders have no entitlement to take any other work until they have
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0566"/>
<col>1053</col>
been here in approved employment for four years and become eligible for settlement. In other words, the conditions for work permit holders are in line with those for overseas domestic workers who come here under the concession, and there would be no practical advantage at all in bringing domestic workers within the work permit arrangements.<lb/>
Another suggestion which is made is that we should at least allow domestic workers to change employers here. The Government cannot accept that. Domestic workers are admitted in this exceptional way in order to safeguard their livelihoods. It was never the intention to give them unrestricted access to the United Kingdom job market. It would clearly be impracticable and, I would suggest, undesirable to allow only those domestic workers who charged their employers with mistreatment to move elsewhere. We would therefore effectively have to give all overseas domestic workers freedom to move to any job whenever he or she wanted to do so. This would be quite inconsistent with the whole reason for the concession, which is intended to enable domestic workers to stay with the employers for whom they have worked overseas. It would also give overseas domestic workers an unwarranted advantage over all other overseas workers, including work permit holders, who are not allowed to take other work here. This would not be consistent with the objective of a firm but fair immigration control, and I must tell your Lordships that the Government are not prepared to make such a change.<lb/>
The noble Lord also implied that overseas domestic workers somehow have no rights when they come to the United Kingdom. That has sometimes been implied, but it is not the case. Everybody in the United Kingdom is entitled to the full protection of the criminal and civil law, regardless of their nationality or purpose of stay. Any domestic worker who is, for example, physically abused by his or her employer can and should contact the police, if necessary by dialling 999, as it is the job of the police to take action against criminal behaviour. Also, as a court case late last year showed&#x2014;noble Lords have referred to this&#x2014;a domestic worker who is ill treated may be able to bring civil proceedings in the United Kingdom courts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04630"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord be kind enough to give way? He rightly mentioned the court case. Would be not agree that that was a totally exceptional case? He must accept that it took five years to bring it, and I can tell him from my own knowledge, from correspondence and communication with the plaintiff's solicitor that no compensation has yet been received. I hope it will be received very shortly, but, leaving that case to one side, the point I endeavoured to make was that there are rights in theory but that they are not enforceable in practice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04631"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take the noble Lord's point. I shall be dealing with some of his specific points in a moment but I am just describing the basic situation as it exists. As I said, there is a possibility for civil proceedings to be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1054</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04632"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I intervene? I hope the noble Lord is going to tell us what he will do, since he cannot do what we have asked him to do. The legal situation now, as it exists, is simply not acceptable, and the noble Lord must know that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04633"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said at the beginning, I shall come later to what else we are doing. Domestic workers from overseas who work for private employers and under the terms of their contracts of employment ordinarily work in Great Britain have the same employment protection rights as British employees. There is thus nothing in the suggestion that there is something peculiar about the position of domestic workers from overseas which excludes them from the rights and protection that we all take for granted.<lb/>
I have taken some time to set out the position because, however much we deplore the incidents which have been described this evening and which have caused us all much concern, we need to recognise that there are no simple solutions. The Government are aware that overseas domestic workers can be vulnerable and we have been looking carefully at ways in which we can help to minimise the chances of ill-treatment. Indeed we are grateful for the advice and assistance that we have received from the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and others with a close interest in the welfare of overseas domestic workers which they have contributed to this review.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Ferrers announced in a Written Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, on 24th July this year, the Government have decided to continue the existing concession but will introduce tighter controls before the domestic worker comes here. Under the new arrangements, the admission of domestic workers will be limited to those aged 17 or over who have worked for the employer abroad for a substantial period: 12 months where the employer comes as a visitor and 24 months where the employer comes here for any other purpose. In all cases the domestic worker will be required to obtain entry clearance before setting out and the entry clearance officer will interview the domestic worker to satisfy himself about the arrangement. The entry clearance officer will also ensure that the domestic worker receives and understands an information leaflet explaining his or her rights. This leaflet will be available in a number of languages and its contents will also be explained orally to those domestic workers who cannot read.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04634"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the leaflet be available before Christmas?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04635"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall come in a moment to the question which the noble Lord raised in his speech. A copy of the leaflet will also go to the employer, together with a covering letter explaining its purpose and emphasising the serious view that the Government take of the need to abide by the laws of this country.<lb/>
We are currently preparing the new leaflet in consultation with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0567"/>
<col>1055</col>
the organisations which particularly represent domestic workers here. The noble Lord has himself made two suggestions, both of which we are happy to adopt. These are that the leaflet should be printed in a way which emphasises that domestic workers should keep their passports themselves in a safe place and that they may be entitled to at least one week's notice of dismissal. Secondly, the leaflet should explain how to obtain treatment from the National Health Service.<lb/>
We hope that the leaflet can be ready and that we can introduce these new arrangements early in the new year. This should ensure that the domestic workers who come here know where to turn for help when in need and both they and their employers will be quite clear that they have a right to protection under the law of this country.<lb/>
I was asked some questions which I have not covered so I wish to make a few additional remarks. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, pointed his finger at deportation, to which a domestic worker who leaves his employer may find himself or herself exposed. It is an essential part of our immigration control that an overseas national can stay here normally only by qualifying under the immigration rules to do so. There will be cases where exceptional treatment is justified but these will be where there are the most compelling, compassionate circumstances. We cannot extend such treatment to whole groups.<lb/>
We cannot offer domestic workers any guarantees that they will not be deported if the basis for their stay comes to an end. But each case will be considered carefully and compassionately before any enforcement action is taken.<lb/>
The question of contract was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hylton, Lord Pitt and others. The Government believe that the terms and conditions of employment are matters to be agreed between employers and employees without the interference of government. Legislation therefore does not set hours of work or levels of pay and the Government would not want to impose terms of contract for this group of people.<lb/>
The question of spot checks was raised. We fear that to institute something similar would involve the creation of a bureaucracy which would be unlikely to be effective in most cases, given that the majority of those who come here are visitors. I might also point out that in this country domestic employment is excluded from the coverage of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 because of the practical problems of enforcement and the invasion of privacy if inspectors were empowered to go into private households. The same would apply in this case.<lb/>
The question of an amnesty was raised. We have no plans to grant a general amnesty, but any case of a domestic worker here who is an overstayer or an illegal entrant is carefully considered on its individual merits before action is taken either to deport or remove him or her.<lb/>
I answered the question as to when the leaflet would be issued. We are at present considering the detailed comments we have received on it. The latest of these
<col>1056</col>
was sent to us by the Campaign for Justice for Overseas Domestic Workers only on 13th November. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office will write to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, enclosing a final copy of the leaflet as soon as possible.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, asked me whether the leaflet could go to all those who are already here. I am afraid that we do not consider this to be practicable since most domestic workers enter for only a short time. They come in on a visit with their employers. However, we shall consider issuing leaflets to all those who apply for an extension of their stay here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04636"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it is a matter of a 20p stamp, it seems to me entirely unreasonable that my request should not be met.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04637"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not believe it has anything to do with the stamp. Large numbers of people in this category who come under this concession come for short visits. That is the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04638"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I asked the noble Lord either to confirm or deny the figure of 3,000. That is a guess but I would be prepared to pay for 3,000 stamps myself. Let us talk the same language.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04639"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said, I do not believe this has anything to do with the matter of postage stamps. However, I am afraid that I cannot confirm the figure that the noble Lord has given as I do not have the information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04640"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister please find out what the figure is and then write to me? Each of these persons has been dealt with by the authorities. Therefore the authorities must have a record. I do not believe for one moment that this information could not be found in two hours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04641"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be happy to look into the matter to see whether I can find the figure that the noble Lord asks for. However, I cannot give him an assurance that I shall be able to come up with the figure although I shall certainly look for it.<lb/>
No doubt I have been asked other questions, and I shall reply to them in writing. I am happy to see that the noble Earl, Lord Longford, has just returned to the Chamber. I can assure the noble Earl that I shall be happy to draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the new Secretary of State the feelings that have been expressed on this matter and the proposals that have been made in the debate this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04642"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I hope I may make one point. Did the Minister mean that he was going to draw the attention of his right honourable friend to the tremendous emotion that has been expressed in this debate and not just to the dry statements that have been made?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04643"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is what I said I would do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04644"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I hope he will clarify one point. He said that
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0568"/>
<col>1057</col>
the pamphlet that is to be issued will make it clear that people can go to the police for redress if they feel they are being abused in some way. He said they would have their passports. I take it that would give them some form of security. However, if a domestic servant is unable to obtain other domestic employment after falling out with his existing employer, he will not be able to earn any money and he will have to return straight home. If he has his passport, he can go home under his own means rather than be deported; but all that means is he would have to pay his own fare rather than have his fare paid by the Government. What does a domestic servant gain from this measure? If he complains, he will be out of a job and he will not be able to get another job. That seems to me to be the great weakness of the measure. A servant cannot go elsewhere even if he has established that he has drawn
<col>1058</col>
a blank as it were with his existing employer. The only course open to such a servant is to go home. What good does that do?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04645"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the position is that such a worker is able to stay on in this country until the end of the period for which he has permission to remain. However, he may not take other employment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04646"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if a servant has lost his existing employment and cannot take other employment, how is he to live?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04647"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the position would vary from one case to another.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Lord Belstead: Tributes</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04652"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we proceed to the day's business, I hope that I may on behalf of my noble friends and noble Lords in all parts of the House pay a warm tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, for the way he has conducted the affairs of this House as its Leader over the past three years. The noble Lord brought great experience to that Office because he had served in a number of departments. That became clear during his tenure, especially when he took part in our debates. In my view he has proved himself a splendid parliamentarian, with the ability to open and wind up debates on a variety of subjects and to think on his feet. However, his greatest gift was his readiness to see every point of view and to help us all to the greatest extent. I believe he is the only Leader in the history of the House who was kind enough to smile even when he lost a Division. I greatly hope that Mr. David Waddington will follow his example. We wish the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, every success in his new Office. We also wish Mr. David Waddington every success when he takes up his new Office in this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04653"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on these Benches also wish to pay tribute to the work that the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, has done as Leader of the House. It must have been extraordinarily difficult to take over from the noble Viscount, Lord Whitehead, the previous Leader of the House. I apologise to the House. I meant to say the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw. However, the noble Lord certainly followed the example of the noble Viscount in one most important respect&#x2014;we all greatly welcomed that&#x2014; in that he has been not only the Leader of the Conservative Party in this House but also and pre-eminently the Leader of your Lordships' House. That is a tradition which noble Lords in all parts of the House are grateful for. We welcomed it and we are confident that it will be continued.<lb/>
Apart from that continuation of the tradition of the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, has wisely handled the House in his own unique way. We on these Benches, trained by my noble friend Lord Grimond, have always considered that the primary duty of Opposition is to make life as disagreeable as possible for those on the Government Benches and for the Leader on the Government Benches. However, it has been extremely difficult to be disagreeable with the noble Lord, Lord Belstead. His particular quality was that he was a great practitioner of the doctrine that the soft answer turneth away wrath. To try to pick a quarrel with the noble Lord has been quite extraordinarily difficult. He had such a
<col>1060</col>
great appreciation of the point of view put forward from other sections of the House that one had to agree with him more often than one wished.<lb/>
We are glad and we congratulate the noble Lord on the fact that he continues to be a Minister of State. His peculiar qualities of friendliness and peacemaking may not perhaps be in immediate demand now that the Conservative Party is demonstrating brotherly love&#x2014;I underline the word "brotherly"&#x2014;on all sides. However, there can be no doubt that sooner or later the noble Lord's peculiar talent for peacemaking will be required again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04654"><member>Baroness Hylton-Foster</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, noble Lords on the Cross-Benches warmly support all the tributes that have been paid to the noble Lord, Lord Belstead. We admired tremendously his constant attendance in the House, his patience and his kind way of reminding noble Lords if they were breaking the rules or customs of the House. We are grateful to him for understanding and protecting the rights of noble Lords on the Cross-Benches. The noble Lord was never too busy to listen to our problems or to give advice. We thank him for all that he has done for all of us in the House. We shall all miss the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, very much.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04655"><member>The Lord Bishop of Ripon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to add from these Benches a further tribute to those which have already been paid to the noble Lord, Lord Belstead. Other noble Lords have already paid homage to his skill as a parliamentarian. I wish to underline that skill and also to mention my own sense of great gratitude for the noble Lord's unfailing courtesy to every Member of the House. He was certainly courteous to me and to others on these Benches. We have been profoundly grateful for the way he has always taken the care and the trouble to talk to each one of us and to help us. We wish him well in his new Office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04656"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to take this opportunity to thank those noble Lords who have been kind enough to make such generous remarks about my noble friend Lord Belstead. I remember the occasion of his maiden speech back in 1964 on the subject of education. He has held office in the Department of Education and Science, the Northern Ireland Office, the Home Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment, as Deputy Leader of the House of Lords, as Leader of the House of Lords and as Lord Privy Seal. That is a remarkable achievement. I am most grateful for the remarks that noble Lords have so generously made.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, might have put it, my noble friend Lord Belslaw followed my noble friend Lord Whitehead. Those were difficult footsteps to follow but he did so with remarkable success. As the right reverend Prelate said, my noble friend always treated the House with courtesy, charm and good humour. When events such as those we have witnessed over the past few days occur it takes me back to my childhood when one used to play a game called pass the parcel. The great thing was to make sure that when the music stopped one did not hold the parcel. In
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0570"/>
<col>1061</col>
politics the reverse seems to be the case. When the music stops one has to hold the parcel, or at least a parcel.<lb/>
I am glad that my noble friend Lord Belstead, who has held such distinguished office, will still be a member of the Government. As noble Lords have so rightly said, he has tried to do his best for all parties in the House. The House only runs on co-operation by all parties. I should like to thank noble Lords not only on this side of the House but also on the other side for the help they gave my noble friend when he was Leader of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Cammell Laird Shipbuilders</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04657">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04658"><member>The Lord Bishop of Chester</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04659">Whether they will support an application on behalf of Cammell Laird Shipbuilders to change its status to a merchant shipbuilder and to allow it to receive intervention funding.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04660"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Hesketh)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the 1985 agreement between Her Majesty's Government and the European Commission on the restructuring of British Shipbuilders and the proposed privatisation of the warship yards such as Cammell Laird does not preclude those yards from engaging in merchant shipbuilding on an unsubsidised basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04661"><member>The Lord Bishop of Chester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Is he aware of the enormous expectancy among the workforce at Cammell Laird and that Cammell Laird is very much the lifeblood of Birkenhead? Is he also aware of the back-to-work campaign in 1984, which at the time the Prime Minister called courageous, and the democratic co-operation of the workforce in Cammell Laird, the remarkable unanimity among the unions and the very high quality of work? The workforce expects some government intervention at this point to rescue the yard. Is it possible that the Government, having given the Answer about the EC ruling, are prepared themselves to intervene in this situation? I understand that the French company CMN of Cherbourg has received help from the French Government. Is the Minister aware that Cammell Laird seeks to build high speed catamarans for the cross-Channel service in direct competition with CMN of Cherbourg and that without government help the yard will not win the contract?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04662"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the agreement that the British Government reached in 1985 with regard to British Shipbuilders fell under the terms of the fifth directive on shipbuilding. On 1st January 1991 the seventh directive on shipbuilding comes into effect. The purpose of the directives is to reduce excessive merchant shipbuilding capacity in Europe. If the Government were to intervene that would be in direct
<col>1062</col>
contravention of the agreement that we reached with Commissioner Sutherland regarding the fifth directive.<lb/>
I should remind your Lordships' House that the reduction in employment in the merchant sector of the shipbuilding industry in Europe has not been confined to this country. In France it has fallen by 79 per cent., in the Netherlands by 83 per cent. and in the United Kingdom by 86 per cent. In Sweden employment has fallen by 98 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04663"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do the Government recognise the gravity of the problem? Two thousand jobs will be lost directly if Cammell Laird closes down and a further 2,000 jobs will be lost among contractors. That spells economic disaster for Birkenhead and the Wirral. Can the Government think of a way to go back to the Community and renegotiate the deal they made over privatisation? After all, we put enough money into the Community. Could we not get some of our money back?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04664"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on a day when I read in the <i>Financial Times</i> of the Labour Party's uncontrolled endorsement of economic monetary union I find it surprising that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, asks us to fly in the face of the fifth shipbuilding directive, which was in force at the time the agreement was reached, and the seventh directive which will come into effect on 1st January.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04665"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister not aware that the shipyard is in an area which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the United Kingdom and where there is very little prospect of anything to take its place? Will he give serious consideration to taking the matter to the new Prime Minister with the request that was put so well by the right reverend Prelate in his Question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04666"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the right reverend Prelate specifically referred to an application to the Commission. I must point out to the noble Lord that there are many other examples throughout Europe. That is why I quoted the percentages involved in the reduction in numbers employed in merchant shipbuilding and why we cannot go for a reapplication.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04667"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend explain why the French have found a way to subsidise a rival firm but we in this country do not seem to be able to find a way round the regulations? Perhaps a copy of their regulations as they apply can be put in the Library. For the convenience of some noble Lords they may be translated into English. Does he believe that we can contrive to do exactly the same as the French have done in so many other ways to preserve what they believe to be in the best interests of their country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04668"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the fact of the matter is that under the 1985 agreement with the Commission Cammell Laird was a warship yard. The CMN yard referred to is a commercial and warship yard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04669"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm or deny the allegation that the French are subsidising that company and that it is in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0571"/>
<col>1063</col>
competition with our yard? If he becomes aware that the French are effecting that kind of subsidy, will he completely reopen the whole question? Does he agree that it is very well known that in many cases the French obey only those Community regulations with which it suits them to comply?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04670"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord that we keep a close watching brief on our position and responsibilities in Europe in regard to both our own activities and those of others. It is important to understand that conditions of parallel existence do not pertain in these two cases. Cammell Laird came out as a warship yard under our arrangements with the Commission, and arrangements differ from country to country on the basis of what they consider to be their priorities. The CMN yard is a warship and commercial yard; at that time Cammell Laird was not a commercial yard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04671"><member>Viscount Mersey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that Cammell Laird's problems arise simply because we are now building extremely few warships? Is he aware, for instance, that in a few years' time we shall have only four diesel-electric submarines? Can he tell the House of any period in British history since the reign of Henry VIII when the Royal Navy has been smaller?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04672"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have numbers for the Royal Navy fleet in my hand or at my disposal. It may be worth pointing out to your Lordships' House that under the Commission's directive intervention is allowed in order to preserve warship capacity if it is seen to be necessary for the defence of the realm.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04673"><member>Lord Geddes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the question put by my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing, can my noble friend the Minister tell us whether we are playing by the same set of rules as the French?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04674"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that we are. I produced the figure for the reduction of employment in merchant shipbuilding of some 79 per cent. in France to show that other countries also have had to take their share of the strain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04675"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that this is one of the many reasons why the British people are disenchanted with going into Europe?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04676"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the light of my earlier remarks with regard to the Labour Party's commitment to EMU today, I am slightly surprised by the noble Baroness's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04677"><member>Lord Swinfen</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if we are playing by the same set of rules, can my noble friend tell me whether we are both obeying them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04678"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that I can go no further than I have already gone this afternoon when I said that I believe that we are.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04679"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04680"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not like to interrupt the noble Lord but we have been eight minutes on the first Question. After he has put his question, perhaps we might move on.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1064</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04681"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say whether he is simply going to accept the massive rise in unemployment in Birkenhead or whether the Government have any plans to alleviate it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04682"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have many plans which revolve around all kinds of schemes such as for inner cities, deprivation and so on. However, the Question on the Order Paper refers specifically to an application to the Commission which would drive a coach and horses through a great European principle.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Disabled People and the Community Charge</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04683">3.24 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04684"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04685">What action they are taking to assist disabled people who are disadvantaged by the community charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04686"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, severely mentally impaired people are exempt from the community charge, as are those with mental or physical disabilities who are resident in hospital as patients or resident in care homes, nursing homes and other hostels. For those disabled people living in the community there is additional help given over and above that given to people without disability through both the community charge benefit and transitional relief.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04687"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. But it is not the case that disabled people are hurt twice over by the poll tax? With low incomes and high outgoings they are hurt as are other poor people, but also under the poll tax disabled people have lost the rate relief on adapted buildings which 70 per cent. of them previously enjoyed. In other words, does she agree that disabled people are being penalised both for their poverty and their disability?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04688"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I seriously take issue with the noble Baroness on her second point. Rates paid on buildings no longer exist. That situation was abolished with the new system. As the new system operates, abatement is considered. It is even more generous than rate relief and the disabilities of individuals are taken into account as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04689"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the noble Baroness any words of comfort for those who look after disabled people, in particular those who live and work in residential institutions for the disabled? Is she aware that the charities which run such organisations, such as the Calvert Trust and the Richmond Fellowship, find the community charge in respect of those employees a very heavy burden? Is it not consuming charitable donations which the donors intended to help the disabled and not merely to boost public funds?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0572"/>
<col>1065</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04690"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question on the Order Paper refers specifically to disabled people. One in four people are helped to pay their community charge bills. A sum of &#x00A3;2 billion is made available and 9 million people receive some help.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04691"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Question raised by my noble friend is an especially poignant one? The poll tax affects many poor people and it hits disabled poor people more than anyone else. If the noble Baroness wants corroboration of that statement, will she be prepared to consider talking to the Disabled Drivers Association, Arthritis Care and the societies for helping the aged? Those associations could give all the facts. She is obviously unaware of them, otherwise she would not have given such suave answers this afternoon. Will she contact the representatives of the disabled people of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04692"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that nothing I have said seems to detract from the way in which I believe that we should care about the needs of disabled people. My first Answer listed the kind of help that is considered. Community charge benefits take account of the needs of disabled people. I said that there is complete exemption for people with severe mental impairment. There is also exemption for those with mental or physical disabilities who are resident in hospital, care homes, nursing homes and other hostels. For those disabled people in the community there is also additional help over and above that given to other people. I hope that I was not suave or uncompassionate in my answers on this issue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04693"><member>Lord Henderson of Brompton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the present Prime Minister is the first person to hold that office who has also held the office of Minister for the Disabled (as it was then) or Minister for Disabled People, as it is now? Organisations for the disabled therefore greatly hope that the Government will be more sympathetic than they have perhaps been in the past about representations from them, especially in regard to the poll tax. Will she kindly say whether representations in regard to the poll tax should be made to the Secretary of State for the Environment or to the Minister for Disabled People?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04694"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord's first remark. My right honourable friend the new Prime Minister served with distinction in the Department of Health and Social Security (as it then was). He had a very good and special relationship with disabled people and their organisations. The noble Lord will be aware that there has been a review undertaken during the past year. The review will continue, as has been very publicly promised. I believe that if disabled people wish to be considered further over and above the generous arrangements that have been made for them, they could make representations to both the Department of the Environment and their own organisations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04695"><member>Lord Swinfen</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend tell the House what steps the Department of Social Security is taking to monitor the effects of the
<col>1066</col>
community charge on disabled people, in particular those who come from hospital into the community for the first time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04696"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Department of Social Security has some very sophisticated methods of monitoring the requirements of people with many kinds of special needs, not just the disabled. I have no reason to believe that those needs are not watched with great care. Continuous monitoring also gives rise from time to time to new policies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04697"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Baroness meets the disablement organisations she will learn that some people on mobility allowance cannot afford a car any more because of the poll tax. There is one other disadvantage which she has not yet mentioned. Disabled people who live in high poll tax areas in specially adapted units of accommodation do not have the same mobility as others in the community. They cannot move to a cheaper area because they will not obtain similarly adapted accommodation. They are therefore trapped in high poll tax areas. What is being done about them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04698"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have detailed the number of ways in which disabled people are helped. However, the noble Lord makes specific reference to areas where the poll tax is very high. I believe that it is more a reflection on the level of the charge in those areas than it is on the level of the way in which we help disabled people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04699"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister not recall that when the poll tax legislation was going through Parliament the Government undertook that social security benefits would be uprated to cover the 20 per cent. of poll tax which disabled and other people on benefits have to pay? Is it not now the case that a single person has to pay &#x00A3;36 extra a year and a couple &#x00A3;76 extra a year, amounts not covered by uprating in social security benefits? Does that not apply with even greater force to those who are disabled?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04700"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my understanding is that if people qualify to have the 20 per cent. paid into their social security payments, whatever they are, that 20 per cent. is 20 per cent. of the average community charge in the country as a whole. Where community charges are above the average, that reflects more on the local authority than on the system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04701"><member>Baroness Hollis of Heigham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister not feel uncomfortable that a family which paid &#x00A3;12 a year in rates because of disability rate relief is now paying &#x00A3;380 a year in poll tax, and, according to RADAR, as a result cannot afford the electric wheelchair that it needs? Is the Minister comfortable about that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04702"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the amount referred to by the noble Baroness means that the family does not fall into the category of receiving some of the benefits available. If the noble Baroness says that an individual with disability is paying &#x00A3;380 she introduces a very different factor. If there is one disabled person he will receive all the benefits. If there are other people in the house, and if they are below the threshold for rebate,
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0573"/>
<col>1067</col>
they will receive rebate. If they are above the threshold, they are deemed to be able to meet the charges.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Hong Kong: Death Penalty</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04703">3.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04704"><member>Lord Hylton</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04705">Whether they will take the necessary steps to abolish the death penalty for serious offences in Hong Kong, and if not why not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04706"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. There are no plans to change the present situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04707"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that since 1966 there has not been one single execution in Hong Kong and that 125 reprieved murderers are now serving life imprisonment with a further 40 awaiting commutation? At the same time, on the mainland of China hundreds of people a year are executed not only for murder but also for political and economic crimes. Would it not therefore be much more satisfactory to abolish the penalty in Hong Kong?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04708"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is right to say that there have been no executions in the territory for 24 years. However, as I am sure he is aware, there is a very high degree of autonomy not only for the present government but for the future government of Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration. We believe that it is most important that such an issue should be resolved within the territory rather than that resolution be imposed from outside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04709"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the Legislative Council of Hong Kong has the power to abolish the death penalty in Hong Kong by way of Order in Council? Would Her Majesty's Government not advise the Legislative Council that they would support such action?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04710"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there does not seem to be a majority in favour of such action in LegCo at the moment. The present situation has worked satisfactorily. However, in view of the unique position of Hong Kong we believe that those matters are best resolved within Hong Kong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04711"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl says that there does not seem to be a majority. On what grounds does he say that? Is it quite clear to the Government that there is no majority? My understanding is that a large number of people would be very glad to see the death penalty abolished in Hong Kong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04712"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a recent opinion poll published on 13th November showed that 71 per cent. of people in Hong Kong were in favour of retaining the death penalty for convicted murderers. That is slightly higher than the last survey in 1986. So far as concerns LegCo, in a recent poll only 17 members out of a total of 58 said that they favoured abolition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04713"><member>Lord MacLehose of Beoch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Earl said, is this not essentially a Hong Kong matter?<lb/>
<col>1068</col>
Abolition is a matter for the Legislative Council. It can be achieved at any time there is a majority for it. Surely we should leave that issue to the Legislative Council. The present policy of the Secretary of State which results in automatic commutation has continued for 16 years or more. If there is a strong feeling among a majority of the executive and legislative councillors that it should be changed, presumably they would say so. Meanwhile, should we not leave the matter to them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04714"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with his vast knowledge of Hong Kong the noble Lord says some very wise words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04715"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, who exercises the prerogative of mercy at present? Who would exercise it or advise upon it under the proposed new constitution?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04716"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before answering that question perhaps I may say that I know that my noble friend will take enormous pride in having represented Huntingdon from 1945 to 1979 and that the judicious timing with which he saw fit to resign his seat has been to the enormous benefit of this party and the country.<lb/>
To answer my noble friend, the present situation has obtained for 24 years and the matter is in the hands of the Governor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04717"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there is, as the noble Earl said, a strong feeling in favour of the death penalty in Hong Kong, why has there been no protest against commutation over the past 16 years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04718"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that I am unable to answer that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04719"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl made reference to Huntingdon and elections. He may be aware that the noble Lord sitting beside me twice defeated the present Prime Minister in parliamentary elections.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04720"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that the Hong Kong Bill of Rights of this year is defective in Article 2, which states that the death penalty may be imposed for the most serious crimes and that commutation may be granted in all cases? Is it not far too permissive?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04721"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is entirely a matter for Hong Kong.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Foreign Goods Vehicles</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04722">3.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04723"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04724">How many foreign goods vehicles whose weight or dimensions exceeded those permitted by British law sought to enter the United Kingdom in the last 12 months; and how many of these were permitted to enter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04725"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, approximately 390,000 foreign goods vehicles entered the country in 1989 and 15,124 foreign vehicles were weighed in
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0574"/>
<col>1069</col>
1988/89 by the department's traffic examiners. Of those, 9,565 were weighed in ports and 2,624 were prohibited from further movement until the excess load had been removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04726"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend stay whether it is intended to enforce British law in this respect? In view of the Answer to the first Question this afternoon, that might be an appropriate response.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04727"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is certainly intended to enforce British law in this respect. During my researches I noticed that my noble friend asked a similar Question almost two years ago. I then said that we had weighed 5,700 foreign registered vehicles in the previous year and that we proposed to weigh 8,800 during that year. I hope that the House will be pleased that we have reached the figure of 15,100 vehicles this year and are looking for a further increase next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04728"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say how many examiners there are at present and whether the Government plan to increase that number? I ask the question in view of the wide variety of obligations that examiners must fulfil not only in relation to the weights and dimensions of lorries but also in relation to condition and driving hours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04729"><member>Lord Barbazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have a figure for the present number of traffic examiners. I am well aware that they have duties other than the weighing of lorries which, as the noble Lord described, they must continue to carry out. However, we propose to increase the number of weighings next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04730"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is all very well to increase the number of weighings but what happens if they are found wanting?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04731"><member>Lord Barabazen of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one stops the lorries from proceeding and makes the drivers unload their excess load.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04732"><member>Lord Mowbray and Stourton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how are we progressing with improvements to our bridges so that they can take the vehicles which may be allowed by our foreign friends in Europe?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04733"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have a derogation from the 40 tonne directive until 1st January, 1999. We are continuing to survey and strengthen our bridges where necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04734"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend clarify his answer about action taken in cases where the load is excessive? He indicated that the driver would be made to unload but, if the vehicle is too large and its dimensions are excessive will it be denied entry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04735"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in such a case, yes. However, there are few cases of excess dimensions so that seldom happens. The common problem is overloading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04736"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware of the grave anxieties that have been expressed in the media by representative bodies engaged in the road haulage business to the effect that there are too
<col>1070</col>
many cowboys and that there is an insufficient number of testing examiners to carry out the increasing obligations that are being imposed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04737"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I last answered the Question asked by my noble friend two years ago I said that 24 per cent. of lorries had been found to be overloaded. The survey now shows that only 17 per cent. are overloaded and therefore there has been an improvement during the past few years.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Maintenance Enforcement Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04755">3.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04756"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
The Government wish to reinforce parental responsibility and to help lone parents. On 30th October we published a White Paper entitled <i>Children Come First.</i> It explained the Government's proposals for the creation of a child support agency which will assess, collect and enforce child maintenance. The proposals in the White Paper are both radical and innovative. Under them child maintenance will be assessed by a new child support agency on the basis of a formula. The agency will arrange for the collection and the enforcement of child maintenance for lone parents who are on income support and for any other parent who wishes to use the agency's services. The collection and the enforcement services may also extend to the maintenance of a spouse.<lb/>
However, the child support agency, if it has Parliament's approval, will not be fully operational until the mid-1990s and we cannot ignore until then the problems which lone parents face in collecting and enforcing maintenance for themselves and for their children. That is why we have introduced this Bill today. In the magistrates' courts alone there are about 85,000 enforcement proceedings a year.<lb/>
Many enforcement proceedings are avoidable, and many of them involve women who are in great distress, both financial and emotional. They often write to the Government pointing out loopholes in the present arrangements for enforcing their maintenance. Perhaps I could give your Lordships an example of what I mean. We have recently had drawn to our attention the case of a woman who obtained an order for maintenance from her ex-husband in May 1989. The order was registered for enforcement in the magistrates' court. Since then, her ex-husband has paid only irregularly, and he has delayed paying arrears for as long as possible.<lb/>
When default occurs under the present law, the justices' clerk, at the request of the creditor, informs the debtor of the sum of the arrears, requests him to make the payment and, if payment is not made, he issues an enforcement summons. In this case, the man concerned pays off the stated sum of arrears only when he receives a summons. But, by this time, fresh arrears have accumulated, and the process has to be repeated. His maintenance account is therefore always in arrears. The man has simply "played the system". Since May 1989 the justices' clerk has been obliged to send the man five notifications of arrears, to issue five summons and to arrange two hearings which then had to be cancelled because payment was made.<lb/>
That case well illustrates the fact that the present law provides too many opportunities for maintenance debtors to evade their legal obligations. En some cases, this may be because they are badly organised or
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0576"/>
<col>1073</col>
careless. In other cases it may well be that default occurs deliberately, and out of spite. I think&#x2014;and I hope&#x2014;that this Bill should go a long way towards closing the loopholes which maintenance debtors can now exploit.<lb/>
In introducing the Bill, the Government have been guided by two principles: first, that family responsibility should be actively encouraged; and, secondly, that it is much better to avoid default occuring than to take action once it has occurred. To the lone parent, who is receiving maintenance payments, regularity of payment can be as important as the amount which is ordered. As a result of the Bill's proposals, we hope that the consequences of arrears&#x2014;time-consuming enforcement proceedings and the need in many cases for lone parents to rely on state support&#x2014;will be reduced.<lb/>
I am bound to admit that, for a relatively simple purpose, the Bill looks dauntingly hefty. However, I advise your Lordships not to be daunted by it. It appears complicated because the present law on maintenance is complicated and because it is distributed between a number of enactments. In the Bill, Schedule 1 in fact is larger than the actual clauses of the Bill itself, and many of the clauses repeat the same powers but for the purposes of different legislation.<lb/>
The Bill's key proposals are, however, simple. The Bill will give the High Court, county courts and magistrates' courts in England and Wales new powers when they are making, varying or enforcing a maintenance order. This includes an order which is made under Section 24 of the Social Security Act 1986.<lb/>
At present, the courts can order that maintenance payments must be paid either to the court or directly to the recipient. The Bill will give the courts two additional powers so that they may order that payments can alternatively be made either by standing order or by attachment of earnings. At present, attachment of earnings orders can only be made if the debtor consents or if he defaults on his payments because of his wilful neglect or culpable default.<lb/>
Many maintenance orders are made in Scotland, Northern Ireland or outside the United Kingdom's jurisdiction, but such orders may be registered or confirmed in the magistrates' courts in England and Wales. That is because the debtor comes to live in this country. We have, therefore, decided that it is right that magistrates' courts should also have the power to specify the method of payment when they are varying or enforcing these orders.<lb/>
The Bill provides for the magistrates' courts to have discretion as to the method of payment which is to be ordered. The High Court and the county courts will also have a discretion whether or not to order a particular method of payment. Before exercising any of their powers, courts will be obliged to have regard to any representations which may be made as to the method of payment by the parties concerned.<lb/>
We think it likely that the courts will, in many cases, make use of these additional new powers to
<col>1074</col>
order payment by standing order. Most people now have a bank or a building society account and the use of standing orders is firmly established. Their virtue in this context is that, once a maintenance debtor has set up a standing order arrangement, then he need take no further action for payments to be made. The recipient is not dependent on the debtor taking a positive step each week or each month to pay the amount required. Standing orders have the capacity to offer the creditor greater assurance and the debtor greater convenience. They will help to reduce the scope for confrontations over money between men and women in circumstances when tensions and emotions may already be high.<lb/>
Payment by standing order can obviously also be useful where a maintenance debtor is self-employed and where it is not open to the court to order an employer to attach earnings. The courts may not require the debtor to pay by standing order unless he is first given an opportunity to open a bank or a building society account, if he does not already have one. If there is a good reason why he cannot open an account&#x2014;perhaps because he is refused banking facilities&#x2014;the court will select some other method of payment.<lb/>
The method of payment which is chosen by the court may be important. We obviously do not want debtors to be able to ignore a court's order. In the High Court and in the county courts breach of an order can be treated as contempt but the magistrates' courts have no contempt powers. The Bill gives magistrates' courts an explicit sanction which can be imposed on those who fail to comply with the method of payment which is ordered. This is in line with other powers which magistrates' courts have in similar circumstances.<lb/>
We realise of course that people's circumstances may change. A maintenance creditor, for example, who may initially have wanted payment by standing order may later become unhappy with this method. As changing the method of payment is essentially an administrative act, the Bill allows any interested party to apply in writing to the justices' clerk for payment by standing order to be varied so as to allow payments to be made to the court. The clerk will have a discretion to refer any application to vary the method of payment to the court if he considers that it is inappropriate for him to deal with it. The Bill also gives justices' clerks the power to amend the method of payment when a person no longer claims income support or when he or she reclaims it if an order under Section 24A of the Social Security Act 1986 has been made.<lb/>
Although the Bill is intended to reduce the scope for default, we also want to take the opportunity to ensure that, if default does occur, the courts are able to deal with it more effectively than they are at present. The majority of maintenance enforcement proceedings are taken in the magistrates' courts. At present, the justices' clerk cannot take proceedings against a defaulter until the creditor has requested that he should do so. This procedure is time-consuming. It encourages the accumulation of arrears, and it gives the wrong impression to the debtor that his
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0577"/>
<col>1075</col>
non-payments go unnoticed by the court. In order to prevent that happening, the Bill makes provision for creditors, where payments are made to the court, to give the justices' clerk a standing authority to enforce arrears as soon as they occur.<lb/>
This is a modest and, I hope, uncontroversial Bill. Its purpose is simply and solely to ensure that maintenance is paid regularly. By so doing, anxiety on the part of parents and spouses will be reduced, valuable court time will be saved, and state benefit payments will be reduced. I commend the Bill to the House. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time. &#x2014;(<i>Earl Ferrers.</i>)</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04758"><member>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to my infinite relief I am completely underwhelmed and pleasingly undismayed by the weight of the number of representations which I have received from outside bodies on the contents of this Bill. Almost no one seems to object to it root and branch. That is a pleasing state of affairs because on these Benches we welcome the general principles on which it is constructed and support the general thrust of its central recommendations.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Mishcon said in your Lordships' House on 29th October in reply to the Statement on child maintenance:
<quote>"The principles behind the Statement&#x2014;namely, that fathers, together with mothers who can afford it, should be responsible for the maintenance of their children and that the children come first&#x2014;are obviously acceptable to the whole House and certainly to the Benches that I represent". [<i>Official Report,</i> 29/10/90; col. 1695.]</quote>
Of course, the present system of maintenance is imperfect. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor described it that same day as unnecessarily fragmented and uncertain in its results. It is based largely on discretion and is operated through hundreds of courts and social security offices throughout the United Kingdom. This modest Bill is a useful first step towards achieving greater justice and greater efficiency. We shall do our best to improve it in detail and to better some of its provisions at Committee stage.<lb/>
I am relieved that the Bill is comparatively modest. There has been too much talk in the media and elsewhere regarding the pursuit of recalcitrant fathers, forcing them to face up to their responsibilities and punishing the miscreants with terrible penalties. I pay tribute to the Government's decision not to impose swingeing punishments on anyone who commits an offence under the Bill. Such people&#x2014;usually, though not invariably, men&#x2014;are mostly inadequate and selfishly careless rather than cunning and criminal. Indeed any justice of the peace can attest that the overwhelming majority of those who default on maintenance payments either cannot pay because they have got themselves into an inextricable financial mess or conscientiously oppose what they see as the injustice of the law.<lb/>
A classic case is that of the man who leaves his wife and children for love of another lady. He willingly
<col>1076</col>
takes responsibility for the support of that lady's existing children as well as any others that he may have with her. He may well lavish care and attention on those children so that he has no money left to provide for his own. He feels that he has done his duty. Unfortunately for him the law takes a very different view. Many of those people need to be taught more than they need to be terrified. The Bill increases the flexibility and sensitivity with which the courts can treat such offenders.<lb/>
The context into which that must be set is the basic problem of failure to pay. A 1980 survey of divorces in Scotland found that no payment at all was made in one-third of cases. Another study found that 21 per cent. of magistrates' court orders were more than &#x00A3;500 in arrears, and another 10 per cent. more than &#x00A3;2,000 in arrears. Two-thirds of orders were more than seven weeks in arrears and more than one in five were over two years in arrears.<lb/>
Lone parents and their children, often on extremely low incomes, cannot afford to wait for late maintenance payments. In the event of non-payment courts can order an attachment of earnings, issue a warrant of distress or, as a final resort, order committal to prison. In practice they rarely do. Indeed, courts often waive arrears, sometimes for perfectly understandable reasons. Uncertain maintenance is a choice which lone parents cannot afford and many opt for the certainty of benefit.<lb/>
The Bill must be judged against that background. We have some reservations and questions. I can outline the most important under two headings: those which concern attachment of earnings orders, and those which concern other methods of payment. Attachment of earnings orders are not always as effective as they may at first appear. Although there exist provisions to prevent default, debtors are often able to evade the effect and the orders by moonlighting. It is often difficult and complex for the courts to take that element of work into account. Proposals in the Bill before us do nothing to counteract that.<lb/>
On the other side of the coin we should like to see some provision made to protect the privacy of employees who have an attachment of earnings order made against them. It is not a sentimental matter of tender loving care for the bruised psyche of the defaulter; it is a practical observation that if they know their privacy will be protected more debtors will elect to pay by attachment of earnings. Those orders, where they are effective, are an efficient, predictable and reliable way of applying a maintenance order. The Bill may well be a better Bill if a little care and attention can be given to revising the provisions in that area.<lb/>
Other methods of payment are described in Clause 1(5)(b) and subsequently. The Bill makes a distinction between the powers of the High Court and the county courts and those of the magistrates' courts. In the former the powers are discretionary; in the latter they are mandatory. It has been represented to me that it is not entirely clear why that distinction must be made.
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0578"/>
<col>1077</col>
Perhaps it would be wiser to impose a consistent system unless good reasons for doing otherwise can be shown.<lb/>
There is also doubt as to whether the use of standing orders or direct debits will be effective. To operate a standing order both the debtor and the creditor must have a bank account. Perhaps the debtor does not have a bank account. The Bill has foreseen that and directs that the debtor can be ordered to open a bank account. But that will only help if there is a bank which will accept him, and if the debtor puts money into the account. It may be difficult for somebody with a bad record of debt or other disabling characteristics to find a bank which will accept him. What will happen if he does not put money into the account? Some of your Lordships may know from personal experience that few things in life are more depressing to the human psyche than a bank account with no money in it. It will therefore remain both dismal and easy for a debtor to evade his responsibilities despite the existence of a court order compelling him to open a bank account.<lb/>
Secondly, the power described in Clause 1(6)(b) to order a debtor to open a bank account has obvious civil liberties implications. It is likely to provoke hostility. There are those&#x2014;not a few&#x2014;who will strenuously affirm that it is the inalienable right of every Englishman, or Welshman for that matter, not to open a bank account if he does not wish to. There may be those citizens of this country who, for religious reasons, are conscientiously opposed to our banks and all their works.<lb/>
Thirdly, and on a related topic, the procedure in a magistrates' court when a method of payment order is varied from a standing order or a direct debit to payments through the court clerk seems not to have within it sufficient opportunity for either party to object. Obviously it would be heavy-handed to hold a hearing over a minor administrative change. But it is important that both sides know about the application and are able to comment. I hope that at a later stage we may be able to propose an amendment to ensure that the clerk must be able to prove that the parties are aware of the application before proceeding with it. I hope that may be helpful.<lb/>
Which things having been said&#x2014;if I may conclude with an ablative absolute&#x2014;we on these Benches welcome the Bill. We will help to steer it safely through your Lordships' House hoping for a calm sea and a following wind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04760"><member>Lord McGregor of Durris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill deals with a tiny area of a very large social problem which, although easy to state in broad terms, is exceedingly complicated in detail. A high proportion of marriages collapse <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure,</i> though failure in one attempt provides only a mild deterrent&#x2014;at least in statistical terms&#x2014;against partners trying again either in formal wedlock or in its irregular substitute.<lb/>
The victims of our by now very well established system of serial polygamy are some 1.5 million
<col>1078</col>
children and their mothers who live permanently or for periods as one-parent families, the majority of them as paupers compelled to live on income supplement. In theory the law imposes an obligation upon husbands and fathers to maintain their wives and children. In practice over the past two-and-a-half centuries it has never been possible to fully enforce it. The reality was that the Victorian poor law, the National Assistance Board, the Supplementary Benefits Commission, or now income support, actually provided the subsistence which was ordered by the courts but which was unpaid or paid irregularly by husbands and fathers having only one income to support two families.<lb/>
By 1980 maintenance orders were producing no more than 12 per cent. of the income of divorced and separated women on supplementary benefit, the commission providing the remainder. Moreover, even if the orders had been paid regularly and in full, recipients would still have been on supplementary benefit as the orders were invariably for amounts less, and often substantially less, than their entitlements to minimum rates of benefit. Thus, receipts from court orders were marginal and payments of supplementary benefit were the chief elements in the incomes of such women. That is why one of the main recommendations of the last departmental committee to report on the subject &#x2014;the Finer Committee on One-Parent Families in 1974&#x2014;was the establishment of a family court, one main function of which would be to bring the private law of family maintenance into a realistic relationship with the public law of social security.<lb/>
A further complication is that in England three separate systems of family law have developed over the past two and a half centuries and all three were largely intact 20 years ago. One system made provision for those who could afford access or who could obtain it through legal aid to a superior court of record with a jurisdiction to issue licences to marry again. Another gave a restrictive jurisdiction to magistrates to make summary orders to deal with the family problems of people who for cultural, social or financial reasons did not or could not utilise the superior court. The third system of family law had been embodied in the poor law and taken over after 1948 by the new National Assistance Board and its successors.<lb/>
The principle of widows' pensions enacted in 1925 has never been extended to the other groups of unsupported wives or mothers who still retain both their legal right to maintenance from husbands and fathers and to assistance from the social security authorities. Accordingly, we still retain different tiers of courts with overlapping jurisdictions and different methods and machinery for collecting and enforcing maintenance. For example, the magistrates' courts alone possess a court collecting office. The normal practice is for maintenance orders of the superior courts to be registered for enforcement in the summary courts, the chief business of which remains petty crime. Again, that is why the Finer Committee recommended that what had been family laws for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0579"/>
<col>1079</col>
different social classes should be brought together in a single unified family law for the whole community, administered in a family court.<lb/>
The very limited provisions of this Bill&#x2014;one can see how limited they are both against that background and against the recommendations of the Finer Committee, which examined the whole area in great detail&#x2014;are worth while as far as they go. They are supported from these Benches in much the same terms as they were supported by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris. Nevertheless, I should make clear that we shall be making many serious and severe criticisms of the White Paper and of the proposed children support agency. However, in terms of the detail of the Bill, it is useful that attachment orders can be made immediately without waiting for default, though it is necessary to recall that from the very beginning when attachment orders were introduced in, I believe, 1958, the promise has always been far greater than the actual performance in producing money.<lb/>
Secondly, it must be remembered that the main enforcement agency, the magistrates' courts, are very short of resources even for the maintenance orders of superior courts. They are short of staff. They can no longer, as in the old days, use their warrant officers to follow up recalcitrant husbands of fathers. For example, I understand that the police now refuse to put maintenance warrants on their computer, so it is very difficult for courts to follow up the men concerned. There are similar difficulties in serving papers. I am told that very rarely a legal aid certificate may be extended to cover the costs of a professions process server, but that is by no means a widespread practice. I understand that the magistrates' courts have great difficulty in serving papers.<lb/>
The results of all that is that it becomes an extremely time-consuming and difficult business for a woman, even with the willing assistance of the court, to pursue her maintenance effectively. I am surprised that the Minister, in outlining the Bill's proposals, which he did with great clarity, failed to suggest that the Government would provide additional resources to the summary courts to enable them to fulfil the further functions envisaged by the Bill.<lb/>
Two questions are often asked about maintenance proceedings, either when negotiations are taking place or after an order has been made. First, people want to know whether the payments can be index-linked to protect them against inflation and to save the costs and upsets of future proceedings to vary the order. Index-linked maintenance orders were at one time thought not to be possible because the Inland Revenue would give tax relief only on payments of a "sum certain". Now that maintenance payments have no significant tax consequences following the Finance Act 1988, it is to be hoped that there will be no impediment to having index-linked orders. It would certainly be a welcome development if the Minister could offer the hope of government support for such a development.<lb/>
Secondly, it is often asked whether the payments can be made by standing order or by attachment.
<col>1080</col>
Until now the answer had to be that a standing order cannot be imposed but can only be set up if the payer agrees. Furthermore, such an agreement can only be enforceable if the obligation is made a formal undertaking to the court. Reasonable payers tend to agree to set up standing orders without causing any problems. It is the difficult, disorganised and recalcitrant who can be brought into line by the provisions of this Bill. A standing order or a deduction from pay gives the recipient greater certainty that the money will arrive and no time. It gives the payer a good evidential record with which to meet any claim that payments have not been made or to settle any dispute about the quantum of arrears.<lb/>
Obligatory payment by standing order will improve the position of those whose spouses like to use personal delivery of the weekly or monthly maintenance cheque or cash as an opportunity for a good row. Against that, if a payment which is supposed to be made by standing order is not made, either because the payer cancels the instruction to the bank or because the payer's bank will not make the payment on the grounds that an overdraft limit has been reached, the recipient may not know until up to a month has clasped and her next bank statement arrives. Meanwhile she may unwittingly get into debt with her own bank meeting payments expected to be covered by the standing order.<lb/>
There are three improvements which I hope that the Minister will be willing to consider on the procedural level of the Bill. The first is to give powers to judges and registrars to make any order for enforcement that is in the court's power whenever the debtor is required to attend for examination of his means and wilful default is found. In that way accounts and assets could immediately be frozen by injunction or charged to make it more, difficult for liabilities to be evaded.<lb/>
Secondly, I hope that the Minister will be able to consider the removal of the anomalous unavailability of legal aid to issue a county court judgment summons. That is perpetuated in the Legal Aid Act 1988. Thirdly, it would be very helpful if the Inland Revenue could be obliged to adjust tax codings of those in default as a means of getting maintenance deducted. I ask the Minister whether the Government would be willing to require the Inland Revenue to reconsider its refusal to date to co-operate in that way in the enforcement of maintenance.<lb/>
From these Benches we welcome the Bill but regard it as containing no more than very minor improvements. We shall wish to make far-reaching criticisms of the wider proposals which we shall be debating when the Bill based on the White Paper comes before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04761">4.24 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04762"><member>Lord Simon of Glaisdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like others of your Lordships, I am grateful to the noble Earl for his clear explanation of the Bill. I am also very privileged to follows the noble Lord, Lord McGregor, the leading sociologist in this branch of social pathology, policy and law. The noble Lord was part author of the statistical study of separated wives which was seminal.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0580"/>
<col>1081</col>
He was a leading member of the Finer Committee on one-parent families which has been referred to. The early death of Mr. Justice Finer was a great loss. It is a solace to have his lieutenant, the noble Lord, Lord McGregor, to carry on and explain the policy.<lb/>
The Bill is a side shoot&#x2014;marginal perhaps&#x2014;of the White Paper, to which the noble Earl referred, called <i>Children Come First.</i> But we are bound to ask ourselves: do we really mean that? Today, one-third of marriages end in divorce. That is double the figure of 20 years ago and double the figure since the passing of the deplorable Divorce Reform Act 1969. The number of divorces is rising. Of the one-third of marriages which end in divorce half of them concern children under the age of 16. If society is facilitating the break-up of such marriages, is it really putting children first? There can be no question that we have facilitated, even encouraged, people to rush for divorce which, as the noble Lord, Lord McGregor, aptly said, is a licence to remarry.<lb/>
The first question is this: where do we place the institution of marriage in our policies and priorities? On that there is a very large consensus. It is true that there is, and always has been, an extreme radical wing which looks askance on marriage as an institution. It has lately had a very able exposition in the first document produced by the Institute for Public Policy Research which has the advantage of being chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone.<lb/>
Undoubtedly the authors of that paper, quite consonantly with the tradition for which they stand, are by no means enamoured of the family as an institution; neither the nuclear family, which is father, mother and children, nor the extended family which we do not have in our law. Other systems of law have it although we have it as a matter of social fact in some grades of society. On the whole there is a consensus that the family is a valuable institution and that it is the best way of rearing future citizens. It is at best a nursery of love. Are we really doing what we can to buttress the family as an institution? The Law Commission's proposals are quite inadequate if that is the objective: in fact, they are nugatory. What are we doing to help the subsistence of marriage where the children are under 16?<lb/>
One simple way would be to stipulate that there shall be no divorce where there is a child under 16. If one takes the secular view of marriage and divorce, that seems perfectly sensible when coupled, as it should be in the secular view, with divorce by consent&#x2014;immediate consent&#x2014;if the children are over 16. I say expressly "the secular view" because people who regard marriage as a sacrament or, as the Church of England holds, in the nature of a sacrament, will not countenance divorce by consent, although in fact the Church of England did so in supporting the 1969 Act.<lb/>
Ought we not to recognise the conscientious feelings of those who regard marriage as a sacrament or as being in the nature of a sacrament by allowing them to stipulate before marriage that it is a marriage that shall not be dissolved? Certainly one would have to have judicial separation, but there would be no
<col>1082</col>
divorce if the parties agreed that there should be no divorce. When that idea was floated during the passage of the 1969 Act the proponents of the Act objected that it would be instituting two classes of marriage&#x2014;a first class and a second class. But what a confession it is that the marriage which is undissolvable and indissoluble is a first class marriage but the marriage which is easily dissoluble, as under the 1969 Act, is a second class marriage. That is obviously a matter which we shall have to consider.<lb/>
It is only after one has worked out what should be the policy there that one comes to deal with the pathology of marriage break down and the separation of parties. At the moment, as the noble Earl pointed out clearly and as was reinforced by what was said by the noble Lords, Lord Morris and Lord McGregor, the enforcement of remedies in that situation is most unsatisfactory.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to take up what was said by the noble Lord, Lord McGregor, regarding the recommendations of the Finer Committee. I refer to the question of family courts. On the Commons consideration of the Courts and Legal Services Bill I certainly understood my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to say categorically that what was proposed in the Bill would lead to a system of family courts. If so, the White Paper and this Bill is a retrograde step. The noble Earl mentioned the proliferation of courts. The noble Lord, Lord Morris, used the word "fragmentary". At the very least we have the High Court and all the multifarious magistrates' courts. They will continue and are given new powers. Why was not their jurisdiction centred in a family court as recommended by the Finer Committee?<lb/>
The same point applies to the social side. One finds in the White Paper the proposal to set up a new agency for enforcement and the collection of maintenance. Why do we need one? All the information is at the moment in the hands of the Department of Social Security. If we need a new agency, why is it not the welfare wing of the family court? Opinion has been running strongly in favour of a system of family courts each having a welfare department and an adjudicatory department in the same way as the <i>Conseil D'etat</i> in France in a different context has its administrative wing and its judicial wing. Matters would go for adjudication only if they could not be settled by the administrative, social and welfare sides of the family court.<lb/>
Although many of the provisions of the Bill are undoubtedly an improvement and are to be welcomed in that way as making maintenance more easily enforceable. I am bound to express my grave disappointment that the main thrust of the Bill has been away from what my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor seemed to promise and what so many of us have been seeking for so long.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04764"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend the Minister for explaining the Bill to us. It is consistent with the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0581"/>
<col>1083</col>
Children Act 1989 which stated that the welfare of the child is paramount and emphasised the responsibility of parents. I wholeheartedly support the intention behind the Bill. However, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, I question the way in which the Bill will be implemented. I cannot see it being implemented well in its present form.<lb/>
A single parent bringing up children faces difficult problems. If maintenance to the lone parent ordered by the court is not forthcoming, the plight of the parent is even worse. If the lone parent has to go to court to seek help and legal aid to make her husband, or wife as the case may be, pay the maintenance which the court has ordered, the burden is almost intolerable.<lb/>
I should like my noble friend to explain some of the provisions of the Bill. I have had a great deal to do with parents in respect of whom the court has made an attachment of earnings order. Has my noble friend facts and figures to show that this is a successful way of obtaining maintenance? My experience is that it is not. Not only is it not a suitable way of obtaining help for the lone parent without maintenance; it is almost counter-productive. If an attachment of earnings order is made, the man, even if in a good job, will leave his job as soon as he possibly can. If he is then pursued by the Inland Revenue he will move again. If he is further pursued he will move out of the town in which he lives. We need to be sure whether the attachment of earnings order procedure is working now. I find from my experience of dealing with such cases that it is not. Are we wise to pursue this line?<lb/>
With regard to the next section of the Bill, I feel that I must ask the same question as that put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Morris and Lord McGregor. Why is there a distinction between the powers of the High Court and the county court, which are discretionary, and those of the magistrates' courts, which are mandatory? My understanding of the matter is not clear. Perhaps my noble friend will be kind enough to explain it to me.<lb/>
I turn now to the question of a debtor having to open a bank account. I wonder whether this provision is practicable. Problems may arise where a debtor is not able to open a bank account because the bank refuses the application. In such a situation, under Clause 2(4)(b) of the Bill the debtor would not have failed to open the account "without reasonable excuse". Therefore, the court could not order a debtor to open an account. In any event, even if that were to be the case, he may not have the money; I cannot imagine any bank accepting such a person.<lb/>
I have some experience of this. A young man I knew called Roger wanted to open a bank account. I took him to the bank. He had been in care and did not know how to open a bank account. The bank manager was very pleased to have another customer. However, he asked me whether I would sign the form confirming that the young man was a suitable person. I was bound to ask Roger "Do you think you are a suitable person because you know you steal and tell lies?" At that point the bank manager said that he could not allow him to open a bank account. How could such a
<col>1084</col>
situation be possible? Therefore, while I agree with the intentions behind the Bill, I do not believe that the way in which it is to be implemented is either practicable or possible.<lb/>
I should now like to pursue the recommendations made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. First, I believe that if we had family courts as recommended by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor we should be going a long way towards solving the problem. Secondly, the divorce Bill&#x2014;which has not been put before the House and was not mentioned in the Queen's Speech&#x2014;recommends that a couple who want to divorce must initially register the fact that they wish to do so. There must then be a period of conciliation during which the conciliation service and the probation service could help the couple; but the divorce would not be granted until the maintenance of the children and the spouse and the question of access were settled. If that Bill is introduced, we shall at least go some way towards achieving the recommendations made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale.<lb/>
In my view, we must start at an earlier stage to help divorcing parents. We should not issue a maintenance order until both parents have worked out between themselves, or with the help of a conciliator, what the agreements will be. If that process were to be followed, we would reduce the need for so much court procedure. As I have already said, I support the intentions behind the Bill but I regret to say that I do not support the manner in which it is to be implemented.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04766"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I had known that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, was going to give us the benefit of his usual wisdom this afternoon I should have withdrawn my name from the speakers list. I agree with everything he said. In common with my noble friend Lady Faithfull, I must say that we as women are most grateful that so many of your Lordships, being of the other sex, take such an interest in the welfare of women who are perhaps left without, as they seem to think, enough money.<lb/>
I have carried out a great deal of research among people as well as among organisations. I have come to the conclusion &#x2014;which I do not expect to be popular with anyone&#x2014;that these men are having a very raw deal at this time. We seem to be pursuing them for something which they probably do not have. They may refuse to pay for reasons which are not given to us or to the court. They may indeed be family reasons. In most cases they are being asked to leave the matrimonial home and the children to whom they are as devoted as the mothers. The result is that very often they are under a terrible emotional strain. They may be sacked from their jobs and they have no home. Moreover, they do not even have their children, to whom, as I said, they are devoted. They are often to be found on our streets. It is a very sad state of affairs and if on top of all that they are to be hounded for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0582"/>
<col>1085</col>
maintenance they will go into hiding. I agree with the noble Earl, who I think said that such men can always be found via the computer, presumably at Newcastle.<lb/>
Who are these men? They are husbands who leave their wives; they are fathers who leave their wives and their children; and they are men who leave their girlfriends and the children whom they have fathered. It has always seemed to me that the break-up of a relationship&#x2014;not necessarily a marriage but people living together&#x2014;is two-sided. It is split 50:50. It is very rare that one can say categorically that it was either his or her fault. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that both sides are usually equally to blame. However, where there are children&#x2014;and we have all decided that children are paramount&#x2014;they are the ones who are hurt. Whatever anyone says or tries to do, the children in such a situation are desperately hurt.<lb/>
I turn now to the reasons for the failure to pay. One of the oganisations with which I have been in touch maintains that this is the reason behind the failure to pay. A man may be willing to pay but, despite the fact that the learned judge who granted the divorce had told him, "You may have access," the mother refuses to grant access and throws him out every time he appears. He may then say, "Why should I give this woman to whom I used to be married"&#x2014;or with whom he used to live&#x2014;"money when I am not allowed to see my will pay?" I am assured that that is the reason for the failure to pay. That is the issue to which we should be addressing our attention and not how we can retrieve the money. We must concentrate upon why these men do not want to pay.<lb/>
I can assure noble Lords that the men to whom I have talked &#x2014;they represent quite a large body of people&#x2014;are very willing to pay. On the whole they can pay. However, if they are unable to see their children they say, "Why should I pay?" That is an issue which we are not able to address within the scope of this Bill. We are dealing merely with how to obtain money from someone who has been ordered to pay but who will not do so. I entirely agree with the argument adequately put forward by my noble friend Lady Faithfull that it is quite absurd to put in a Bill the requirement that a man must open a bank account.<lb/>
I also believe that the attachment of earnings order, which I used to make quite frequently when I dealt with such cases, is impractical. I say that because, although the man may ask his employer to help him in respect of such an order, there is a stigma attached to it. Those working in the office of the employer are bound to know that the man is in trouble and is not paying the money due to his former partner. Then, as my noble friend said, the man leaves his job and is unemployed. The state then has to pay not just him but the woman with whom he lived.<lb/>
I appreciate that this is a difficult social problem. I agree with the principle that preferably both parents should always be financially responsible for the children, but when it is impossible to make the man pay I am afraid that the state, as it has done for a long time, has to pick up the bill. I do not know what we
<col>1086</col>
shall do with the Bill. I do not like it. It is far too long. It repeats itself over and over again. I shall be interested to see what my noble friend the Minister makes of it in Committee. I expect that we shall all table a number of amendments.</membercontribution></p>

Like her, I have always been a great supporter of the cause of my sex. I have always supported sex discrimination laws and the equality for which we have fought. Like the noble Baroness, I have all too frequently met cases similar to those she described. There has been a strange turn of events. All too often now the man suffers because the woman appears to get the best of the argument. Sadly we all know cases within our own families. As I said one day, I do not need to watch "Dallas"; I could write the script from my own family.<lb/>
There is no doubt that some way must be found to deal in the Bill with the circumstances described by the noble Baroness. The matter is no longer black and white. When I sat in court we frequently made attachment of earnings orders. The trade unions found the men who were forced to pay. The climate has changed. We no longer have the simple obligation of marriage or non-marriage. People live together voluntarily. It must be a two-party thing. I hope that during the course of the Bill's passage we can table some amendments to take account of the circumstances so eloquently described by the noble Baroness.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04770"><member>Lord Meakswell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may apologise to the Minister for entering the debate rather late and unannounced. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady Phillips and the noble Baronesses, Lady Faithfull and Lady Macleod, for their contributions. They revealed a depth and breadth of understanding of the problems that unfortunately was not apparent from previous speakers. We must recognise that the problem is far more difficult than just finding a financial resolution or an easy, quick fix by the courts.<lb/>
I want to concentrate on two aspects of the Bill. The first relates to its general thrust. The second relates to one minor detail, although when I come to it your Lordships will appreciate that it can be a significant detail. I am concerned that we have the Bill at all. I am afraid that it reflects the Government's philosophy and attitude to the situation that faces our society&#x2014;the break-up of marriages and the results. We are doing things the wrong way round. We are saying, "Here is a Bill, which will become an Act, which will constrain and enforce, effectively, a contract that was not mutually agreed between the parties." That is one of the biggest problems with the concept of enforcement of maintenance payments. It is not as though there is a contract between two parties mutually entered into. It is a one-sided affair. The courts will be taking a view of a situation and imposing their reaction to it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0583"/>
<col>1087</col>
The implication is that it is all very well to have children so long as you can pay for them. That draws a distinction between well-off members of our society and poor members of our society. In this day and age that is not a distinction that we can allow to continue. One or two previous speakers alluded to the fact that people often separate because one party is excluded from the home, the affections of the partner, and the ability to relate and live with their children. That is the partner whom we penalise. It is perceived to be unfair.<lb/>
I do not say that the Bill is against men only or women only. One or two speakers tended to say that it is all to do with getting money out of men. That is not the situation that we face. At the moment we are already faced with the enforcement of maintenance payments against women. Heaven forbid that it should come about that my wife and I separate. However, my wife earns more than I do, and if she decided to leave and I was looking after the children I should be expected to demand money from her. We are not talking just about men.<lb/>
So much for the generalities. I shall mention one detail. One of the things that has come about over the past few years is the increase in the use of direct debits in place of standing orders. With a standing order, a set amount passes from one bank account to another at a set time. It continues. On the other hand, a direct debit relates to where money is paid from one bank account into another but the amount is not determined by the person paying. It is determined by the other party, who effectively says to one's bank, "Please pay us this amount". The other party is free to vary the amount.<lb/>
I recently had a dispute with BT because it has stopped accepting standing orders and will accept a direct debit only for regular payments. I refuse to pay on that basis. I and no one else shall be the person to determine what is paid out of my bank account. That is only reasonable. The Bill's Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states:
<quote>"by standing order or some similar method".</quote>
I make a plea that we ensure that in the Bill we do not give the courts power to demand direct debit payments because that would only compound the non-payment problem.<lb/>
Perhaps I may give your Lordships two examples of the situation that can result from divorce and the payment of maintenance. One example is where a man was effectively excluded from his household. He loved his wife and children. He wanted to contribute to their maintenance, and he did so as long as he stayed in employment. But the very fact of separation virtually destroyed his ability to work. He lost his job and became virtually destitute. However, whenever he has any money he contributes because he still loves his family. It is an incredible situation.<lb/>
There is another example about which I know. I met someone recently who, for the last 20 years, has lived in the black economy solely to prevent any earnings which he may receive being paid to his wife because of the circumstances of his separation. Surely
<col>1088</col>
this whole Bill is a complete waste of paper in those two situations, because we are discussing this area of social difficulty in completely the wrong way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04771">5.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04772"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to your Lordships for the welcome in general that you have given to the Bill and for the debate that we have had upon it. It has shown your Lordships' care and concern about what to do when marriages break down. I was glad that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, paid such a tribute to the noble Lord, Lord McGregor of Durris, for what he said and for his knowledge of these matters, which is of course considerable.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McGregor of Durris, welcomed the Bill. He said that it was a modest Bill, and it is a modest Bill. We never claimed that it was anything more than that. But we thought that it sought to meet a certain area of difficulty, and that is what we have done. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, for saying that he would help this Bill through the House with a calm sea and a following wind, which I think is a nice nautical expression for which we are most grateful.<lb/>
I was even grateful to my noble friend Lady Faithfull who said that she supported the Bill for what it intended but not for the way in which it did it. I am bound to say that if the Government ever produced a Bill with which my noble friend was wholly content, I think that I should be tempted to adjourn the House not during pleasure but with pleasure.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, said that a third of marriages end in divorce, which is double what it was 20 years ago. It is as well to remember those rather horrifying facts. He said that it is sometimes necessary to consider where we place the institution of marriage in our lives, and that the family is a good institution and a nursery of love. Few of us would think that the institution of marriage was anything other than highly commendable and highly desirable, but the sad part is that somehow the pressures of modern life seem designed to try to break it up.<lb/>
When marriages break up they cause troubles, sorrows and endless sadnesses. It think it was the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, who said that sometimes people nowadays live together without being married. It seems the easy option. It seems the convenient thing for people to do. I merely suggest that it seldom results in real happiness, and when things go wrong it is inevitably the children who suffer as well as everyone else.<lb/>
The sad part again is that like all matters which are fairly far apart there is a slender dividing line: goodness is quite close to badness; kindness is quite close to unkindness; love is quite close to hatred, although they are opposites. It is sad when people can marry and love each other that when they get divorced their love can almost turn to hatred to such a degree that, as the noble Lord, Lord Monks well, said one person can be prepared to make all his earnings on the black economy for the simple reason that he did not
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0584"/>
<col>1089</col>
want his ex-wife to have any of his earnings. Of course I do not think that we shall ever get over that problem, but it re-emphasises the fact that we should do all that we can in our various spheres of life to try to bolster up the cause of marriage, and try to encourage it rather than subject it so frequently to such risk and sorrow.<lb/>
In this Bill we have tried to address one area where we think it could give a little more happiness and a little more contentment. I think it was the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, who said that the Bill was repetitive&#x2014;no, I am sorry, it was my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve. Of course she is quite right. On the face of it it appears repetitive but that is because it addresses a number of matters of a similar nature and they all have to be addressed individually. Therefore, while my noble friend may feel keen to put down a lot of amendments to make the Bill simpler, I hope that she will be hesitant about putting down too many because I doubt whether she will find that it will be all that easy to make it that much simpler.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, was concerned about the discretion in the High Court and the county courts. The noble Lord is correct that the approach in the Bill differs as regards the High Court and the county courts and as regards the magistrates' courts. The reason is that the magistrates' courts' powers are contained entirely in statute whereas the higher courts have both statutory and common law powers. The intention is to give the courts new powers without interfering with existing powers. The most convenient way of achieving this has been adopted in drafting the Bill in its present form.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McGregor of Durris, was concerned about maintenance law and the family courts. The law of maintenance and related issues of jurisdiction are part of my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor's review of the family justice system. My noble and learned friend's department is engaged in a wide-ranging review of family law and procedure, with the objective of creating in stages a single family justice system applying a single body of substantive law.<lb/>
The aims are to ensure that the interests of children are given priority; that the personal responsibility of parents for their family is emphasised; that the system for hearing and deciding family cases is improved and rationalised, making the most effective use of existing court and judicial resources, matching cases to the most appropriate level of court; and removing from the courts functions that could more effectively be dealt with elsewhere.<lb/>
On the magistrates' courts' resources, about which the noble Lord, Lord McGregor, was concerned, I would only say that it is accepted that enforcement proceedings can be difficult and time consuming, and can be a drain on the courts' resources. It is for this reason that the Bill's proposals should be helpful in preventing default in the first place, and the creation of the child support agency will relieve the courts of
<col>1090</col>
enforcement work. Instead there will be a specialist and dedicated new body to do that in place of the courts.<lb/>
The noble Lord also referred to the Inland Revenue, and asked whether it was possible to adjust the defaulter's tax coding. It is not within the scope of this particular Bill to do that. Indeed, the entire system for reassessing and collecting child maintenance will be reformed by the "children come first" proposals. However, I would agree, without commitment, to give further thought to this matter in consultation with other departments. I shall try to discover whether the Inland Revenue can assist in the matter of maintenance schemes.<lb/>
The noble Lord also referred to index linking. The White Paper on child support proposes that child maintenance awards under the proposed formula would be reassessed each year and would make index linking unnecessary. Orders for spousal maintenance will not be covered by this formula. However, index linking is not without its difficulties and while it will be borne in mind by the Government as they develop their policy in this field, I cannot commit the Government to any particular line on this matter at present.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, referred to family courts. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor did not give an undertaking to create family courts. However, the Government have embarked upon a review of substantive family law and related issues of jurisdiction and procedure. They will be informed by the need to rationalise the use of existing courts and resources and to match cases to the level of court or judge according to the weight and complexity of the cases. Although the review aims to create a rationalised family justice system, that does not mean that it will lead to what the noble and learned Lord has described as family courts.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Faithfull referred to the usefulness of attachment of earnings orders. There are of course circumstances where attachment of earnings orders will not work. However, I believe that frequently they are successful. The purpose of the Bill is merely to make such orders available in circumstances where they are not available at present, thereby increasing the flexibility of the courts' powers. It will of course be for the courts to decide whether to impose such an order in the circumstances of any particular case. My noble friend was also concerned about divorce and conciliation. Divorce reforms are part of the review of family law by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, as is the connected issue of conciliation. The Government are considering the Law Commissioners' report on divorce. They welcome that as a useful contribution to the debate on this important matter. The Government wish to hear views from all interested quarters on the commissioners' proposals. However, it would be premature for us to reach any conclusions on the future of divorce now.<lb/>
My noble friend was also concerned about the power to require a bank account to be opened. The
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0585"/>
<col>1091</col>
power is clearly not relevant to cases where a person is refused facilities by a bank. The Bill contains safeguards for the debtor. The power is needed to prevent someone who has an account in good order from closing it in order to frustrate a court's maintenance order. We do not expect the power to be used often but it is a useful deterrent. The argument that the debtor may not have any money is not a good one. The maintenance order will reflect his financial circumstances. The Bill is about the methods of payment and not about how much should be paid.<lb/>
Noble Lords made a number of other points and I am most grateful for them. I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord McGregor of Durris, remarked that most of his criticisms were of the White Paper. I am glad to know that because I hope it means that the majority of his criticisms will not be deflected onto this Bill and that he will help to give it an easy passage. I am grateful to noble Lords for having given the Bill such a welcome. </membercontribution></p>

<title>Namibia Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04774">5.14 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04775"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
Namibia's attainment of independence and entry into the Commonwealth on 21st March this year were a great source of satisfaction to Britain. As a co-author of the UN plan for Namibian independence adopted in 1978 and a major contributor to the UN Transition Group (UNTAG), we played an important role in the independence process.<lb/>
We have built up a close working relationship with the president and the new government. Our aid programme is an important element in this relationship. We have pledged &#x00A3;10 million over the next three years which is to be devoted to police training, education and health, and is designed to encourage good government, accountability and cost-effective use of resources. At President Nujoma's request and in addition to the &#x00A3;10 million package, we are also helping to train the Namibian army.<lb/>
The purpose of the Bill before us today is to modify existing legislation to place Namibia on an equal footing with other Commonwealth countries for the purposes of UK law. The Bill follows earlier precedents, the most recent being the Pakistan Act 1990. It involves purely technical amendments to a number of Acts to apply them to Namibia. The Bill covers Namibia's relationship with the Commonwealth Institute. It provides for Namibian forces to be included in the definition of Commonwealth forces with implications for their legal status when visiting the UK, for example for training. It makes provision for the exercise of command and discipline when British and Commonwealth forces are serving together and for attachments of members of one force to another. The Bill also ensures that regulatory powers applying to
<col>1092</col>
the whaling industry will not apply to ships registered in Namibia as it is not appropriate for these powers to extend to the shipping of independent members of the Commonwealth.<lb/>
Clause 2(2) of the Bill deems the Act to have come into force on 21st March 1990, the day Namibia achieved independence and became a member of the Commonwealth. There is no technical reason for this, but clearly there is a strong symbolic value in deeming the provisions of the Act to come into effect on Namibia's independence day.<lb/>
I should remind your Lordships that the immigration and electoral implications of Namibia's admission to the Commonwealth have been dealt with separately by an Order in Council which came into effect on 25th August 1990. This added Namibia to the list of Commonwealth countries in Schedule 3 to the British Nationality Act 1981. With this brief summary of the Bill, I commend it to your Lordships. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04776">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time. &#x2014;<i>(The Earl of Caithness.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04777">5.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04778"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful for the clear explanation that the Minister gave of this small but nevertheless significant Bill. As the Minister said, the Bill aims to modify certain United Kingdom enactments in relation to the Commonwealth Institute, the armed services and visiting forces, and shipping in the light of the admission of Namibia to the Commonwealth. I, too, wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the sense of pleasure we all felt at Namibia's independence some months ago. I wish to express the high hopes we had and have that the people of Namibia will enjoy better lives now that they have emerged from the maelstrom of events which occurred in the long period of conflict which unfortunately lasted for many years in their country.<lb/>
Although it is true that the eight months of independence have brought a kind of peace to Namibia, they have not, unfortunately, brought a glimmer of prosperity. It is on this worrying aspect of the extreme poverty of many areas in Namibia that I wish to comment. I wish to ask the Minister some questions about the part that Britain will play in this matter.<lb/>
I believe that UNICEF is in a strong position to assess the needs of the Namibian people as that organisation drew up a country programme recommendation for assistance for Namibia for the transition period and for the first year of independence. In addition to establishing a child survival programme, UNICEF assisted in the repatriation of exiled Namibians. As many as 42,000 people were assisted in their return to Namibia.<lb/>
The areas of main concern during both the transition period and the first months of independence were identified by UNICEF as, first, the larger numbers of vulnerable groups, including people who were internally displaced or had been led to migrate&#x2014;they were often led to migrate to Crowded
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0586"/>
<col>1093</col>
peri-urban areas&#x2014;due to war and rural insecurity. A further vulnerable group includes populations in remote areas.<lb/>
The second area of concern relates to the fragmentation of services and misallocation of resources resulting from the retention of several administrative authorities in different areas of the country, many of which follow their own policies and priorities. That is a legacy of the apartheid concept and remains a problem for the new country. Thirdly, a strain has been placed upon the health and education services by budget shortfalls, resulting partly from drastic reductions in South Africa's budget subsidy to Namibia but also from the internal resource allocation policies of the various administrations. A further major problem is the critical food security situation affecting poor households in northern areas due to a combination of long-term and short-term factors, including drought, displacement and income losses resulting from South Africa's military withdrawal and subsequent employment cutbacks.<lb/>
Those stark facts make it clear that Namibia needs the strongest support in order to leave the launching pad and fly under its own steam. There are many ways in which the international community and the United Kingdom in particular can contribute. I should like to ask the Minister two or three questions in that regard.<lb/>
First, there can be no doubt that the major unresolved question following independence is the future of Walvis Bay. The Minister mentioned it yesterday in the debate on the Commonwealth. The return of the port, which is required under UN Resolution 432, is critical to Namibia. Can the Minister tell the House what steps the Government are taking in order to influence the South African Government on the implementation of the UN resolution?<lb/>
Secondly, in regard to economic aid, Namibia had hoped for a 19,000 tonnes beef quota under the European Community's Lom&#x00E9; Convention but the Commission recommended only a 13,000 tonnes limit. That quota has still to be ratified and therefore perhaps the Minister will say whether Her Majesty's Government will seek an increase for Namibia under the Lom&#x00E9; agreement. Will the Minister also say whether the Government are taking steps to ensure that Namibia receives least developed country status from the European Community, which would be of the greatest assistance to Namibia in acquiring EC aid funds?<lb/>
Lastly, can the Minister tell the House when the Commonwealth Development Corporation will complete its survey of possible investment projects? Is he able to provide an estimate of the number of personnel from Voluntary Service Overseas and other agencies which are currently assisting Namibia? I should be grateful for answers to those questions, but as I did not give the Minister notice of the questions I should be equally grateful if he would write to me with the answers. I believe that that is an area in which the
<col>1094</col>
United Kingdom can be of enormous assistance to Namibia in its struggle to begin its independent life in better shape.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04779">5.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04780"><member>The Viscount of Falkland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on these Benches would also like to thank the noble Earl for his very clear introduction of the Bill, which we welcome. Because we support the principles of the Commonwealth we also welcome the fact that Namibia has joined the Commonwealth.<lb/>
We are conscious of the fact that Namibia is an extraordinary country. In area it is much the same size as France and the united Germany but it has a population of just over 1 million people. It has had a difficult history over the past 60 years, culminating in the 1960s in the fight against a cynical apartheid regime imposed illegally by South Africa. Resistance to that regime began peacefully but unhappily ended in violence as that was seen as the only means by which the nationalist organisation, SWAPO, could continue to put pressure on the South African Government, against the disapproval of the greater part of world opinion, not to mention the United Nations and the International Court at The Hague which ruled that the South African acts were illegal.<lb/>
When I was in Zambia in the 1970s, in Lusaka I met a number of the leaders of the SWAPO movement. I learnt something of the problems and their desperation about the cynical way in which their country was being used in a cat-and-mouse game. I was impressed by the quality and education of that small group of people and the reasonableness with which they faced what appeared to be a bleak future. I am pleased that Namibia is now a member of the Commonwealth. The action of the Commonwealth in paving the way for the admission of Namibia has been very encouraging, particularly with regard to education, both in Namibia itself and for those who are exiled from the country.<lb/>
Before I finish I should like to welcome the aid which the British Government have put at the disposal of the Namibian state. It may not appear an enormous amount and we hope that it will be increased, but undoubtedly the quality of that aid will be excellent. We look forward to it continuing into a happy future. We wish the country well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04781">5.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04782"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all friends of Africa and of the Commonwealth will welcome the Bill and the evidence that it gives of Namibia's adherence to the Commonwealth. I remind the House that the Commonwealth offered membership to Namibia at a time when Namibia was still occupied by the South Africans but the Commonwealth was unable to help the Namibians to achieve the independence in which the country could make its choice.<lb/>
It would be inappropriate if, in a bland welcome to the Bill today, we forgot the background to the independence of Namibia and its adherence to the Commonwealth and, in particular, the debt that we in this country have accumulated by our actions or lack
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0587"/>
<col>1095</col>
of action over the past 40 years. My mind turns to the valiant activities of the late Reverend Michael Scott, who was the first public figure to take a continuous, stance on the matter. He attended the United Nations year after year on behalf of what was then known as South-West Africa. He was supported by and represented the people of what is now Namibia. In his lone stance he received some support from non-aligned nations but very little support from this country.<lb/>
We should remember that it was South African occupation of the country and insistence on administration, despite the fact that the United Nations regularly passed resolutions calling on South Africa to withdraw from the territory, which provoked the war that broke out in 1966 and continued for the next 22 years. The International Court of Justice pronounced on the matter in 1971. With a curious parallel to the present situation in the world, the Security Council set May 1975 as the deadline for South African withdrawal. That deadline was not met. South Africans quite openly declared that they had no intention of meeting it. What did members of the United Nations and permanent members of the Security Council do about that open defiance? Nothing at all. In fact the following year, when a call was made for an arms embargo to enforce the decision of the Security Council, it was vetoed by the governments of France, the United States and the United Kingdom. How things have changed.<lb/>
Despite the atrocity of the appalling massacre at Cassinga in 1978, when 750 Namibians in a refugee camp were slaughtered by the South African forces, still no action was taken. In the same year, Resolution 435, which became the basis of United Nations policy toward Namibia, was passed. What support did it receive from the members of the United Nations? There was a Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of South Africa and the setting up of a Namibian Council. Indeed, one of our own number until recently, the much beloved late Lord Caradon, was appointed as the commissioner for Namibia. He never arrived there.<lb/>
What support was given to the Security Council, its resolutions and its policies at that time by the United Kingdom Government or members of the Security Council? A western contact group was set up. I met its members nearly 10 years ago in Lusaka. They wandered around year by year and quickly came under the domination of the United States representative. Nothing was done to put into action the resolution or any of the policies of the United Nations.<lb/>
Meanwhile, throughout this period, uranium was being mined by Rio Tinto Zinc, based in this country, in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. Diamonds were being pulled out of the ground and sold in defiance of United Nations resolutions. The seas around Namibia were being grossly overfished in defiance of United Nations resolutions. In this country we took a part in all those activities. To its credit the Commonwealth regularly supported Resolution 435 and regularly criticized
<col>1096</col>
those who were breaking United Nations provisions; but not with the support of Her Majesty's Government.<lb/>
I should like to pay tribute to David Owen who, as Foreign Secretary in 1978, almost reached a diplomatic agreement. I never thought that there was any chance of going through with it: in any case he never had the chance because he was out of office at a very early stage of the negotiations. I pay tribute also to the work of the churches. I single out a much beloved Member of this House, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, together with his wife, who paid a number of uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous visits to Namibia. He produced brave reports of what was going on in the country.<lb/>
That is the background, and that is the debt that we have piled up to the people of Namibia. It is good to recall that when agreement on a ceasefire eventually arose, the Commonwealth immediately played an active role by sending an observer team to supervise the elections in November 1989, as had been dome in Rhodesia. I mentioned the point in yesterday's debate. It did not just send an observer team; it also sent a technical team, which in some ways was even more important, from the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation. Two legal experts were provided to help work out a new constitution. Training was provided in setting up the foreign ministry and other advisers were supplied to modify and modernise the civil service. Perhaps of most importance was the help given to the Namibian extension unit, mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, to move back to Windhoek from its exile in Lusaka and Angola in 1990. That was a very important unit.<lb/>
I was privileged to participate for a time in helping its training. It trained Namibian refugees to fit themselves to run an independent country, which is one, if not the most important, contribution that can be made from the outside to the growth, development and establishment of a new, independent nation. I am glad to know that the CFTC has continued to supply experts from Commonwealth countries to assist the Namibians in their nation-building.<lb/>
I welcome the statement by the noble Earl about the work that has been done by the British to help training in both the police and the army. I regret that he could only announce the very meagre figure of &#x00A3;10 million, considering the debt I have outlined which we have built up to the people of Namibia&#x2014;the amount of what one can only call loot, which has been extracted from that country ever since the war largely by the South Africans but with a great deal of British participation. I hope that the noble Earl will take the message from this House that &#x00A3;10 million is nothing like enough to repay the debt that we have built up.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to reinforce the point made by my noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs with regard to Walvis Bay. Walvis Bay has a very long history in the affairs of southern Africa, going back to the last century. Walvis Bay is absolutely crucial to the future economic health of Namibia. As my noble friend pointed out, that has been recognised by the United
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0588"/>
<col>1097</col>
Nations. We are entitled to ask about the attitude of the British Government, as a member of the United Nations and a member of the Security Council. What policy are they following in insisting that United Nations support for the Namibian claim on Walvis Bay is pursued so that this new member of the Commonwealth is given a reasonable chance to build up its economic strength following the rape it has suffered over the past 40 years?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04784"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the welcome that the Bill has received in your Lordships' House. The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, said that it was a small but significant Bill. We agree about its great significance.<lb/>
The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, spoke of the importance of Walvis Bay. It is worth recalling that in 1978 the United Kingdom voted in favour of Security Council Resolution 432 which states that Walvis Bay should be reintegrated into Namibia. As I said in our debate yesterday, we believe that this important issue is best resolved through negotiations between Namibia and South Africa. We believe that both the Namibian and South African governments are prepared to negotiate bilaterally.<lb/>
It is also right to tell the House that the Namibian foreign minister has written to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and to the United States and German foreign ministers reserving the right to revert to the Security Council. We have replied commending bilateral negotiation but offering diplomatic support if necessary.<lb/>
The noble Baroness also mentioned the importance of economic aid to Namibia. The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, was grateful for the contribution of Britain. The noble Lord, Lord Hatch, said that it was depressingly small. Let me repeat that Britain is producing a substantial amount of aid in various forms to Namibia. One must not forget also the contribution of the Community. In 1990, the Community draft budget has provided for help to Namibia of some &#x00A3;12.7 million. Within that there is a substantial contribution from Britain.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked about the least developed country status within the Community. I cannot tell her what it is at the moment. It is of course a matter for the Community to decide. Perhaps I may write to her on that point. I shall also write to her on the fourth point with regard to the CDC.<lb/>
As to the economics of Namibia, the noble Baroness referred to poverty. It is worth saying a word about the external debt situation. Negotiations on that and other aspects of the financial and commercial relationship between independent Namibia and South Africa are now taking place. We must leave it to the independent Government of Namibia to decide how to settle those complex matters. However, I am sure that we all hope the outcome will provide a basis for a prosperous future for Namibia.<lb/>

<title>Education Support Grants Regulations 1990</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04788">5.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04789"><member>Baroness Blatch rose</member> to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 8th November be approved [<i>2nd Report from the Joint Committee</i>].</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04790">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, these draft regulations provide for the payment of education support grants. They consolidate, with amendments, the previous 1984 regulations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04791">Before I explain how these new regulations differ from the old ones, it may help your Lordships if I set out some of the background and in particular the new arrangements for combining education support grants with local education authority training grants into a single co-ordinated grants programme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04792">When last year the noble Viscount, Lord Davidson, introduced regulations to amend the previous education support grant regulations, he informed your Lordships that a scrutiny had been established under the auspices of the Prime Minister's efficiency unit to review the department's two main specific grants&#x2014;education support grants and the local education authorities' training grants scheme. The scrutiny was asked to examine the administration of the two grants, to consider whether they were effective instruments for supporting the policy objectives they were intended to support, and to make recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04793">That scrutiny reported in January. Its first conclusion was that the grants should continue. It found that the grants were broadly meeting their objectives and had exerted powerful influences for change. But the scrutiny also concluded that there was no longer a case for two separate grant systems. Instead it recommended the establishment of a unified
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0589"/>
<col>1099</col>
scheme combining both grants. This was designed to improve co-ordination between training and other forms of grant support.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04794">The reason for that is that the two schemes have increasingly covered similar ground. Both now have it as a key objective to help schools, colleges and local education authorities to implement the changes flowing from the Education Reform Act. For example, both provide funds to help put the national curriculum in place. But under current arrangements the training that is needed for the national curriculum is considered, and grants are paid, quite separately from the other forms of support that are needed for the national curriculum such as books, equipment and non-teaching staff. Both grants have also allocated funds increasingly according to formulae based on objective measures such as the number of pupils or schools in individual local education authorities rather than on the basis of competitive bids.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04795">The Government therefore readily accepted that bringing the two grants together would make sense. Indeed the principle has received a general welcome as helping to make sure that available funds are used to best effect. The scrutiny report suggested that ideally new legislation might be introduced to provide for a single grants scheme. But it recognised that the prospect for early legislation was uncertain. Meanwhile, we shall continue to keep the two grants formally separate and paid under their respective statutes but administer them side by side so that we can gain the benefits of a co-ordinated approach. The combined programme is known as the grants for education support and training or GEST programme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04796">It is against that background that we have put before your Lordships new regulations governing education support grants. In practice, the regulations draw extensively on those previously in force. But they make several changes of substance. First, the schedule to the regulations allows for the various ESG activities within the proposed 1991&#x2013;92 programme. It removes the activities specified in previous schedules which are coming to an end in 1990&#x2013;91. It updates the descriptions of activities which began in previous years and are continuing into 1991&#x2013;92; and it allows for the new activities which will begin in 1991&#x2013;92. In particular, item 28 in the schedule covers the new activity which will support projects to improve the planning and co-ordination of provision for the under-fives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04797">Secondly, the regulations will enable the department to pay education support grant termly instead of quarterly as in the past. That brings ESGs into line with the existing practice for the training grants which have been paid on a termly basis for some time. It should help to cut down the administrative burden of the grants programme by allowing both grants to be claimed and paid at the same time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04798">Thirdly, the regulations give my right honourable friend powers to require information to verify that grant has been properly paid and to require LEAs to comply with requirements specified by my right honourable friend including requirements as to the repayment of grants. Both these provisions mirror
<col>1100</col>
requirements included in the parallel regulations governing the LEA training grants scheme. Perhaps I may assure noble Lords that the power in regulation 10 about complying with requirements is not for everyday use but is designed as a long-stop which will allow my right honourable friend to protect the taxpayer's investment. In particular, it is designed to allow him to require LEAs to repay an appropriate amount of grant when they sell assets bought with ESG funding. This is a standard requirement for grants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04799">In addition to these changes of substance we have taken the opportunity to bring the wording of the regulations as closely as possible into line with that of the LEA training grants scheme regulations to mirror the bringing together of the grants into a single programme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04800">Your Lordships may like to know more about how the combined 1991&#x2013;92 programme will work. The size and pattern of the proposed programme was announced in July. We expect to support through grants total spending of &#x00A3;364 million. Of that, &#x00A3;215 million is provisionally attributed to education support grants and the remainder to training grants. But the precise sums paid under each set of regulations will be decided when all the grant allocations to LEAs for each activity within the programme have been settled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04801">Also in July the department issued a single draft circular to LEAs inviting them to submit bids for allocations under the combined programme. Although each activity has been separately identified as payable under ESG or training grant regulations, by grouping activities together the circular is designed to help local authorities develop more coherent responses which can treat training and other forms of support as parts of a single package. The department has now received authorities' bids and we are considering the final shape of the programme. We shall announce allocations to local authorities as soon as practicable, subject to these draft regulations receiving approval.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04802">The Government's overriding priority for the 1991&#x2013;92 programme is to help schools, colleges and LEAs to implement the education reforms. Consequently, of the &#x00A3;364 million total programme no less than &#x00A3;270 million is being targeted on different aspects of the reforms. As in previous years my right honourable friend the then Secretary of State consulted the local authority associations on the shape of the programme. Within the &#x00A3;270 million for the reforms some &#x00A3;170 million will be allocated for various elements of the national curriculum and collective worship. This includes, first, &#x00A3;35 million of support for implementing the new national curriculum assessment regime, helping LEAs administer the new arrangements, promote consistent assessment standards and give teachers and other staff the necessary training; secondly, &#x00A3;30 million of spending on information technology systems for teaching, with a particular focus on primary and special schools and on the support of children with communication difficulties; thirdly, &#x00A3;15 million of spending on extra
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0590"/>
<col>1101</col>
books for the national curriculum; and fourthly, &#x00A3;16 million for other ESG support on materials and equipment for the national curriculum and the appointment of staff such as technicians to help implement it. A further &#x00A3;100 million will support projects to improve the management of schools and colleges primarily by helping LEAs implement schemes of local management. This includes expenditure on management training for staff, computerised management information systems and additional administrative support.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04803">But, as in previous years, the programme will also support other priorities not directly related to the education reforms. There is additional support for projects to increase local recruitment of teachers, particularly former teachers and nature entrants to teaching. We shall continue to support projects in the areas of health education and school discipline. There will be a new activity to improve the planning and co-ordination and provision for the under-fives across the LEA and voluntary sectors. There will also be continuing support for a range of ESG activities in adult education including adult literacy, educational guidance and support for the Workers' Educational Association.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04804">Thus far I have focused on the operation of the programme in England. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for the operation of education support grants in Wales. There too, ESGs are being combined with training grants in very much the same way as in England.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04805">The programme in Wales will support expenditure of nearly &#x00A3;25 million in 1991&#x2013;92. The activities to be supported closely mirror those in England in reflecting the priorities of the Education Reform Act. But in addition funds will be available to support Welsh in the national curriculum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04806">I believe that the value of the Government's specific grant programmes in education is widely acknowledged. The efficiency scrutiny report commented:
<quote>"The evidence we have received, from all sources, provides overwhelming support for the two schemes. Specific grants have funded important and beneficial developments which would not have happened otherwise".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04807">It is always a pleasure to receive such a ringing endorsement. But there is more that we can do and I have tried to set out for your Lordships the approach that we are taking to ensure that ESG and training grant allocations become even more effective. The regulations currently before us will allow education support grants to continue to provide a vital margin of funding to help schools, colleges and LEAs make a real success of implementing the education reforms and to respond to other education priorities. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04808">Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 8th November be approved [<i>2nd Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#x2014;(<i>Baroness Blatch.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04809"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for taking time to explain the background to the currently complex situation in relation to grants for education support and training. I wish to make
<col>1102</col>
two or three general points before making two or three specific points. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of the queries and questions that I wish to put to her.<lb/>
There is considerable and justified anxiety about the loss of local flexibility as a result of the new arrangements for education support grants and local education authority training grants. The Efficiency Scrutiny Study, to which the Minister referred, was undertaken last year. It recommended that the greater flexibility that was entailed in the training grants should be applied to education support grants. However, the reverse has happened; any streamlining of the system to try to bring the two closer together has resulted in less flexibility. That is a great pity and perhaps the Minister will comment upon it.<lb/>
The scrutiny study suggested that the two schemes should be properly integrated and I wish to endorse its recommendation. However, it appears that the Government have gone only half way down that route. It now appears that as regards the timetable the schemes are being run together but essentially kept separate as regards funding and bidding. That means that local education authorities must prepare two separate bids at the same time. Therefore, there is no opportunity to take into account the outcome of one set of bids when constructing the other set and there is no opportunity for local authorities to try to obtain a balance between the two schemes.<lb/>
The benefits of a complete merger of the programme as recommended by the scrutiny study will not materialise. Parallel running will not achieve all the benefits and instead we shall be left with a continuing set of administrative complications. I know that the Government will say, as the Minister has already said, that the legislative position prevents total merger. Novertheless, can she say what the Government intend to do about removing the legislative technicality which is preventing complete merger? If, as she said, it makes sense to bring the two grants together, why not do so? Surely there is not so much legislation around in this Session that a fairly minor piece of legislative adjustment cannot be undertaken.<lb/>
A number of important items are listed in the schedule to the draft regulations. However, the overall funding for the grant is decreasing in real terms. I know that specific grants have always been somewhat controversial in the local education authority world because local authorities prefer not to be tied down by a range of specific grants. However, we may decide to introduce them for important aspects of education provision. As the Minister said, there is great emphasis in the list on the implementation of the national curriculum. There are other important items such as the teaching of mathematics in schools; science and technology teaching and learning in primary education; the training of school governors; the provision of health education, the development and use of information technology in our schools; and the provision of open learning centres for adults in order to provide tuition in literacy and numeracy. Those matters are all vitally important areas of our
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0591"/>
<col>1103</col>
educational provision. Surely we should not cut funding on those matters. And yet, that is exactly what the Government are doing.<lb/>
There is an increase of &#x00A3;8 million over the 1990&#x2013;91 figure of &#x00A3;364 million; in other words, in cash terms that is an increase of just over 2 per cent. In real terms, that must be a cut of around 5 per cent. if we assume inflation at 7 per cent. When local education authority budgets are already so constrained, it seems to me very odd to make such a cut if the Government regard those items to be of great importance, as we have been told that they do.<lb/>
Perhaps I may now turn to the more specific matters which I wish to raise. I was very glad to see that the management and appraisal of school teachers, including training for the appraisal of school teachers, is first on the list of items in this schedule. Clearly, that is a matter of high priority but I am puzzled as to why only &#x00A3;9 million has been allocated to such a high priority item. I believe that the &#x00A3;9 million is for pilot projects but perhaps the Minister can confirm that that is the case.<lb/>
I am particularly puzzled because the new Secretary of State is now saying that appraisals should be compulsory in all authorities for all teachers. Does he mean that? If so, where is the money to come from? Why has not more money been allocated for that purpose? The national steering committee on teacher appraisal estimated that some &#x00A3;35 million to &#x00A3;40 million was needed. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House on that matter.<lb/>
I also welcome very much the inclusion in the list of improvement of planning and co-ordination of educational provision for children under five by education authorities and other bodies. I hope that that will encourage those Tory authorities which are doing absolutely nothing to expand and develop provision for under-fives. I referred to that in our recent debate on education and I hope that the Government will start to make a serious effort on that vital stage of education.<lb/>
I believe that that item allows for the training of non-teaching staff working with children under five, such as nursery assistants. That was not possible under the training grant scheme which specified the training of teachers only. That must be welcomed. It is something for which the local authorities and teachers' unions have been asking, and I must compliment the Government on listening for a change. However, can the Minister explain the basis of the allocation of money under this item? Is it based on population figures in the authorities or on the number of children under five who are in the education system?<lb/>
Last year there was a great deal of anxiety in the Workers' Educational Association about the transfer of funding from the association to the education support grants mechanism. Can the Minister confirm that the new method of funding is now working to the satisfaction of the Workers' Educational Association,
<col>1104</col>
to the satisfaction of local authorities and without any loss of funding to the WEA, particularly in those areas where WEA provision is quite extensive?<lb/>
Finally, can the Minister explain why the Government have rejected the scrutiny report's recommendations on allowing virement between the various items which are listed under the education support grant regulations? Circumstances can change quite quickly and when one takes into account that bids are made over a six to 12-month period before the money is spent, it would do a great deal to cut down potential waste and bureaucracy if virement was allowed as the scrutiny report recommended. That would be very much welcomed by the local education authorities, yet it would still mean that money was being spent on the 28 items which the Government listed as of sufficient priority to justify those specific grants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04810">6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04811"><member>Lord Ritchie of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from these Benches I should like to thank the Minister for her clear exposition of the changes which have been made. We notice that the ESG and local education authority training grant schemes are to be run in parallel. I must echo what the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said. I believe that the local education authorities are concerned that they have lost the flexibility which they had when the training grant schemes were open to them for suggestion and they could work out their own projects, submit them for approval and go ahead with them. They are now confined to specific projects. That does not permit a local initiative. If we approve the existing scheme whereby education is delivered by local authorities, then they should not have their opportunities for initiative reduced in that way by central authority.<lb/>
All the activities named in the new regulations are thoroughly worthwhile. However, the original idea of the 1984 Act was that money would be forthcoming from central government for specific projects on specific aspects of education. One wonders whether some of the activities named in that list can come under that heading. I am thinking of such matters as the teaching of mathematics in schools. Can the Minister explain in what way that is a specific project? The teaching of mathematics in schools is and should be carried out in any case. In what way is that an object of an education support grant? The same applies to the training of teachers in schools to improve pupils' use and understanding of the English language. Surely that too is part of the education service of the country. It does not seem to be legitimate that that should be a specific purpose of the education support grants.<lb/>
I mention also a difficulty which the local authorities have as regards timing. Most of these ideas are floated by the Government in the spring. They have to be considered by local authorities during the summer and autumn. Bids must then be submitted. The work done in planning the projects and putting in the bids, which involves time and money, may then be wasted because those projects may be entirely rejected
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0592"/>
<col>1105</col>
or under-funded. It is a recurrent complaint by local authorities that that can happen. There is a loss of time, money and labour because of that.<lb/>
I should be interested to know if the Minister can give me any idea of the take up of some of the excellent suggestions. What sort of progress is made as regards projects to meet the educational needs of persons from ethnic minorities? Has there been a worthwhile take up and successful progress as regards the promoting of social responsibility in children? I am thinking also of item 21 &#x2014;that is, the provision of open learning centres for adults in literacy, numeracy and such skills, the implementation of provision for pupils whose behaviour poses difficulties and action to improve rates of attendance in schools. Those matters are all terribly important. One wonders what success there has been and what has been the take up.<lb/>
I too hope that the schemes will be merged, and that in doing so there will be full consultation with local authorities so that whatever scheme is thought of and whatever legislation is introduced will be satisfactory to all. At the moment there are anomalies and sources of inefficiency which the whole of the new scheme is designed to prevent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04812"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like briefly to reinforce what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, about virement. It is maddening that the allocation of money, which is decided in advance of the grants, is rigid. Anyone who has had the job of administering moneys from central government knows that over time the best use of that money changes. To be stuck with the exact allocation of money that has been incorporated in the budget is extremely uneconomic. It produces very bad results and wastes money.<lb/>
This plea for more virement&#x2014;I know I am crying for the moon but that is what I shall do&#x2014;refers to virement not simply to the different kinds of work to be done using the money but also to what happens at the end of the year. The situation is absurd. We all know that at the end of the year the people who received a grant say that they have not spent it, and if they do not do so they will not receive as much money the following year. Therefore they feel they must rush out and spend it. That is an appalling waste of money. It leads to bad administration. If there could be greater flexibility at local level both between categories of work to be done and overtime it would lead to much better results and save money.<lb/>
That is not the point I primarily wished to make. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, in the account she gave us of these grants spoke briefly on allocations for adult education. We who are connected with adult education know that it is the Cinderella of the education services. There is no statutory obligation on local authorities to fund adult education. When they are hard up the temptation is not to fund it. That is happening at a time when adult education needs to expand rather than contract for economic reasons as well as social reasons.<lb/>
<col>1106</col>
I did not fully understand what was implied in what the noble Baroness said. If there is money in the schemes for adult education, will it be in some way ring fenced so that the adult education colleges actually receive the money? If it is not, and the money goes into the general pool, the temptation will always be to use it for something else. Can the Minister tell us what is intended by her reference to adult education? I should like to know how much will be expected, but the Minister probably cannot answer that. What rights over the money will the adult education colleges have?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04813">6.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04814"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this was a short but useful debate. There has been a wide measure of support for the education support grants programme. Everyone will have their own view of the real priorities. It would always be nice to have more money to do things. Nonetheless, it is common ground that ESGs and the parallel training grants are having a beneficial impact and provide a key margin of funds to help ensure that the education service can respond to changing needs.<lb/>
It may be easier if I start with the last matter and address the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, on adult education. My understanding in regard to ESGs and training grants is that when the bid is made for them they are specifically spent consistent with the details set out in the bid. It relates to the virement point, to which I shall turn in a moment. On the one hand, the noble Baroness was saying spend it for the purpose for which the bid was made but then add flexibility to allow virement when it makes sense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04815"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only want virement for the concerns in which I am particularly interested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04816"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall allow that comment to pass.<lb/>
Perhaps I may deal with some of the points made in the debate, with the caveat that should I omit anything I shall write to the noble Baronesses and the noble Lord. The first point made by the noble Baroness in her introduction was: why is there less flexibility at local level? That is an issue which was considered very carefully. We recognise that the LEAs use the local priority area to fund various forms of training not covered by nationally specified priorities and that its withdrawal would require some reordering.<lb/>
The heart of the matter is that the GEST funds are limited. The Government must take a view on the best way of using them and the pattern of activities which will obtain best value for money. Schools in particular have a lot of work to do to implement the education reforms. Our judgment was that the overriding priority for the 1991&#x2013;92 programme must have help to implement that work. Within the limited funds available it was not possible both to continue with local priority area funding and to fund at the same time at the appropriate level all the national priorities which need support; for example, information
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0593"/>
<col>1107</col>
technology equipment, information systems, books and materials, extra administrative staff, extra support staff, and so on.<lb/>
It is a question of judging priorities. We recognise that some people may judge differently. However, I make no apology for the fact that the Government's judgment was that it would be absurd not to use all the levers at their disposal to give schools all possible help to implement the reforms.<lb/>
There is a partial replacement for the local discretion in the new activity within the 1991&#x2013;92 GEST programme which will support the overhead costs of managing INSET and spending on non-subject specific training. For 1991&#x2013;92 that activity, which is to be paid for under the LEATGS, not the education support grants regulations, is much smaller than the former LPA. But we said that its scale and effectiveness will be reviewed for next year.<lb/>
Finally, it is important to keep the figures in perspective. The combined GEST programme will account for some 2 per cent. of education's share of the 1991&#x2013;92 local authority proposed grant settlement. While I recognise that resources are not unlimited it remains true that LEAs, schools and colleges are free to add to their GEST allocations to support particular training to which they wish to give priority. The noble Baroness referred to it being a cut in real terms. It is important to set it against the spending on education as a whole. In real terms an increase of more than 40 per cent. in spending per pupil in primary and secondary schools has taken place between 1979 and 1989. The 1990&#x2013;91 local authority grant settlement allows for local education authorities in England to spend &#x00A3;15 billion on education, which is over 9 per cent. higher than the comparable figure for 1989&#x2013;90. The proposals for local authority grant settlements in 1991&#x2013;92 will allow English LEAs to spend &#x00A3;17.5 billion on education. That will represent a 16 per cent. increase over this year's total.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04817"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down perhaps I may pick up what she just said. Giving the overall per pupil increases in spending over the past decade is hardly relevant to this argument. If it is indeed the case that only 2 per cent. of the share of total LEA spending is allocated through this mechanism, it is particularly odd that the proportion should actually be reduced when the Government have a number of priorities that they have allocated; and many are priorities that we on this side of the House would welcome. I do not feel that I have had an adequate explanation of why there has been a cut in real terms for ESG.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04818"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the point I am making is that overall expenditure has gone up by 9 per cent. this year, and will go up by 16 per cent. next year for education spending. The local authority expenditure prescribed nationally by the Government as a proportion has gone down. In other words, the flexibility for local determination has been increased by the reduction in national prescription.<lb/>
Another point raised by the noble Baroness related to why we did not complete the merger. That was also
<col>1108</col>
mentioned by other noble Lords. I said in my initial speech that one difficulty was the legislative one. I know that the noble Baroness asked why we did not bring forward a minor Bill. We took advice on the scrutiny suggestion that the combined programme might be paid wholly under ESG legislation. We were advised that it would not be acceptable in terms of legal propriety. Given that Parliament enacted in the Education Act 1986 that there should be grants specifically to support training, the advice we received was that it would not be proper to let that statute lie fallow and pay training grants under the ESG legislation.<lb/>
The scrutiny report recommendation for new legislation is the preferred option, not only of the report but of the Government themselves. I can promise the noble Baroness that the position will be kept under review. In the meantime, rather than delay bringing these two grants together we have set in train the arrangement as set out in my original speech.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, also referred to funding. Again, I think I probably addressed that point earlier. I am measuring ESG and training funds against the education funds as a whole. The noble Baroness also asked about the basis on which we are determining ESG funding for under-fives. The ESG element of the under-five activity is being distributed to give an equal share to all local education authorities. Given what the noble Baroness said in her speech, I believe that she may actually welcome that. The training element is based on the number of pupils in nursery and primary schools.<lb/>
The next point is that regarding teacher appraisal. The Government's view is that appraisal for school teachers can assist teachers to realise their potential and to carry out their duties more effectively. In September my right honourable friend the former Secretary of State issued for consultation his proposals for an appraisal scheme under which employers would have been left to judge for themselves whether to introduce appraisals. However, employers would have been able to require teachers to participate if they wished to implement that scheme.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the new Secretary of State is currently considering the whole question of how best we can move forward in the light of the consultation responses that we receive. The noble Baroness is right to have exposed his current thinking on that subject, but I must say in response that the matter is being considered. The resource implications of various options will have to be considered, but no final decisions have been made. In the meantime, the appraisal moneys will be given to local education authorities on the basis of their bids and the local authorities voluntarily entering into those agreements.<lb/>
I promised the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, that I would deal with the point she raised about virement. The virement procedures under the LEA training grants have caused considerable problems in relation to the auditing of expenditure. Auditors find themselves unable to keep track of changes resulting from virement. Instead, we have invited LEAs, in putting to the department their bids for allocations for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0594"/>
<col>1109</col>
relevant activities, to say if they want to switch the money from one area to another; for example, from training into education support grant and vice versa. We would try to accommodate that. We believe that the new arrangements will allow LEAs sufficient scope to transfer funds. That links with the original point that when a bid is made specifically to do something, the general expectation is that that is what the money will be spent on. If voluntary virement takes place in any sense other than it being flagged up at the outset when the bid is made, then it is difficult to make sure that the money is spent for the purpose for which it was bid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04819"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Baroness, but I must register a protest. The change is made for administrative convenience and not in order to achieve the best possible educational results. We should not organise matters for the convenience of civil servants who administer them. We must run them to get the best schools and colleges that we can. If there are difficulties for the auditors, that is just too bad.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04820"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said earlier that the proportion of these moneys is 2 per cent. of the budget overall. I believe I have answered the criticism that the percentage is reducing. It is because local authorities are being given greater discretion over the moneys that they are spending. That 2 per cent. is specifically set aside for the Government to have their national priorities met and to assist local education authorities to implement, as current thinking goes, the national curriculum and the measures in the Education Reform Act.<lb/>
We are saying that as far as possible we want the moneys to be spent on the purposes for which they are bid. One of the duties of the auditor will be to make sure that that happens. If the moneys are vired and there is no control over what has happened to moneys at local level, difficulties arise. Our concern is not to make the position administratively tidy, and it is certainly not to make things easier for the auditors, but to make sure that the money goes to meet the Government's national priorities and to benefit local authorities who implement the measures of the Education Reform Act.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, referred to the WEA. The new arrangement will provide opportunities for the development of partnerships and collaborative styles of working between the local education authorities and the WEA. That has been evident from information supplied in local authority bids for 1991&#x2013;92. I can say that the WEA activity is a success and the signs are that it is. We had an excellent response from LEAs bidding for funds for this year's programme. We have also had a very good response this year and will be monitoring the impact of the scheme as it operates.<lb/>
I have not answered all the questions raised in this debate. If I have missed an important point I shall write to the noble Baroness or noble Lord concerned. Perhaps they will be good enough to remind me of any specific points to which replies are required. I hope
<col>1110</col>
that I have responded to the main issues raised. I believe that the ESG activities which my right honourable friend proposes as part of the combined grant programme for 1991&#x2013;92 will provide valuable assistance to local education authorities. In particular, they will help schools which are already working hard to make a success of the education reforms to carry on their good work. The regulations we have discussed today will enable us to build on previous successes and to establish new and better arrangements for a co-ordinated grants programme. I commend the regulations to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Amendment) Regulations 1990</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04822">6.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04823"><member>Baroness Blatch</member> rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 16th October be approved [<i>27th Report from the Joint Committee, Session 1989&#x2013;90</i>].</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04824">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I understand that it will be convenient to discuss the Scottish regulations at the same time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04825">These two sets of regulations, which have already been considered in another place, are laid under the powers respectively in Section 303 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Section 87 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. They amend regulations introduced in April this year for Scotland and, for England and Wales, regulations approved by this House and another place some 20 months ago which came into effect in mid-March 1989.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04826">The main change introduced by these 1990 regulations is to provide for a general increase in the level of fees for planning applications. We have also taken the opportunity to make some very minor amendments to clarify the text of the regulations. Fees for planning applications were first introduced in 1981. Since then they have represented a contribution to the costs which the local planning authority incur in handling planning applications and reaching a decision. Applicants are charged according to the nature of the development proposed, and its size where that is relevant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04827">During the debates on the 1985 and 1987 amending regulations the Government's stated objective was that fees for planning applications should move to a level where they recovered about 50 per cent. of local authorities' development control costs. The 1989 regulations provided for an increase in fees of 15 per cent. across the board and the Scottish regulations introduced earlier this year made a 20 per cent. increase. Allowing for those increases, and for the steadily increasing volume of planning applications received by local authorities in recent years, we estimate that last year, 1989&#x2013;90, fees recovered
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0595"/>
<col>1111</col>
approximately 52 per cent. of local authorities' costs in England, and a rather lower proportion north of the Border.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04828">The two sets of regulations now before the House provide for an across-the-board increase in fees of around 20 per cent. Subject to approval, the new fees scale should come into operation next month. The overall effect of the new fees will be to restore cost recovery to around the 50 per cent. level in England and Wales and to raise it to approaching that level in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04829">The House will be aware that, as proposed in the consultation paper <i>Efficient Planning,</i> published last year, the Government also intend that planning application fees should eventually cover 100 per cent. of local authorities' development control costs. The Minister for Housing and Planning announced in another place on 25th July that we intend to invite your Lordships' House and another place to approve further regulations over the next several years to raise fees progressively in order to achieve 100 per cent. recovery. That is also the target in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04830">In <i>Efficient Planning</i> the Government also proposed to simplify the fee regulations in England and Wales, which we believe are excessively complicated. We intend to consult publicly about this before too long.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04831">Under the present proposals in England and Wales the basic units of fees will rise from &#x00A3;76 to &#x00A3;92, and from &#x00A3;38 to &#x00A3;46. A full application to build dwellinghouses, for example, will be subject to a charge of &#x00A3;92 per dwellinghouse. An outline application will be charged &#x00A3;92 per 0&#x00B7;1 hectare of site area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04832">The householders who wishes to extend his house will&#x2014;assuming he has to obtain specific planning permission&#x2014;have to pay a fee of &#x00A3;46, instead of &#x00A3;38. Applications to erect non-residential buildings, such as offices or factories, will incur a fee of &#x00A3;92 instead of &#x00A3;76, per 75 square metres of floorspace, and so on throughout the fees scale. The maximum fee in each category with a sliding scale will also be increased pro rata by around 20 per cent. This means that, for example, the maximum fee for a factory or office development will rise from &#x00A3;3,800 to &#x00A3;4,600, and the maximum fee for an application to win or work minerals from &#x00A3;5,700 to &#x00A3;6,900. Slightly lower rates of fee levels will apply in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04833">As I have indicated, the remaining changes we propose to make to the regulations are minor, and amount to little more than clarifying the text of the existing regulations in the light of our further experience of their operation. The Government believe that it is a sound principle that those who use and potentially benefit from specific administrative processes should meet their cost. I believe there can be no doubt that, even after taking into account the increase in fees proposed in the regulations before the House, fees for planning applications will in general continue to be modest in relations to the overall cost of
<col>1112</col>
the development which is the subject of the application. I commend the 1990 regulations to the House. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04834">Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 16th October be approved [<i>27th Report from the Joint Committee, Session 1989&#x2013;90</i>].&#x2014;(<i>Baroness Blatch.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04835">6.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04836"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her exposition of these two regulations. They are not enormously complicated. The issue behind them is still considerably controversial. It is no secret that when fees for planning applications were first introduced in 1981 we on these Benches were not in favour of them. However, a great many things have changed since then, notably the squeeze on local authority expenditure and the introduction of the poll tax. In the light of the experience of government control of local authority finances (because that is the word we must use) over the past eight or nine years, our opposition to fees has diminished to the point of being eliminated.<lb/>
In fact, when the Government state that it is their intention to increase the fee level to cover 100 per cent. of local authority costs over a period of years, I would go so far as to say that we are not proposing to object to that change. However, there are difficulties which should not be passed over in silence. Even with these regulations there have been protests which have no doubt gone directly to the Government from such bodies as the Federation of Master Builders which fears that an increase of 20 per cent. in application fees in another burden for the building and construction industry at a time when it is being hit harder by recession than at almost any time I can remember.<lb/>
We must take these concerns seriously and recognise that when the construction industry is in the parlous state which now affects it, there is a case for tempering the wind to the shorn lamb. We must also consider whether it is right to continue to increase fees when the planning system itself is still subject to legal constraints which make it more expensive than it should otherwise be. However, I am pleased that these regulations are coming forward in the week when we have been considering the Planning and Compensation Bill which the Minister will acknowledge we broadly welcome.<lb/>
The improvements especially in the enforcement proceedings proposed in that Bill will go some way towards increasing the efficiency of the planning system. Those improvements should enable local planning authorities to cut some costs and therefore decrease the figure which will be arrived at ultimately when 100 per cent. of the costs of applications is covered by fees. These are difficult matters. They are not issues about which anyone can be wholehearted. If the Government take our approval for these increases in planning application fees as general approval for a move towards a fee-based local authority service, they would be quite wrong. That is not our intention. It is not something that we wish to see. The universal provision of most local authority services is a prize for
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0596"/>
<col>1113</col>
which we would fight hard. Planning application fees, coming as they do from those who have specific economic reasons for using local authority time, are a different matter. In this case we think it is proper that these regulations should proceed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04837"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord for his comments and his conversion to the recovery of costs scheme. I note his reluctance and the reasons why he takes that view. The noble Lord spoke about the parlous state of the construction industry and the difficulties that it is having at this time. We are talking about the costs being met only when application is being submitted. We are talking about the part of the construction industry which is still in work and managing to submit applications.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04838"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must say that is a bit rich&#x0021; One of the reasons why there will be fewer applications for planning permission is that the total costs of construction are greater. Those costs include, even though to a small extent, the costs of planning applications. The Minister cannot get away with a policy of divide and rule concerning the construction industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04839"><member>Baroness Blatch</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note what the noble Lord has said. I was saying that costs are only awarded when an application is made. We are talking about that part of the construction industry which is still submitting applications. We all wish that the construction industry was more buoyant at the moment. The noble Lord mentioned the degrees by which we are increasing the fees and that it was done specifically in order to help the construction industry.<lb/>
I agree with the point he made that there is downward pressure on the local authorities to improve the planning system. The Planning and Compensation Bill will help a little in that respect. The more efficient the planning system itself becomes the less money that we shall need to recover from those who present planning applications. The Government are always ready to receive any suggestions for improvements to the fees scheme although we would prefer to avoid making it more complex. As I have said, we are considering ways of simplifying the scheme. I hope that sensible ideas to improve the fees scheme will continue to come to us from all those with an interest in the planning system.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Merchant Shipping (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Order 1990</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04845">6.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04846"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 12th November be approved [<i>1st Report from the Joint Committee</i>].</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04847">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order amends the Merchant Shipping (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Order 1987, which enabled regulations to be made to give effect to Annex II to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973. The order will empower the Secretary of State to amend these regulations so as to incorporate updated requirements which have been adopted by the International Maritime Organisation. It will also empower the Secretary of State to make regulations to give effect to Annex III to the convention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04848">I should perhaps explain that the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships&#x2014;better known as the MARPOL Convention&#x2014;is the principal international instrument for controlling pollution from ships. It contains five annexes dealing with oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, packaged dangerous goods, sewage and garbage. It is revised by the International Maritime Organisation as the circumstances dictate, and this enables its provisions to keep up with newer practices and reflect current public concerns. The convention commands wide international support and it is only through its regulations that we can improve the cleanliness of the seas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04849">Annex II to the MARPOL Convention sets out the measures for preventing the pollution of the sea from noxious liquid substances in bulk. It categorises these substances into four groups according to their potential for pollution, prescribing for each category how it should be controlled and monitored. The list of substances is continuously assessed by internationally recognised experts and, in the light of discussion in the International Maritime Organisation, the severity rating of some substances is altered and new substances are added to the list.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04850">Annex III to the convention deals with the prevention of pollution by marine pollutants carried in packaged form. It has been decided by the International Maritime Organisation that for convenience and good order Annex III should be implemented by incorporation into the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code. This code was
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0597"/>
<col>1115</col>
developed for substances which are dangerous, rather than for pollutants. But the general precautions that need to be observed&#x2014;whether a substance is dangerous or is a pollutant&#x2014;are the same and indeed in transporting these substances on board ship the trade does not differentiate between the two. A completely new edition of the code has therefore been developed by the International Maritime Organisation which now incorporates pollutants and applies to them for the first time requirements on packaging, marking and labelling, documentation, stowage and segregation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04851">Annex III, though ratified by the United Kingdom as long ago as 27th May 1986, is not in force internationally because the number of ratifications by member governments of the International Maritime Organisation is just short of that necessary to bring it into effect. The delay is a cause for concern. The International Maritime Organisation has urged member states to implement the annex in advance of it coming into force internationally and Ministers at tending the North Sea Conference in March of this year agreed to give effect to the new edition of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code by 1st January 1991.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04852">Regulations made under this order are being prepared to give effect to Annex III. They will incorporate broadly the same duties and responsibilities as are to be found in the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Regulations. They will include a variety of ancillary provisions and will apply not only to ships registered in the United Kingdom but also to foreign ships while they are in the United Kingdom's territorial waters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04853">I feel sure that the House will appreciate the need for this order, which is intended to help make cleaner the seas and oceans around the world. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04854">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 12th November be approved [<i>1st Report from the Joint Committee</i>] &#x2014;(<i>Lord Brabazon of Tara.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04855"><member>Lord Clinton-Davis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for the manner in which he introduced the order. I welcome the order very much, although one notes with some concern the dilatory process of the entry into force of so many international agreements in this field. Usually such agreements are motivated by a disaster. How much preferable it would be if the international community began to anticipate environmental problems rather than simply react to them in a costly way later on.<lb/>
It has, of course, been through the International Maritime Organisation that substantial progress has been made in developing international efforts to prevent pollution of the sea from oil. But marine casualties like the "Torrey Canyon", the "Argo Merchant" and the "Amoco Cadiz" have played a major role in improving international regimes to control oil pollution. More recently the "Exxon Valdez" catastrophe on 24th March 1989, with its resultant disastrous oil spill, focused worldwide
<col>1116</col>
attention on the massive resources required to combat a large spill, particularly in a sensitive and sometimes hostile environment.<lb/>
We are talking in a sense of a package that arises under the MARPOL convention. An exception to the delays has occurred this very day. I understand that the plenary session of the International Conference on Oil Preparedness and Response at the International Maritime Organisation adopted a convention which, when it comes into operation, will fill a major gap in the international framework of treaties dealing with marine pollution. That in itself is one of the annexes to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. By IMO standards it is something of a record that some 90 governments participated in the conference leading to the adoption of the convention. It was only in October 1989 that the IMO assembly adopted a resolution directing the IMO to convene an international conference on the issue. It is remarkable that the convention has emerged in just over a year. It would be a great example to others as well as being in the best interests of the United Kingdom if the Minister could indicate today that the Government propose to ratify the convention as rapidly as possible, so helping to facilitate its swift implementation.<lb/>
Having said that, the customary situation is to wait for years to see conventions of this kind secure the necessary number of signatures and ratifications to bring them into effect. And having hailed the fact that today there seems to be something quite different, one has to remember that it was in 1973 that MARPOL was hailed as a signal achievement, regulating as it did for the very first time all aspects of ship generated pollution. Notwithstanding that, some of the five annexes, including Annexes II and III on which this order is based, are not yet in force internationally. That is a matter for great regret. Consequently, I wish to take this opportunity to stress that the United Kingdom and our European Community partners need to continue to exercise considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries to ratify IMO conventions far more expeditiously. I wonder whether the Minister would like to say a word or two about that.<lb/>
As a result of the slowness in preparing for diplomatic conferences which are designed to adopt international law, and with the further delay which always follows in relation to their entry into force, the international community should not blind itself to the principal causes of marine pollution. These are much less ship based and much more land based. We support wholeheartedly the powerful efforts that have been made by the IMO over so many years to regulate various aspects of vessel-source pollution. Indeed, as a Minister, I was a great admirer of the IMO and have continued to be so since. We need to recognise that worldwide pollution from that source accounts for only about 10 per cent. of maritime pollution. The figure comes from a report by the Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution, which brings together scientists from the United Nations and various United Nations agencies.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0598"/>
<col>1117</col>
The fact remains that there is little in international law that attempts to redress the problem of land based sources of pollution. The report asserts that a wide range of land activities, either directly or via rivers and the atmosphere, contribute far more than sea-borne activities. Pollution is not confined to the Continental Shelf. Coastal waters are most at risk from the destruction of habitats, microbial contamination of seafood and beaches and, indeed, from fouling in general. That makes it clear that we need to try to encourage much greater respect for quick action by the IMO and by other environmental organisations. We can only proceed on the basis of international co-operation in facing so many of these problems.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will put full force behind securing such objectives. Important through the order is&#x2014;and it is important&#x2014;it must be viewed against the wider perspectives which I have raised. It is to be hoped that the Government will use their best endeavours. I join the Minister in commending the order to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04856"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, for welcoming the order. I too welcome the conclusions of the oil pollution preparedness and response conference. We shall of course have to study and consult on the convention and naturally we shall ratify it as soon as possible if it is seen as desirable to do so. As I said in my opening remarks, we have a very good record in ratifying IMO conventions.<lb/>
In talking about this particular MARPOL convention, I believe that the noble Lord said that Annex II is not yet in force. If my assumption is correct, I must point out to him that he is mistaken. That annex came into force in 1987. Annex III which is also dealt with by the order is, however, not yet in force. We hope that it soon will be. It has at present been ratified by 40 states but has not yet achieved the 50 per cent. tonnage which is required. I understand that legislative time is being urgently sought in the United States and that if that is successful it would be sufficient to overcome the impediment of ratification. I hope, therefore, that we shall see the annex coming into force before very long. I agree with the noble Lord that we need to make further progress. We shall of course continue to do so.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Charities: European Policy</title>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04858">6.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04859"><member>The Earl of kinnoull</member> rose To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps are being taken to ensure that charities in Britain will be able to play a full role in Europe and that a unified policy is adopted not only in the European Community but also including a wider Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04860">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the Business of the House today has covered a good range of subjects and perhaps charities is a worthy subject with which to conclude. I am most grateful to those who have
<col>1118</col>
indicated their intention to take part in the debate this evening. There is first the noble Lord, Lord Meston, whose father I believe was a strong charitable man, and we shall also hear from the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder, whose charitable work has few equals; her husband's work may match hers, but very few other people can equal her great success in the field. The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, will also be speaking on the subject. She will be giving her second performance today. I am sure it will prove to a <i>tour de force.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04861">I am sure too that my noble friend will understand that, although the Question on the Order Paper may look obtuse, it has a very real relevance as we approach 1992. The British charitable movement is one of the proudest cultural jewels which we bring to the European table. No one needs reminding of how the farsighted and generous businessman of the early Tudor days set up trusts for the poor and needy, and indeed for education, and how those trusts were enshrined in the statute of Queen Elizabeth I in 1601; nor of how today our charities range from local and national organisations to the great international charities, from the mighty Oxfam and the very successful Save the Children Fund to the medical bodies whose researchers carry out such great work. There is also the work carried out in animal welfare, which forms a very active section of charitable activity all over the world. All these need to raise huge sums of money annually from generous individuals, from companies and of course from institutions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04862">No one in the House needs reminding that the charities in Britain are among the biggest gross businesses or industries which we have. I believe that 165,000 new charities were registered last year&#x2014;some, of course, giving a certain sense of duplication. However, all are administered with care and efficiency by the Charity Commission, which is a small dedicated body of civil servants with little more than 400 people to carry out its work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04863">One may perhaps ask what is the fuss and purpose behind the Question. It has nothing to do with the White Paper on charities which was published by the Government a few years ago, because that did not mention Europe. I find that fact somewhat amazing and worrying. The purpose underlying the Question is that as we approach 1992 there is developing in Brussels a dangerous back of awareness about how the charitable system in Britain works. That is mainly because 10 of the 12 countries of the Community have a much narrower system. Therefore, any proposals to harmonise charities in Europe could prove harmful to the system in this country unless more is done to explain the British case and indeed our system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04864">There are two recent examples which will perhaps illustrate the point that I am trying to make. They cause small pinpricks of worry, but those worries are genuine. There was a case involving teddy bears. For many years they were hand made by volunteers for small charities and they created a most valuable income. However, a directive issued by the Community effectively put a stop to that kind of income and to such endeavours. There was also the
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0599"/>
<col>1119</col>
case of the minibus. This is a vital source of transport to charities which help the handicapped and the elderly. Again, new rules issued by the Commission meant that drivers were apparently not competent to work for charities and so yet another considerable problem was caused. Those are small problems but I believe they ring warning bells about what will happen when the commissioners seek to harmonise&#x2014;to use that terrible word&#x2014;charities in Europe in 1992.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04865">As I tried to explain, there is a large gap between what charities stand for in the 10 countries of the Community and what they stand for in Britain and Ireland. The British system, with its legal framework, its vigour and its inventiveness, is admired in Europe by those who know what it achieves. I believe that we can bring a great asset to the Community by way of this movement. It could prove to be the Community model. However, to achieve this we need a positive approach from Her Majesty's Government to educate the thinking of the Commission, of the directors general and of the commissioners. But we appear to be running out of time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04866">Certain dangers which have appeared on the horizon have been identified by the Charity Commission. I give praise to the commission and to its able chairman, Mr. Robin Guthrie. The main danger centres around the proposed interpretation of Article 58(2) of the Treaty of Rome. That proposal would give a more narrow interpretation not affecting the 10 member states which could lead to a very large number of large British charities falling outside the umbrella of comfort secured by Section 58, with quite damaging consequences. It could affect such charities as bible societies, museums, fee-paying schools and even the National Trust.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04867">Therefore, what is the European Commission saying about the situation? Herr Heinrich von Moltke of Directorate General XXIII Enterprise Policy, Commerce, Tourism and Social Economy is of course sympathetic. He does not seek to be hostile. He states that the Commission's objective is to include all associations under the <i>Economique Sociale</i> so that they enjoy the benefits of the European single market.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04868">The Commission sees the need to create a new European charitable statute so that a charity can operate anywhere in the Community but be liable to the laws of the parent country. That seems to be an encouraging step forward. When my noble friend replies, perhaps he will tell us whether the Government support that suggestion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04869">The Government need now to take positive action&#x2014;a pro-active policy&#x2014;and a useful start would be to second an expert from London to Brussels to advise the Commission and to help any British charities which seek advice. We should have a booklet, which we do not have at the moment, to explain how the 12 countries operate charities. We should be drafting suitable amendments to the Article 58(2) proposals while they are still at the consultative stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04870">All those actions need to be taken now. I hope that my noble friend's brief is encouraging and positive. The question relates to a wider Europe. I am thinking
<col>1120</col>
of what assistance and support the Council of Europe can give and what role it can play. The secretariat in Strasbourg is keen to promote charity support in a wider Europe beyond the Community. I hope that my noble friend will be able to enlighten us on current government thinking and on whether they will set up discussions with the Council of Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04871">No opportunity should be lost to remind Her Majesty's Government of the acute anxiety felt by charities which benefit from the VAT concession. There is deep concern that with any 1992 harmonisation those concessions may be sacrificed for the sake of achieving a wider goal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04872">My noble friend would do a great service tonight if he were to reaffirm that the Government have no intention of penalising such charities. For example, the RNLI would lose &#x00A3;3 million a year on the concession it enjoys on the purchase of boats, launch equipment and slipways. That of course is only a single charity. There are many more with stronger arguments to make. I hope that my noble friend will use firm and resolute words to remove any lingering doubts on the issue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04873">7.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04874"><member>Lord Meston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is an opportune moment for the Question to be raised. There was nothing obtuse about what the noble Earl said or in his valuable suggestions. It has become a matter of concern that the European Commission is preparing to bring charities&#x2014;that is to say, the non-profit making voluntary sector&#x2014;within the ambit of the Treaty of Rome. I question the appropriateness of bringing British and Irish charities under the unfamiliar regulatory control of what is essentially an economic community.<lb/>
I claim little knowledge of and no expertise in European law, but I am aware, and presume that the Government are aware, that there is a genuine question about the legality of the proposals. Article 58 of the treaty seems clearly to exclude non-profit making organisations. Autonomous British and Irish charities are different creatures from the nearest equivalents elsewhere in Europe, such as the French co-operatives and other institutions which can and do undertake commercial activity for its own sake.<lb/>
To include our charities would seem to depend upon a strained interpretation of Article 58. Given the real doubts about the position, surely the legality should be tested before the European Court before matters go any further. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how far harmonisation measures have gone and whether the Government are concerned about any such measures being prepared in advance of an authoritative judicial interpretation.<lb/>
The Question posed by the noble Earl is expressed in a positive fashion, and he made some positive suggestions. The matters that I have raised may suggest a negative point of view. I do not intend to be insular about this matter. It is for charities themselves to assess the benefits and disadvantages of what is under consideration and of their future in a European context with suitable assistance from central
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0600"/>
<col>1121</col>
government and the Charity Commission. There clearly is concern that the valuable and hard-won VAT relief will be sacrificed to European harmonisation. I end where the noble Earl ended, by asking: what is being done and what can be done to protect the charities' zero-rated concessions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04875">7.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04876"><member>Baroness Ryder of Warsaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am especially grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, for bringing this serious matter to our attention. We are working against the clock because by 1991&#x2013;92 we, the charities in Britain, may find ourselves being told that decisions have already been taken. As your Lordships are aware, Britain and Ireland have the largest number of charities in Europe. Many are unique in what they do and in the countless ways they work to relieve human suffering.<lb/>
We have a long tradition going back over the centuries and we must surely be safeguarded. It is an appalling and frightening thought that we may receive orders from the Commission in Brussels. I refer as an example to VAT on donated gifts sold in the shops that bear my name. The shops aim to keep a high standard of appearance. They have four broad functions: first, to raise desperately needed funds for the foundation's work; secondly, to make better known the needs of the sick and handicapped of all age groups in Britain and overseas; thirdly, to bring together people from all walks of life; and, fourthly, to serve the local community.<lb/>
The shops are the life-blood of the foundation in all aspects of its work, especially as we receive so little in government grants. For instance, it costs over &#x00A3;500 a week to nurse and care for a sick or handicapped individual. The foundation is lucky to receive merely &#x00A3;245 per week per patient on average.<lb/>
I speak with some feeling on the subject, because many other countries have different traditions with charities. They also operate differently. In Germany and, I believe, in Austria, after the Weimar Republic collapsed in Germany and the Nazis took over, all forms of charities were forbidden. Today, in 1990, they have still only five to seven main charities. Their income is from individuals who pay a tax through their pay packets or pensions towards the church charity or one of the other five or six charities. They do not have our tradition of different forms of fund raising. Donations come almost entirely from that tax. That is just one example of how differently we operate here. I know from hard and long experience over 40 years how different and how difficult it is to operate in other European countries.<lb/>
Those of us whose lives are spent in trying to relieve human suffering beg the Minister and the Government to appoint a representative in Brussels as soon as possible. I again stress the urgency, for we as a sovereign state cannot lose all our traditions of giving and running sound charitable foundations. It really could be a disaster for thousands of the sick and handicapped both in Britain and overseas unless suitable action is taken now.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1122</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04877">7.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04878"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all of us&#x2014;and perhaps in particular those of us who have been involved with the voluntary sector and charities for a long time&#x2014;will be extremely grateful to the noble Earl for bringing forward this important subject and putting interesting and pertinent questions to the Government this evening. The noble Earl said clearly how charities in Britain hold an important place in not only the life of the country but also in the culture of the country, and that there is a particular ethos attached to our voluntary sector and to our charities which is really quite different from that to be found in any other country.<lb/>
One has seen how in recent years the work of our voluntary agencies has increased very much as state provision for the needs of certain sectors of society has diminished. At the same time the work of the voluntary sector has tried to replace it. This would be a good opportunity to pay our great respect to the talented and enormously dedicated people who work in Britain in those organisations. Their work is vital to the life of so many people in this country. Therefore obviously any kind of threat to the work of this particular sector is of enormous worry. It is for that reason that the points that the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, and the noble Lord, Lord Meston, have made this evening are of great importance.<lb/>
We have been told that the first major area of concern for charities in Britain is the definition of charities, because our charities fear that moves towards a common definition of charities throughout the EC will result in a much narrower definition than that which we currently enjoy. This is of great concern. The second major area of concern is tax approximation&#x2014;namely, as the noble Earl has said, the fear that the European Commission's proposals for approximation of VAT rates will result in a loss of zero rates. We could give many examples of the difference that this would make to the fortunes of many of our major charities in this country.<lb/>
I should just like to spend a couple of minutes drawing the debate a little more widely, as the noble Earl has included in his Question "a wider Europe". I should like to point out that there are now many more charities seeking to develop a role across the continent, to find partners in other countries, and themselves to operate in other countries. What they need to facilitate this process is a common legal structure. That would enable them to run integrated operations across frontiers, to offset profits and losses in different countries, and to use a single accounting system for all operations.<lb/>
We welcome the ratification by Her Majesty's Government of the Council's convention on the recognition of the legal personality of international NGOs. However, it is generally thought that this does not go far enough, and what many charities, and the NCVO in particular, have requested is the establishment of a common legal structure. Perhaps I might ask the Minister in that connection, and with respect to European cross-border fund raising, whether the proposals that I have suggested are being considered
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0601"/>
<col>1123</col>
by the European Commission. Could the noble Lord say whether organisations based in Britain will be able to apply for grants from other European countries' overseas aid funds? Could he also say whether a charity wishing to raise money in another European Community country would have to register? That would be an important point for them.<lb/>
I should also like to ask one question of the Minister about the know-how fund. I hope that he will not think that I am going outside the debate, but the recent announcement by the Government that the know-how fund is to be increased and extended to new countries in Eastern Europe is welcome. I should like to ask the Minister whether there will be scope, within the provisions of this fund, to assist and advise governments, charities and NGOs in Eastern Europe as to how to establish legal frameworks in which their new charities can best operate. Also, can the know-how fund be extended to cover the social provision work of new charities and voluntary organisations operating in Eastern Europe? Of course they often operate in partnership with British charities.<lb/>
After all, there are many people in those countries who would like to play their part in the social reconstruction of the countries of Eastern Europe. There is little doubt that this is critically needed, and surely this is an area in which Britain can help. Britain is extremely experienced in how to structure and set up charitable organisations, and this could well be done through the know-how fund.<lb/>
My last point relates again to a European fund which is close and helpful to our voluntary organisations, and that is the European Social Fund. The objective of this fund is to increase training places in the United Kingdom, and the Commission has recognised the special ability of the United Kingdom voluntary sector in delivering the kind of training that the fund seeks to promote. Therefore, our agencies have been very successful in acquiring funds from the European Social Fund. Indeed, the British voluntary sector receives some &#x00A3;18 million from the European Social Fund, which comprises over 7.5 per cent. of the total United Kingdom budget. As I say, it is spent on vital training work, including transnational training exchanges.<lb/>
However, it is the role of the Department of Employment to co-ordinate British applications, and unfortunately the Department has been doing this in a dilatory fashion, which has endangered the effectiveness of the scheme. For example, when the Commission handled co-ordination the voluntary organisations were notified by April. Now that the Department of Employment handles it, voluntary organisations are not receiving funding notifications. This has created a great funding crisis for many providers of training, and some may be forced to close down their operations. Would the Minister undertake to make changes in the European Social Fund unit in the Department of Employment to ensure that delays do not occur next year?<lb/>
There is little doubt that we are fortunate in this country in possessing such a vibrant and wholly
<col>1124</col>
professional voluntary sector, and it is an area in which we could take the lead in Europe. The noble Baroness, Lady Ryder, spoke with a voice of great authority in this debate and, as other noble Lords and the noble Baroness have said, I believe that it is important for the Government to make sure that any harmonisation should be to the level of the best possible practice. Although I am not usually a great nationalist, I believe that our practice in this country is at a very high level.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04879">7.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04880"><member>Lord Reay</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, developments in Europe offer the charitable and voluntary sector in this country a challenge. There are opportunities but there are also hazards. The Question which my noble friend has brought before us this evening affords us a most welcome chance to take a look at this challenge.<lb/>
The system of charities which has grown up in this country is unique and much prized. I agree with the noble Baroness on that point. As my noble friend told us, we have a charity system of considerable scope. It has been estimated that the turnover of the charitable sector amounts to about &#x00A3;15 billion.<lb/>
Charities are bodies whose property and income must be entirely applied for public benefit and under their constitutions no part of their funds may be distributed for private or personal purposes. Their trustees receive no personal benefit from them. Charitable property receives special protection from the law.<lb/>
The Government make a considerable contribution to the well-being of charities. Charitable status brings with it substantial tax benefit. The Charity Commission protects and assists charities.<lb/>
The word "charity" has a narrower meaning in other European states. It tends to be confined to bodies whose purposes are the relief of poverty and distress. There are of course bodies corresponding to the range of our charities doing comparable good in other European countries but their structure is different.<lb/>
The creation of a single market in Europe has prompted the European Commission to consider how the benefits of the removal of barriers to trade may be extended to bodies in the voluntary and charitable sector. It has considered how obstacles to voluntary and charitable bodies that wish to operate in other member states may be removed. The charitable sector will, I have no doubt, learn from a greater involvement in Europe. I am equally sure that Europe can learn from the best elements of our arrangements.<lb/>
We know that some charities are alive to these opportunities; indeed my noble friend participated in the seminar which the Charity Commission recently held on developments in Europe which was attended by a large number of representatives of government departments, charities and voluntary bodies.<lb/>
However, the fact that charities are unique to this country means that their position under European Community law needs to be carefully protected. At present the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act do not cover charities
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0602"/>
<col>1125</col>
specifically. There is some discussion in Brussels about the possibility of creating a statute to cover the voluntary sector. This would include our charities. Bringing voluntary bodies under Community law in this way may be a good way of facilitating operations by charities and voluntary bodies in other member states. However, it would need to protect their special position. The development of a statute is at a very early stage and thus far no specific proposals have emerged. But I can assure noble Lords that Her Majesty's Government are keeping a close watch on developments.<lb/>
We have taken account of the position of charities in the context of another European Commission proposal to bring charities into the sphere of Community law; that is, a proposal to interpret Article 58 of the Treaty of Rome in such a way as to bring the charitable and voluntary sectors within the scope of Community law.<lb/>
Several noble Lords referred to Article 58. That has hitherto been understood as excluding from Community law all non-profit making organisations. The Commission's proposed interpretation would exclude only those bodies not engaged in economic activity; that is only a small number of UK charities. We do not think that this is the best way to preserve the role of charities. Community law drawn up along the lines of such an interpretation may not be compatible with our charity law. We have resisted and shall continue to resist that interpretation. However, discussion on possible interpretations is still under way. We shall, of course, maintain a close involvement in that discussion.<lb/>
We do not believe that the European Commission has any current legislative proposals in mind which would have an undesirable effect on United Kingdom charities. But charities may in the future be exposed to the possibility of legislation which may inhibit activities in pursuit of their objects, albeit that this may be unintentional. We are discussing this with the Commission at the moment. The Commission is, because of our representations, coming to realise that the charitable sector here should be distinctively recognised by, if necessary, special provision. The voluntary sector here and equally in other member states has distinctive qualities which, if they are to be effective, should be recognised by special provision.<lb/>
We have sought also to protect our charities' position in the face of other proposals from the Commission which affect charities indirectly. We have for example worked to protect the favourable VAT position of charities and we have corrected the EC directive on driving licences to preserve the valuable role played by voluntary minibus drivers. My noble friend referred to that matter.<lb/>
My noble friend's Question goes wider, however, than the European Community. I know that he plays a valuable role in the UK delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe brings the European nations together on a broader basis than the Community. In particular it provides a context in which contacts with
<col>1126</col>
Eastern European countries can be developed. The Council of Europe is not a law making body in the same way as the European Community, but its function in developing common standards and principles is invaluable.<lb/>
British charities are not, of course, dependent on government in order to participate in Europe. There are indeed a number of networks bringing together charities and voluntary bodies in Europe to help them co-operate at a European level. This co-operation involves a desire to exchange ideas with European counterparts and has also underlined the need for the voluntary sector to be better informed as to developments in Community law. Perhaps I might mention one such network, the European Committee of General-Interest Associations, CEDAG for short. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations, NCVO, here is actively involved in this developing voice in Brussels. Indeed the NCVO representative is one of the vice-presidents of CEDAG.<lb/>
Finally, I wish to acknowledge the developing role which British charities are playing in Eastern Europe. One well publicised example of that is the contribution to the Romanian orphanages. Another example has been the assistance given to the victims of the Armenian earthquake. In our view a flourishing voluntary sector is important to the development of a pluralist democracy and a market economy. However, we should not forget that we are looking at societies that are involved in great change which have their own ideas and their own traditions and to whom we can offer valuable assistance and insights.<lb/>
A voluntary sector, in the sense we understand it, cannot be imposed from without, or conjured up from within. But what we can do, and what individual organisations in the UK are already doing, is to share knowledge, advice and expertise to help develop an infrastructure for the voluntary sector in Eastern Europe.<lb/>
I shall try to reply to some of the questions that were put to me. My noble friend Lord Kinnoull and the noble Lord, Lord Meston, asked about VAT. I can reassure noble Lords that we intend to protect the zero rate for charities where charities enjoy it today. I was asked whether we would consider sending an expert to Brussels to help charities in their relations with Brussels and to establish a contact with the Commission. We have a permanent representative's office in Brussels which represents our interests. However, on this specific matter we have been invited by the Commission to consider taking the step I have mentioned. We are looking for a suitable person who might enable us to take up this proposal.<lb/>
My noble friend asked whether we would produce a booklet to show our charities how charities operate in the different member countries of the EC. We would be happy to consider that step in consultation with the charities' organisations which make up the European groupings. I cannot promise that we shall do this as it has resource implications, but we are happy to consider it. My noble friend also asked whether we would conduct discussions with the Council of Europe with a view to the council becoming some kind of
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0603"/>
<col>1127</col>
focus for charities in their involvement outside the Community. That is what I understood by my noble friend's comments. We would be perfectly happy to discuss that with the relevant organ of the Council of Europe.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, asked about the know-how fund. The know-how fund does not include the voluntary sector in its remit and is obliged to concentrate on priority sectors agreed with the Eastern European governments concerned, namely, those of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia so far. The noble Baroness asked other questions but, if I may, I should like to write to her with the answers.<lb/>
In conclusion, I am grateful for my noble friend's reminder that we must not be parochial in considering
<col>1128</col>
the interests of charities and that charities themselves should be prepared to look towards the opportunities that are on offer in Europe. The Government are engaged in active dialogue with the European Commission, as I indicated, to ensure that the special position of our charities is preserved. That will enable them to play their full role in Europe. We also watch with interest developments further afield. Although it is perhaps too soon to speak of a unified policy for a wider Europe, it is not too soon to confirm that we are working to ensure that our experience of charity law in the United Kingdom is made known to our fellow Europeans.</membercontribution></p>

<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04891"><member>Baroness Cox</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04892">What was the outcome of the meeting of the European Community Transport Council on 30th October.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04893"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member>: My honourable friend the Minister of State for Public Transport attended the meeting of the European Council of Transport Ministers which was held in Luxembourg on 30th October.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04894">Most of the items considered by the Council concerned inland transport. The Council discussed the recent disputes affecting certain border crossings and the transit negotiations with third countries (Austria, Switzerland and Yugoslavia). It also discussed measures to be taken in the event of a crisis in the road haulage sector and an increase in the Community quotas of road haulage permits but did not come to any firm decisions on these two items. They will be discussed again at the December Transport Council. The Council did agree, however, that the Commission should be given a mandate, in consultation with the member states, to negotiate with non-EC countries on the alignment of the drivers hours' rules in the Community and AETR (the European Agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport). The Council also agreed a resolution on setting up high level group to study the prospects for a European combined transport network.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04895">At the June Transport Council, member states had reached agreement in principle on an <i>ad hoc</i> three-year programme for EC transport infrastructure funding until the end of 1992. Some points, however, had remained outstanding, and the Council on 30th October made good progress towards resolving these. It now seems likely that the proposal will be finally adopted shortly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04896">The Council reached a general agreement on the text of a report to the European Council concerning the memorandum produced by the Netherlands entitled <i>A Transport Policy for Europe.</i> The report welcomed the objective reaffirmed by the memorandum, that an internal market in the transport sector should be achieved between now and 1st January 1993, and set out the Council's view of the lines along which Community transport policy should be developed. The Council also discussed fiscal harmonisation and the length of road trains, without coming to agreement on either topic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04897">Under Other Business my honourable friend raised the issue of airport slot allocations and stressed the Government's concern that the Commission's proposed block exemption regulation was premature in creating new policy in this area in view of the fact that
<col>WA 6</col>
in the near future the Council was due to consider another Commission proposal on common rules for slot allocations. Other issues also briefly discussed included the aviation negotiations with Norway and Sweden and the nationality clause in air services agreements.</p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04899">Whether in view of the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky TV they propose to amend the revised planning controls over satellite television antennas that they announced on 1st November.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04900"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member>: Clearly, the position on satellite dishes has changed with the recently announced merger of BSB and Sky Television and the proposed adoption of the Astra satellite broadcasting system. My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales will therefore be reviewing the proposed changes to the General Development Order in the light of developments.</p>

<title>SERPLAN STATEMENT: REGIONAL PLANNING FOR THE SOUTH EAST</title>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04901"><member>Lord Norrie</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04902">What action it proposes to take on the advice given to the Secretary of State for the Environment by the London and South East Regional Planning Conference (SERPLAN) in its regional statement <i>A New Strategy for the South East.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04903"><member>Baroness Blatch</member>: We welcome SERPLAN's regional statement, which is an important step towards developing new regional planning guidance for the South East. The existing regional guidance is set out in the Department of the Environment's Planning Policy Guidance Note No. 9 of February 1989. Such guidance is intended to provide a framework for the preparation of structure plans by county councils. The Government will now review the existing guidance in the light of SERPLAN's statement. We will also take account of any relevant views expressed by other persons or organisations. Those wishing their views to be taken into account should send them to the Department of the Environment by the end of 1990. To assist consideration of the issues concerned, the Department of the Environment will be holding a conference early in 1991 at which invited parties will be able to express their views. We will later publish&#x2014;for consultation&#x2014;draft regional planning guidance for the South East.</p>

<title>LITTER AND REFUSE: CODE OF PRACTICE</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04904"><member>Baroness Cox</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04905">When they propose to issue the code of practice on litter and refuse foreshadowed in Part IV of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0607"/>
<col>WA 7</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04906"><member>Baroness Blatch</member>: My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has today laid before Parliament the statutory code of practice on litter and refuse envisaged in Section 89(7) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. A copy is being sent to all local authorities and other interested bodies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04907">Part IV of the Environmental Protection Act underpins the Government's drive to tackle the serious problem of litter, which scars our towns and our countryside. The Act places a duty on local authorities and certain other bodies throughout Great Britain to keep land clear of litter and refuse. We intend that the duty will apply to local authorities and the Crown from 1st April 1991; there will be certain transitional provisions in relation to authorities which have already let street cleaning contracts under the Local Government Act 1988. We will shortly be making an announcement about the other bodies to which we propose that the duty should apply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04908">The Act also increases the maximum fine for littering from &#x00A3;400 to &#x00A3;1,000, and gives powers to local authorities to introduce fixed penalty schemes, to designate litter control areas and to issue street litter control notices.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04909">The code of practice is another important part of our war against litter. It is designed to give practical guidance to local authorities and other bodies which will be covered by the litter duty. It was drawn up with the help of an advisory group containing experts from local authorities and other organisations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04910">The code breaks new ground in its approach to litter clearance. For the first time, it sets out standards of cleanliness which should be achievable in different types of location under different circumstances. This</p>

<title>FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL, 12TH NOVEMBER</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04924"><member>Lord Mancroft</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04925">What was the outcome of the Foreign Affairs Council held on 12th November.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04926"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member>: The Foreign Affairs Council met in Brussels on 12th November. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs represented the United Kingdom. Ministers discussed the Iraq-Kuwait crisis and reaffirmed their determination to bring about the release of all hostages in Iraq and Kuwait, the refusal of their governments to negotiate with Iraq and their condemnation of Iraqi treatment of hostages. They agreed to give the highest priority to the role of the United Nations and to continue to put pressure on Iraq to receive the Secretary-General's special representative. They agreed a UK proposal to make demarches to a large number of countries and groups of countries to convince them to pursue these same aims in contacts with the Iraqis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04927">The council discussed the proposed EC-US and EC-Canada declarations and asked the Commission and presidency to continue to work with the Americans and Canadians to achieve agreed texts to be exchanged in the margins of the Paris CSCE Summit. The council had an initial discussion of the draft negotiating mandates for Association Agreements with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The United Kingdom looks forward to early detailed examination of the mandates with a view to their approval this year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04928">The council reviewed policy towards Asia and Latin America and noted that the programme for the 1990s would be considered by a special development council later in the year. The council discussed again the Commission's proposals for a new Mediterranean policy, which were remitted for further detailed work. Finally, the council discussed progress in the Community's negotiations with EFTA for the creation of a European economic area. The United Kingdom called for renewed EC efforts to maintain the momentum of the negotiations through a constructive approach to outstanding issues.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04929">In the margins of the Council, Ministers held an informal meeting with Foreign Ministers of the Arab Maghreb Union. The meeting discussed a wide range of political and economic topics of mutual interest including the development of EC/AMU relations and the Gulf Crisis. On behalf of the Twelve the EC Presidency urged the AMU to join in exerting pressure on Iraq to accept the UN Secretary-General's envoy and to release all hostages.</p>

<title>BATHING WATER QUALITY: SURVEY</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04936"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04937">What progress has been made in improving the quality of bathing waters, and when they expect all bathing waters to meet the standard in the EC Bathing Water Directive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04938"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member>: Provisional results for the survey carried out during the 1990 bathing season showed that 77 per cent. of the 446 identified bathing waters in the United Kingdom met the mandatory coliform bacteria standards of the EC Bathing Water Directive. This compares with 76 per cent. of the 440 identified bathing waters in 1989.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04939">Although this maintains the steady improvement of recent years, we believe that more urgent action is required to bring all of our bathing waters up to the highest standards. Last March my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment announced that in future all substantial discharges of sewage to sea should be treated at a sewage treatment works. The estimated cost of this was &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 billion. We are now able to announce that following discussions with the water companies in England and Wales, they have agreed to provide additional treatment for around 40 improvement schemes at an estimated cost of around &#x00A3;600 million over the next five years. This
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0611"/>
<col>WA 15</col>
is on top of the &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;4 billion bathing water compliance programme announced last year, which the companies have also agreed to advance where possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04940">This means that bathing waters will be improved sooner, and for many discharges the standard of treatment provided will be better than previously planned. Our aim is to complete the improvement programme for all bathing waters that presently fail to comply with the EC standards by 1995, though present indications are that this may not be practicable for nine large schemes where there are major technical difficulties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04941">The 1990 results for the United Kingdom are set out below in summary form. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment shall arrange for a more detailed summary of the results to be placed in the Library shortly, and we shall also be sending the results to the Commission of the European Communities.</p>

<title>STREET CLEANING: TENDERING</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04945"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04946">What response they have received from local authorities to their decision to postpone competitive tendering deadlines to enable the authorities affected to let their street cleaning contracts on the basis of the proposed code of practice on litter; and what consideration they have given to this response.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04947"><member>Baroness Blatch</member>: We have received a number of submissions from local authorities about our decision to extend competition deadlines for street cleaning. In particular, it has been drawn to our attention that authorities whose work has until 1st April 1991 fallen outside the provisions of the Local Government Act 1988 because expenditure incurred has fallen below &#x00A3;100,000 per annum are in a similar position to those authorities announced by my honourable friend the Minister for Local Government on 20th July in another place who have already been granted an extension. We therefore intend to substitute a later deadline of 1st August 1991 for all authorities whose street cleaning work is required to be submitted to competition by 1st April 1991. We shall make an order giving effect to this intention. My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales will make similar arrangements for Scottish and Welsh authorities.</p>

<title>EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENTS: OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04954"><member>Lord Denning</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04955">Following the Answer of the Lord Chancellor on 31st October 1990 [H.L. Deb., col. 1891] whether the phrase "voluntary school" in section 112(3) (a) of the Education Reform Act 1988 extends to voluntary schools anywhere in England and Wales or is limited to voluntary schools generally in the diocese, or is limited to voluntary schools in the area of benefit of the endowment concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04956"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member>: The phrase voluntary schools is not qualified. The primary purpose behind an order made under Section 2 of the Education Act 1973 (as amended by Section 112(3) (a) of the Education Reform Act 1988) is to make new provision for educational endowments with a view to enabling the denomination concerned to participate more effectively in the administration of the statutory system of public education. The Secretary of State could accordingly make an order under that section making new provision for the use of those
<col>WA 18</col>
endowments for appropriate educational purposes in connection with voluntary schools throughout England and Wales. In practice the denomination concerned is the Church of England and Section 2(2) of the Education Act 1973 provides that an order shall not be made "except on the application of the persons appearing to the Secretary of State to be the appropriate authority of the denomination concerned". This is invariably the relevant diocesan authority and it follows that the application will relate to the use of the endowment for other Church of England voluntary schools in that diocese.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04957"><member>Lord Denning</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04958">Following the Answer of the Lord Chancellor on 31st October 1990 [H.L. Deb., col. 1891] whether Section 2(4) of the Education Act 1973 is narrowed by the opening words making it "subject to any provision affecting the endowments of any public General Act of Parliament" and whether those words make it subject to Section II of the Endowed Schools Act 1869 or to Section 13(4) of the Charities Act 1960, which limit the area of benefit of a local charity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04959"><member>Baroness Blatch</member>: An order under Section 2 of the Education Act 1973 making new provision for the use of an educational endowment is indeed subject to any provision affecting the endowment of any public general Act of Parliament. To that extent therefore the application of Section 2 is narrowed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04960">Section 11 of the Endowed Schools Act 1869 was repealed by the Education Act 1973.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04961">Section 13(4) of the Charities Act 1960 is not relevant here because there is no question of applying property cy-pr&#x00E8;s. Furthermore, Section 13(4) does not operate so as to prevent the area of benefit of a charity from being extended. The power under Section 13(4) is, for example, without prejudice to the general jurisdiction of the courts and the charity commissioners to make schemes expanding the area of benefit of charities to the extent necessary to permit the property to be suitably and effectively applied in a manner consistent with its original trusts.</p>

<title>FISHING VESSEL LICENSING CONDITIONS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04962"><member>The Earl of Kimberley</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04963">What changes are proposed to the conditions attached to fishing licences, in the light of the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the <i>Agegate</i> and <i>Jaderow</i> cases.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04964"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Baroness Trumpington)</member>: The <i>Agegate</i> and <i>Jaderow</i> proceedings were originally commenced against the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1986 in order to challenge the validity of the fish licensing conditions designed to procure the proper implementation of the quota system under the common fisheries policy. In the course of those proceedings our courts referred certain legal questions to the European Court of Justice. The
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0613"/>
<col>WA 19</col>
European Court of Justice delivered its judgments on 14th December 1989 and the matter is to return to the English Divisional Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04965">The ECJ judgments cast doubt on the validity of the crewing condition in its present form but upheld our right to have an operating condition provided that certain rights were respected. We have been considering what changes need to be made to our licence conditions in the light of these judgments. At present we are minded to tighten up the operating condition in order to improve compliance and to make enforcement easier. This will probably entail conditions such as the following applying to all vessels which do not land at least half of their annual catch in the United Kingdom:
<ol>
<li>(i) they will make at least four visits to United Kingdom ports in each half year (January-June and July-December);</li>
<li>(ii) vessels to give at least 24 hours' notice of each visit, and to stay in port for at least 8 hours; and</li>
<li>(iii) there should be a minimum period of 10 days between "qualifying visits".</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04966">The licence condition concerning the natinality and residence of crew members would probably be dropped, except in respect of non-EC nationals, as might the condition concerning social security payments (since this is covered elsewhere by Community law and the obligation to pay social security continues irrespective of whether there is a licence condition to that effect).</p>
<col>WA 20</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04967">These changes would have important implications for the <i>Agegate</i> and <i>Jaderow</i> cases and we have discussed them at their request with representatives of the Spanish fishing industry, who have indicated that they accept that we were entitled to ensure that there is a real economic link between their vessels and the British fishing industry and to impose an effective operating condition. They have also indicated their intention to employ at least two British crewmen on their vessels, in addition to the British skipper and mate, and to land fish in British ports on at least two occasions in each half year. These discussions are very encouraging.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04968">The registration requirements in respect of fishing vessels contained in Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 will, subject to the interim orders of the European Court and this House, continue in force. This means, in particular, that fishing vessels may only be registered here&#x2014;and thus fish against British quotas&#x2014;if each vessel is managed, and its operations are directed and controlled from within the United Kingdom. The cases in the European Court challenging the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 will be vigorously contested by the Government. An oral hearing will take place at the European Court on 17th January 1991.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04969">Fisheries departments will in due course be issuing a detailed notice about the new licence conditions and licences will be amended with effect from 1st January 1991. These amended conditions would contribute towards the objective of ensuring that British licensed fishing vessels have a real link with this country.</p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04972"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Baroness Blatch)</member>: Clauses 47 and 49 (Home loss payments) are to have effect in relation to displacements occurring on or after 16th November 1990. However, no sum will be payable by virtue of these clauses until one month after they come into force (which under Clause 55 will be on a date to be appointed by order after the Bill receives Royal Assent). Clauses 25(2) and 42(2) provide for the repeal of Section 114 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Section 158 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 (compensation for planning decisions restricting development other than new development). Clauses 25(5) and 42(5) provide that these repeals shall have effect, or be treated as having effect, where the application for planning permission was made on or after 16th November 1990.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04973">Clauses 25(3) and 42(3) provide for the repeal of Section 27 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and Section 160 the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 (compensation for refusal of consent to alteration, etc. of listed building). Under Clauses 25(6) and 42(5) these repeals shall have effect, or be treated as having effect, where the application for listed building consent was made on or after 16th November 1990. Schedule 5 provides, inter alia, for consequential amendments of Section 15 of the Land Compensation Act 1961, Section 5 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 and Section 107(4) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to have effect as specified from 16th November 1990.</p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-04984"><member>Baroness Hooper</member>: Remarkable advances continue to be made in the means of diagnosing and assessing risk for single gene disorders, chromosome and malformation syndromes and in procedures for fetal diagnosis, for example by more precise ultrasound imaging and the introduction of chorionic villus sampling.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-04985">Genetic services are generally co-ordinated through regional clinical genetic centres and are available to all health districts.

collected centrally by the department. The department, however, is aware that every region has a clinical genetics centre and at least one clinical geneticist. Health districts in Wales and health boards in Scotland and Northern Ireland also determine their own allocations to genetic services. In addition central funds have been allocated to the Scottish Molecular Genetics Consortium (&#x00A3;290,954 in 1990&#x2013;91 and &#x00A3;278,158 in 1989&#x2013;90) and the Institute of Medical Genetics at the University Hospital of Wales (&#x00A3;291,000 capital and &#x00A3;504,000 revenue in 1990&#x2013;91 compared with &#x00A3;80,000 capital and &#x00A3;398,000 revenue in 1989&#x2013;90). In Northern Ireland in 1989&#x2013;90 an additional &#x00A3;55,000 was allocated to convert research activity into a fully operational routine laboratory service to improve genetic counselling.

<p id="S5LV0523P0-05019"><member>Viscount Dilhorne</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05020">What steps have been taken by the Lord Chancellor to nominate judiciary to deal with child care cases in the higher courts under the Children Act 1989, and whether the locations at which these hearings will take place have been determined.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05021"><member>The Lord Chancellor (Lord Mackay of Clashfern)</member>: The Children Act 1989 is due to be implemented on 14th October 1991. Central to the philosophy of the Act is the principle that children's cases in the higher courts should be heard by judiciary who, by reason of their experience and training, are specialists in family work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05022">Under the Courts and Legal Services Act, the Lord Chancellor will have the power to nominate such judiciary, with the concurrence of the President of the Family Division. The nomination process is expected to extend over a period of months but as a first step I

have today, with the approval of the Right Honourable Sir Stephen Brown, President of the Family Division, named 47 circuit judges who will be known as "designated family judges". This group of judges will be based at the network of county court "care centres" and will have the primary responsibility for hearing the child care cases transferred to those centres from the magistrates' courts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05023">Each centre will also provide the focus for a local implementation committee which will be chaired by the designated family judge and which will play a major role in developing implementation plans based on local circumstances. It is envisaged that these committees will begin their work well before October 1991.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05024">The locations of the "care centres", which were announced on 2nd August, have been confirmed following widespread consultation with justices' clerks, local authorities and other interest groups.

<p id="S5LV0523P0-05028"><member>Lord Cavendish of Furness</member>: Under guidelines established in 1979, Her Majesty's Government expect oil companies exporting crude oil from the United Kingdom continental shelf to do so in the markets of member countries of the European Community and International Energy Agency and those countries where there is an established pattern of trade with the United Kingdom. The Government are keen to see the freeing of trade with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union across a wide range of sectors.

<p id="S5LV0523P0-05035"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Baroness Hooper)</member>: NHS dentistry has not been underfunded since 1980.

<p id="S5LV0523P0-05036">The new contract has attracted over 5&#x00B7;5 million patients in England and Wales in the first seven weeks and the British Dental Association has carried out a survey which concludes that "the public should have no difficulty in finding an NHS dentist in any part of the country".</p>

<title>DISCONTINUED VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS: DISPOSAL OF ENDOWMENTS</title>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-05074">Whether a diocesan authority can make an application under Section 2 of the Education Act 1973 in respect of a closed voluntary school where the premises have been sold unlawfully by the diocesan authority itself or by other unknown persons without an order under Section 29 of the Charities Act 1960 or Section 2(3) of the Education Act 1973.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05075"><member>Baroness Blatch</member>: Diocesan authorities may make application under Section 2 of the Education Act 1973 in respect of the endowments of any discontinued voluntary school which can be shown to have been held or used for or in connection with the provision at the school of religious education in accordance with the tenets of the religious denomination in question.
<col>WA 38</col>
Such applications may relate to the school site and premises or the proceeds of sale of such land and property.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05076">Where an application relates to land and property, orders under Section 2 of the 1973 Act provide authority to sell in accordance with subsection (3). Where proceeds of sale are involved, the Secretary of State seeks to establish whether the premises were sold &#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a) by authority of the Charity Commissioners under the Charities Act 1960 or</li>
<li>(b) in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 14 of the School Sites Act 1841 or</li>

<title>AIRPORT CAPACITY: WORKING GROUP</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05078"><member>Lord Gainford</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05079">What further steps have been taken towards identifying possible locations for additional runway capacity to serve the South East, following the publication by the Civil Aviation Authority in CAP 570 of advice on the adequacy of airport capacity in the longer term.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05080"><member>Viscount Davidson</member>: My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport announced in July his intention to establish a working group to examine the wider implications of development at airports identified by the Civil Aviation Authority in CAP 570 as likely to be able in air traffic control terms to accommodate additional air traffic. Work has since been going forward on the group's terms of reference, structure and membership.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05081">We have concluded that the terms of reference for the group should be:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05082">"To evaluate the wider implications of developing additional runway capacity at the sites identified by the Civil Aviation Authority in CAP 570 as likely to be feasible for such development in air traffic control and airspace terms;</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05083">"To have regard to the considerations, including the environmental considerations, which led the Government in 1985 to the view that second runways should not be built at either Gatwick or Stansted; and to the relevance of those considerations at Heathrow and at other airports;</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05084">"To test the authority's conclusions in CAP 570 on the contribution of regional airports, and to gauge the extent to which these airports can play a part in meeting the overall demand into the next century;</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05085">"And in the light of these considerations to advise the Secretary of State on the possible courses".</p>
<image src="S5LV0523P0I0623"/>
<col>WA 39</col>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05086">We intend that the group should be chaired by a senior official from our department, and that it should be assisted by four subgroups addressing, for each of the locations identified in CAP 570, the implications for regional development and the environment; for aircraft noise; for surface access; and capital costs, lead times and other practical and technical considerations. The first of these subgroups will be chaired by the Department of the Environment, the second and third by the Department of Transport and the last by the CAA.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05087">Invitations to join the working group or one of its subgroups have today been sent to a variety of organisations. We have asked SERPLAN to co-ordinate the local authority input, and have also sought the involvement of the Kent Economic Development Board. To represent the interests of airports we have issued invitations to the Airport Operators Association, BAA plc and the Joint Airports Committee of Local Authorities. We have in particular asked JACOLA to take the lead in assessing the contribution of regional airports. The International Air Transport Association, the International Air Carrier Association and the British Air Transport Association have been invited to represent airlines.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05088">We have asked the Association of British Travel Agents, the British Tourist Authority and the Air Transport Users Committee to represent, respectively, the interests of the travel and tourism industries and of consumers of air services (passenger and cargo).</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05089">To ensure a thorough examination of the important environmental implications of airport development, we have extended invitations to a number of bodies and organisations. These are the Federation of Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups; the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign, the North-West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association; and the Airfield Environment Federation. We have also invited the participation of the chairmen of the consultative committees at each of the airports in question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05090">The local management of the different airports have been asked to contribute to the work of the airport technical subgroup, and British Rail and London Regional Transport have been invited to join the subgroup which will consider surface access. Finally, the working group will involve officials from the CAA and from the trade and industry, employment, defence and agriculture departments, as well as from the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05091">We are confident that the expertise of those we have invited will enable the group to engage fully with the many issues it will address. Inevitably, it has not been possible to offer places to all of those wishing to participate. We hope that many of those not included will be able to put views forward through the various representative organisations on the group. We also intend to initiate shortly a wider, written consultation, to ensure the group has access to the views of others
<col>WA 40</col>
with an interest in the issues. The results of this consultation will be an important contribution to the group's work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05092">Once we have heard from those invited to join the group, arrangements can go forward for the first of the meetings. We expect this to take place early next year.</p>

<p id="S5LV0523P0-05112"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member>: The position is as follows:
<ol>
<li>(a) The Scottish Law Commission's report on Child Abduction confined its recommendations to Scotland, but recognised that the problems involved required a Great Britain approach, which is currently under consideration.</li>
<col>WA 42</col>
<li>(b) The recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission's report on Legal Capacity and Responsibility of Minors and Pupils were accepted by the Government and were expressed in the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Bill, introduced as a Private Member's Bill with Government support in the House of Commons in 1989. The Bill failed to obtain a Second Reading.</li>
<li>(c) The Government are giving favourable consideration to the Scottish Law Commission's report on Civil Liability&#x2014;Contribution.</li>
<li>(d) The Government have carried out a public consultation on the recommendations in the report on Prescription and Limitation of Actions (Latent Damage and Other Related Issues). The responses received are now being analysed.</li>

<title>AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR RENT:<lb/> LEGISLATIVE REVIEW</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05150"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05151">What action they propose to take to improve the availability of agricultural land to rent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05152"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Baroness Trumpington)</member>: The Government believe that the tenanted sector is an important element in a healthy agricultural industry but it is clear that the current legislation is hindering the supply of land to rent. In discussions with the main interested organisations all have recognised the need for change. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food therefore intends to issue a consultative paper in the New Year with a view to securing a lasting and effective change without prejudice to the position of existing tenants.</p>

<title>MOTORWAY WIDENING PROJECTS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05153"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05154">When the planned widening to four lanes of (i) the M.1 from the M.25 up to the M.18; (ii) the M.25, where it does not already have four lanes; and (iii) the M.6 between the junction with the M.1 and Manchester will start and how long this will take.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05155"><member>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member>: Plans for widening these motorways have not yet reached a stage where firm dates can be given for the start and completion of the works involved. Widening can be done by a number of methods for which the time required for planning and building will vary, depending on the scale of civil engineering work involved and on whether more land needs to be acquired. The best choice of widening method will depend on local circumstances and detailed investigations to identify the most appropriate methods are still in progress or planned to start shortly.</p>

<title>PARKING METER REVENUE</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05156"><member>Lord Simon of Glaisdale</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05157">What has been the annual income from parking meters since the inception of the scheme, and how much money has been spent each year on the provision of off-street parking over the same period.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05158"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member>: Information is not collected centrally which distinguishes either between revenue from on-street parking meters and off-street car parks, or between expenditure on the provision of off-street car parking as opposed to on-street parking. Figures available show that, in aggregate, local authority parking revenue currently amounts to over &#x00A3;300 million a year in England. Surplus on-street revenue can only be applied for further parking provision or for highways or public transport purposes.</p>

<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (PROMOTION OF<lb/> ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT) REGULATIONS<lb/> 1990</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05168"><member>Lord Lyell</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05169">Whether they have received any representations about the Local Government (Promotion of Economic Development) Regulations 1990.</p>
<p id="S5LV0523P0-05170"><member>Baroness Blatch</member>: The Association of District Councils and a number of individual councils have argued that it would be sufficient if local authorities which are not education authorities consulted their local education authority about the programmes of education and training which they provide for economic development purposes. We have accepted this, and the Department of the Environment is consulting the local authority associations on draft regulations to replace the current requirement to obtain the consent of the local education authority to those programmes with a requirement to consult the local education authority. The draft regulations also make it clear that the new economic development power is not intended to change the rules on the disposal of land at less then the best consideration reasonably obtainable.</p>

Table 1 shows year by year information for each authority during the years 1979&#x2013;80 to 1985&#x2013;86.
