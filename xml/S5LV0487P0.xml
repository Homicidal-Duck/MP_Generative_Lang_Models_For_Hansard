<title>Hospital Building Programme</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00293"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what progress is being made with the hospital building programme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00294"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the largest ever sustained health building programme continues to gain momentum. Information held centrally shows that there are currently over 450 building schemes, each costing over &#x00A3;1 million, at various stages of planning design and construction. The total value of the programme is estimated at &#x00A3;3.26 billion and it will provide over 24,000 new hospital beds. This compares with a programme of 380 schemes, with an estimated total value of &#x00A3;2.84 billion, reported last October.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00295"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that very encouraging answer. Can he comment on whether damages, defects and delays are causing slippage in the programme?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00296"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to say that, although all the problems can never be eliminated in such complex construction projects, the situation is much improved. There has been a marked improvement in the completion of schemes both in terms of cost and time. A sample of 36 completed schemes has indicated an average cost overrun of about 1.7 per cent., or about &#x00A3;100,000, and a time overrun of about 4 per cent., or six weeks. That compared with averages respectively of 11.6 per cent. and 29.7 per cent. for a similar sample of pre-1980 schemes.</membercontribution></p>
<col>2</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00297"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord assure us that the building programme is not being carried out at the expense of smaller hospitals, some of which have been either shut or had beds removed, which are greatly valued by local communities and badly needed for the community care that we have increasingly to provide?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00298"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness will not be surprised that I am unable to give a specific answer to her question. She is well aware that we are committed to an expanding and successful National Health Service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00299"><member>Lord Taylor of Blackburn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister ask his right honourable friend to take a leaf out of the book of the Secretary of State for Education and Science who is announcing today that he no longer intends to close small schools? Perhaps he will ask him not to close small hospitals in the same way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00300"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that that is slightly wide of the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00301"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the hospital building programme is doing as jolly well as the Minister says it is, why is the number of beds available to NHS patients now 10,000 fewer than it was eight years ago? Why is it that, except for two periods of industrial action, hospital waiting lists are longer than ever before&#x2014;devastatingly and cruelly long?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00302"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for the record, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 35,000 from 1974 to 1979&#x2014;the period of the last Labour Government&#x2014;and has been reduced by a further 36,000 since then. The reduction results from the replacement of inefficient and obsolete hospital stock, usually built in the 19th century, by modern hospitals which are more economical to run and provide a better health care environment for patients and more productive working conditions for staff. The facts speak for themselves. The numbers of in-patient treatments has increased by 18 per cent. since 1978, from 5.3 million to 6.3 million. The number of day case treatments has increased by 71 per cent., from 562,000 to 969,000. Out-patient treatments have
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0010"/>
<col>3</col>
increased by 10 per cent., from 33 million to 37 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00303"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we all welcome a programme to build hospitals. However, it is pointless to build hospitals if we do not have the staff to operate them. There should be a vast range of staff in every modern hospital. Does the Minister agree that in the past there has been a deleterious effect on the staffing of hospitals? Does he agree that it is essential to put that right so that hospitals that are to be built will be properly staffed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00304"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question on the Order Paper concerns the hospital building programme and not staffing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00305"><member>Lord Auckland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those are impressive figures. However, is my noble friend aware that there are some new hospital wards that have not been opened due to staff shortages and that in existing hospitals there are too many wards not in use due to such shortages?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00306"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am here to answer a specific Question rather than to comment on questions which are not on the Order Paper today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00307"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the Minister can respond concerning what he himself said. Why does he insist on giving figures for new patients, either day patients or in-patients, when he does not know such figures but only the number of admissions? Does he accept that the figures which he keeps giving are simply not based on the facts in any way whatsoever?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00308"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not come to the Dispatch Box if I believed that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00309"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has just read out the Government's manifesto for the National Health Service. Will he now be good enough to give us the date of the general election?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00310"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: Not without notice, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00311"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister referred to some small hospitals as being inefficient. Perhaps he will reconsider that statement. There may be criticism on grounds of cost-effectiveness. However, some of us who have used small hospitals resent the use of the word "inefficient".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00312"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not use the word "inefficient" with regard to small hospitals; I used it in relation to old and obsolete hospitals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00313"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend tell the House how the hospital building programme is being funded? Is it possible for proceeds from local sales within a regional health authority to be credited towards a particular scheme?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00314"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, capital spending on the National Health Service has increased in real terms every year since 1979. This year, when income from
<col>4</col>
sales of land and property no longer required for the health service is taken into account (health authorities being able to retain that money) capital investment in the National Health Service will amount to nearly &#x00A3;1,000 million.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Missing Persons: Search Procedure</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00315">2.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00316"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will confirm that 500 adults in the United Kingdom have been missing for more than five years in circumstances which give concern for their safety; and whether they will draw to the attention of all chief constables the 1979 recommendation of the Council of Europe on the search for missing persons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00317"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. Over 500 adults in the United Kingdom have been missing for more than five years, but not all of these are in circumstances which give concern for their safety. New Scotland Yard missing persons bureau is aware of the 1979 recommendations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00318"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that Answer and for previous Answers to Written Questions. Is he aware that these recommendations appear to be unknown to the police generally? Two friends of mine suffered a great tragedy when their daughter disappeared seven years ago&#x2014;she has never reappeared&#x2014;but they have no complaints against the police at Eastbourne where the tragedy occurred. However, on looking into the matter they discovered that there is no generality of understanding or general policy operating in police forces in different parts of the country. As we are a party to these recommendations, and as they lay down specific procedures to be followed, it is suggested, not only in this country but in Europe generally, would it be a good idea at least to make police forces aware of the recommendations, especially as they are so complicated and so detailed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00319"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said to the noble Lord not only today but in Written Answers, the police forces are aware of the recommendations. But it would be wrong for me to comment on the individual case that the noble Lord mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00320"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that tribute should be paid to the Salvation Army for the absolutely excellent bureau which it runs for tracing people, particularly children, who have disappeared?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00321"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join my noble friend in paying tribute to the Salvation Army. Indeed I pay tribute not only to the police and Salvation Army but to all in the DHSS and others who contribute on this front.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0011"/>
<col>5</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00322"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nevertheless, will the noble Earl be good enough to discuss this matter within his department in order to see if some general procedure can be adopted? I believe he will discover, on looking into the matter again, that it would be much more satisfactory not only to the police forces, but also to the Salvation Army, if some general procedure could be adopted which operated throughout the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00323"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the matter is kept continually under review in the Home Office.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Investment: Protection of Public</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00324">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00325"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they propose to prevent members of the public (and especially Lords) being bombarded with requests to invest in or subscribe to a variety of dubious schemes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00326"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Lucas of Chilworth)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I assume that the noble Lord has in mind advertising by direct mail of financial and business opportunities. On that assumption I have to tell the noble Lord that the Government have no plans to restrict this sort of advertising generally, although there are now arrangements by which people can quickly and easily have their names deleted from the many mailing lists in existence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00327"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that Answer. I hope he will not mind, however, if I say that I find it a little disappointing. Members of your Lordships' House in receipt almost daily, certainly weekly, of applications to subscribe to a variety of very doubtful schemes may be in a position to judge the merits of such schemes. Less informed members of the public may not be in such a position. Does the Minister agree, on second thoughts, that further consideration should be given to this matter in order to protect less cautious members of the public?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00328"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's Question dealt with the abundance of direct mail, rather than with that which was dubious. if he will advise me of the matters which he considers dubious, I may then be able to give consideration to them and see whether any fall within the general framework of legislation which currently exists as regards advertising.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00329"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend help your Lordships and others by distinguishing between the dubious schemes referred to in the Question and the equally dubious ones embodied in Alliance propaganda?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00330"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend raises a very different issue. It depends on how these matters are put before the recipients.</membercontribution></p>
<col>6</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00331"><member>Lord Barnett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister care to give us his definition of "dubious schemes", drawing perhaps on his experience of government schemes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00332"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is nothing dubious about any of the government schemes, all of which have borne fruit to the benefit of all those concerned. I can think of only one dubious scheme which is well outside the Government's realm, namely, pyramid selling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00333"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that in addition to many dubious schemes involving the sale of time-sharing weeks, many thousands of unsophisticated first-time investors are being inveigled by direct mail shots into buying single-premium bonds, which happen to be much less tax-efficient for the majority of investors than, for example, investing in unit trusts, particularly in view of this year's Budget? Is he further aware that this happens mainly because of the very high commissions which can be obtained by pushing such investment bonds?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00334"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Monson, raises two issues. On the issue of timesharing, I draw the attention of noble Lords and others to the leaflet <i>Your place in the Sun</i> which has been produced by my department. This gives warnings with regard to time-sharing.<lb/>
On the noble Lord's other point, I shall look forward with anticipation to the noble Lord raising that when we discuss the SIB designation authority later this month, when I shall be able to give him a rather fuller response.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00335"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord&#x2014;and perhaps other noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter&#x2014;agree that we should get on rather more swiftly if we deferred blatant electioneering, at least until we know the date of the election?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00336"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not noticed any great blatancy on election matters this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00337"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord be prepared to discuss with his noble friends the possibility of introducing legislation to forbid local authorities from selling their electoral registers? That enables any kind of organisation to distribute widely circulars which most of us would much prefer to be without.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00338"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, raised two points. First, it has always been considered, certainly in company law, that the lists of the owners of companies should be open to everybody. That applies equally to local authorities. It would be quite wrong to deny people the opportunity of knowing who owns what and who is listed on an electoral role.<lb/>
I do not think that the noble Lord's second point applies to this Question.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0012"/>
<col>7</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00339"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely this Question is all about rubbish. Is this not one of the reasons why the wastepaper basket was invented?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00340"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I look across the Benches opposite but I do not see the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, here this afternoon. He posed a very similar question in February to that now put to me. On that occasion I agreed with him, as I do now with the noble Lord opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00341"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord satisfied that the law as it stands&#x2014;I refer to the Financial Services Act&#x2014;gives proper protection to those people in receipt of direct mail for schemes, dubious or otherwise, so that they are not unnecessarily taken in?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00342"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, will have been studying very carefully the published draft rules of the SIB, and no doubt he will soon address a number of questions to me. I shall then be in a better position to answer him specifically on the point he raised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00343"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister was good enough to ask me whether I am aware of any dubious schemes. In the hope that he will consider prosecutions in appropriate cases, may I ask him whether he is aware that I have in my hands a letter sent to me at my home address appealing in a most barefaced manner for a subscription to a fund? All it says is:
<quote>"You have my promise that whatever you give will be put to good use."</quote>
It is signed by a chap called Norman Tebbit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00344"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not had an invitation to subscribe to a good-use cause. If the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, will let me know about that I shall be pleased to look into it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00345"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords referring to the dubious scheme just mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, will the Minister say whether those endeavours to get people to subscribe to the Conservative Party are classified as an electoral expense of Mr. Norman Tebbit?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00346"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, stretches the principles of your Lordships' House. I said earlier (did I not?) that it is a long-established practice of company law that the public have a right to know who owns registered companies. Therefore anyone may obtain a company's share listing, including members of the Opposition, to use in any way they wish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00347"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has got it wrong. The request was to make a contribution to the Conservative Party and had nothing to do with a company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00348"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00349"><member>Lord Maud of Stratford-Upon-Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that as a matter of history there
<col>8</col>
is nothing new in what the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, refers to? It is on record that at the time of the South Sea Bubble a notice was issued which stated:
<quote>"A profitable enterprise, but nobody to know what it is".</quote>
</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00350"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend draws upon a better knowledge of history than I have. All I can say&#x2014;and I am quite serious in this&#x2014;is that there are a number of statutes which forbid the issue through the mail of a variety of pieces of information. The Government have taken strong note of breaches of the practice, as have all governments.</membercontribution></p>

<title>House Insulation</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00351">2.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00352"><member>Viscount Hanworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they propose to introduce a major programme to provide finance for the insulation of existing housing stock, in view of their agreement on the cost-effectiveness of such action (H.L. Debates 16th March, col. 1307).</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00353"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government plan to continue their present policy of providing financial assistance for some insulation measures and targeting this on those most in need. Housing authorities can determine their own priorities for insulation within the financial resources for housing available to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00354"><member>Viscount Hanworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I take it that there is no major programme for the insulation of existing housing stock. Does the noble Baroness agree that if there were such a programme it might well save us another power station in the future? As the Government have already said, insulation is highly cost-effective. Therefore why do they not promote it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00355"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we welcome the effects of home insulation. Indeed, the take-up under the existing scheme is very satisfactory. Results from the survey carried out by Audits of Great Britain indicate that only 13 per cent. of private dwellings with loft spaces now have no insulation. Our aim is now to target help on those who most need it&#x2014;that is, those on housing benefit and supplementary benefit&#x2014;and it is therefore much more sensible to increase the amount available to those in real need rather than pay out a smaller amount to many who could afford it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00356"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the Minister agree, bearing in mind that our future energy resources will consist for the foreseeable future of well over 50 per cent. from finite resources, that it makes sense to preserve and harness those resources on an ever-increasing scale? Taking that into account, will the Minister plead with the Secretary of State to reverse the present policy of making grants available to a diminishing number of people&#x2014;not classes, but numbers&#x2014;and implement a substantially expanding programme which will be to the benefit of the nation and to all concerned?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0013"/>
<col>9</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00357"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the new targets for the scheme are intended to help more people at a lower level. The calculations which have been undertaken lead us to believe that this will increase substantially the number of homes with insulation. As the noble Lord knows, there are three different departments involved in these schemes. In terms of energy efficiency and the projects brought forward during that period, the Department of Energy has played, and is playing, a vital role.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00358"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister must be aware that this Question is only a rehash of a similar Question which I tabled some weeks ago. The figures that the Government give of grants to an increasing number of people is strongly challenged and resisted by people involved in the industry. They say that when the Government's present proposals are implemented there will be a considerable reduction in the number of households that can apply for the grant. I do not believe that the people involved in the industry are wrong. The Government would do well to look once again at the policies they intend to pursue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00359"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am only too well aware that we have had previous Questions, and indeed a full debate, on the topic. I can only go on the figures that are available to the Government, which we believe are correct.</membercontribution></p>

<title>British Railways (Stansted) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00360">3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00361">Read a third time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00362"><member>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Aberdare)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill do now pass.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill do now pass&#x2014;(<i>The Chairman of Committees</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00363"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no wish to oppose the passing of this Bill but I should like to make a number of brief comments before the House sends it on its way. In November 1985 British Rail submitted to the Government, a proposal to construct a rail link to Stansted Airport. On 24th February 1986 the British Railways (Stansted) Bill came before another place. Despite government support the Bill was talked out and failed to secure a Second Reading. As noble Lords will recall from questions asked repeatedly in this House, dates for resuming the adjournment debate kept appearing and disappearing on the Order Paper of another place.<lb/>
At last the adjourned debate of 24th February reached the Floor of another place on 3rd June. Even then, on 3rd June, considerable dissatisfaction was expressed by Members from all sides that after such a long delay, and when so many Members still wished to speak, a closure Motion was moved after one hour's discussion. On 24th July I was informed by written parliamentary answer that the Government had approved a rail link to Stansted Airport.<lb/>
Finally, in the sequence of events, on 29th October and 3rd November the other place asked this House to
<col>10</col>
concur in a carry-over Motion that the British Railways (Stansted) Bill should be proceeded with in the next Session of Parliament. On 5th February this year the Bill received its Third Reading in another place and was passed.<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like to explain why I have spoken today. I gave considerable thought to whether or not I should oppose the Bill when it came before the House on Second Reading on 25th February this year. In the event I decided against doing so because further delay would have helped nobody. On that day your Lordships sent the Bill to an Unopposed Bill Committee, from which it has now returned.<lb/>
This has been an unhappy Bill. It is not well drafted and has been subject to much criticism from all sides in another place. It was not only Members from the North who were critical. There were constant reminders to the effect that in 1985 half a million passengers flew from Stansted but 5 million flew from Manchester. Members of Parliament asked why it should be commercially viable to serve 500,000 passengers but not 5 million passengers. The feeling persisted that the Government were all eagerness about Stansted and all hesitation about the proposed link to Manchester airport.<lb/>
As the House will be aware, I have many reservations concerning the size of the present development envisaged for Stansted and the procedures that I have tried to describe today have added to those reservations. Whatever excuses relating to Private Members' Bills are put forward by the Government, there is no doubt that they have suffered considerable embarrassment over this long drawn-out saga of the British Railways (Stansted) Bill. However, equally it is obvious that if Stansted is to succeed it is essential that a rail link be provided. I hope that it will be a satisfactory one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00364"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Baroness, I have no wish to delay the House over this Bill but I hope that your Lordships will give it their full support. Noble Lords will recall that I too was a little critical about the type of development at Stansted, but since the development envisages dealing with 8 million passengers per annum, a rail link is absolutely essential.<lb/>
First of all, it is essential for the convenience of air passengers and, secondly, it is necessary from the environmental point of view because it will reduce the possibility of over-development of roads in this charming area of Essex, about which I have spoken before.<lb/>
There are two questions that I should like to put. Will there be careful attention given to the possible overloading of the Cambridge-London line? British Rail will have a spur extension from that main line and I should like to be assured that it will be watched very carefully to ensure that there is an adequate passenger service. Secondly, the Bill provides for the temporary stopping up of certain footpaths and bridleways. I can understand that; but will careful attention he paid to ensuring that it is reduced to the very minimum and that when the time comes for their replacement, should that prove impossible, alternative footpaths and bridleways will be provided?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0014"/>
<col>11</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00365"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps it would be appropriate for me to indicate the Government's support for this Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Burton, has made a couple of points about its rather tortuous passage through another place. Of course that is not a matter that I can deal with this afternoon.<lb/>
She also raised the point about the rail link to Manchester airport and asked why that has not been approved in the same way as has this Bill. We treat each case on its merits and should be happy to approve the Manchester line if the case can be made for it. But we are still considering the recent grant application and officials from the Department of Transport are discussing this matter with the Passenger Transport Authority and the airport. Details have still to be resolved but we shall approve the application if the case is robust.<lb/>
In our view the Stansted link stands on its own merits. It would be highly profitable even for an airport with a capacity of 7 million to 8 million passengers a year. It will relieve congestion on the motorways and local roads to Stansted and the extra rail traffic can be accommodated within the planned capacity of the railway line to Liverpool Street, about which the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, made a point. British Railways believe that they can cater for the increased traffic within existing plans for rebuilding Liverpool Street Station without cutting the quality or overloading the trains.<lb/>
I am afraid that at the moment I cannot comment on the noble Lord's other point about footpaths and bridleways being stopped up by the proposals in the Bill. However, I have taken that on board and perhaps I may be able to write to him. I have already said enough to indicate that the Government welcome this Bill. It will bring significant advantages to British Rail and to Stansted Airport when the proposed expansion there goes ahead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00366"><member>The Chairman of Committees</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think I need make further comment on the matters of concern in respect of this Bill, but perhaps I may assure the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, that his remarks will be conveyed to the British Railways Board.<lb/>
On Question, Bill passed, and returned to the Commons with amendments.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00411">Clause 16 [<i>Registration appeals</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00412"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 151:
<quote>Page 15, line 15, leave out from ("have") to end of line 16 and insert ("allowed the request")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00413">The noble Lord said: My Lords, Clause 16 deals with registration appeals. Registration means that one is liable for the personal community charge, which may be anything up to &#x00A3;300 at the present time, or for the standard community charge&#x2014;that is the second home charge&#x2014;which will be anything between one and two times the personal community charge. It is important in relation to the efficiency and fairness of the whole matter that the register be accurate. In dealing with appeals, we have these surprising words:
<quote>"Where a person requests the registration officer to make or amend an entry in the register relating to him and the registration officer fails to notify the person of the determination of the request within such period as may be prescribed, he shall be deemed to have refused the request".</quote></p>
<col>14</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00414">That is a bit much is it not, my Lords? One asks an official to amend or change some entry in the register applying to oneself; the registrar does nothing; and, after a certain time, he is deemed to have refused one's request.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00415">The position should be the other way round. If the register is concerned about the accuracy of his register, he should take steps right away to get in touch with the person and make a decision. Indeed, if he does not do so timeously, he should be deemed to have allowed the request.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00416">I know this makes it a little more difficult for the registrar. Although convenient for the registrar that he should be allowed to forget about an application and by doing nothing, thus refuse it, that is not fair. This amendment would correct the situation with regard to the rights of the individual. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00417"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said in Committee, this amendment&#x2014;which was also discussed then&#x2014;challenges the logic, the fairness, or both, of providing that if the registration officer has failed to give a determination on a request to make or amend the register entry he shall be deemed to have refused it and that an appeal shall then lie to the sheriff against that deemed refusal. The logic of the amendment would turn this presumption on its head and deem it that the registration officer had allowed the request. However, there is a very simple objection to that approach. The provision would not of itself achieve anything since, unless a change were made in the entry, the register would remain in its original condition and the individual's liability for the charge would be governed accordingly. Therefore, even if it were thought attractive to use this mechanism to provide an incentive to registration officers to give their determinations promptly, the amendment of the noble Lord would not work.<lb/>
At Committee stage, it was suggested that the provision in the Bill would in some sense protect the registration officer. That is not the case. The registration officer will be required to notify the person who has requested an amendment of his determination of that request within a prescribed period which we envisage as being no longer than a month. As I said then, we have no reason to suppose that registration officers will fail to give determinations timeously in the vast majority of cases.<lb/>
However, there has to be some presumption in order to protect the position of the person who has made the request about what should happen if, by any chance, the registration officer does not respond within that period. As I said, a presumption that the request should be taken to be granted would have no practical effect since it is only the registration officer who can amend the register. Where the registration officer has not responded to the request therefore, it must be assumed that there is some difficulty in the case which requires the appeal mechanism to be triggered. The deemed refusal is simply a device to achieve that end. It is a safeguard for the individual and in no way for the registration officer.<lb/>
The logic of the approach which provides for appeal against a deemed refusal makes good, straightforward sense, and I must hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00418"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the explanation is anything but straightforward. It does anything but make sense. The registration officer would know that if he did not comply with the request by a certain time then he would have to allow it. There is no gap in amending the register. However, it is obvious that the Government are not going to make any change in this respect. I am anxious to save time. We do not have a lot of time.

<quote>Page 16, line 13, leave out ("has") and insert ("may have").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00424">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a rather strange measure in relation to obtaining information. We give very considerable powers to the registration officer. We protect him in many ways. At page 16, line 13, the Bill is very mandatory. It states:
<quote>"Subject to subsection (4) below, the registration officer may require the regional or islands council or any district council in his registration area, to supply him with such information as he may reasonably require".</quote>
It may be information that the council does not have. The presumption is that he is applying for information that is there.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00425">My next two amendments, which should be taken together, are to say that the councils can give the information only if they have it. It is commonsense. We are not saying that they shall give information, only to discover thereafter that they do not have it. I therefore put in the words "may have"; and later on instead of "comply" I propose that they shall "if they have the information" provide it. It is sensible drafting. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00426"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fully appreciate that the intention behind the amendments is to make it clear that registration officers can require from registration officers of other registration areas or of local authorities within their own area only such information as these other authorities actually hold. I can give the noble Lord an unequivocal assurance on that point. Local authorities and other registration officers will in no case be required to collect information which they would not otherwise collect. The provision allows the registration officer to acquire access only to information which these authorities actually have. As a matter of drafting the present provisions are quite clear. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment which the noble Lord proposes.<lb/>
However, Amendment No. 154A, which I thought we agreed would be spoken to with these amendments, I am prepared to take separately if that is what the noble Lord wishes.</membercontribution></p>

<col>16</col>
is rather stupid to have a mandatory phrase such as they "shall comply with such a requirement". They may be asking for information which the regional or islands council does not have.

<quote>Page 16, line 16, at end insert ("except where such information as requested has been acquired previously on a voluntary and confidential basis").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00431">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am glad that this amendment is being taken separately. I raised the matter at Committee stage and the reply I received from the Minister was not totally reassuring, particularly to some of the officers of Strathclyde Regional Council. As I said then, the Strathclyde Regional Council and other councils have been making voluntary population surveys which include information about age, status, occupation, etc. of the people in the region to help in forward planning. But the data were collected specifically on the strict understanding that they would be confidential and would not be divulged for any other purpose.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00432">As I said, again at Committee stage, the council was required because of the Data Protection Act to register the holding of this information and the purposes for which it was obtained. I am sure the Government would not wish an organisation such as Strathclyde Regional Council or any other region not to gather information to facilitate the planning of schools, housing and various other functions that they have to carry out. They believe that if they are to collect information of real value it must be gathered on a confidential basis. They know that the information will be able to be collected more easily from citizens if it is collected confidentially.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00433">The idea that they must divulge information to the registration officer would jeopardise that, and they would be breaking the law, having made a promise that it would not be divulged and having had to divulge it. I hope that the Minister, having dealt with it last time and having seen the amendment on the Marshalled List, will have a more satisfactory answer for the officers of some of the Scottish regions and particularly Strathclyde. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00434"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fully appreciate the concern which has been expressed on this point. Again, I must say that I think it is unnecessary. The information which registration officers will require for checking purposes will usually be simply lists of names and addresses. Where any question of confidentiality may arise, however, it will be possible under Clause 17(4) to prescribe information which should not be made available to registration officers under the clause. We have already undertaken that confidential information held by social work departments or the police should be prescribed under that power.<lb/>
I shall consider very carefully the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. It is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0017"/>
<col>17</col>
certainly not our intention that confidential information should be made available under these provisions. I hope that in the light of that further reassurance the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00437"><member>Lord Morton of Shuna</member> moved Amendment No. 155:
<quote>Page 16, line 33, leave out paragraph (c).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00438">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to leave out Clause 17(6)(c), which deals with responsible persons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00439">The phrase "responsible person" means,
<quote>"(a) &#x2026; the owner or &#x2026; a tenant"</quote>
where they occupy the premises, or,
<quote>"(b) &#x2026;where the premises are not occupied by the owner or by a tenant &#x2026; for a period of 12 months or more".</quote>
and then,
<quote>"(C) in any case"</quote>
not in any other case, but in any case at all,
<quote>"such other person as the registration officer considers it appropriate to designate, any district council, or any housing body as the responsible person".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00440">The duties on the responsible person are, as I understand it, to tell the registration authority who is living in the house. How on earth that duty can be landed on a district council or on a housing body which is not basically interested in who is living in the house, but who is liable to pay the rent of the house or otherwise pay for occupying the house, seems to me quite absurd. It is odd that these obligations should land on a district council, a housing body or anybody else who does not appear to be the person in the house. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00441"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be helpful if I quickly run over the arrangements provided for by this clause to ensure that there will be a responsible person to provide information about the residence in each set of premises. In the vast majority of cases it will be obvious who the responsible person should be. He will be the present rateable occupier or, in the old-fashioned phrase in the Green Paper which has been much criticised, the head of household. He will therefore usually be the owner-occupier or tenant-occupier as provided for in Clause 17(6)(a), but there may be circumstances in which there is neither owner-occupier nor tenant-occupier on the premises. In those circumstances it has to be considered who should be the responsible person.<lb/>
It seems reasonable to provide, as does subsection (6)(b), that in those circumstances the owner or a tenant whose lease is for a period of 12 months or more should be the responsible person, since that person will normally have sufficient interest in the property to know who lives there and to be able to provide information for registration purposes. I fully accept, however, that that will not be appropriate in all cases, for example, when an owner is abroad. That is why subsection (6)(c) provides that in any case a registration officer may designate another person as
<col>18</col>
the responsible person. This provision could come into play where there is a resident owner or tenant; for example, if a person lived with and cared for his elderly parents and who might own the property but might not wish to take on the responsibility of being the responsible person. It would then be open to the registration officer to designate the son or daughter as the responsible person instead.<lb/>
I hope that from what I have said it will be obvious that in the vast majority of cases the responsible person is identified, but it is conceivable that in some cases he will not be. For example, in the case of a housing association providing accommodation as a half-way house for people coming out of hospital or other institutional care it might be appropriate to designate an officer of the housing association who would deal with many of the business affairs of the house but who would not himself be resident there as the responsible person.<lb/>
The other kind of case in which a non-resident might be designated as a responsible person would be where the manager of a property subject to a collective community charge would be designated as the responsible person for the purpose of providing the registration officer with information to enable him to calculate the collective community charge multiplier.<lb/>
I should perhaps clarify one point for the noble Lord, Lord Morton. The reference in Clause 17(6)(c) to "district council" or "housing body" is a printing error in this part of the Bill. As I understand it, this was an amendment in Committee which was not printed at the time and will have been corrected in the next draft. It appears on a supplementary list in green entitled "(120-corrections)", which I think the noble Lord may have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00442">3.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00443"><member>Lord Morton of Shuna</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was very interesting to discuss subsections (6)(a) and (6)(b) which my amendment did not intend to alter in any way at all. I have no objection to those, otherwise there would have been an amendment down. The difficulty is subsection (6)(c) which talks about designating first of all
<quote>"such other person as the registration officer",</quote>
which may or may not be suitable. But then it does not talk about designating a responsible officer of a housing body or a council or whatever the word is, but "the body", which seems to be a difficulty, at least according to what the Minister was reading out to us.<lb/>
I certainly see some difficulty in the idea that, for example, a person who is acting, whether as estate agent, solicitor or whatever for a person who owns a house and goes abroad should be responsible not, only for telling the registration officer to whom he has leased or let the house or whatever but who is living in it. That seems to be putting an extraordinary burden on somebody who otherwise has no duty at all to go to the house and inspect whomever is living in it. It is the duty on the responsible officer to say who is occupying the house as a main residence and who is over 18. Does the Minister expect estate agents to do this all the time? That seems to me quite extraordinary. But as we are trying to get the Bill through to allow other matters, and having pointed out the difficulties, no
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0018"/>

doubt we shall not be accused of having let them pass without pointing them out. Therefore I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00447">The noble Lord said: My Lords, at Committee stage the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, tabled an amendment to give the person designated as the responsible person the right to object formally to the registration officer against that designation with a subsequent right of appeal to the sheriff against the registration officer's determination.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00448">We then said that we would consider the need to change the Bill on this point to meet the concerns expressed at Committee stage in relation to designation as the responsible person. We now propose that it would be fitting to bring the appeal provisions in relation to designation as responsible person into line with the general appeal provisions relating to registration under Clause 16(1) of the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00450"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the Government for having made the change. Noble Lords should appreciate that being named, even against your will, as the responsible person brings with it possible penalties. You may be fined &#x00A3;50 on the say-so of the registration officer (not any court of law) because you have given false information or because you say, "I am not going to give that information; it wouldn't be right for me to give it". If you do that, having been appointed to this position which you did not want, you can be fined &#x00A3;50 in the first instance. You are not fined, because it is a civil debt&#x2014;a strange new idea that you empower a registration officer carrying out the task which Parliament has laid on him by this, if he does not get the right information, or gets false information, or no information at all, to fine the person whom he has appointed &#x00A3;50. Furthermore, if that person still does not provide the information, it is a matter of &#x00A3;200.<lb/>
That is why I am concerned about who is to be the responsible officer. I think it is more than a bit much, but I am glad we have at least got this appeal business sorted out in part by the acceptance of the suggestions which have been made.

<quote>Page 17, line 31, leave out ("notify") and insert ("be notified by").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00456">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a slightly different amendment. We are up against the rights of the individual or the rights of the democracy. Every person will be liable on 1st April 1989 or becomes liable; that is to say, every person who becomes 18 has a birthday present from the Government on his eighteenth birthday. Whether he is working or unemployed&#x2014;it does not matter what his status is, be he duke, duke's son or dustman's son&#x2014;he is liable to pay the personal community charge. If he has a second home somewhere&#x2014;and that will not apply to many of the unemployed, I am sure&#x2014;it may be anything over &#x00A3;300 a year. He is not liable for anything at the moment, he is not liable to pay rates but this is the new obligation on everyone of 18 and over.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00457">There is more than that obligation. He has to notify the registrar. It is not for the registrar to find him from his register on completion of the register; it is for him to notify the registration officer. I should have thought it would be the other way round and it would be the registration officer who should notify him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00458">It is a simple matter which I am dealing with here. The registrar is paid handsomely. He is already the electoral registration officer and he is already the assessor; that is the valuation officer in Scotland at the moment. Now he has this new task of drawing up the register.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00459">We do not write saying "I am now 18. May I have a vote?". That is found out by the electoral registration officer. Now you are bringing a new tax upon yourself and to whom you pay it will depend on the area in which you are resident. If a person moved from one area to another, I could understand the necessity for notification&#x2014;of the responsible person telling the CCRO, the community charge registration officer. How these new initials will slip off our tongues by the time we come to the election after this coming one. I think it is a matter for the registration officer to draw up his own register and not for the people who will pay this new tax to notify him. Therefore I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00460"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to point out that as a householder I am normally sent a form to fill in for the electoral register. In that form I am asked to say who lives in my house and whether they are over 18. I am asked to give the names of anybody over 18 who is resident in the house. So it is not the electoral registrar's job to find out; it is up to the householder, probably the parents of the young people, to tell the electoral registration officer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00461"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to raise much the same point as the noble Lady. Is it not the duty of the householder to give the electoral registration officer all the particulars which he needs before he comes to levy the charges? Am I wrong in thinking that in Committee the Government looked favourably upon dealing with the difficulties which they were going to impose on students and people like them who
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0019"/>
<col>21</col>
move&#x2014;and they are not the only people who will do that&#x2014;for part of the year and who, as I understand it, will be responsible for notifying any registration officer into whose area they come, over and above what may be sent on their behalf by their householder? Are the Government certain that it is reasonable to call upon students and suchlike to do this?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00462"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must come to the support of my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock. Surely there is a distinction here. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, is quite right. We put young people down on the electoral register before they reach the age of 18. However, the difference&#x2014;and it is a serious one&#x2014;is that when their names are put down on the register they are claiming a right, which is not quite the same thing as claiming a liability. People can decently be asked to claim a right but I am not quite so sure that they can be decently asked to claim a liability. It is not the same thing.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Ross is surely right. Once a person has made a claim for the right to vote, it then becomes the duty of the registration officer to say that that right to vote is granted, in the same way as, drawing on the electoral register, he could say that the right to the liability is granted as well. As usual, my noble friend Lord Ross is correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00463"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened carefully to what has been said in support of the amendment but it seems to me that the amendment would be entirely impracticable since subsection (1) of Clause 18 applies only to people who are not already registered and of whose liability the registration officer will be, by definition, unaware. There are separate provisions in Clauses 14 and 15 for the registration officer to notify individuals who are the subject of register entries and of whose liability or prospective liability he is aware. But when a person arrives in an area and is not yet registered on the community charges register it is obviously impracticable for the registration officer to notify him of his liability. For the life of me I cannot understand how he is to find out that the person has arrived. That is the practical difficulty.<lb/>
As for students, they will be liable for a prescribed percentage of the personal community charge and will be registered at their term-time address. Student flats will therefore be in no different a position from other shared flats. In the normal case one of the residents will generally by agreement be designated as the responsible person and will provide for registration purposes information on the residents of the flat. I do not think this will be an onerous duty. I am sure it will not and I am confident that the provisions of the Bill will allow the system to work smoothly.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, did not refer to Amendments Nos. 160 and 160A specifically although I think he will agree with me that, because of the requirement in them for the notice to be in writing, they are closely connected with this amendment. It seems to me to be unduly restrictive to require the notices to be in writing. At present there is nothing to prevent an individual who becomes liable from simply telephoning or going to the registration officer's office
<col>22</col>
and informing him or his staff of the fact that he has become liable. Under Clause 18(1)(b)(ii) he will then be required to supply the registration officer with appropriate information so that the register entry can be made up. For those purposes he will normally be required to fill in a form, but I do not think it would be necessary to require that the notification itself should always be in writing. That would perhaps add to any bureaucracy which the noble Lord has felt applies in any other case in this piece of legislation.<lb/>
The arguments turn on practicability. That is the main reason why I hope that with my further explanation the noble Lord will feel happy about this proposal in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00465"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have heard the explanation before more than once. The difficulty is in relation to the whole business. It is easy enough for rating purposes to know that there is a house in a particular area. That house is valued by the assessor, who in Scotland is the same person as the electoral registration officer. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, filled in a form. That form was sent to her. But no form is being sent to anyone here. That is what I want.<lb/>
How will it be known that the person is 18? The electoral registration officer has the right to check and there is also the responsible person. This amounts to penalties by inertia. The man who will apply the penalty does nothing, but the person who will be taxed up to &#x00A3;300 a year has to notify the registration officer that he is now 18 or that he has now come to the area. The latter point does not matter so much because the chances are that if he has moved into the area he is already paying the community charge somewhere else; and if he is not removed from that register then he is paying at least once.<lb/>
These are the difficulties that arise from the change of moving from rates which are levied on houses. Houses do not move. People come and go but the rates remain attached to houses as people move in. This is the unfairness of the whole thing and no doubt one of the difficulties that the registration officer will face. We have troubles at the moment in respect of the electoral register not being complete because of mistakes. From that point of view it will be much more worth while for a person not to register. We shall find that the register is very incomplete. We shall not have as complete a register when it means, "Right, you've been nailed, you're there. Now pay &#x00A3;300 a year". This is one of the difficulties. The difficulty is not of my creation but arises from the Government's change.<lb/>
We already know that this registration will be costly. It will cost far more than the existing system of rates and the valuation roll although the same person will draw up the register. There will be a considerable element of chaos and a certain amount of unfairness if you expect people to do it themselves. The Government are having it both ways. In this clause the person is liable. In the previous clause the responsible person is liable. What I have tried to show all along is the considerable and almost impossible burden being placed on the registration officer and what the cost will be if he is to have an efficient register.<lb/>

I do not remember ever filling in a form in respect of my household although I live in a town. Canvassers are sent out. Canvassers come to the door and ask questions. Remember this: there is no penalty for giving the wrong information. If my two daughters had been rabid communists at the age of 18, while I would not have done it some people might have been content not to put their names on the electoral register. There is no penalty for giving the wrong information in respect of the electoral register but there is in respect of the community charges register.<lb/>
It is a difficult problem but it stems from what we are doing&#x2014;taxing people instead of levying rates on households. I do not think that we shall get anywhere on this matter but I want to point out and keep pointing out the difficulties the Government have got themselves into. I hope that English Members of the House will remember that it is coming to them in due course. It may well be that they will change their minds before that and remember some of the warnings that we have given them. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 17, line 49, leave out from ("period") to end of line 17 on page 18.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00470">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is to question the whole definition of "backdated period". The provision is rather confusing as it stands. it seems to be worded so that any period prior to the date on which the entry is made in the register for which the taxpayer has been resident could be classed as a backdated period. It seems rather confusing. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain it more clearly. Perhaps he has had second thoughts since Committee stage and will be able to clear up this point. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00471"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I should emphasise first that there is no question of any penalty attaching to someone whose liability for one of the community charges is properly registered but who has simply fallen into arrears. Recovery of arrears is dealt with separately under Clause 21 and Schedule 2 to the Bill.<lb/>
The provisions in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of Clause 18 are directed at the circumstances where someone was under a duty to notify the registration officer of his liability for one of the community charges but has not done so and is therefore not registered as liable. That is why subsection (3) refers to an entry in the register recording a liability commencing on a date prior to the date on which the entry is made.<lb/>
The main circumstances covered by that provision will be those where an individual should have informed the registration officer of his liability but has not in fact done so. He has therefore evaded the
<col>24</col>
community charge and it is right that a civil penalty should be imposed. The penalties provided for by the clause are similar to those provided for in relation to VAT evasion under the Finance Act 1985, and involve the imposition of a surcharge related to the amount of community charge which has been evaded subject to a minimum amount of &#x00A3;50.<lb/>
I must strongly defend the principle of the provisions. There are ample safeguards in the clause for people whose absence from the register may be a result of ignorance or carelessness. First, the penalty may only be imposed if the period for which the person has not been registered is three months or more. People who are simply dilatory in notifying the registration officer of their liability will not therefore be caught.<lb/>
Secondly, the penalty need not be imposed if the local authority is satisfied that the person has a resonable excuse for not having been registered. What constitutes a reasonable excuse will be a matter for interpretation by the courts, but the provision is precedented in other taxation legislation and will allow local authorities to take into account any special circumstances of cases where a person has not been registered for three months or more.<lb/>
Thirdly, an appeal to the sheriff against the surcharge is provided for by subsection (5). Subsection (4) provides that the amounts of the surcharge and the rates of interest which may be applied to tax for the backdated period may be varied by regulations made by the Secretary of State. This is necessary in order to allow periodically for changes in the value of money and the general level of rates of interest prevailing.<lb/>
These provisions are clearly necessary to deal with deliberate evasion of registration for the purpose of avoiding payment of the community charge. The amendment does nothing to deal with such evasion because it seeks merely to require the person concerned to repay the arrears without penalty or interest. I hope that the noble Lord will feel further enlightened.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00475">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a simple matter of drafting. The person who draws up the register is the person who is responsible for its accuracy and for saying whether or not it is complete. I rather think that it is up to him to be satisfied that there has been a reasonable excuse for not having been registered, and not up to the levying authority. The levying authority just levies. It is not responsible for the register at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00476">It would be far better to make this change. The paragraph says:

That is the levying authority. I think he should satisfy the registration officer, who has the responsibility and all the facts in relation to that kind of thing. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00477"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate the intention behind this amendment. Since, when there is any question of a surcharge being imposed on an individual, the matter will relate to his registration, it seems logical at first glance that it is the registration officer who should be satisfied as to whether or not the person concerned has a reasonable excuse for not having been registered. I expect that in practice the levying authority will wish to take advice from the registration officer when it is contemplating imposing a surcharge. But I have to say that the provisions of the Bill are necessary.<lb/>
It is the levying authority to whom the community charge, including the arrears, is payable. Since the surcharge is related to the amount of community charge payable it is for the levying authority to impose it. It is therefore right that it should be the levying authority in the last analysis which decides whether or not it should be imposed. It is therefore for the authority to satisfy itself whether or not the person in question has a reasonable excuse. As I have said, in this context the authority is likely to wish to seek advice from the registration officer, but I am satisfied that the arrangements set out in the Bill are nevertheless correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00478"><member>Lord Morton of Shuna</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what happens if the registration officer says, "This is a reasonable excuse", and the levying authority says, "No, it is not"? Does the levying authority then put in a surcharge although the registration officer says, "Well, this is a reasonable excuse", or even "This was my mistake"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00479"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should have thought that on that sort of occasion, if that were to arise, it would be a matter for consultation between the two to start with; but ultimately the levying authority should be the final arbiter since the surcharge is due to it along with the community charge itself. Beyond that, I should have thought that it would be a question of appeal to the sheriff against the surcharge in that particular case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00480"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we could have avoided all this nonsense with the person who knows about registration. The person who is subject to all the regulations in respect of registration is the CCRO&#x2014;the community charge registration officer. It is far easier to say "CCRO" than "community charge registration officer". Really they should satisfy him about reasonableness or otherwise.<lb/>
I am sorry that the Government even at this late stage do not recognise how hastily this Bill has been drafted. There are tremendous gaps of logic. When a Minister says, "It would be logical to do this, but", he should stop and make it logical. You could easily put a phrase in there to ensure that the question of reasonableness was properly assigned to the person who knows all about registration, and that is the registration officer. But if the Government are
<col>26</col>
determined not to be logical who am I to save them from the troubles that may well arise? If the thing is careless, then let them blame it on themselves. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00488"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Clause 19 provides that the register should be conclusive on the question of the liability of persons registered to pay any community charge, on the date as from which such a charge is payable and on the collective community charge mutiplier in respect of premises registered for the collective community charge. All of these points relate directly to the principle or the amount of a person's liability. The amendment would add to these provisions the provision that the register is to be conclusive as to the address at which liability is incurred. Liability flows from residence in a local authority's area and not residence at a particular address, and while the register will of course record the addresses of the persons who are liable, the fact or the amount of their liability will not strictly speaking depend on whether they are resident at one address in the local authority's area rather than in another. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00489"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely it is appreciated that the address may not itself be in the area of that CCRO. From that point of view it is essential that the factual information be there.

<quote>Page 19, line 14, leave out paragraph (d).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00495">The noble Lord said: My Lords, here we come to the business of inspecting the register. The inspecting of registers by the public is a matter of considerable concern, especially as most of the registers will probably be drawn up and maintained by computer. I have seen a few programmes on television recently which show that people can, without the authority of the registrar, key in to computers and get quite a lot of information from them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00496">I am concerned that paragraph (d) says:
<quote>"such other person as may be prescribed"&#x2014;</quote>
what other person, other than those mentioned in (a), (b) and (c)?
<quote>"shall be entitled to inspect the register to such an extent and for such purposes as may be prescribed".</quote>
Paragraph (d) is a mine of non-information. Nobody knows what it means. The Government have not yet told us. Here is an opportunity for the Minister to shine and tell us the persons who are going to be prescribed, the extent to which they inspect the register and for purposes such as may be prescribed again. Could we have some information about the kind of person, the extent and the purposes? I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00497"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is an area where the Government ought to be specific. In the first three paragraphs of that subsection they are specific. They indicate a number of people who are entitled to inspect and examine the register, and all of them seem to have a specific, precise and, indeed, defensible reason for inspecting the register. Then the clause seems to fall to pieces. It appears to say that another nameless, nebulous body of people who might be prescribed in some particular way might then be entitled to examine the register. I wonder why that last part is there and why paragraph (d) should exist at all. In a clause which is mainly precise, why should there be an imprecision introduced at the end? I think we are entitled to a fairly detailed explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00498"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I should say straight away that paragraph (d) is a contingency provision. At the moment we do not envisage circumstances in which persons other than those listed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) should have the right to inspect the register, but it might be that in future a need for such a right of inspection will arise, and where this was clearly demonstrated it would obviously be highly desirable if the change could be made by regulations rather than by primary legislation. In any case, the extension of the rights of inspection under this provision would be carefully limited to the extent and the purposes necessary to meet the future circumstances which had arisen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00499"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister sits down, will he recognise that he has not told us anything at all? He said that this is a contingency, which it clearly is, and it is a contingency to deal with certain nameless circumstances which might arise at some unspecified future time and for
<col>28</col>
wholly unspecified purposes. Surely it is not sufficient for him to say it is a contingency, which we know already, without telling us for what it is a contingency. Surely some hint of the kind of event or occurrence which might give rise to this contingency should be given to us. It is not enough merely to say that something might arise some time in the future without giving us some hint of the kind of thing which that something might be.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00501"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think subsection (2) is at all unreasonable. It lays down who will have the specific right. "Contingency" is a real concept. Contingencies arise in all spheres, and it is just as well not to be caught out, if we want a certain thing to be done eventually, as we have got the statute so narrow that discretion cannot be used by people with the authority to use it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00503"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note what the noble Baroness says. The purpose of the provision is to provide for contingencies. Things may change in time. That is why the paragraph is written in. I cannot crystal-ball gaze in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, invited me to. Obviously there is a strong sense that despite the fact that it is a contingency provision and that it adds flexibility, it is flexibility which in your Lordships' eyes goes rather too far, so on this occasion I am willing to bow to those strong feelings and to accept the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00510"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot see that there is any harm in the provision which the amendment would remove. It is no more than a provision whereby persons who could have obtained information from the register by inspecting it will be able to buy that information in a more convenient form. There is a similar provision under the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 1986 enabling the electoral registration officer to sell copies of electors lists or the electoral registers. Those are frequently bought by commercial organisations to which they are very useful. As the community charge register will be more up to date than the electoral register, and because the provision allows only for the sale of information which is publicly available anyway, I expect that the community charge register will be even more useful to commercial interests than the electoral register. However, I hope that in the light of that explanation, and the precedent for it, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>

People want to buy the electoral register in order to take part in elections. Anyone who has taken part in an election will know that one would be greatly hampered if one could not obtain copies of the register except by inspecting it. As the Minister said, those who will want to buy this register will wish to do so for commercial reasons.<lb/>
I am far from being certain that it is good that people should be able to buy the register for purely commercial reasons; for instance, so that they can pester those on the register to take part in their enterprise or buy their goods.

The dangers involved, as has been outlined by the noble Lords, Lord Grimond and Lord Ross of Marnock, indicate that this is a somewhat uneasy situation. If the Bill passes I think that it should encourage and place no impediment in the way of people registering in order that they may exercise their votes. However, I do not think that a hint that the register may be sold for commercial purposes to property developers or salesmen of one kind or another is an encouragement for people to register.

I do not agree with it and I do not think that noble Lords on various sides of the House agree with it. The question is whether this amendment is the place to carry it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00515"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister was good enough to join us on this side of the House in respect of the last amendment. I am inclined to join him from this side of the House in respect of this amendment. I take that view because, as I read it, subsection (2) of this clause provides that any member of the public shall be entitled to inspect the register. That means that anybody can get his hands on the names and addresses. What the Minister is saying is: "Okay, let them have the names and addresses but let us have the money too". It is a little sordid but not unduly so, and I must say that I am on his side.</membercontribution></p>

It is a matter which goes rather wide of this particular piece of legislation.<lb/>
However, we must remember that when it comes to people obtaining this kind of information staff must be employed to make it available, to supervise the office and such matters. It seems to me, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, that it is not unreasonable on occasions such as this, when there may be a demand to obtain such information, that the costs of doing so shall be borne by the individual rather than the authority itself. Indeed, during the passage of the Bill it has often been said that extra costs would accrue to local authorities in one form or another in any event. This is a simple case of applying the same

If only the noble Lord, Lord Harmar-Nicholls, had spoken in favour of the Government we might have had a chance. There will need to be in existance two or three registers; there must be one which is complete and one which gives only certain information. The existence of a complete register holds the danger that other people will obtain it in some way or another. The names, addresses and ages of people are to be shown on the register.<lb/>
The dangers of age being shown have again been pointed out. I know that the Government will say that that is the one matter which they will not disclose in order to assure the ladies in the community that their ages will not be known. It may be available to people whose intentions are not good and they will find that in certain areas there are people aged 75, 76 or 81, and there are old ladies living alone. That is very dangerous information to have anywhere, especially if in some way and by some chance the code could be broken and the information on the register obtained.</membercontribution></p>

I believe that she appreciates the difficulties when information is given to some people but not to others. It can fall into the wrong hands. I have always argued that the fact that one appears on the register makes it unnecessary for the age to be shown; one is obviously over 18 years of age. That is all that people need to know from the point of view of liability for this tax. However, I do not think we are going to get anything from the Government by way of this and I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment, having sounded the warning about the difficulty of these registers, about limiting them and safeguarding them as far as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00521">Schedule 2 [<i>Levy, collection, payment and recovery of community charges</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00522"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 166:
<quote>Page 32, line 38, leave out ("standard").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00523">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I think that this amendment is associated with Amendment No. 167. If my memory is right, I am concerned about the use of this word "standard". It occurs on lines 38 and 44 of page 32 and it is a wonderful thing. We already have "standard" in the "standard community charge". Now we have the word again when people are going to be called upon to pay this community charge monthly. What are we going to call the monthly instalment?&#x2014;"the standard monthly instalment". So we are going to have the standard monthly payment of the standard charge. They are different things, and I think it is quite nonsensical.</p>
<col>32</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00524">You do not require to define the standard monthly charge at all: it is just a monthly payment. Reading sub-paragraph (4), it says:
<quote>"Instalments (except the first) of the personal community charge and standard community charge payable in accordance with subparagraph (3)(a) above shall, subject to this paragraph, be equal to the standard monthly amount of the personal community charge or, as the case may be, of the standard community charge".</quote>
That is the standard monthly payment of the standard community charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00525">I do not know whether the draftsman had got rather fed up by this time. If he had given any of us here a ring, refreshed as we are by the constant lively debates we have here, particularly on this Bill, we could have redrafted that passage and got rid of at least one of the "standards". If this goes on, the Standard and the Braes of Mar will be raised again. It is rubbish. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00526"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the purpose of paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 is to set out the normal standard arrangements for the payment of community charges by 12 monthly instalments. This represents a change from the rating system where the basic arrangement involves 10 monthly instalments. The fundamental reason for the difference is that under the rating system liability is determined at the beginning of each year and the precise timetable on which payments are recovered has less significance. By contrast, the concept underlying the community charge is a continuous liability, as recorded in a rolling register kept continuously up to date, and it therefore seems more simple to spread the payments throughout the year and to organise them so that equal amounts are due each month.<lb/>
We recognise that some people have taken the view that continuation of arrangements for 10 monthly instalments would have provided a fallow period, such as exists at present, during which local authorities can complete the book-keeping for one year and prepare and issue bills for the next. It is quite clear, however, that the lack of such a fallow period does not represent a serious objection to the Government's proposals and that, provided the processes of determining the community charge can happen sufficiently far in advance of the beginning of each financial year, as is the Government's intention, there will be no problem about completing the necessary paperwork. In the course of consultations on the Green Paper the Scottish branch of CIPFA came down in favour of the approach enshrined in the Bill, of 12 equal monthly instalments.<lb/>
Against that background it seems to me that the present provisions in the Bill are perfectly satisfactory and that these amendments, which would delete the term "Standard monthly amount" are unnecessary and unhelpful. It may seem as though leaving paragraph 4(4) to refer simply to the "monthly amount" would provide an added measure of flexibility. In practice it would mean nothing different from what is there at present but would carry the risk of leaving important terms undefined. The provisions of paragraph 4 already leave sufficient flexibility to cope with a variety of other circumstances: for example, the need to round off the payments in broken months when an individual becomes, or ceases to be,
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0025"/>
<col>33</col>
liable for the community charge in the course of a financial year; the need to round off the amount payable in one of the 12 months&#x2014;for convenience the first month&#x2014;in order to produce exactly the right total of payments for the year; as well as providing the opportunity for local authorities to agree with individual community charge payers a different schedule of payments, if they wish to do so, by virtue of subparagraph (10).<lb/>
I am confident that these provisions as they stand provide a sensible basis under which the bulk of the individuals in each local authority area will know what they are due to pay each month&#x2014;the standard monthly amount&#x2014;and I think that this makes sense as well as simplifying the work of local authorities, banks handling standing orders and so on. In the light of this explanation, setting it in context, I hope that the noble Lord will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00527"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the House: one of the penalties of putting down even a drafting amendment is that we have to endure a Scottish Office explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00528"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00529"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Did anybody understand it? Did anybody understand why we have to have the word "standard" added to the words "monthly payment" or "monthly instalment"? All that needed to be said was "a monthly instalment". That is one meaning of standard. It is not only the personal charge: you have a standard community charge and so you have a standard monthly payment of a standard community charge. It is rather ridiculous. The Scottish Office is getting worse. Bring back the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield: that is what I say. However, I am not going to risk another explanation from the Minister, and so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00532"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 169:
<quote>Page 33, line 46, leave out ("a person is") and insert ("tenants and any spouses residing in dwelling houses let by it are").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00533">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the arrangement whereby housing authorities, which may be the local authority housing authority, or indeed the Scottish Special Housing Association or some similar body, have to collect the personal and collective standard charges instead of the levying authority. It seems quite right. They are used to going into the house and collecting both the rent and rates at the same time. But when they do that they collect only from the householder who is the tenant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00534">They are used to doing that kind of thing, but why should they have to collect from somebody who is not the tenant or the spouse of the tenant? It may be somebody who is lodging at the house; it may be part of their own family; but surely it should not be the responsibility of the housing authority, which has no idea who else is in that house, because its officers have
<col>34</col>
not been asking about that sort of thing, and I think the limit of their collection or recovery should be to the tenant or his spouse and not to other people in the house. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00535"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as it stands, the amendment seems to me to be focused on a fairly narrow point and I am not quite sure that I follow the logic of it. If the arrangements which may be made between housing bodies can cover community charge payments by all persons and not just tenants and spouses, why should these additional sums, which are closely tied to community charge liability, not be payable on a similar basis?<lb/>
A more general issue is whether arrangements made between housing bodies and levying authorities should apply only to persons who are housing body tenants and their spouses or should cover a wider range of community charge payers.<lb/>
The amendments moved in Committee by my noble friend Lady Carnegy were intended to provide the greatest possible flexibility in the arrangements which could be made between housing bodies and levying authorities. These amendments were a response to representations made by what is, I believe, one of the key professional bodies in this area, the Rating and Valuation Association and, I understand, reflected the wishes of the Scottish branch of CIPFA. Both these organisations have made it clear that the most sensible approach is to provide the greatest degree of flexibility so that local authorities can make arrangements between themselves which provide for the optimum use of resources of manpower, equipment and local offices to make the most efficient and economical job of levying and collecting community charges.<lb/>
There is a wide range of such arrangements at present as regards rates. In some areas district councils collect rates only from their tenants; in others, they collect rates from everyone. The case for flexibility having been accepted, it would be quite unreasonable, I think, to restrict matters in the way that the amendment would bring about.<lb/>
As it stands, paragraph 5 provides considerable flexibility for sensible arrangements to be made locally. I should be reluctant to see that flexibility reduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00536">4.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00537"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the fact that there is flexibility and that it is not mandatory for the housing local authority to collect from people from whom it does not normally collect, this will make easier the method by which the charges will be collected. It is easier to collect the rates with the rents&#x2014;so much so that people in some areas do not know the rents of their houses and talk about rent when they mean rent and rates, because they make one payment. However, the local authority never collects from people other than the tenant or spouse. Therefore I am not very happy about this way of doing it. It is true that "may" rather than "shall" provides a certain measure of flexibility. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00539">Clause 22 [<i>Reduction of community charges</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00540"><member>Lord Morton of Shuna</member> moved Amendment No. 169A:
<quote>Leave out Clause 22.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00541">The noble Lord said: The amendment has been tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove and myself to find the Government's response to the undertaking that the Minister gave in Committee on 9th April, at col. 1173 of <i>Hansard</i>. This appalling clause says:
<quote>"Schedule 3 to this Act has effect."</quote>
Schedule 3 gives the Secretary of State power to control the community charges if he considers that the expenditure is excessive and unreasonable. I am not raising at this time the question whether it is proper that he should have the power. The question I wish to raise is whether that power should be in the main part of the Bill or in a schedule.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00542">In Committee on 9th April there was a powerful expression of views from the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, the noble Lords, Lord Campbell of Alloway, Lord Boyd-Carpenter and Lord Stallard, the noble Earl, Lord Perth, the noble Lord, Lord Sanderson of Bowden, and others that it would be much better to follow the precedent of the previous legislation, which puts this power of the Secretary of State in relation to rates into clauses of the Bill, rather than what, from my slight knowledge of drafting, seems an appalling way of doing it; namely, in a clause stating that schedule blank to the Act has effect, followed by the inclusion of whatever one likes of principle.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00543">As the Minister undertook to consider this issue, the amendment is tabled to ascertain the result of his consideration. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00544"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must admit that I am a little disappointed that it is necessary for the amendment to be tabled at all. My noble friend the Minister will recall, as the noble Lord, Lord Morton of Shuna, has reminded us, that we had considerable discussion in Committee, not on the merits or demerits of the schedule but on the question of whether it is good or even acceptable parliamentary drafting to put the considerable and important powers that the Minister is to be given in the clause and in the schedule and rely on that being legitimised by a single, one-line clause.<lb/>
I think that my noble friend the Minister will recall that in the dicussion he sought to quote the precedent of the 1965 legislation, which precedent appears to be wholly against him because in that case the powers, as I recall, were put in the clause in the Bill. From the point of view of practicality and propriety, it seems a better practice to do that than to do what has been done in this schedule.<lb/>
First, as regards any person who required to study the Bill and to know the law&#x2014;and under the Bill there is no question that it will be very important for many people to study and be aware of the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;it makes it less easy for him to find a one-line clause and then have to burrow into the schedule to discover what it is all about.<lb/>
Secondly, I think that a certain measure of propriety is involved&#x2014;I agree that it is a difficult matter of
<col>36</col>
judgment&#x2014;for Parliament when enacting important things to put them in the clauses of the Bill clearly and openly enacted, and to stow away in the schedules only the complicated but less important aspects of the legislation. I still hope that my noble friend, who appeared to be not unimpressed by the arguments poured on him from all sides in Committee, will have something to say on the Government's attitude. Meanwhile, he puts some of us in a difficult position. It would be silly to accept the amendment, which would simply have the effect of knocking out of the Bill a very important provision contained in the schedule. On the other hand, many of us are very unhappy that the Bill should go forward with this kind of drafting apparently approved by Parliament.<lb/>
There have been comments lately&#x2014;I do not want to generalise&#x2014;that the standard of parliamentary draftsmen today is not quite what it used to be. This example certainly seems to render some force to that criticism. I therefore hope that, even at this stage, my noble friend will be able to say something to encourage those of us who wish this important measure to be drafted in appropriate, traditional, conventional and accurate terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00545"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member>; My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. I took this point very strongly on the last occasion. Without repeating anything that has been said before, it is surely right that the Government&#x2014;any government&#x2014;accept as a matter of principle that the principles governing the operation of a statute go in primary legislation, and the implementing machinery goes in the schedule. That is the problem to which we shall come. It keeps hiding its face, but we shall come to it later today under Clause 24. Where are the governing principles? There are none in the Bill. The problem is the same.<lb/>
The Bill is lamentably drafted. The drafting is sloppy. It does not face up to the cardinal importance of putting principles in primary legislation. We are entitled to ask for that as a matter of the exercise of our advisory role. I agree that there is nothing that we can do about it, but we can go on asking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00546"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I pray in aid the recommendations of the committee of which I had the honour to be chairman, which said what my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has just said; namely, that principles should be stated in clauses and that when a great deal of detail is needed to be set out to apply those principles to particular circumstances, it should be contained in a schedule or, if temporary, for example, in statutory instruments or Orders in Council.<lb/>
Applying that concept to this schedule, I think that most of what is in the schedule should be in a schedule. It is desirable, and it would not involve substantial repetition, that the principles underlying the schedule should have been stated in Clause 22, instead of having in Clause 22, which I think is most unusual, and in Clause 21 for that matter, the mere statement that the schedule should have effect. As my noble friend has said, it is too late for us to have this put right. In this short discussion I hope that we are laying down guidelines for a better future.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0027"/>
<col>37</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00547"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not like the discussion to finish merely on the point of where the provisions should be without saying that in Committee I pointed out the illogicality of the schedule itself, in that, as I understand it, the whole point of the Bill is to get rid of rates and put in a system which will restore responsibility to local authorities. We have the whole Bill for that and then there is this important point of principle; that the Government have contingency plans in case the Bill does not work. Contingency planning is probably right because the Bill is such a mess that it will not work. I wanted to point out that many of the points contained in the schedule are objectionable in themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00548"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what has gone wrong here is that the schedule refers to parliamentary proceedings, and parliamentary proceedings would of course be appropriate matters for a schedule. However, the body of the schedule does not deal solely with proceedings; it deals with the Secretary of State's powers. The Secretary of State's powers should be in the Bill. They should be clearly stated in Clause 22, and that clause should refer to Schedule 3 for the proceedings.<lb/>
I am not sure whether it is too late to make a change. Is not this the kind of change which would be suitable and appropriate for Third Reading? I know that we do not want too many changes on Third Reading of any Bill. I agree entirely with that. This proposal is so inept and mistaken that surely it can be put right at a later stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00549">4.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00550"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with care to the points that have been raised, as I did to the points that were raised in Committee. I studied those remarks with care. I shall not deal with the merits of the matter because they have not been dealt with by any of your Lordships. The burden of my remarks will be addressed to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, and whether the principles should have appeared in the clause.<lb/>
It is no easier to change the contents of a schedule than the contents of a main clause because primary legislation is needed in both cases. In this case, all the contents of Schedule 3 deal with the mechanics or the exercise of the Secretary of State's power to propose a reduction in a community charge, and there is no real issue of substance on that. With the benefit of hindsight, I willingly concede that it would have been better, and would certainly have looked better, if we had provided something more substantial in the clause.<lb/>
The question that I have had to consider over the past few days is whether it would be prudent to propose changes in this part of the Bill at this stage. There has been considerable scrutiny of the points that have been raised and no fundamental issue of principle is at stake. One problem is that there would be no unanimity of view as to what, among the present contents of Schedule 3, constitutes issues of principle. I dare say that it would be possible to draw them out. The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, said it would be reasonably simple to do that, but I do not think that
<col>38</col>
it would be simple. We could end with a fairly substantial gutting of Schedule 3. That would lead to another difficulty. It would not be prudent to attempt major redrafting at this late stage unless there were the most persuasive reasons. The danger is that we may get it wrong, and there would be little opportunity, if any, to put it right.<lb/>
For those reasons, bearing sincerely in mind all the points which have been raised, I do not think we should attempt an amendment at this stage. I hope that your Lordships will accept that point. I intend that we shall take careful note of the general point which has been raised by your Lordships when considering future legislation. I said earlier that I thought that with the benefit of hindsight this could have been better done. That is a serious point which I fully acknowledge. I hope that with the understanding of the enormous complexities of trying to gut the schedule and to put its contents into the Bill at this stage when we may not get it right in time to leave your Lordships&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00552"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, asked why. The simple reason is that we have only today and Monday and I do not see how we can possibly redraft a schedule and put part of its contents into the Bill and leave part in the schedule in time for it to leave your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00554"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister sits down, will he try to get it right in the English Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00555"><member>Lord Morton of Shuna</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should have thought that as this Session has a certain period of time to run, this matter could have been got right. It could have been got right, with little trouble, over the Easter Recess. The Government have had some experience of drafting these clauses because they took what I think the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, referred to as Section 5 of the 1965 Act&#x2014;I think it is the 1966 Act&#x2014;in 1980 or 1981 and altered it.<lb/>
They know how to do it. They have had experience of altering the powers of the Secretary of State to control local authority expenditure. I should have thought it was quite easy to insert in Clause 22 something on the lines of:
<quote>"If the Secretary of State is satisfied that the total estimated expenses".</quote>
Those words can be found in the first paragraph of Schedule 3. That is the principle and that is what should be in the Bill.<lb/>
The following could also be inserted:
<quote>"The Secretary of State may follow the procedure in Schedule 3".</quote>
That is quite easy to do. The difficulty is that, in spite of the Minister's assertions, we are leaving a precedent for that type of drafting. In the absence of any satisfactory answer and because I see no reason why that kind of amendment cannot be brought forward
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0028"/>
<col>39</col>
before next Monday&#x2014;because parliamentary draftsmen can do that&#x2014;I seek the opinion of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00556"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we take advantage of the chance to vote on the clause and in order to give the Minister and the noble Baroness a chance to have a little more fun, I cannot see anything wrong with taking that course now. I well understand the reaction of the purists that things should be done absolutely the same as they have been done in the past, but a schedule is just as much a part of a Bill as a clause. Because of all the intricacies involved in this instance, one can see the good sense of having all the intricate details as regards the application inserted in the schedule.<lb/>
On this occasion we should not give the impression that we think that a schedule is not an integral part of a Bill. The fact that it does not have more words by way of introduction does not interfere with the general effect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00562">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00563">5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00564">Schedule 3 [<i>Reduction of community charges</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00565"><member>The Deputy Speaker (Lord Aylestone)</member>. <membercontribution>My Lords, in calling Amendment No. 170, I should say that if the amendment is agreed, I shall not be able to call Amendment No. 171.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00566"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 170:
<quote>Page 36, line 22, leave out ("or a summary of these representations").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00567">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment was raised at an earlier stage of the Bill. It removes the power of the Secretary of State to present to Parliament, when he decides that he does not approve of the proposal of a local authority for setting the community charge, a summary, rather than giving the entire case of the local authority. This is a very important point. When I moved a similar amendment at Committee stage I said that the Secretary of State would be not only prosecutor and judge, as is now the case, but under the new power he would be able to present to Parliament the case for the defence. He would have the power to summarise, exclude and emphasise any particular point as he might wish. In such quasi-judicial proceedings a council putting forward proposals must be allowed to make representations without editing or summarising. I do not think that there should be any objection, as is always the case with a statutory instrument, that there is a brief note in plain English which usually appears at the back and which informs those taking part of the intended meaning. Nevertheless, there should always be available to the House of Commons, which will deal with this particular problem, the full case as laid out by a council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00568">This is a very important point which must be given due consideration. I do not think it will affect the Government's case, since they will almost certainly say that the Secretary of State will be completely honest in his presentation. He may well be. However, he will have a particular slant on matters and he may see things in a slightly different way from that in which the local authority sees them. I think therefore that there should be available the total and unabridged version of the representations made by a local authority. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00569"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as we are aware in the context of this amendment, the Bill introduces a slight change to current arrangements for presenting reports to Parliament. It will enable, but not require, the Secretary of State to put a summary of the representations of an authority to Parliament instead of the full representation. The purpose of this change is to help Parliament. Clearly the Secretary of State would go to the trouble of summarising reports only where they were vexatiously long, repetitious and
<col>42</col>
irrelevant. There can be no question of the Secretary of State distorting representations in the course of summarising them. It would not be in his interests to alter the representations of an authority in any material respect since the authority concerned would then be able to challenge the summary in court. That could jeopardise the Government's entire action. The power to summarise representations is not in any way sinister. It may well never be used. But it could be helpful to Parliament for the Secretary of State to have it available.<lb/>
In any case, the power does not prevent authorities from putting their entire representations to Parliament themselves. As your Lordships will be aware, public bodies and other interest groups are not slow to let Parliament know what they think. I do not think that the amendment addresses a real problem and in the light of that explanation, perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, may feel able to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00570"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that the amendment was reasonably innocuous. As the Minister has said, the Secretary of State would find it difficult to make a summary that was not faithful to that submitted by the council. I also suggested that there would be no harm in having a summary as long as the full representation was available to Members of Parliament. I do not think it is enough to say that councils and local authorities have ways of letting Members of Parliament know how they feel about matters. Of course they do, and it is quite right that they should. However, when some matter comes up, particularly with the heavy load of business in Parliament, I believe that there would be no harm in having the full text available to Members of Parliament. However, this matter has been raised before and we have got no further with it. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00571">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00572"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 171:
<quote>Page 36, line 22, leave out ("a") and insert ("an agreed").</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, if we cannot have the full text of the representation of the local authority, perhaps the Minister will agree that it should be inserted in the schedule that when a summary is made it should be agreed between the local authority and the Secretary of State. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00573"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this amendment is clearly closely related to the one which we have just been discussing. It requires the Secretary of State to seek agreement to any summary of an authority's representations which he intends to put before Parliament. The question is, whose agreement is required? Presumably the intention is that it should be the agreement of the authority. However, that is not specified by the amendment.<lb/>
Setting aside the drafting defect, the amendment would completely undermine the purpose of the power to summarise representations. As I said in the context of the last amendment, the power to summarise is designed to help Parliament. If the Secretary of State must seek the agreement of the authority to any summary of their representations, an authority
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0030"/>
<col>43</col>
presumably will simply use the opportunity to delay presentation of the report to Parliament. The Secretary of State could not accept that, because delay could ultimately jeopardise the entire community charge reduction which he was proposing. He would therefore be driven back to presenting all the representations, however vexatiously long, repetitious or irrelevant. That would not help Parliament at all.<lb/>
I think that the amendment is defective and appears to seek to undermine the useful power which has already been discussed. It does not significantly improve the position of authorities. In view of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, will feel able not to press the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00574"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely the Minister's answer to the amendment is somewhat outrageous. In the first case, the drafting point is technically valid. However, it is perfectly obvious that what is intended by the amendment is to have an agreed version. That seems to me to be eminently reasonable in the whole of the circumstances. Surely if there is to be a summary, it should be an agreed summary. I find it extraordinary that the Minister should say that perhaps the authority will use that as an opportunity to delay the matter. Equally, one could say, if one were so tempted, that the Minister might present a summary somewhat biased in his favour.<lb/>
However, in this context, I do not think there is any room for such allegations between local and central government. A clue to the circumstances, referred to in our debates on the Bill, is the present state of open warfare between local and central government, which is very much to be deprecated. It has been suggested that central government feel unable to trust anyone in local government to reach a sensible agreement about an appropriate summary. However, that is something done by lawyers every day in the course of proceedings in the law courts, however much they may be at issue on the merits of a particular point. I am surprised that the Minister will not accept the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00575"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I take on board the anxieties expressed by the noble and learned Lord. I should be very happy to give the undertaking that, as and when the Secretary of State sees fit to produce summaries in the way outlined, the complete text of such summaries would be made available in the Library of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00576"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a concession which I am only too pleased to accept at this stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00577">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00578"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 172:
<quote>Page 36, line 34, after ("are") insert ("closely").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00579">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns a more important point which I am sure the Minister will explain fully. The purpose of the amendment is to bring the new arrangements embodied in the Bill into line with the wording of existing arrangements for determining excessive and
<col>44</col>
unreasonable expenditure. The words "closely comparable" appear where other local authorities are to be used as a yardstick. However, for some reason the word "closely" has been omitted from the Bill. Therefore, only the word "comparable" appears, which seems rather wide. I think it is legitimate to ask the Minister to explain why the word "closely" has been omitted. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00580"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we considered carefully whether the word "closely" added anything substantive to the legislation and concluded that it did not. The word implies a degree of closeness which can in some way be measured, and that beyond some unspecified limit an authority is no longer "closely" comparable to another one, while still being comparable. Although we believe it is quite possible to compare one authority with another we do not think that the comparisons can be made against a yardstick which permits the kind of test which the noble Lord seeks. The word therefore does not add to the meaning of the legislation and can quite readily be dropped.<lb/>
I could put the matter further in context by explaining briefly how we determine what are the comparable authorities to any particular authority, but I do not think that would necessarily usefully add to the noble Lord's point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00581"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. One wonders how, as regards earlier legislation, the Minister would have defended his position if someone had said "closely" was tying the Minister down too much. I feel that he would have been just as zealous in defending the inclusion of the word "closely" as he is now in saying that it is unnecessary and misleading. However, in view of his explanation I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00582">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00584"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 173A:
<quote>Page 36, line 40, leave out sub-paragraph (4).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00585">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment objects to the principle that the Secretary of State is able to take account of balances in the general fund of the local authority when determining a lower level of community charge. I understand that no such power exists at the moment and therefore the Secretary of State should have no right to become involved in aspects of councils' finances other than their determination of the community charge. The amendment would restrict the powers of the Secretary of State to reduce the community charge by reference only to the so-called excessive expenditure. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00586">5.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00587"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, where the Secretary of State proposes a reduction in an authority's community charge he may take into account an authority's balances. This is being added to the provision&#x2014;repeated from the present legislation&#x2014;that an authority may not compensate for a reduction in
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0031"/>
<col>45</col>
community charge payments by borrowing. Taken together those two provisions will mean that a reduction in community charge will be effective both in securing savings for the local taxpayers and in securing a real reduction in the authority's expenditure. That is important because if the authority seeks to evade the effects of a reduction in the community charge by using balances to sustain a high level of expenditure, it is obviously building up trouble for its taxpayers in the following year.<lb/>
This is a financially prudent provision which is entirely consistent with the overall objective of Schedule 3, the principle of which we have already discussed. I hope that the noble Lord will accept my explanation and not press the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00588"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the difficulty about the Minister's explanation is that the Government and the Secretary of State have managed very well without needing to take account of any surplus funds available to the local authority, and it is disappointing that they have now suddenly decided that they must have access to these surpluses. On reflection the Government will find that there are a number of local authorities who are not very happy, and they may not necessarily be local authorities of the persuasion of this side of the House. However, having heard the explanation, and disappointed though I may be, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

The amendment proposes that the word "shall" be substituted for the word "may". I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00599"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I should make it clear that it is envisaged that every local authority will receive revenue support grant. All the calculations made to show how the new grant system will work have been done on that basis. The word "may" is included to cover the remote possibility that an authority might one day have so much income from non-domestic rates and other sources that it would be fairer to give all the grant to other authorities. That
<col>46</col>
position might arise from a massive industrial development in a small authority. However, I again emphasise that we do not see any authority being in such a position at present. We merely think it prudent to cater for such circumstances in case they ever arise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00600"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that appears to be a belt and braces approach.

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00603"><member>The Deputy Speaker (Lord Aylestone)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we come to Amendment No. 179. If this is carried, Amendment No. 180 cannot be moved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00604"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 179:
<quote>Page 39, line 16, leave out paragraph 1</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00605">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I think we must first see what happens to Amendment No. 179. The schedule is headed:
<quote>"Revenue support grants".</quote>
Line 15 states:
<quote>"Determination of aggregate amount".</quote>
This deals with how the aggregate amount of grant is to be determined. Let us read the schedule to see whether we can learn anything from doing so. Paragraph 1(1) reads:
<quote>"For the purpose of determining the estimated aggregate amount of the revenue support grants payable to local authorities for any financial year, the Secretary of State shall determine".</quote>
There is no argument about that:
<quote>"the Secretary of State shall determine".</quote>
Indeed, the paragraph concludes:
<quote>"and may, from time to time, re-determine".</quote>
How, we do not know. What, we do not know. The paragraph continues:
<quote>"(a) the aggregate amount which he estimates is to be available".</quote>
I repeat, what,
<quote>"he estimates is to be available".</quote>
Nobody else is involved. At this point even the Treasury does not come in. It is the Secretary of State who estimates. The paragraph goes on:
<quote>"(b) the portion of that amount which the Secretary of State estimates will be allocated &#x2026; for that year in respect of such services"&#x2014;</quote>
What services?
<quote>"as the Secretary of State may determine".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00606">Therefore, the Secretary of State determines, the Secretary of State estimates and, again, the Secretary of States determines. That is very illuminating. Nobody can say yea or nay. It is entirely in the control of the Secretary of State.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00607">With all due respect, it is not enlightening to have, as we have here:
<quote>"Determination of aggregate amount".</quote>
It tells us nothing. It is surely a proclamation that the Secretary of State will do what he likes and determine
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0032"/>
<col>47</col>
what he likes and that everyone else must lump it. I should like to hear the justification for paragraph 1(1) in this part of the schedule.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00608">There is no need for the Minister to look for help. The Secretary of State is not here. The noble Lord is on his own. However, I now see that the cavalry has arrived. I hope he can justify this and can give us some enlightenment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00609"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was somewhat puzzled by the amendment because it appeared to increase the Secretary of State's discretion rather than constrain it.<lb/>
Paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 repeats the existing provisions of Section 2 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1966 but in a simplified form. The Secretary of State first determines the aggregate of grants to local authorities in respect of their relevant expenditure. This is commonly called aggregate exchequer grant. He then estimates how much will be payable as specific grant such as police grant. The rest is then available to be paid as revenue support grants.<lb/>
This method of calculation was introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, when he was Secretary of State for Scotland. It has stood the test of time and I must congratulate him on its widespread acceptance and on its durability. It is a tribute to his 1966 Act that we are, in effect, simply replicating his arrangements in the new system. There may be differences of view as to the amount of grant that should be paid but not over the process by which it should be determined.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00610"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is all very well for the Minister to plead me and my perfection of draftsmanship when giving powers to the Secretary of State, but he will remember what has happened since then. What was the proportion of that relevant expenditure that I gave, which was determined after the aggregate of grant had been drawn up? The reason why there has been no demand for an explanation hitherto is because I was so generous to local authorities. There was no outcry from the local authorities in 1966.<lb/>
I do not know what age the noble Lord was then, but I do not suppose he was paying very much attention in those days to rate support grant or meetings with the Convention of Royal Burghs or the Association of County Councils and the counties and cities, as they were in those days&#x2014;they have changed their names. In fact, I gave over 70 per cent. of the relevant expenditure in grant. This year it is 75.6 per cent. and that is one of the reasons why rates have gone up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00611"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is 55 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00612"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: That is right. Rates have increased because the Government have not been paying their due share of much that is national expenditure. That is not determined by the local authorities themselves but by the actions of this House; by decisions of the Government in respect of
<col>48</col>
teachers' salaries, the number of teachers, extensions of educational opportunity, and so on. The more we have done that, the worse the situation has become.<lb/>
It is from the point of view of the Government's behaviour that we question whether it is wise to give this degree of power to an irresponsible Secretary of State. In the next amendment I propose certain aspects that should be borne in mind in making these determinations. There is no reason why we should trust the Government with this power at the present time; that is why I have tabled this amendment. Therefore, the Minister should not plead the fact that I was so good and my draftsmanship even better in 1966. The position has become much worse for the Scottish Office since 1966 and more so since 1979. It is dreadful that, as justification for the words in the schedule, we should be given something that was rightly done 20 or 21 years ago when I was a boy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00613"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, briefly, surely the noble Lord's amendment is not concerned, apart from the forensics, with the functions of the Secretary of State as regards relevant expenditure and whether the Government do or do not pay their right share. Its only concern is with the functions of the Secretary of State from the point of view of administrative law. As far as I can see, my noble friend Lord Glenarthur is totally right, this paragraph to the schedule constrains the power rather than extends it.

This is a last ditch attempt to do something to protect those sections of the community who are the worst off and who will be involved in paying contributions towards the community rate should this Bill go through as it is.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00624">I know that the Government will say that we have already discussed this matter when amendments were
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0033"/>
<col>49</col>
put forward, first, to give 100 per cent. rebate and then, by a further amendment, to give a 95 per cent. rebate to people in this category. They will also say that they cannot possibly consider this amendment because it is their established principle that everybody should contribute; that is embodied in this Bill and that is the purpose of the Bill. However, the Government have principles other than those that are enshrined in this Bill. One of them, which is embodied in the Social Security Act 1986, constitutes protection for the worst off in our community with a determination, which they have repeated again and again, to fight poverty by focusing resources on the poorest sections of the population. That was the whole theme of the 1986 Social Security Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00625">Surely there is an inconsistency between the principles embodied in the 1986 Social Security Act and the determination expressed in this Bill to make even the poorest people pay. There is the provision for a rebate of up to 80 per cent. but that still leaves 20 per cent. to be paid, however hard up those people are. It has been estimated that there may be cases in which a childless unemployed couple with an income of a little over &#x00A3;63 per week would be called upon to pay &#x00A3;10.40 a month as a result of this legislation, and there may well be far more serious cases than that. That seems to us to be monstrous at a time when we know that in certain areas poverty is very acute and when the Government have said that such acute poverty has to be fought and that that is the basis of their social security legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00626">I ask the Government to show consistency between the legislation that they put through last year and the present Bill. We should like to see that inconsistency overcome by ensuring that income support is enhanced to a point at which the person who is paying the 20 per cent. (which that person will still have to pay even with an 80 per cent. rebate) will be no worse off, because that would feature as an element to be included in income support as was foreshadowed in the 1986 Social Security Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00627">The Government will say that it is another way of ensuring that the rebate is given to the very poorest people in the country, which is what we are trying to do. They attach great importance to what they see as the principle that everybody should transfer the money out of their own pockets into the pocket of the local authority so that they learn to have some responsibility for the demands that they make on local authority expenditure. In fact this will physically take place because money will come from the DHSS, go to the person so concerned and then that person will continue to pay the 20 per cent. that they are required to pay under this legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00628">To some of us it seems a ridiculous way to proceed. It would be much more sensible to give the 100 per cent. rebate for which we asked in previous legislation. That has been lost and the excuse for defeating that measure was that everybody must have the experience of paying something to the local authority. Very much as a second best, we put forward the proposal that the extent of the rebate should be incorporated into the income support that is to be given in such cases. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps the noble Baroness can enlighten me.</membercontribution></p>

I shall not be moving Amendment No. 188AA. I hope that that clarifies the position for the noble Lady. She is doing fine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00631"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that explanation. At Committee stage I tabled and spoke to a probing amendment, seeking an assurance from the Government that couples in receipt of maximum rates rebate under the Social Security Act 1986 should not be put at a financial disadvantage by the passing of this legislation. The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, pointed out that for various reasons (which he gave in col. 1194 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 9th April last but which I shall not repeat) my amendment was impracticable, which explanation I accept. He gave me the assurance that:
<quote>"A large majority of the most needy groups in society will gain, or be no worse off. Among those are unemployed couples and other couples on income support who have no children".</quote>
I welcome that assurance, but there still remain couples who have children and I have had no assurance about their fate.<lb/>
The Minister also mentioned the press release in which his right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave illustrations of figures for the thresholds of income support and the rebates payable. He said:
<quote>"If those have not been drawn to the attention of Members of the Committee, I shall ensure that that is done for clarification".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i>9/4/87; col. 1192.]</quote>
It was done but I am not as clear as I should like to be about it. I got out my crystal ball and my pocket calculator and I thought that I was doing quite nicely until I looked at the notes. Note 1 seemed to bear no relationship to any of the figures in the illustrations; nor did the illustrations tell me how couples with children will fare in real terms compared with their situation at present. Moreover, what about couples with children who are over the age of 11 or those who have only one child or more than two children?<lb/>
Perhaps I am being very stupid but I must ask the Minister to clarify this matter a little further and to produce some assurance that in setting the income support levels for the year 1989&#x2013;90 the Secretary of State will bear in mind the incidence of community charge on those people at least in Scotland. That is all I am asking.<lb/>
I should like to say a word about Amendments Nos. 188AA and 188AAA that have been tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear. I have only just received Amendment No. 188AAA and I am not familiar with it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00633"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness. So far as I can see, subsection (3) of Amendment No. 188AAA is to some extent a differently phrased version of my amendment. It is rather narrower than mine because it takes account only of the average personal community charge as opposed to the actual community charges in different local authority areas. Under the amendment quite a large number of people in areas with a low community charge would be making a profit whereas people living in areas with a high community charge would be losing out. For that reason I cannot support the amendment. However, I should be most grateful if the Minister could give me the assurance about the levels of income support with regard to couples, for which I have asked.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00634">5.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00635"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Amendment No. 188AAA sets out what I assume Amendment No. 188AA intended. It supports in terms the principle of the 100 per cent-. maximum rebate. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for signifying consent. That is the principle which the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, contends in Amendment No. 185.<lb/>
All these grouped amendments raise the fundamental question of principle as to whether rebates under Clause 24 can be up to 100 per cent. By the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, it is sought to enshrine&#x2014;no more and no less&#x2014;the 100 per cent. rebate as one of the governing principles of the regulations under Clause 24. The governing principle of these regulations was a point which I sought to raise with your Lordships for discussion on a previous occasion.<lb/>
The amendments of the noble Baroness to some extent follow the same initial approach of Amendment No. 188 in the name of the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and in my name, which takes into account liability to pay any community charge subject to rebate. As noble Lords appreciate at once this is a more flexible approach. It is, or could be adequate&#x2014;I stress the words "could be" because this depends on the implementing regulations, and here one comes back again to the governing principle&#x2014;to ease the shoe where it pinches on the ability to pay as regards grants under Part II of the 1986 Act. The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, proceeds on that basis alone by supporting the principle of 100 per cent. rebate and by importing an average concept of community charge instead of region by region. I may be wrong&#x2014;this is a difficult Bill and I am open to correction&#x2014;but I thought that the House slightly disapproved of that concept at an earlier stage. I thought that the House welcomed the region by region approach as distinct from the "average" approach. However, I may be wrong on that; it is only my impression. I have not been able to look it up.<lb/>
Therefore, although I understand and applaud the spirit, I cannot support the amendment of the noble
<col>52</col>
Baroness, Lady Seear. With the utmost respect it seems to me that the amendment of the noble Baroness, and that of the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and myself, are in a sense not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill. Although both sets of amendments deal with the income support grant they do not lay down any governing principles governing the regulations under Clause 24 for rebate concerning the severely disabled who are unable to pay, or others in receipt of state benefit and allowances, who are unable to meet the community charge&#x2014;the point taken by all of us&#x2014;save out of government funds.<lb/>
The crucial question of principle is this. Where there are those unable to pay the community charge, will these graduated rebates of up to 100 per cent. be available or will the Government take the other course and provide machinery under the regulations for a determination of graduated charges by rebate according to means which will include in the grant sufficient funds to meet the community charge&#x2014;in other words, that would enhance, to use the words of the noble Lady, the support <i>in toto.</i><lb/>
I do not at this stage wish to anticipate but one cannot get away from a consideration which has worried me throughout progress on the Bill. What are the governing principles of these regulations as to rebate? I raised the matter in Committee at col. 775. I raised it on Report at col. 1658. I respectfully ask&#x2014;although I would not be discourteous and demand&#x2014;for a measure of clarification from the Minister.<lb/>
At one time I was attracted to the idea of exemption under Clause 8(7) for those in receipt of income support grant. I changed my mind for reasons which are on record. For reasons that are again on record I have also changed my mind in respect of the money merry-go-round. I think that I was wrong about that. I accept the first limb of the amendment of the noble Baroness&#x2014;whether it be Amendment No. 188AA or Amendment No. 188AAA&#x2014;which marries with the fundamental approach of Amendment No. 188 in the name of the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. But the second limb stands open to serious objection for the reasons that I have sought to give. With the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, I seek assurance and comfort&#x2014;it is no more than that&#x2014;as to the Government's intentions about couples with children.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00636"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this stage I do not want to prolong the debate much longer but to agree with the amendments put down by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear. I apologise to her for not hearing her opening remarks. I do not want to go into the convoluted arguments that we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, about the Government's intentions and so on. I share his concern about the absence of regulations. We are discussing something that does not exist at this moment&#x2014;not for the first time. It is difficult to envisage or to anticipate what might be in regulations when trying to discuss such details.<lb/>
My major concern is with those people who at present are entitled to 100 per cent. rebates. It is clear that that principle should be enshrined in statute. The people concerned should not be made worse off as a result of the Bill. It was made clear that the 1986 social
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0035"/>
<col>53</col>
security legislation was the forerunner. A figure was put in, a nominal figure admittedly, but it was included at 20 per cent., and that figure has been used right the way through and is now becoming enshrined in this legislation. In the absence of the regulations we have to work on that figure of 20 per cent.<lb/>
The noble Lord in debates on previous clauses in this Bill announced a number of concessions. For those everybody is grateful. Concessions are always welcome, but the concessions stop short&#x2014;the Minister said so himself&#x2014;at the physically disabled in the community. As I understand it, concessions may affect residential homes and people living in those homes, but they will not affect the physically disabled living in the community. My concern is that most of those who live in the community now are receiving 100 per cent. rate rebates. The Bill ensures that they will not get a 100 per cent. rebate but will be charged 20 per cent. of the community charge, whatever that might be. That must mean a worsening of their living standards and other conditions, which must be of concern to all of us, because those people are at the most vulnerable end, the receiving end, of any legislation and certainly of the Bill.<lb/>
Given the difficulties that I have outlined about discussing this in a vacuum, because we are not sure what the regulations will be or what they will say, we can only assume. It is a fairly strong assumption, however. We also know&#x2014;because I sat through the debates on the social security legislation, as did the noble Lord, he will recall&#x2014;of the anger and concern that this 20 per cent. charge contained in that Act has caused throughout the country.<lb/>
Voluntary organisations are still concerned about the 20 per cent., charge on rates. The Social Security Advisory Committee expected that figure to be used in this legislation. I read from pages 11 and 12 of the Fifth Report of the Social Security Advisory Committee, which says quite clearly that if domestic rates are replaced by a community charge the administrative problems will be significantly exacerbated. The committee believes that it would result in a real cut in the value of the safety net for the poorest people in society with increased hardship or increased debt. The committee was not only talking about the Social Security Act 1986, but it was anticipating the community charge as we know it now. As far as I am concerned, the major concern must be for those disabled people still living in the community who until now would have been receiving 100 per cent. rate rebates and who will have quite a serious cut in their incomes if this Bill is allowed to go through in its present form. I support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00637"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate the considerable concern which has been expressed at all stages in our debates on the Bill about the Government's intention that under the reformed scheme of housing benefits which applies to rates as from 1st April 1988 and on which the community charge rebate scheme will be based everyone should make at least a minimum contribution towards their local taxation. We have heard arguments which strike directly at this principle by seeking to increase the maximum rebate to 100 per cent.<lb/>
<col>54</col>
As we have heard, the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness and the amendments put down by the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway seek to tackle the matter in slightly different ways by proposing a requirement, in the case of the noble Baroness, that the level of income support should be set so as to leave individuals not worse off having paid that community charge. At the technical level Amendment No. 188AA, which I appreciate has been superseded by Amendment No. 188AAA, would have gone too far anyway.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00638"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: I shall not be moving Amendment No. 188AA, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00639"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in that case I shall remark upon it no further. Amendment No. 188, in the name of the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, is perhaps better focused in the way that Amendment No. 188AA was originally focused, but in both cases the general principle at stake seems clear enough.<lb/>
The Government hold firmly to the principle that it will help improve local accountability if each individual makes some contribution to his local taxation bill. At present substantial numbers of people receive 100 per cent. rebates. While this provision was introduced no doubt for very understandable reasons, it creates a situation in which a significant proportion of those who are nominally ratepayers have no financial interest in the cost of the local services that they enjoy and the financial implications of the policies of the local councils for which they vote. The requirement to make a minimum contribution will change that.<lb/>
Taken together with the introduction of the community charge, which will substantially widen the tax base, our policies will provide for a great increase in accountability and I believe an important strengthening of local democracy. The question raised by these amendments is whether, having paid at least the minimum contribution, people will be worse off than would otherwise have been the case. It is impossible to consider just the proposed minimum contribution in isolation. Instead we must consider the overall impact of the whole package of benefit changes being introduced on 1st April 1988, discussed last year in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, described.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00640"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on that point we know that those changes were brought in to save &#x00A3;500 million. It was purely a saving exercise. We also know that more than half that &#x00A3;500 million was to come from this 20 per cent. The intention of the Government was that over half the savings on the social security benefit side were to come from the introduction of the 20 per cent. It was not a question of accountability; it was originally a cost-cutting exercise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00641">6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00642"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has slightly misinterpreted my meaning. The measure of accountability to which I was referring related to the Bill as a whole and the principles enshrined in it. If he will allow me to develop my argument a little further, I hope he will begin to understand what we are saying. When we discussed that package of benefit changes, it
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0036"/>
<col>55</col>
was illustrated in Great Britain in the technical annex to the social security White Paper. On the assumption of a minimum contribution of 20 per cent., it showed that the majority of people on income support will not experience any overall reduction in their disposable income after meeting the minimum contribution to their rates.<lb/>
Of course there will be gainers and losers. I suggest that is bound to be the case in any wide-ranging reforms. But the fact that the overall position is as I have described it, with the majority experiencing no overall reduction in their disposable income must, I suggest, temper the force of the argument that explicit provisions need to be written in, addressing specifically the question of the minimum contribution.<lb/>
The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, referred to the press notice on how the rebate system will work.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00643"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord turns to that point, I think he said that paying the minimum contribution of 20 per cent. for people on income support would have no effect on their overall disposable income. Is that what he said?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00644"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is what I said when I quoted the technical annex to the social security White Paper. But if the noble Lord will bear with me for a minute, r shall return to the theme shortly. Before I do so, I pick up a point made by the noble Lady when she referred, for example, to a couple who are unemployed with two children under 11. They are quoted in the document, and the noble Lady asked what would be the case if the children were over 11. If they were over 11, we should have to add &#x00A3;5 a head, which is &#x00A3;10 in total, so the income support level rises from the illustrative figure in the table attached to that press notice to &#x00A3;83.95.<lb/>
However, further than that, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, concerned as I understand him to be about the governing principles being lacking in this case, appeared to be suggesting that the additions to income support should vary region by region and not on average, as proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear. A hugely complex administrative machinery would be necessary to try to do this in the way my noble friend proposes. I hope that he will accept from me that, while I can understand the point he is making, the practical feasibility would be such as to make it virtually unworkable.<lb/>
I also emphasise that the figures available so far have all been illustrative and that until the rates of income support are set this autumn, it is premature to draw absolutely firm conclusions about who may or may not be worse off. Much will happen between now and then which will need to be taken into account and which will influence the factors affecting the setting of the income support rates. One of those factors will be that many people will for the first time be making a contribution towards their rates. In setting income support levels we shall take into account the impact of this on the most vulnerable groups.<lb/>
I cannot make a detailed commitment now, but I hope that your Lordships will find what I have been able to say about the position of vulnerable groups to be a positive response to the concern which I think
<col>56</col>
underlies all these amendments. For the reasons I have explained, therefore, and with the assurance which I have given about vulnerable groups, which I think very much helps both my noble friend Lord Campbell and indeed the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, I believe that a specific amendment of the kind which the noble Baroness has put down is not necessary or desirable. I hope with that explanation that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00645"><member>Lord Sanderson of Bowden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been most interested in hearing what my noble friend has said. Let us cut out most of his speech and concentrate, if I hear him right, on the suggestion that in setting income support levels the Government will take into account the impact on the most vulnerable groups. I had a letter today, as I expect many noble Lords did, from the Social Security Consortium, which said that the noble Baroness's amendments did not contradict the position of paying the 20 per cent., but then there should be compensation for such payment through income support levels. I think what we have heard from the Government today through my noble friend must mean just that. I should be very disappointed if the most disadvantaged people in the community, as I said at Second Reading, should be in any way put in a position where they have no money and are not able to pay. So this may well be the let-out for us on a most important part of this legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00646"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too listened with great care to what the Minister said. It was difficult to take in precisely his phraseology and I would be glad if he could confirm that he said what the noble Lord, Lord Sanderson, suggested.<lb/>
On the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, No. 188AAA, I feel that although in principle clearly she is trying to do something very similar, this approach would not work out quite right because the level of the community charge which will be set in individual regions will be uneven&#x2014;and it will not only be in individual regions but, as we know, for example, by looking at Strathclyde and Lothian regions, very different in different districts of Scotland. It will vary enormously.<lb/>
So if a person was getting an amount not less than the average of the community charge over the whole of Scotland, some people would be getting considerably more than they had to pay and others considerably less. Although it would probably be impossible to be totally fair to everybody&#x2014;it always is&#x2014;that seems to me to be building into the Bill an unfairness and a discrepancy which are not necessary. I hope very much that the noble Baroness will not press the amendment on those grounds if on no other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00647"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with very great interest to what the Minister said and also to what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. This amendment is a compromise; it is not what we would wish if we could have our own way. I fully accept that it would be much more desirable if the system could be regionally based for the reasons which Baroness Carnegy gave.<lb/>
As the Minister said, one was aware that that would be immensely complicated and in a very imperfect Bill
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0037"/>
<col>57</col>
this is an imperfect amendment. However, we think it has more chance of being accepted than the more desirable but very much less administratively practical amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, and the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. That is why I fully accept that it is not by any means ideal. We should much have preferred the 100 per cent. rebate to the poor and to leave it at that, but we could not get it. What we are trying to do here is something which we thought the Government would find practical to operate and would be a step in the direction in which we wanted to go.<lb/>
The Minister replied very carefully to the debate which has taken place. He told us&#x2014;and this is exceedingly unsatisfactory, although it is not his fault&#x2014;that we do not know at this stage many of the matters of cardinal importance which will determine the impact of the Bill. We do not have these housing benefit regulations. We are legislating in the dark on some of the most important aspects of the Bill and on the important effects it will have on the most vulnerable section of the community. This is a criticism not of the noble Lord but of the way in which, for obvious reasons, the Bill is being presented. It is asking us to do something which your Lordships' House should never be asked to do, which is to make decisions with quite inadequate information to allow us to judge what the impact of those decisions will be.<lb/>
The noble Lord was trying to say in his final reply that the Government were aware that hardship would be created by the introduction of the community charge without the full rebate and that something would be done about it. The noble Lord is an honourable man and I am sure he means it, but this is too vague. First, we are asked to accept legislation in the light of regulations of cardinal importance which we do not have in front of us; and, secondly, we are asked to accept what is at best a vague promise from the noble Lord. While I thank him for the spirit in which that was said, I cannot accept it and I must test the opinion of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00651">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00652">6.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00653"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 184B:
<quote>Page 20, line 27, after ("or) insert ("individual").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00654">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of this amendment is to show that the fundamental concept behind the Bill, which is the introduction of a personal charge, is incompatible with Sections 28 to 31 of the Social Security Act, which from 1st April next year will introduce a benefit system based on household support income. This contrasts with the scheme proposed in the Bill, which of course will deal with an individual tax for everyone in the household. It is possible that some administrative arrangements can be made to overcome the problem of the two systems working together. However, it will still not detract from the fundamental difference in the two concepts and methods of taxing a household.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00655">If we look at the case of a married couple living together as man and wife, the community charges will be added together and the joint income will be reached by adding these two on a household basis, including non-dependants' income. This will be taken into account before a rebate level is established. If this is done on a joint basis, which is their individual liability, at the moment there would be a fifty-fifty split, whereas when the Bill comes in it will be quite different and there will be one person severally and jointly responsible for paying the community charge. But nevertheless the community charge will be paid by both the man and wife or the people living together as man and wife. We have a real contradiction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00656">We also have the problem that the Scottish Office will be dealing with another department of government, because it will be operating a quite different system from that south of the Border in terms of household income support. It will not be household income support in Scotland; it will be the personal tax. There is also considerable difficulty within a household in that anyone over 18 will be paying the full tax as well.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00657">I hope that the Minister will try to explain to the House whether there is any possibility of an administrative arrangement that can clearly show that these two different ways of working are supportable, and also of course without causing undue stress to the Scottish people as against those south of the Border. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00658"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I understand the concern which lies behind this amendment and Amendment No. 174B, which I believe is connected
<col>60</col>
with it. I can, however, give a clear and unequivocal undertaking that the rebate system which will be brought forward in due course will apply to all those who are liable to pay the personal community charge and the collective community charge contribution.<lb/>
It is correct that at present only householders who are actually liable to pay rates are eligible to apply for housing benefit for rates. The modifications to the Social Security Act 1986, which will be made in regulations, will however ensure that the community charge rebate scheme will indeed apply to all individuals who are liable for those charges.<lb/>
Couples will continue to be assessed on the basis of their joint income, as indeed is the case at present. Non-dependants' income is not taken into account in the assessment at present. There is a flat-rate deduction from rebate when there are non-dependants. In future no such deductions will be made and non-dependants will be separately assessed for a community charge rebate in their own right. Perhaps the noble Lord was labouring under something of a misapprehension when he expressed that concern.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00659"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that my noble friend's concern is well justified. We are working on the basis at the moment of what is going to happen in 1986, where it is easy to determine a person's income in relation to pensions and other things which are universal throughout the whole country. In 1988 100 per cent. rent rebates will be admitted and 80 per cent. rates rebates within that.<lb/>
For a year Scotland and England will be treated absolutely alike. But then there is a new burden in respect of those who are claiming rebates in 1989. You will have then a new burden upon Scottish applicants in respect of which they will get an 80 per cent. rebate at maximum. While in England and Wales it will be 80 per cent. of rates, in Scotland it will be 80 per cent. of the community charge. Therefore you have people probably in receipt of exactly the same amount of money but paying different sums. A husband and wife will be liable for about &#x00A3;600, whereas in England and Wales they will be liable in respect of 80 per cent. of their rates. You can take it that most of the people who are applying for rebates are not paying that amount in rates.<lb/>
That unfairness will remain unless, as my noble friend suggested, you get individual assessments. We hoped that the noble Lord might have said on the last amendment that he was going to give us individual and different income levels acceptable in respect of rates, but we are no further forward. We do not know whether he is going to do that. If he does not do the one, he has to do the other if there is to be fairness between those of exactly the same circumstances in England and Wales and in Scotland.<lb/>
For instance, for the young unemployed applying for rebate within the present known scales that are going to be applied, I think the allowable income for the 18s to 24s is &#x00A3;24. In relation to the over 25s the income allowed is &#x00A3;30.60. Yet when it comes to the question of the community charge, the community charge is exactly the same. Probably about &#x00A3;60 a year will be the 20 per cent., and I am talking now within the one country, Scotland. There is going to be
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0039"/>
<col>61</col>
unfairness there between the 18s to 24s, because their income level is lower, and the others in respect of which it is &#x00A3;30.60. One is going to pay 4.8 per cent. of their income as assessed and I think the other is something like 2.4 per cent.<lb/>
If we take it in money terms there is unfairness there unless we sort out the business of the different scales in Scotland. There is no justification for a charge which is going to be universal to the individual and which is the same, and yet for income to be assessed at different levels. An 18 year-old does not eat less or cheaper food than a 24 year-old. Or does he have to eat cheaper food? Similarly, does his dress have to be cheaper? There is no fairness here between 18 to 24 year-olds and the 24 year-olds and over who are applying for housing benefit rebate.<lb/>
The charge is to apply to Scotland only, and there is going to be a difference between Scotland and England. There will be unfairness for young people, the unemployed and pensioners until such time as there is a Bill applying the same general principles of the community charge to England and Wales. I do not think that even the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, would call that a benefit. Far from it; it is a considerable disadvantage when people in the same circumstances are treated differently because of the introduction of something which is not rates but which is a very onerous charge in respect of the poor.<lb/>
As to what we have done with respect to students, there are wealthy students as well as those who are going to feel very hard done by at having to pay 20 per cent., which is what is suggested by the amendment, although once again we do not know because the Government have not told us. This will apply in Scotland only and not in England. Suppose that the sum is &#x00A3;60. That is a great deal to a student. We get into this difficulty simply because we are applying a different burden in Scotland from that in England and Wales. Until such time as the England and Wales community charge is applied and there is equality in that respect, we are going to risk considerable difficulties with the deliberate unfairness to the vulnerable categories in Scotland. This will not be sorted out unless we make the changes in the DHSS scales in 1988 for that one year between 1988 and 1989, and then until such time as we get the gap closed between England and Wales and Scotland.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will look at this question very seriously indeed. I do not think they have considered the need for an individual rebate. This has to be done. We have to have fairness. We have made so many changes in this Bill; we have been forced to make changes that run across all the principles which were laid down originally, when everyone was going to pay it and everyone was going to pay the same. It is not working out that way at all. I hope the Government will think again and not brush it aside by saying, "Well, it will run counter to the principle". We have broken the principle before. We want to have fairness within Scotland between the 18 to 24 year-olds and those over 24 who are applying for rebates through housing benefit.<lb/>
There is no fairness there. The young unemployed man does not pay rates, but now he has to pay the community charge. In England he does not pay rates
<col>62</col>
but he will not be paying a community charge. The burden is there. These unfairnesses are being deliberately put in, and they will cause considerable trouble in Scotland. I do not need to ram it home. I do not want to give grist to certain separationist-minded people in respect of it, but this is a gift to them. I am sorry about that, but the Government are not being fair to the poor.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00672">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the Highlands and I have spoken to it previously. With no apology I again bring forward the whole situation because it is of extreme importance to the Highlands. Better men an better governments&#x2014;Conservative Governments at that&#x2014;have in the past had a tremendous concern for the Highlands and for the social problems there. They have made many concessions and put forward many positive schemes to help. This must be the first piece of legislation that will do great harm to the Highlands. It is generally accepted that an extra &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million will be taken from the pockets of those living in what are disadvantaged areas. That must be wrong, in view of the great efforts being made to preserve and improve life there, and also to keep the Highlands as an area which may be enjoyed by the rest of the population.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00673">The Government and the Minister persist in telling the House that the Bill will have little effect and how many households will be better off and how many worse off. The Highland region has carried out a study of the effect on a number of selected areas. It will be for the benefit of the House if I quote from the study. No doubt the Minister has read it with great care and will have an answer. The authority studied a number of regions typical of the area&#x2014;an island crofting parish in Kilmuir, Skye; two remote mainland crofting parishes in Durness, north west Sutherland, and Ardnamurchan, West Lochaber; a small northern farming parish, Bower, in Caithness (all places I know well); an east coast farming parish, Logie in Easter Ross; a peripheral public housing area, Balloan in Inverness and a highly rated private housing area, St. Stephens in Inverness.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00674">That is a pretty fair selection of areas in the Highlands. All had different characteristics. I shall not deal with the whole report but I shall quote the results. In the crofting area of Kilmuir, 90 per cent. of the houses would have paid more, and over &#x00A3;61,000 would have been removed from the local economy. In Durness, 91 per cent. of the houses would have paid more, and over &#x00A3;23,000 would have been removed from the local economy. In Ardnamurchan, 67 per cent. of the houses would have paid more and &#x00A3;33,000 would have been removed. In Bower 86 per cent. of the houses would have paid more and &#x00A3;30,000 would have been removed. In Logie, a rather better area, 54 per cent. of the houses would have paid more and &#x00A3;5,500 would have been removed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00675">In the public housing area of Balloan in Inverness, 57 per cent. of the houses would have paid more and nearly &#x00A3;23,500 would have been removed. In only one area&#x2014;the private housing area in Inverness&#x2014;80 per cent. of the houses would have paid less and over &#x00A3;124,000 less would have been required to be paid from the local economy. It is the pattern of the whole Bill that the rich are better off and appear to benefit

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00677"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: I shall forgive the noble Lord but I shall not give way. There will be an opportunity later on. In bringing forward the amendment, I think that it is enormously important that the Government should do something about the matter. It is all very well to say that there will be individual chances to apply for rebates. But this is an extraordinary burden when there is a simple answer, and the simple answer is to give the same sort of remission that the crofting counties had before.<lb/>
Amendment No. 188AB would also benefit a number of people who are not official crofters, and they are important too, because people really have enough to bear in the Highlands without actually having their income dropped. I know that everyone will say that crofters have other jobs, but even if you are a roadman in the West of Sutherland it does not make you an enormously rich chap. You still have a lot of extra costs to bear. Certainly it is not an inducement to make someone from the City of London go to West Sutherland even if he knew he could get a job as a roadman as well as having a croft. We need these concessions if we want to hold the population and keep the Highlands viable. I think this amendment would go a long way towards that, and I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00678"><member>Lord Gray</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we debated in Committee an amendment identical to Amendment No. I 88AB, I explained that while I was sympathetic to the principle I found the wording unacceptable because it was drawn so widely that it would give rebate entitlement to many who were certainly not genuine crofters. That remains my position.<lb/>
However, as regards the other amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, has just spoken, No. 188AC, I am a great deal happier. As I read it, it allows for the application of the means test, which is essential, in that it refers to those crofters:
<quote>"who would benefit from relief from local taxation but for the provisions of this Act".</quote>
That qualification would allow the local authority, as I understand it, to apply the principle set out in Section 7(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956, which restricts rebate of rates as of now to working crofters, dependent mainly upon their crofting activities for their livelihood. Although the provision I have referred to will be abolished under this Bill, the principle will by implication remain available for application under Amendment No. 188AC. Also, the amendment is modest, in that it targets the crofter alone and does not extend to those who live with him. It targets him as the recipient of community charge rebate.<lb/>
That said, I entertain certain doubts that the words at the end of the amendment&#x2014;
<quote>"relief from the Community Charge on a comparable scale",&#x2014;</quote>
are really capable of interpretation in the way that I imagine the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, intended. I
<col>66</col>
should have thought it could be a matter of doubt whether they apply to a percentage or to a financial amount.<lb/>
We have heard arguments at earlier stages against both the detail of whether crofters should be accorded some relief and the generality of the argument that they should. At Committee stage my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour argued that others elsewhere engaged in agriculture should receive equal treatment if crofters were to be favoured. However, that argument does not recognise just how small some crofts are or that the very existence of some communities depends on crofting or that some communities have crofting as their essential core.<lb/>
My noble friend also referred to the great amount which is being, and has lately been, done by a multiplicity of agencies to assist the Highlands and Islands. That is true; but it is expenditure on infrastructure or even more direct aid given to improve workaday conditions. It does not put ready cash into the hand of those who must pay the community charge.<lb/>
As to the generality of the argument against making an amendment of the type which has been put before your Lordships this evening, my noble friend Lord Glenarthur argued that it was wrong to single out a particular socio-economic group for special treatment. However, we have heard during our discussions on this Bill that specific groups will receive special treatment. Already, for instance, we have students actually mentioned in the Bill proper. I know that my noble friend the Minister recognises the special place of crofters and crofting within Scotland. I hope that even if he cannot accept either of the amendments put forward this evening, he may yet be able to look favourably on the principles and perhaps help crofters in some way with regard to the community charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00679"><member>Lord Stodart of Leaston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think there is any dispute or quarrel with the facts deployed by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie. It is a hard life: there is no question about that. All the same, I am bound to say&#x2014;and this is not an original remark because it has been referred to already and I think the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, would agree with me&#x2014;that agriculture is under pressure at the moment both inside the Highland area (or perhaps more accurately in the crofting counties) and also outside it.<lb/>
The point I want to emphasise is that, not only now but hitherto, the shoe pinches most on the farm where no practical alternative way of farming exists. Therefore in Angus the noble Lord can grow probably the best strawberries that are on the market and if they do not pay he can move into "Golden Wonder" potatoes; and if they have the colour knocked off them, he can move into "Golden Promise" barley.<lb/>
That is fine. I am not in quite so fortunate a position in the uplands although even I can vary slightly. But there are farms&#x2014;and, as I say, this is where the shoe pinches most&#x2014;where there is no readily alternative means of agricultural production. That is why, quite frankly, much though I sympathise with the money that is going to be taken out of the crofting counties by means of this, I do not think it would be fair on those who are in the category I have described; and many of
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0042"/>
<col>67</col>
them exist outside the area we have been referring to. It is true that, although it still remains a hard life for the crofter, if the stirks sell badly there is just a chance that with his boat he may be able to make up his income by catching lobsters. Many of them do.<lb/>
A second reason perhaps why I am not happy about this amendment is that I hate lines such as 75 acres or &#x00A3;100 rent to be drawn. One immediately runs into trouble with the man who has 76 acres or pays &#x00A3;101 in rent. I say this somewhat sensitively because for years now I have farmed the last farm before the area where hill advantages apply. I am therefore conscious of the unsatisfactory position of drawing lines.<lb/>
It is just possible that I might have had more sympathy with the amendment if the noble Lord had explained the slightly obscure words in paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 188AB:
<quote>"a person to whom subsection (6) of section 22 of the said Act applies".</quote>
It may be somebody of such importance that it would have swept me off my feet.<lb/>
There was reference to the 1897 Act. No doubt the noble Lord has looked that up and if it is a matter of great substance I am sure that he will tell us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00680">7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00681"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Gray made reference to some remarks that I made in a discussion at an earlier stage, of which in the main this is a re-run. It is my belief, with my noble friend Lord Stodart of Leaston, that there are many farmers in other parts of the country who have similar difficulties in not dissimilar circumstances and that the amendment is therefore not a wise one.<lb/>
However, a new element in the discussion was introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, the report by the Highland Regional Council, which I read with great interest. I have a great deal of respect for that council; I have met it and we have discussed many matters in the past. It has produced a document, which, although it makes the case that it does, is enormously misleading. The tables take no account of the effect of the very rebates that we discussed in the previous debate today. The effect of rebates in the Highlands will be enormous for crofters and for other people. This is a very important element in the Highlands. The lower the average income in a given area, the more important rebates will be. Thus the discussion we had is of great significance in regard to the content of the amendments.<lb/>
The right way to help crofters in need&#x2014;and there will be crofters in need&#x2014;will surely be through the normal rebate system. That is the correct way to do it, as applies in the rest of Scotland.<lb/>
In this context, the Highlands Regional Council report, although interesting, is not valid evidence on which to base the argument because it ignores the rebate system, as does the amendment of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00682"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I live on a farm in another less favoured area, although crofting is not the kind of farming there. I agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, said
<col>68</col>
about crofting. It is very important. I hope that whatever legislation is enacted at no point will the crofters be left out or treated in any way less well than anyone else.<lb/>
In the Highlands there is the excellent Highlands and Islands Development Board, which has done a wonderful job and is well supported and financed. There have also been considerable grants from the EC for the less favoured areas of the Highlands, all of which I strongly approve of.<lb/>
When it comes down to singling them out for treatment that does not cover other less favoured areas in Scotland in regard to agriculture, one will get into difficulties. Many farmers in my area are experiencing difficulties, not necessarily because they have only a small area but because the land is very poor and the markets are not good. People are talking about more and more forestry and less and less farming; and this may happen. I do not know.<lb/>
I should like to be sure that we do not take on something that is favourable to one kind of less favoured area farming, which I would call crofting, and leave out the rest. In my view, it would be dangerous to agree to the amendment because it will only stir up many other people who will ask why they too are not being helped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00683"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Mackie of Benshie has probably been less than generous to the Highlands. He read a report from the Highlands region. I read it with interest and thought that it proved its case very well.<lb/>
The definition of crofter and cottar in the report was based on a rental of &#x00A3;200. The noble Lord is limiting it considerably by suggesting &#x00A3;100. He is therefore being generous to the Government, probably hopeful that they will see the point that one is dealing mainly with real crofters and people who are up against it.<lb/>
The 1956 Act made this mandatory. There was no question of a rebate scheme. The local authorities in the crofter counties were told that they had to reduce by 50 per cent. the rents of crofters, cottars or the like without any definition of acreage or rental, and of course this has caused considerable heartache to people who employ and have on their land, crofters.<lb/>
No-one can argue against that. If one did that in 1956 in respect of the croft, what does one do in respect of the crofter? Taking an average of three personal charges&#x2014;I think that these were the figures that came out as the average in the crofter county areas&#x2014;it is probably &#x00A3;600. Crofters do not have that sort of money to throw around. I think that we can overdo the business of saying go and ask for a rebate. We do it with group after group of people who should not be paying this kind of charge at all.<lb/>
Crofter counties have been covered in many aspects of legislation. We have had the Highlands and Islands Development Board. I know a little about that. I can remember, if I may so remind the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, that it was not always called an excellent board. I remember the leader of the Conservative Opposition at that time telling us that what we were doing for the Highlands and Islands was Marxism. Now people are falling over themselves to say how good it is. But never mind about that.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0043"/>
<col>69</col>
In terms of the infrastructure we had a special road scheme, the crofter counties road scheme, in an endeavour to do everything that we could to help the area. Having done so much, recognising how special the area was, why should we go out of our way to help them and then come along with this, which removes one of their benefits in respect of rates and involves charges to people? I think that they are far too high in relation to the services, yet these people value education. In some areas they have more respect for education than in many other parts of Scotland or England. It is often a way of getting out of the Highlands.<lb/>
Better roads encourage them to get away more quickly. That is sad, but it is to the benefit of the rest of the country and the world. But if we want to keep them there, we must maintain our efforts to treat the Highlands and Islands areas as different and in need of this kind of help. It does no good to say that other areas have a claim. They do not have the same history, the same claim.<lb/>
I sincerely hope that the Government will recognise that claim. I see the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gray, in respect of certain drafting weaknesses. But the last thing that should stop us doing something for the Highlands is that a few words are drafted badly or wrongly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00684"><member>Lord Gray</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down and with the leave of the House, I agree that the provision under the 1956 Act was mandatory. But it was subject to certain conditions. One condition was that the person living in the house was engaged primarily in carrying on or directing agricultural operations on those lands and heritages, or was employed as an agricultural worker thereon. In other words, he must obtain the main source of his income therefrom. In respect of the noble Lord's comment and the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, the Act extended within the crofting counties to lands and heritages situated within the counties to which that Act applied, being lands or heritages the area of which did not exceed 75 acres or the rent of which did not exceed 100 a year. I merely enter that in the record for clarification.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00685"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not disagree with what is said in the Act or in the amendment. I think that I mentioned it when I spoke about the amendment. The amendment is even less generous in respect of the suggested reduction than was the 1956 Act. It shows how reasonable my noble friend is being on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00686"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, began his remarks by referring to the Highland Regional Council report. I agree with my noble friend Lady Carnegy. Reading the report leads one to believe that its authors have taken no account whatever of the existence of rebates. Details of the Government's intentions on the rebate scheme and a large number of examples have been available since the Bill was published. I am frankly surprised that the Highland Regional Council should have made such a remarkable omission from its report.<lb/>
<col>70</col>
It will always be possible to select individual areas which will be better or worse off under any policy change. The introduction of the community charge is no exception. The majority of the examples selected by the Highland Regional Council appear to be representative of sparsely populated and remote, or relatively remote, areas. Only two out of the seven represent areas in which the bulk of the regional council's population lives. The question of what people should pay for their local services, especially in remote areas, is already a sensitive one under the rating system.<lb/>
Our basic position is that the flat-rate charge payable by each adult is fairer than the property-based rating system. That is just as true in remote areas as in built-up areas. Of course, many services cost a great deal more to provide in more remote areas. Education is the obvious example. There are others. It is therefore far from clear that those who have to pay more under the community charge system are necessarily being unfairly treated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00687">7.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00688"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not want to interrupt too much. But that is looked after by the share and the apportionment in respect of the rate support grant. Whereas Glasgow receives 49 per cent., the Highland region receives far more. That is a recognition of more costly services. It is already dealt with. The Government pay their share through the apportionment of the rate support grant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00689"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, that is one thing. I shall turn however, to the debate's central theme relating to crofters. We discussed the matter at considerable length in Committee. It was argued that there should be some form of specific relief for crofters and other smallholders from full personal community charge liability. Nothing that I heard then or that I have heard this evening has convinced me that any general relief of the type proposed by Amendment No. 188AB is appropriate.<lb/>
Not for the first time I must remind your Lordships that we are introducing the personal community charge to spread the burden of payment for local authority services more widely and to achieve the accountability and fairness which the present domestic rating system so conspicuously lacks. In principle therefore, it is right that all adults over the age of 18 should be liable for the full personal community charge subject to the limited exemption which we have discussed. The position of individual crofters and of others in their households under the new arrangements will of course depend on the circumstances of each person and household involved.<lb/>
I am the first to recognise, along with all those who have contributed to the debate on this amendment, that crofters in the Highlands have for years held a special place and have been regarded with a great deal of affection in respect of their way of life. The amendment implies that one particular group of people should enjoy a sizeable reduction in its personal community charge liability merely because it forms a distinct economic group and social category.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0044"/>
<col>71</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00690"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Like students.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00691"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: I agree with my noble friends Lady Camegy and Lady Elliot that if we went down that road, we would receive representations from many other groups of people that they, too, should be granted similar relief. That would make a serious breach in the principle that the personal community charge should be a universal obligation at the same basic level for all. And that in its turn would lead to unfairness to others who, though no less deserving than those in the favoured groups, were unable to argue that their social or economic status justified relief from the personal community charge liability.<lb/>
Without going over all the ground covered in Committee, I think I said that a measurable proportion of crofters has resources of income other than crofting. Those sources are secure and well paid. I described how among crofters are to be found, for example, general medical practitioners, vets, shopkeepers, hoteliers, teachers, policemen, civil servants, local government officers and so on. That shows the breadth of the crofting community and how it is even more difficult to argue that its status justifies special reliefs, putting at a disadvantage people from other communities who might broadly be in the same financial position as crofters but not favoured by the same benefits.<lb/>
Amendment No. 188AC, the alternative to the earlier amendment, takes a slightly different approach by proposing that crofters who at present qualify for rating relief should enjoy a relief from the community charge "on a comparable scale". That appears to apply only to rateable occupiers and is therefore somewhat narrower than the noble Lord's earlier amendment. The same objections of principle apply. In addition, the proposal would appear to require some form of continuation of the assessment of croft houses for rates in order for an assessment to be made of the comparable relief which would apply. That would be a cumbersome requirement which I do not think we could contemplate.<lb/>
I must therefore say that, while we recognise of course that some crofters and their families may have difficulty in meeting the full personal community charge payment, the remedy for them should lie where it lies with all others in that position, and that is in the rebate system which we propose. This will allow full account to be taken on an individual basis of the financial circumstances of people in that position, without invidious distinctions being drawn between particular groups of people. I believe that that is a fairer and more equitable approach than that proposed by the noble Lord's amendments. I hope therefore that he will be prepared to withdraw them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00692"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to repeat what I said in Committee about crofters, which has also been said by many other noble Lords. However, three points have arisen. First, we now learn from the figures of the Highland area that the burden of the Bill will be very much heavier than even the most mischievous of us expected. It has been argued and has just been argued by the Minister in answer to that, that the crofters' will receive a rebate. That is a perfectly fair argument and I accept it, but it has never been the
<col>72</col>
answer to comparative poverty in the crofting areas. Secondly, it might have been said that the crofters could obtain national assistance, family income supplement or whatever else is available, but that is not the line that has historically been taken. The line taken was that this was a special area and that the crofters deserved special treatment.<lb/>
That leads me to my third point, which is that it is justifiably argued by many people that the position of the Highlands is no different to that of the Borders or other difficult upland areas. However, in my view, it is. The whole argument and the entire history of the crofting areas and the treatment of the Highlands show that the position there is different.<lb/>
There is no area comparable to the Highlands in Britain. That applies even more to the Islands. To say that the Shetland crofter is in anything like the same position as the Border farmer is untrue. He may in certain circumstances be lucky enough to have other jobs and be as well-off, but the position is still different and to pretend that it is not is to fly against the whole history of the Highland area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00693"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Grimond has encapsulated the whole case. The Minister of course does not look with sympathy on the study carried out by the Highland Regional Council, but nevertheless he cannot gainsay the facts. The fact is that one is taking money out of an area which is still one of the poorest in Britain and one which successive governments have tried to help for that reason and because of its importance for the preservation of a way of life and of a countryside which is valuable to the whole of the rest of the country.<lb/>
It is no argument to say that the districts chosen for study might not be representative. In fact I could not have picked a better representation of the Highlands areas than was listed in the study. The areas of Bower in Caithness and Easter Ross, two remote areas, and the fairly big town of Inverness were chosen for the study. That appears to me to be a perfect cross-section. Therefore, one cannot do down its arguments.<lb/>
It was interesting that the traditional Highland laird had a lot of sympathy for the general case, although he quite rightly pulled me up on certain points in the amendment about which he knows much more than I. However, sympathy for the general case came from the Minister. He does not like lines drawn, especially when they are drawn against him. To quote many a reply from the Minister, as regards the technical points that he was asking, if he does not mind I shall write to him as they are fairly obscure and I doubt whether he would understand them any more than I do.<lb/>
To come back to the main point at issue, of course a number of crofters will be well able to pay the community charge, but the point that I thought I had made clearly was that the whole area requires all the help it can get. The man who receives the 50 per cent. alleviation will be able to pay his personal charge, but the man who has a very small croft and does not have another job will need to apply for relief for 50 per cent. of the personal charge. However, an answer has not been given to the fact that out of this area&#x2014;which we all have all agreed should be helped&#x2014;a figure of between &#x00A3;1.3-&#x00A3;1.5 million is being taken. It must be bad and it must be wrong that this Bill is cancelling a
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0045"/>
<col>73</col>
concession which we have all already agreed is necessary. I must ask the opinion of the House and put the issue to the vote.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00700">Schedule 5 [<i>Water and sewerage charges:</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00701"><member>Lord Grimond</member> moved Amendment No. 188B:
<quote>Page 42, line 44, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("11A. Notwithstanding the repeal of section 44 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 any regional council or islands council which has at any time before 1st April 1987 pursuant to that section defrayed any part of the expenditure referred to in that section out of the regional rate or the general rate (as the case may be) may make a contribution to that expenditure out of the general fund as if that section had not been repealed and it had authorised the defraying of such expenditure out of the community charges and non-domestic rates due to the council.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00702">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to alleviate some of the steep rise in water charges which will result if the Bill becomes law. It is moved particularly with reference to Orkney, although I think that other areas may also be affected. Sixty per cent. of the water in Orkney is metered. Under the Bill as it stands, the local authority is bound to apportion the charges for water between the various users as equally as it can. That will mean that for users of metered water the charge will rise by 270 per cent. One farmer has reckoned that his water bill will increase by &#x00A3;1,400 per annum, which is an extremely steep increase, particularly in days when agriculture is not doing so well as it was.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00703">The charges for water work out in the following manner. The deficit on the water account of Orkney is &#x00A3;1,395,000. The meter charges at present account for &#x00A3;309,000 of that total. The domestic water rates account for &#x00A3;283,000. The balance is made up of two sets of contributions, one from the rate fund and the other under Section 44 of the Water (Scotland) Act. As I understand it&#x2014;no doubt the Government will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;assuming that the deficit on the water account is the same after the Bill passes, the meter charges will have to come up from &#x00A3;309,000 to &#x00A3;837,000. As I said, that is an increase of nearly 300 per cent. Exactly how far the other charges will go is difficult to calculate. However, I understand that they will almost certainly go up.</p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0046"/>
<col>75</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00704">It may be that users of water should pay more towards the cost. It may be that there are other arguments about how these charges should be borne. However, I do not think that there can be any argument that, in one step, the rise is simply too steep. I cannot believe that the Government intended it to work out that way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00705">My amendment suggests that Section 44 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 should, although the Act as a whole will be repealed, be left in operation and that the local authority should still be able to make a contribution under that authority. Of the two contributions which are now made from the rates, one will disappear but the other will be kept. That seems to me to be a reasonable compromise. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00706"><member>The Duke of Atholl</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the amendment. I do not think it goes against the Government's thesis that everyone should bear their particular share of the burden. That is a thesis with which I entirely agree. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, has said, the proposed system seems very unfair on the Orcadians and I feel that they need some relief. Perhaps my noble friend has some suggestions to make. I suspect that the amendment may be deficient in some ways. But I should very much like to support it in principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00707"><member>Lord Sanderson of Bowden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too find the increase in water charges an enormous one for farmers to face. I am amazed that the increase should be, as the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, has said, one of almost 300 per cent. If that is the case, I hope that the Government will look very carefully at the matter, because it will have serious effects in Orkney and perhaps in any other island with high water charges.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00708"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although the amendment would go wider than Orkney, perhaps it would be best if I responded particularly to the Orkney situation. I realise from the remarks of my noble friend Lord Sanderson and also those of my noble friend the Duke of Atholl that those concerns are uppermost in everyone's mind.<lb/>
Orkney is now the only council which meets more than the normal one-third of expenditure on water services from the general rate. I understand, in fact, that in 1987&#x2013;88 around two-thirds of this expenditure will be met from the general rate, with the domestic water rate accounting for only one-third. The result is that rates demand notices show a domestic water rate of 11 p in the pound but of course this does not reflect the true cost of providing the service.<lb/>
Similarly, the present metered rate of 17.6p per cubic metre does not reflect anything like the true cost, as metered users also currently contribute a substantial part of their general rate to public water. The actual level of metered charge and community water charge will be governed in future by the apportionment between domestic and non-domestic users as determined by the council, having regard to the requirement not to discriminate against any class of consumer. That will not change the overall cost of the service. The metered rate will go up, but of course
<col>76</col>
non-domestic users will not be making an additional payment as they do now through the general rate.<lb/>
I understand the worry in Orkney that charges will be redistributed within the non-domestic sector, placing a greater relative burden on domestic users, particularly farmers. However, I cannot go into the full details of the matter today because neither I nor my department has the full figures available at the moment. There have been discussions between the Orkney Island Council officials and our impression is that Orkney's worries on this score are much overstated and that the problem can be sorted out, at least to a substantial extent, by further detailed consideration of this kind.<lb/>
My officials are ready to have further discussions with the Orkney Islands officials. Therefore while I cannot accept the amendment, which would have a very wide effect well beyond the islands, I can say that I recognise that there are problems in Orkney and I believe that those problems are capable of being resolved in another way. That is the burden of the discussions which are now beginning to take place. I hope that with that assurance the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00709"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, for his sympathetic attitude, and for his statement that further discussions can take place. However, as he well knows, the difficulty that we are up against is the time limit in the Bill. Unless something can be done there will be a serious situation for Orkney farmers. It is not a question of the Orkney Council itself being able to do much about the situation, because, as the Minister knows, under the Bill it cannot discriminate&#x2014;it must fairly apportion the results. Therefore it has only limited play.<lb/>
However, in view of what the noble Lord has said&#x2014;and I am sure he is sincere in thinking that he can sort the matter out, and in a way which will avoid an immensely steep increase&#x2014;I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. Although I have in mind primarily Orkney, I am told that similar difficulties may well arise in other places, and that there is dispute in other places as to the way in which the matter is to be handled. However, in view of what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

It may not delegate the function to a committee or subcommittee or to one of its officers. The underlying reason for this is that decisions involving the raising of money, whether by rates or through borrowing, which is the other function mentioned in Section 56(6) which the local authority has to discharge itself, are so important that they should be taken only by the whole authority in council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00742">Quite simply, we consider that for the same reason a similar restriction should apply also to the determination of a local authority's personal community water charge and standard community charge multiplier.

<quote>("() General application of a decision in principle shall not be retrospective to any date earlier than the date of decision.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00747">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the general application of the principles that apply will not be retrospective. Appeals to the sheriff are provided for, with appeal on a point of law to the Court of Session. How speedily can a community charge registration officer expect the sheriff courts to respond? The success or failure of a poll tax must depend upon the immediacy or otherwise of a decision. How long will it take for a point of law to clear the Court of Session?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00748">If such a point of law produces a retrospective general effect should there not be a provision that, except for the actual case in point, general application of a decision in principle should not be retrospective to any date earlier than the date of the decision? The local authority should not be overpenalised because of the difficulty or the tardiness of getting a decision from the sheriff or the Court of Session. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00749"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are a number of reasons why I consider that this amendment is undesirable. First, I am not certain what is meant by "a decision in principle" or its general application. As I understand it, the court decides the particular case which is before it. It does not decide it in principle. It may be that certain cases are more important than others in establishing a principle or ratio which can then be applied to different cases, but this is not a decision in principle.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0048"/>
<col>79</col>
However, I assume that what the amendment is seeking to do is to prevent the ratio of a judicial decision from being applied retrospectively before the date of that decision except in relation to the particular case in which it was given. The timing aspect concerned the noble Lord.<lb/>
I think that would have undesirable consequences. Let us take the example of a number of cases, all turning on the same point, involving a person's liability for the personal community charge he has been paying for over a year. In these circumstances, it is usually arranged that one of these cases should be taken as a test case and the other cases sisted until the outcome of that test case. Let us further assume that it is decided in the test case that the person should not have been registered and should not therefore have been paying the personal community charge. The local authority is then obliged to refund him the amount of the personal community charge which he had been paying for the year.<lb/>
Without the amendment, the ratio of the decision would then have been applied to the cases which were sisted so that they were then all treated equally. The amendment would, however, have the effect that the ratio will not be applied to the other cases so as to give the persons whose cases were sisted the benefit of that decision prior to its state. The effect of the amendment would be to discourage persons from agreeing to take a test case. It would have the undesirable consequence of encouraging a multiplicity of actions to no useful purpose, except to the pockets of lawyers. I could give other examples, but that explanation sets out the need for this in context and I hope the noble Lord will see the force of it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00754">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in this part of the Bill we are granting exception status to a group of people. Do not ask me who they are, because I do not know. The Bill states that they are exempt,

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00755">Once again we are in the dark. We may think this is worth while or we may not. For a long time&#x2014;almost since the start of this Bill&#x2014;I have been asking what is happening to the armed forces. At present they may be on Crown land but the Government undertake to pay rates for them with a total sum to the local authority concerned. It might be personnel at HMS "Gannet" in Ayrshire, some of whom live in houses provided by the Government. It might be the RAF somewhere else. It might be the army in various places. Altogether there are about 14,500 people who are probably in this category, and that is a fair number of people.</p>
<col>80</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00756">There are also about 500 Ministry of Defence officials who are on Crown property. The Ministry of Defence used to pay a sum in lieu of rates for them. What is going to happen now? Surely they are all subject to this overall business of accepting accountability. The Government want them to be accountable. They can vote in local elections. They are using local services. Their children go to local schools. They are using water and all sorts of services provided by the local authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00757">Why should they be made exceptions? They are not exceptions to the rating system. The whole principle of every person being liable for personal charge or, indeed, collective charge is broken. So far as I can see, they often have second homes in Scotland&#x2014;perhaps a place in Argyll or the Borders. They should pay for that, like everyone else. Therefore can we be enlightened as to the position of the armed forces? Are they covered here? It would be wrong for them to be exempt.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00758">The point is that we will never see this legislation again. That is not good enough. There will be regulations and we will probably read about them but they are all subject to the negative procedure. We will never see them here. They will be decided, if anywhere, in another place. Therefore I am concerned about the principle that we do not know who these people are and that we are left in the dark on who is covered. Further, are the armed forces included, or are they not? I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00759"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the term "Crown land" in the context of this subsection is not limited to the Sovereign's private estates but extends, for example, to land occupied by government departments, as the noble Lord realises.<lb/>
Property owned or occupied by the Crown is not subject to rates; instead, the Treasury makes contributions in lieu to local authorities. But those individuals who are solely or mainly resident in Crown land will not be exempt from the personal community charge, which is a personal rather than a property-related tax. The purpose of subsection (2) is to allow for the exemption from liability for the personal community charge of certain categories of people. As I made clear in earlier debates, we intend to use this provision to exempt prisoners and long-term patients in NHS hospitals. The argument here is that those categories are so far removed from the democratic process that the imposition of liability to pay the personal community charge would be inappropriate. Payments in lieu of non-domestic rates will be unaffected by the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about servicemen. The Bill makes provision for all adults solely or mainly resident in Scotland to be liable for the personal community charge. That will apply to servicemen as to other people. In Committee I agreed to consider, in consultation with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence, the financial position of servicemen who may be liable for the personal community charge. I have now done so and will be considering in due course, along with the Ministry of Defence and other interested departments, whether any special arrangements for registration or collection of the community charge from the forces are
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0049"/>
<col>81</col>
necessary. My right honourable friend will also be reviewing the basis of the assessment of service accommodation charges to see whether changes need to be made in the light of the new system.<lb/>
I should also refer to visiting forces as, again, this matter was raised in Committee. The position of visiting forces is at present under consideration by the various departments involved. In fulfilment of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, visiting forces are at present exempted from rates, as well as from British income tax and various other forms of taxation. Some contribution towards the rate liability of accommodation occupied by visiting forces is, however, made by the relevant governments.<lb/>
Some aspects of the position of foreign forces&#x2014;and diplomats, who are in a similar position&#x2014;will probably require consultation with other governments. Further legislation may be required, in which case the Government will bring this forward in time for enactment before the new arrangements come into operation in Scotland on 1st April 1989. In any event the Government will honour their international obligations under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Vienna Convention.<lb/>
I thought that it was important to have those two points on the record because they were raised at Committee stage, but the main point is that the purpose of the provision is to exempt prisoners and long-term patients.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00760">8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00761"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have made some headway in that the Government are considering whether there should be special arrangements in respect of registration. Apart from that, am I to understand that such people will be liable no matter how they are registered? We must remember that it is not only the people in the forces who are more or less permanently resident in Scotland; there are their wives and children who may be grown up. As far as I can see, they will be registered but we have not yet reached a conclusion on how they will be registered, and that is the moot point.<lb/>
That applies to our own forces; if they are living&#x2014;domiciled&#x2014;in a house next door to other people and not in married quarters, I see no reason why they should not be registered. They should be treated just like everybody else. I can understand exactly what is happening in respect of visiting forces. It will not be easy to make arrangements but if we stick to what has been agreed by international agreement, then I have no objection.<lb/>
I shall still be interested in the people who are exempted. I do not know who they are and I doubt whether the Government know. It is one more occasion on which we are left completely in the dark. It should not require further legislation. With all the powers contained within the Bill I am sure it will be possible to do it. It may well be a different matter for visiting forces; that may require further legislation.<lb/>
It is a difficult problem to solve, and it is made even more difficult when one considers what may be termed appendages to the forces; that is to say, wives and children, who fully use all the services available from the local authorities. Can the Minister give us any
<col>82</col>
indication, even by letter, about when this difficulty is likely to be solved so that we may know what will happen?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00762"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House perhaps I may say that there were two elements in what I said. One was that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence and the other departments which are interested will be consulting about whether any special arrangements for registration or collection of the community charge in respect of the forces are necessary. That is one aspect. The other aspect, which relates to the point made by the noble Lord in his concluding remarks, is covered by the fact that I also said that my right honourable friend will be reviewing the basis of the assessment of service accommodation charges to see whether changes need to be made in the light of the new system.<lb/>
I cannot go further than that, nor do I think I can give the noble Lord information on timing. However, if I find that I am able to provide him with any information on timing, I shall correspond with him. I do not yet know, and I suppose that I shall not know for some time. Nevertheless, those are matters that my right honourable friend is considering at the present time, just as he is also considering the position of visiting forces. If I let the noble Lord know about that, I hope that he will feel at least partially satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00763"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad of that reply. It is an important point because, although there are around 15,000 of our own forces in Scotland, they tend to be concentrated in particular areas. From the local authority's point of view it is important how much it will gain or lose by this breach of the general principle that everybody will be treated alike. In view of the explanation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00767">The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps we may discuss Amendments Nos. 202 and 203 together, as they cover the same point. I think that this is an astounding piece of information in a Bill that has already given us so many headaches and left us rather blind as to what will happen in view of all the powers of prescription that will be taken. It is just like the last one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00768">Clause 30(1) reads:
<quote>"Such provisions as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of rendering this Act of full effect may be prescribed.".</quote>
In other words, the Government are saying, "We can do what we like without referring to Parliament other than by regulation".</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00769">Why bother to have a Bill at all? Why not just state the general principles and then say, "Well, anything that we think we need to do for the purposes of introducing these charges may be prescribed"? We are
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0050"/>
<col>83</col>
giving a very powerful instrument to the Government; we are giving them the power to introduce anything else, anything they like, and confirm it by regulation. We must remember that under this Act the regulations:
<quote>"shall be made by the Secretary of State by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00770">I am sorry that some of our more able constitutionalists are not in the Chamber because one does not just give such powers to a government without question. I can remember in the Parliament of 1945 the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, keeping the House up all night on the subject of such resolutions. Nowadays one has only three-quarters of an hour for a negative Motion and an hour and a half for an affirmative Motion. In those days, 1945 to 1950, time was not limited and we went on and on about this matter. Now not even the Commons will be allowed an hour and a half; it will be three-quarters of an hour to discuss matters of such considerable importance. In the whole of this Bill there is not a single instance of regulations, no matter how important they are, being subject to affirmative resolution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00771">The power that is being taken in this Bill means that one can introduce anything that has been forgotten because anything:
<quote>"necessary or expedient for the purposes of rendering this Act of full effect may be prescribed".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00772">That means anything, without limits. This Bill is incredible stuff&#x2014;but it is worthy of the Bill itself. Everything is done by prescription and then, if there is anything that has been forgotten, it can be introduced by negative resolution. What is the explanation? I hope there is a good one. I shall leave it to the Minister of State. He has proved to be a dogsbody on this Bill. I do not know what he has been saying to the Scottish Office but I know what we should have said to it a long time ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00773">The Government are to blame. They asked the civil servants and the draftsmen to draw up this Bill and this is the best that they could do in the time available. Let us not blame the civil servants for that; let us blame the civil servants for saying that they would do it. They should have dug in their heels and said, "It cannot be done in the time that is left to us". I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00774"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is quite a weird provision in an Act of Parliament. In general I do not think that precedent is necessarily tremendously important, but I think that the House is entitled to have a precedent for something quite so excruciating as this particular provision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00775"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it will be found that there are many precedents which give such a power to meet the circumstances, even if they are not spelled out in detail. In his speech made in respect of his last amendment the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, pointed out that with the best will in the world one will encounter situations which at this minute cannot be identified and therefore included in any statute. He expressed himself satisfied that
<col>84</col>
something would be done to ensure that everybody who ought to make a contribution should contribute their fair share.<lb/>
I see no other way of doing it than by giving power to somebody so as to take into account all the circumstances in order to make sure that everybody is treated fairly. If one takes the contribution that the noble Lord made on his last amendment, it is the answer to his objection on this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00776"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I suggest that we know at least what is being done in principle here. We are left with the words:
<quote>"Such provisions as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of rendering this Act of full effect may be prescribed".</quote>
Subsection (2)(a) states,
<quote>"such supplemental, consequential or transitional provision as the Secretary of State thinks fit".</quote>
That is not comparable with what we discussed in respect of the Crown land provision where exceptions will be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00777"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should explain that subsections (1) and (2) are both well precedented in recent legislation. There is a very similar provision to subsection (1) as my noble friend Lord Harmar-Nicholls indicated. That similar provision lies in Section 215(1) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 where it states:
<quote>"The Secretary of State or any appropriate Minister may at any time, whether before or after 16th May 1975, by order make such incidental, consequential, transistional or supplementary provisions as may appear to him&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a)to be necessary or proper for the general or any particular purposes of this Act or in consequence of any of the provisions thereof or for giving full effect thereto; or</li>
<li>(b)to be necessary or proper in consequence of such of the provisions of any other Act passed in the same session as this Act as applied to any area or authority affected by this Act;</li>
</ol></quote>
<quote>And nothing in any other provision of this Act shall be construed as prejudicing the generality of this subsection".</quote>
There are others which I do not think I need go into. There are also examples of provisions similar to subsection (2). I can quote one. It is Section 35(3) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 which provides that,
<quote>"Any order under this Act may contain such incidental, consequential and supplementary provisions as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or proper for bringing the order into operation and giving full effect thereto".</quote>
I do not think that I need detain your Lordships by speculating on exactly how these powers might be used. By definition the powers in subsection (1) are contingency powers. As an example, however, it is conceivable that in the light of experience we might wish to provide formally that the registration officer should give a copy of the register to the levying authority, or details of the procedure to be adopted by the registration officer before imposing a civil penalty under Clause 17(10), or before a levying authority could be satisfied that a surcharge should be imposed under Clause 21, should be specifically set out.<lb/>
That is the kind of use that might be made of the powers in subsection (1). I believe them to be entirely reasonable.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Deer Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00794">8.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00795"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. Unlike the Bill that we have just been discussing this is a Bill of complete simplicity to do with deer farming in England and Wales. As your Lordships probably know, deer farming is a small but emerging industry which shows a certain amount of promise. There are only about 140 deer farmers in the two countries. The industry is hampered by the fact that it is still governed by laws relating to deer in the wild and the killing of them. This means that at certain times of the year, the deer farmer, according to the breeding cycle of the deer, is unable to sell venison or any of the by products that go with such farming&#x2014;a quite considerable disadvantage
<col>86</col>
in itself. But the situation is made worse by the fact that in Scotland this matter was rectified some time ago and an element of unfair competition therefore creeps in.<lb/>
It is important that this industry is given every possible help. There is export potential. The meat is very popular on the Continent, particularly in Germany. It constitutes, albeit in a small way, an alternative crop. Later on this evening, we may be discussing those kinds of issues. I am told that the meat is very health giving. It is lean and good for people suffering from conditions of the heart.<lb/>
The Bill is perfectly simple. Clause 1 states that deer sold from a farm out of season must be contained within a deer-proof fence and must be marked in a conspicuous manner. It says no more than that. But the provision allows the farmer then to sell his deer and so regulate the breeding cycle, as one would with cows or sheep, and to ensure that deer are not killed with a fawn inside them, or at foot, or anything of that kind.<lb/>
There is no explanation to be given. Clause 2 is simply a formality. I wish to commend the Bill very strongly to your Lordships. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00796">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time. (<i>The Earl of Radnor</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00797">8.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00798"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise to my noble friend Lord Radnor for not being in my place when he began his speech moving the Second Reading of this Bill which the Government certainly support. I am grateful to my noble friend for explaining the need for it and its main provisions. Although keeping deer for venison production has a long history, deer farming in Britain is relatively new. I am sure that with the increasing interest being shown by farmers in diversifying their activities we can expect this area of the agricultural industry to continue to grow. This is what is in the mind of my noble friend in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, which has already been through all its stages in another place.<lb/>
One particularly pleasing aspect of deer farming is the size of the potential market for its products. Venison is especially attractive to the increasing body of consumers who demand quality lean meat. As my noble friend said, it is seen as being a healthy food and there is also the opportunity to adapt the product by developing novel processed foods. British deer farmers have been taking an increasing share of the home venison market in recent times through farm gate sales, sales to hotels and catering establishments and, more recently, to supermarkets. I am glad to say that quality has been high.<lb/>
However, continuity of supply is all important. This is really the basic reason for this Bill. As my noble friend has explained, the close season for deer in England and Wales as specified in the Deer Act 1963 is inappropriate and a hindrance which the Government wish, as my noble friend does, to see removed as soon as possible.<lb/>
The Farm Animal Welfare Council, which recently looked into the welfare of farm deer, pointed out the inappropriateness of a close season in this particular
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0052"/>
<col>87</col>
context, as it is essentially to conserve the wild deer population and not farm deer. My noble friend has explained that steps are being taken in Scotland to correct this situation. The measure there has appeared to work well and I am pleased to see that my noble friend's measure has been drafted closely to match that adopted in Scotland. From the Government's point of view, we see no difficulty in its being operated successfully in England and Wales as well.<lb/>
For those reasons, I support my noble friend in bringing this Bill to the House for a Second Reading. I hope it will receive a Second Reading and go through the subsequent stages to get on to the statute book.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00799">8.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00800"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, for being late in coming to the Chamber. He indicated that he would speak fairly briefly, but I did not realise that he would be as brief as he was.<lb/>
I had thought that I would read the debate in the Commons on Second Reading but I found that the Bill went through on the nod, which did not give me a lot of help in what I might say. Like the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, I agree that this measure is necessary for deer farmers. Farming deer behind a ring fence is a totally different matter from shooting deer in the open on the hills of Scotland and elsewhere.<lb/>
There is one question that I should like to ask. There seems some scope for malpractice, if I may put it that way. I wonder whether experience in Scotland has shown that this has been able to be controlled.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Belstead, mentioned how great was the demand for venison and that people seemed to like it. I think it is an acquired taste, but, more important than that, one has to acquire knowledge of the way to cook it. It is amazing what a mess can be made of a roast of venison if one does not know that it must be kept inside tinfoil otherwise it will be as dry as an old loaf.<lb/>
We give the Bill our blessing and again I apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, for not being here when he introduced the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00801"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful both to my noble friend and to the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, for supporting this small, short but very important Bill. I am at a great disadvantage because I did not hear the end of the noble Lord's question, which does not give me a chance to answer. He said that there was perhaps scope for something, but I did not hear that one word.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00802"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been possible in Scotland, though I am not sure for how long, to kill deer outside the close season. I wondered whether there was scope for malpractice in getting deer from outside on to the market because of this. I wondered whether there was any experience of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00803"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for repeating that. I suppose it would be wrong to say that there was no scope at all, but the ways that deer in Scotland have been marked&#x2014;so far,
<col>88</col>
apparently successfully&#x2014;by ear-tagging, plastic collars and freeze banding would somehow draw attention if a deer was shot in the wild out of season or poached and then tagged. For a start people would start looking. I have a feeling that ear tagging done after death is different from that done after three months, which I think is advisable. All I can tell the noble Lord is that apparently this trouble has not been experienced so far. I have no doubt that there is somebody lurking in the wings who will have a try, but I suspect and hope he will be found out and suitably punished. All that remains for me to say is that. I hope the Bill will benefit the farming community and those who wish to take up deer farming.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00805"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it in order for just a moment for me to draw the House's attention to what I hope is never done?&#x2014;that is, to send deer to an abattoir. They are highly sensitive animals and suffer great stress, far more than bullocks or horses. I am slightly out of order speaking about this. I shall sit down in a moment, but this matter is not in the Bill. I hope my noble friend the Minister will bear it in mind when he speaks to some of his fellow Ministers who are interested in this subject.<lb/>
I hope that in the not too distant future we shall have a Bill that will forbid sending deer to abattoirs by lorry. It would be extremely cruel. All farmed deer should be shot on the farm. That is by far the kindest way. On some farms now one can shoot a deer and the deer beside it a few yards away will take no notice. I hope that will be borne in mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00806"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, I think I can put my noble friend's fears at rest because there is nothing about abattoir killing in the Bill.

<title>Farm Price Proposals: ECC Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00808">8.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00809"><member>Lord Gallacher</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on the 1987&#x2013;88 Farm Price Proposals. <i>(7th Report H.L. 121)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00810">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the annual price review of the common agricultural policy invariably involves a very tight timetable. This year has been no exception. The actual proposals for 1987&#x2013;88 were received extremely late and it is a source of some satisfaction to your Lordships' Select Committee that the deadlines which it was necessary to meet as regards these proposals have in all circumstances been met. This is due in no small measure to the speed with which various bodies have managed to produce written evidence for the Select Committee. We are grateful to those bodies and in particular to the witnesses who gave oral evidence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00811">We have before us tonight volume 1 of the report together with the memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0053"/>
<col>89</col>
proposals. Although the full evidence has yet to be circulated, I think we have sufficient before us tonight to say that all the essentials are with us to enable us to give some consideration to what is proposed for the forthcoming year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00812">Apart from any intrinsic merit the document may have&#x2014;and that is for your Lordships to judge&#x2014;I think it constitutes a valuable reference document and for that the Select Committee is grateful to its specialist adviser, Mr. Simon Harris, and to the Clerk to Sub-Committee D. I am looking forward, as I am sure other noble Lords are, to the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Carter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00813">There are now no shortages of any commodities covered by the common agricultural policy. Indeed the converse is the case and the problem which shows through time and time again in our report is that of surpluses. Therefore it follows from this position that the test of an annual price review can be summarised as follows. First of all, are the proposals within the financial guidelines which were set for the CAP in 1984 and first complied with in 1986? Secondly, are they such as to stop creating new surpluses? Thirdly, what proposals are there for the disposal of existing surpluses? Lastly, if changes create problems for small farmers, are there ameliorative proposals by way of socio-structural measures?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00814">I think it would be obvious to anyone reading the report that the proposals are not within the financial guidelines, and the detail of this is spelt out at paragraph 30 in our report. They are in fact 14.5 per cent. above the financial guidelines and details are given at page 12, table 1. The net overrun is of the order of 2.4 billion ecu. This is a remarkable figure in itself and is similar to the extra costs of the common agricultural policy due to external factors and therefore beyond the control of the Commission. Three of these external factors are, first, the depreciation of the United States dollar against the ecu which accounts for 1.2 billion ecu of the overrun. Next there were two European monetary system realignments during the past period accounting for 580 million ecu, and a drop in world prices accounts for the overrun of 600 million ecu.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00815">We spend time in this House considering whether we should join as full members of the European monetary system. Looking at the effect of the depreciation of the United States dollar against the ecu, I sometimes think that we should be turning our minds to trying to persuade the United States to become a full member of the European monetary system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00816">The overrun is to be met to the tune of 2 billion ecu by not paying member states for the common agricultural policy spending until after the spending takes place. This is a fairly breathtaking proposition which I understand has been canvassed by the chairman of the Commission, and I wonder how serious such a situation would be for the United Kingdom if by some mischance it happened to become a fact of life.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00817">Next we ask ourselves, are the review proposals such as to stop creating new surpluses? Here we are mainly discussing prices and their effect on commodities. We give details at paragraph 40 of the report of this position, and the Ministry of Agriculture view of the situation is that the overall effect of the price proposals
<col>90</col>
is a reduction in common support prices of 0.5 per cent. in ecu terms and a slight increase of 0.2 per cent. in national terms. Green rate changes proposed to reduce monetary compensatory amounts are modest: for the United Kingdom, a 4 per cent. green rate depreciation is proposed. Both the National Farmers' Union and the Ministry of Agriculture, who gave evidence to us, will seek to improve this during the negotiations. If they are successful, undoubtedly other member states will try to emulate them in this respect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00818">On a commodity basis, milk and beef were dealt with in the 1986 United Kingdom Presidency; a significant achievement, we believe, by the United Kingdom during its Presidency, and details concerning these important changes in the milk and beef regimes are given in some detail in Part 3 of the report. The level of dairy quotas now fixed incorporates a six per cent. degree of over-supply. Your Lordships' Select Committee thinks this not unreasonable to allow for yield variations, but it ought to be kept under review.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00819">Dairy quotas are producing hardship for smaller farmers, and the choice of 1981, according to the evidence given to us, as the base year for quotas was unfortunate for the United Kingdom because of exceptional weather conditions then prevailing. This alone makes the Select Committee recommendations for the transfer of quotas given at paragraph 53 of our report even more significant. Cheaper borrowing rates are essential for hard pressed farmers in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00820">The disposal of old butter stocks constitutes a major problem for the Community, and the member states are to bear the costs of this disposal by an ingenious, if dubious, accounting procedure. There is, however, no justification in our opinion for the proposal to end intervention for salted butter from 1st April 1988. This blow is aimed specifically at the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with a side-swipe at New Zealand. The Select Committee was told by the Milk Marketing Board witnesses that the costs of converting United Kingdom creameries to produce unsalted lactic butter was around &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million per creamery.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00821">So far as the oils and fats tax proposals are concerned, we have almost universal condemnation of this proposition. But we ask ourselves, though not perhaps loudly enough in the document, where the alternative finance will be found if the proposed oils and fats tax, which is estimated to produce 2 billion ecu in a full year, is not proceeded with. Again, one is entitled to say that the Commission may not be serious about the proposal and is simply using it to force the Council to take some very unpopular decisions if it turns down the proposed oils and fats tax. Certainly, if it is turned down in its entirety there will need to be some major revisions of the price proposals affecting other commodities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00822">So far as beef is concerned, the reduction in dairy quotas to which I have already made reference may disrupt the market because of increases in culled dairy cows. This may pose particular problems for the United Kingdom producers and the Select Committee was grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will press for additional market support for beef should the need arise. The mere fact that it threatens is an indication of the knock-on effect of corrective
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0054"/>
<col>91</col>
measures under the common agricultural policy. This is a fact of life well known to your Lordships' Select Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00823">So far as sheepmeat is concerned, the Community is only 80 per cent. self-sufficient in it. This leads us without hesitation to believe that the proposed limitation on the number of ewes per holding on which the premium will be paid affects the United Kingdom directly. We have little hesitation in rejecting this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00824">Turning to cereals, production is still dangerously out of control despite the co-responsibility levy. The Select Committee has long favoured a rolling programme of phased price reduction for cereals. The present proposals are a disguised price cut. If open price cuts are politically unacceptable, then the policy of restricting the intervention system has to be accepted. The whole future of cereals needs speedy decision. There is now too much discussion about the problem involving set-aside, whether compulsory or voluntary, quotas and the rest. Discussion is becoming an end in itself. The Select Committee is still unhappy about the co-responsibility levy for cereals, its amount, the exemptions and the mode of collection, as well as the use of the proceeds. No changes in co-responsibility levy are proposed this time, but the Select Committee reserves the right to discuss it again if alterations are made in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00825">So far as protein crops are concerned, parity treatment is given with cereals. We do not regard this as being soundly based. The European Community is still a net importer of proteins and these are suitable crops for cereal growers to divert into. Even in adversity proposals must relate to market needs, actual or potential.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00826">Although the United Kingdom is not guilty of adding to the wine surplus, it still represents a major problem for the Community. In fact Britain is the best market for other member states for wine, and to that extent we support the restrictive policies for wines which are rightly to continue so far as the 1987&#x2013;88 year is concerned. I wonder whether the Minister in replying could expand on the proposed establishment of national control bodies for wine with Commission supervisors. One asks oneself whether this is a serious proposition and whether it constitutes a precedent for common agricultural policy control by Brussels. The overall proposals will not stop the creation of new surpluses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00827">Turning to the disposal of existing surpluses, this is still a dangerous exercise because of its effect on world markets. Sugar is almost a classical example of this. The cost of disposal to consumers and the unfavourable climate of opinion it creates for the Community and the CAP as such are together a grave indictment of the common agricultural policy and it is regrettable that the Commission appears insensitive to the effect of such transactions on the public perception of the CAP. We believe that the policy should be to give consumers in the Community first refusal of surplus stocks at reduced prices.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00828">I turn now to agri-monetary changes. These are among the most sweeping yet made by the Commission. They are the most controversial of the proposals, although separate from prices. There is a
<col>92</col>
difficult balance to be struck, even in the United Kingdom where current negative monetary compensation amounts are around 25 per cent. The evidence received by the Select Committee is summarised at paragraphs 74 to 80 of the report. We believe that West Germany holds the key to agri-monetary changes of the type proposed. Full United Kingdom membership of the EMS might give us more leverage for agri-monetary change, but, separate though the monetary changes are from price proposals, they are likely to be part of the prices package.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00829">The proposals for small farmers are of considerable importance. We were told by the National Farmers Union of England and Wales that if price proposals for 1987&#x2013;88 are adopted as they stand, the effect will be to reduce farm incomes in the United Kingdom by &#x00A3;250 million. A further estimate from the National Farmers Union is that 10 per cent. of farm businesses are at risk of being forced out of business. If this is the United Kingdom position, then the dimension for very small farmers in other member states is frightening. This gives added point to the urgency of considering an extension of socio-structural measures on a scale well beyond that already tried and contemplated. Some hope arises in the proposition that money spent on FEOGA guidance gives a better return than comparable spending from the guarantee section of FEOGA. This leads one to favour greater financial realism about price proposals than those for 1987&#x2013;88.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00830">At the outset I said that timing had been extremely difficult for the Select Committee in considering this year's proposals. We therefore make the plea in our report for a better alignment of the annual price fixing proposals as regards time so that these affect the size of the crop for which they are meant to apply rather than the following crop. The decision to extend the last price year by two months this year indicates the need for such realism as regards timing. The May meeting of the Agriculture Council of Ministers will be decisive. The common agricultural policy has both faults and problems galore, but nevertheless remains at the heart of the European Communities. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00831">Moved, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on the 1987&#x2013;88 Farm Price Proposals. (<i>7th Report H.L. 121</i>).&#x2014;(<i>Lord Gallacher</i>.)</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00833"><member>Lord Middleton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I first join the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, in saying how much I look forward to hearing the noble Lord, Lord Carter. He is a very successful farmer and I know that what he has to say tonight and on future occasions will receive your Lordships' close attention. His knowledge and experience will be of much value to proceedings in this House.<lb/>
At the top of the Select Committee's summary of conclusions we make the rather obvious statement that,
<quote>"The overriding need at present is to reduce the expense of the CAP arising out of surplus production".</quote>
We follow that up by saying:
<quote>"A sustained policy of price reductions over a period of years is the best way of cutting agricultural surpluses".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0055"/>
<col>93</col>
We might well have added,
<quote>"but such a sustained policy which we have consistently advocated has not been adopted".</quote>
Now the brakes have been applied, but, in my view, too sharply and too late.<lb/>
The Commission started the process last year. In regard to the support price proposals for 1987&#x2013;88 which we are now debating, the net effect would be more drastic than the movement in intervention prices appears to imply because of the proposals for linked measures. This application of the brake is too late because the agricultural market support bus is now out of control. The Community budget was overspent last year by more than 1 biillion ecus. This year the current price proposals are designed to cope with an overrun of 4 billion ecus, including a carry-over from last year. The Commission, recognising the political impossibility of cutting support prices more drastically, has proposed to cover something like two-thirds of the deficiency by imposing, as the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, has reminded us, an oil and fats tax. Such a tax, as the report points out, would create many more problems than it would solve. So we have reached the predictable situation where the Commission is groping around in a desperate search for means of slowing down the bus.<lb/>
It has been said so often that I hesitate to repeat that farming is best managed by consistent policies and is damaged by expedient measures. Farmers are remarkably responsive to changes in technology and to business signals, but once they are geared up to a particular system, having made the necessary investment of capital, they cannot be expected hurriedly to switch without loss. Given that agriculture has to be allowed more time than most other industries to adjust to the market, it might be asked, why should it be politically impossible now to reduce support prices sufficiently so as to cut back the surpluses? Why are the Commission and the Council of Ministers so cautious? The popular conception, certainly in the United Kingdom, is of a spoilt and prosperous farming community, overloaded with subsidies and growing food that nobody wants at the taxpayers' expense. The reality is different. As we say in paragraph 9 of our report:
<quote>"The result of measures"</quote>
that have been taken
<quote>"and the distortions caused by the agri-monetary system, especially in the United Kingdom in recent years have led to a decline in farm incomes in real terms. A large number of farmers are experiencing financial difficulties and some may go out of business as a result".</quote>
We go on to say in paragraph 74 of the report:
<quote>"In the past ten years there has been an average fall in the purchasing power of net farm income in the Community of 25.5 per cent.".</quote>
In the United Kingdom the decline has been 39.8 per cent. We attribute this excessive United Kingdom decline mainly to the maintenance of large negative MCAs in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Whatever the cause, the downward trend is well illustrated in this year's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food annual review. The vagaries of the weather are just as upsetting as current monetary policies. If anyone thinks that farming is anything but a very hazardous affair, then let him look at Table 26
<col>94</col>
of that document, which sets out the average net income per farm in the United Kingdom. If you take 1982&#x2013;83 as a base year, you will find that the subsequent trend is downwards for all six of the different types of farming that are analysed. The only exceptions are pigs and poultry which fluctuated widely as they usually do. If you take 100 as the index figure for net farm incomes in real terms for the 1982&#x2013;83 season, the figure for cereal farms went up to 118 in that very good season 1984&#x2013;85. In 1985&#x2013;86, the index figure went down to 12. In the same year dairy farms went from 100 to 63. In the same year, lowland cattle and sheep farms went from 100 to 26, and so on.<lb/>
I hate quoting too many figures especially at this hour of night, but if you look at the table for net farm incomes for the year to February 1986, in Scotland you will see that cropping farms of medium size made a loss averaging &#x00A3;6,307 for each farm. Large cropping farms in Scotland in that year lost on average, &#x00A3;19,228 each. It is not just the lack of resolve on the part of EC Ministers that puts constraints on what the Commission can propose by way of price cuts. There is this consistent decline in farm incomes and all the statistics show it. My noble friend Lord Ferrers referred to it in a powerful speech when we debated the subject this time last year.<lb/>
The situation in the Community now is worse than it was then. If the forecast that the Minister gave in his most helpful evidence to the Committee is correct, and these are his words:
<quote>"The Community will run out of money some time in the autumn of this year".</quote>
The oil and fats tax will not do, so how does the Community find the money to plug the budgetary gap? Farmers do not have the financial reserves after a period of decline to solve the problem by submitting to more drastic cuts than those that are now being proposed. If I may give an example of the effect of what is now being proposed for cereals, what appears to be a price freeze now proposed for 1987&#x2013;88 is something very different when you work out the full effect of the related measures. As we say in the report:
<quote>"the drop in support in ecu terms for bread wheat is in the order of 9 per cent. and for feed grains 12 per cent.".</quote>
For oil seed the MAFF original estimate was that the effect of the measure proposed was equivalent to a 25 per cent. cut, though it has said that this estimate may need revision. There is an additional worry for United Kingdom farmers in that the oil seed rape proposals would discriminate against just those varieties that suit our climate.<lb/>
These proposals, therefore, following last year's effective 7 per cent. price cut for these commodities amount, as I have said, to another sharp application of the brake. I find it extremely difficult to see how the problem of financing the CAP is going to be solved painlessly. The farm spending crisis might have been avoided by intelligent and consistent use of the price mechanism over the past 10 or 15 years. But that presupposes a wisdom and an awareness by the Commission and by European Ministers of advances in technology that can perhaps not with fairness have been demanded of them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0056"/>
<col>95</col>
The problem of milk, as the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, reminded us, is being tackled by means of the quota system, and that was tightened up last December. The next biggest surplus is in grain, and we say in our report that in this field the pricing and related measures will have to be supplemented by other means of control.<lb/>
What other means can be adopted? Incidentally I have an idea&#x2014;and perhaps my noble friend the Minister will confirm this&#x2014;that this year's grain stocks in the United Kingdom are not nearly so large as had been predicted. Perhaps he will give us the figures when he replies.<lb/>
The committee discussed in earlier reports the pros and cons of quotas and other methods of control of cereal stocks. I do not propose to rehearse those arguments again, but I believe that serious attention should be paid to the kind of set aside scheme that is now being considered by the Minister and his advisers. He referred to it in his evidence to the committee and I understand it to be not so much a blueprint at this stage as a stimulant to discussion on land diversion. I understand that the thought is that it should be Community wide, voluntary at the level of the individual, applicable for a number of years and with a range of possibilities for alternative land use.<lb/>
The main diversion would be away from cereal growing and the aims would be, first, to achieve a much quicker removal of land from cereals than would be achieved by market policies alone, and, secondly, to reduce expenditure in supporting intervention stock. I believe that to succeed a diversion scheme must provide sufficient inducement to pull the less efficient growers out of cereal production. I am perfectly certain that whatever method is devised to cut down production it must apply across the board and not just in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
As we say in our report:
<quote>"The Community's problems are aggravated by the conflict between the objectives of the Treaty of Rome in terms of maintaining farm income and the insupportable burden that would be placed on the budget were agricultural support to have remained open-ended".</quote>
This is indeed the nub of the problem.<lb/>
I believe that we face a very difficult situation indeed. This report described and recognises the financial problems facing the EC. We criticise such proposals as would in our opinion be damaging to the Community as a whole or to the United Kingdom in particular. We do not pretend to identify an easy solution. As a farmer I am preparing&#x2014;and not for the first time in my agricultural career&#x2014;for rough times ahead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00834">8.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00835"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as is usual, the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, has said all that I was going to say, said it rather better, and illustrated it enormously well. But I think I must follow along the same line. What has happened in the Commission this year&#x2014;which is what we are reporting on&#x2014;is that it has begun to think about how it will tackle first of all the money probem, financing the CAP, and it is now
<col>96</col>
thinking in terms of reducing production by cutting prices.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, said, the price cuts are going to be very savage indeed. Taking first the milk proposals, it is true that the Minister assured us that the cuts proposed might in two years remove the current milk surplus and bring the product into balance. This might well be true, but a whole lot of things are wrong with the quota system at the present time. One is that nothing can be more profitable than bribing people out of milk production on a voluntary basis, to let the others have the quotas which should be transferable and get on and produce milk efficiently and make a living out of it.<lb/>
We have to remember in the middle of all the talk of surpluses and waste of money that in fact the agricultural industry in this country is still saving the balance of payments a great deal of money. The more the oil begins to run down, the more important it is that we supply as much as is reasonable and as we can of our own food. Certainly we cannot run down the milk industry to an extent where we are unable to make use of the factories and manufacturing capacity, and indeed the very good products that we make in this country.<lb/>
That may be on the way to being tackled, but the cereal business is being tackled very brutally, if they agree. The Ministers are still to agree. Although the Commission has put forward proposals it is not yet agreed. What frightens me about the proposal to use intervention, or the lack of intervention, to keep the price down is that in the back end, the autumn, the people who will have to sell cereals at the lowest price will be those who are the hardest up. You might find in fact that with no intervention the price of cereals might fall to &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;60 a tonne.<lb/>
It would not be the big man who would be hit. It would probably be the person who has equipped his farm to produce, is short of money and has to sell, and of course everybody in an open market will take advantage of it to the best of his ability. We have to watch that with great care. There needs to be some form of bottom. It would have been far better to have a fairly savage difference in the intervention price during that time rather than simply delaying it until the spring of the year.<lb/>
There are all sorts of other dangers. Although in our committee and elsewhere we are beginning to tackle the problems of surplus, neither we nor the Commission are beginning to think seriously about the long-term problem of what we are to do with the agricultural land and the agricultural people of Europe. In this respect the MAFF scheme for a voluntary set-aside is extremely useful because the economics are straightforward. If somebody grows two tonnes of cereal at the present time it costs nearly &#x00A3;100 per tonne to store it and sell it for export. That is obviously ludicrous. If you have &#x00A3;200 to play with, and if you can save &#x00A3;100 and use &#x00A3;100 to promote the countryside in some other way you are doing something useful. That sort of figure is necessary before you can get people, perhaps the secondary landowner, out of cereals and into something else.<lb/>
The Community and the Commission have to look at this matter, because European money must come
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0057"/>
<col>97</col>
into it. That is where we would be saving the money. The obvious way is to grow trees, and there are others, such as promoting a more extensive system of grazing, which would go along with lower rents, because the value of land is falling and is bound to fall even further. Certainly we have to look at the interest rates which many farmers have to pay.<lb/>
Seven or eight years ago the committee said that a policy of a price freeze and a forecast of what was going to be in surplus was what was needed so that farmers would know what to grow and which way to direct their future plans. As the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, said, that might have worked then, but now we need more. The Minister, who is going to have a very tough time in Europe trying to put over any form of policy to some of our Continental partners, needs to go further in pushing for some form of voluntary set-aside and a replacement for the grain which would have been grown by a crop or a system that would leave the farmer a reasonable living and keep him on the land.<lb/>
The policy for the hills, which we do not touch on in the Commission, is a fairly simple one. We have to keep up the straightforward subsidies to less-favoured areas if we are to keep both stock and people on the hills. We have to provide alternatives. We have to have a countryside policy, and the money saved has to go into that policy.<lb/>
The report deals with all these things and covers the field extraordinarily well. I do not agree with all of it. There is a great vehemence about condemning the oils and fats tax. I agree. I do not think it is a good tax and I do not think we should have it, but the vehemence with which it is condemned is hypocritical, if I may say so, when you consider that what we did at the start of the CAP was tax people's food in the form of wheat from abroad in order to grow it at home. I suppose that is what they are proposing here. It is a very bad tax and is not really analogous; but this has happened in CAP before.<lb/>
The report is good, but the problems are immense. I look forward to hearing the Minister go a little further than the price review this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00836">9.4 P.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00837"><member>Lord Northbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, in the view that the Committee has produced a very good report. I am not going to rehearse the problems of the CAP, as they are all well known to your Lordships&#x2014;vast stocks overhanging the market and the prospect of continued overproduction due partly to technological advance and partly to farmers' desperate attempts to maintain their income.<lb/>
I think we all agree that the present situation is unacceptably costly to the CAP. Furthermore, and perhaps even more importantly, it is tending to destabilise world trade and to have ramifications which go far beyond the shores of Europe. I think we all agree that we must restore the balance of markets and that that can only be done basically by reducing the quantity of production.<lb/>
In that context, the present package which is being proposed&#x2014;I think the report suggests this&#x2014;is both too little and too late. We know that is because stronger action has proved to be politically unacceptable to our
<col>98</col>
partners in the EC. The problem is that, if markets are to be brought into balance and production is to be reduced, whatever method is adopted is going to cause hardship to farmers.<lb/>
I would say only this: if farmers are going to be forced to take nasty medicine it is important at least to ensure that that medicine is effective and also that the burden of suffering is fairly distributed. Whether we are looking at the reduction of output by physical controls such as quotas or acreage set-aside, or whether we are looking at achieving reduction by financial pressure on prices or, indeed, by the co-responsibility levies or the limitation of intervention, the effect on the farmer is going to be the same; it is going to reduce his margins. Since the effect is going to be the same, it is important to be sure that we employ systems which are to be effective.<lb/>
There are two or three points which I should like to make. The first is that farmers' decisions about levels of production depend on what they perceive the medium-term economic climate of farming to be going to be not only this year but in the next two, three, five or more years. As the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, pointed out, the Commission of the Council of Ministers is still arguing about the price of cereals for this year's harvest. We all know that this year's corn is planted and very shortly it will be coming into ear. There is nothing we can do about this year's harvest. Farmers will shortly be making their plans for the 1988 harvest. The Commission must take that on board. I suggest that the right response is to urge the Commission to develop a five-year plan&#x2014;perhaps a rolling five-year plan&#x2014;enabling farmers to see a little of what is ahead of them down the line. I believe that in that way one would obtain an effective response from farmers.<lb/>
The response of farmers to economic signals now being sent out by the Commission can lead to reduced acreage. However, it can also be to say, "This is a short-term phenomena and perhaps the best thing that we can do is to increase our production per acre so that our narrowed margins will help to cover our overheads". That particular trend of thinking is encouraged by the concern of the farming community that quotas may be introduced; and that if quotas are introduced at a later date a base tonnage for the farm may be a valuable asset. That is an argument for keeping up the level of cereal production, for example, at the moment.<lb/>
I urge that it is necessary for the Commission to develop a five-year plan designed to make it more economic for farmers on marginal land to reduce their cereal production, if we are talking about cereals, and to reduce the production of other crops in surplus. I argue that much quicker and more effective results will be achieved by sending out the right economic signals on a medium-term and long-term basis than by the present uncertain and vacillating policy.<lb/>
Secondly, it seems to me that the Commission must set the right political climate if it is to have any hope of taking the action that it needs to take. There are two categories of farmers who are, more than any others, extremely vulnerable to the reduction in margins which must occur. They are those who are heavily in debt and those whose business is too small to provide
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0058"/>
<col>99</col>
a family income on reduced margins. Dealing first with debt, it is tough to be in debt when economic signals turn against one. I think that as a community and a nation we must decide how much, if at all, we feel that we have misled farmers with calls for yet more food production, and how far we must accept some measure of joint responsibility for having misled them into incurring that debt.<lb/>
I shall say no more about debt, but as regards small farmers I think that we must look at them carefully because they fall into many different categories. Politically they must be the most important group, if for no other reason than that they are the most numerous and therefore represent the most votes. There are different categories of small farmers. There are those who are capable of helping themselves, and they should certainly be encouraged to do so. Some farmers can be helped to prosper through specialised activities or good marketing; for example, through farm-gate sales. Others, and I think that this is a very important group, will survive by simplifying their farming systems and taking on part-time work. I believe that to be an attractive and important alternative.<lb/>
In Germany, already more than 50 per cent. of the farming population have some other part-time employment. This route can provide a reasonable standard of living, coupled with the way of life which many people seek when they enter farming and often, if their business is too small, fail to achieve. The provision of the opportunity for part-time employment must be a much more satisfactory way of providing for small farmers wherever possible than any kind of direct income subsidy.<lb/>
There is a third category: those in environmentally sensitive areas. There are farmers on marginal land who can be retrained at public expense to maintain and manage the environment, or to maintain and manage systems of farming which the public wish to see maintained. In my view only the residue, who do not fall into any of the above categories, should be eligible for direct income support to minimise the hardship for existing occupiers until such time as they reach retirement age. By that time consideration will have to be given to the amalgamation of the holding or to its removal from agriculture.<lb/>
Some of these proposals have already been referred to and are envisaged in a modest way in the Government's ALURE package. A much more vigorous pursuit of the proposals, on a community-wide basis, would go far to alleviate the hardship which will be caused to many farmers by the action that the Commission and the council must take, and they will make it politically more feasible to do what must be done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00839"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although I rise with some trepidation to make my first speech in your Lordships' House, I am pleased that it is on this very important topic of farm prices, agricultural policy and taking note of the excellent report of the European Communities Committee, presented to your Lordships' House by the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher.<lb/>
<col>100</col>
I am very conscious of the great honour and privilege it is to be a Member of your Lordships' House and I am looking forward, together with my colleagues on these Benches, to playing a full part in the work of the House.<lb/>
I am aware that I am speaking at the "connoisseurs' hour" of 9.15 and to an audience of experts. There are a number of your Lordships who wish to speak and so I shall be brief. I should like to take up just two themes. The first concerns the price proposals in the package&#x2014;and we must remind ourselves that at this stage they are only proposals&#x2014;and their effect on farming costs. Secondly, I should like to take perhaps a slightly broader view on the future direction of agricultural policy.<lb/>
To deal first with farm incomes, the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, has already referred to the paragraph in the report which I shall repeat:
<quote>"In the past ten years there has been an average fall in the purchasing power of net farm income in the Community of 25.5 per cent. The Committee are concerned that in the United Kingdom the decline in purchasing power has been 39.8 per cent., a greater decline than in any other Community country".</quote>
The committee may well be concerned. Many farmers I know are desperate. The report says, correctly, that the worst effect on United Kingdom farm incomes results from the gross disparity in the value of the green pound. The Commission has proposed a devaluation for the United Kingdom of 4 per cent. The NFU has suggested a devaluation of 15 per cent. I see from the press reports last week that the Minister is perhaps thinking of a devaluation of 9 or 10 per cent., thereby demonstrating the supremely sophisticated ability of the arbitrator to divide by two.<lb/>
The sub-committee's report refers to farmers' incomes throughout, but there is another and very important group in the farming community who are not mentioned in the report: those are the farm workers. Your Lordships will be aware that the number of people employed in United Kingdom agriculture declined by 70,000, or about 18 per cent., in the last 10 years. That statistic is worse than it appears. As we know, only 40 per cent., I think, of United Kingdom farms actually employ labour. The many farms that I know&#x2014;and they are necessarily the larger farms&#x2014;have reduced their labour force considerably and are considering reducing it still further.<lb/>
There is a further effect of the squeeze on farming incomes, and it is an obvious one: that is, the reduction in capital investment. We are aware that the gross capital formation in the industry has declined in real terms by &#x00A3;300 million in the last 10 year or by 26 per cent. There is the effect, of which we are all aware, on the farm machinery industry and the workers in it.<lb/>
This underlines the importance of the devaluation of the green pound to farmers' incomes. It would not be appropriate at this hour to make detailed technical comment on the price proposals, much as I should like to do so. But there is just one point in the report on which I should like to take the friendliest issue with the committee. Paragraph 55 refers to the suspension of milk quota and it says:
<quote>"For the 4 per cent. suspension in 1987&#x2013;88 producers will receive compensation at a rate of 6.5 p/litre, which represents almost double the average profit per litre for milk production".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0059"/>
<col>101</col>
I understand that the committee is relying for its figures on an Answer that was given in another place. If my arithmetic is correct, that implies that the average profit for a cow with a yield of 5,500 litres would be &#x00A3;192. That is far in excess of any figure that I see.<lb/>
However, as a milk producer considering the reduction or suspension of 6 per cent. of my quota, it is not the average profit per litre that concerns me: it is the marginal profit. My labour remains the same, and all the rest of my fixed costs. I estimate that the marginal profit from milk production is of the order of 9p to 11p per litre, and, as a producer, I think I shall be losing about 3p per litre on all our suspended quota.<lb/>
The second matter is the direction of agricultural policy. The price proposals are all about the reduction of the budgetary costs of the CAP. The securing of fair prices for consumers and reasonable incomes for producers are now secondary. We are in the middle of the battle of the Community budget. I also think that we can see a subtle but potentially far-reaching change in the CAP, with a gradual move away from supporting farm incomes through price policy and towards direct income support. This has already been touched on by other noble Lords.<lb/>
Two things seem to me to flow from this. First, the UK farmer is bound to suffer relatively because of our better structure if the tendency is towards income support. If I may quote from a child's guide to the common agricultural policy produced by the Commission entitled <i>The CAP and its Reform</i>, referring to socio-structural measures it says:
<quote>"These could be implemented anywhere in the Community, but the Community would make a greater financial contribution to the Member States and regions with the worst structural problems."</quote>
We must ask ourselves how we would fare compared with Portugal, Greece or Spain in that context.<lb/>
The Commission is tinkering with the sociostructural problems through the price support policy&#x2014;for example, the proposal to limit the ewe subsidy according to size of flock. In my view there is a great danger in attempting to solve the structural problems of European agriculture through tinkering with price support systems. That is a job for the guidance fund, the social fund and national budgets.<lb/>
There is, I think, a further consequence of what I see as this gradual change in the direction of support policy. Repatriation and renationalisation are dirty words in Commission circles. I believe that the Commission will want a free market in agricultural products in Europe at prices closer to world prices. However, we are aware that the budget of the Community cannot afford this. Therefore why not have a price reduction to reduce the cost of market support but at the same time attempt to switch gradually to income support, which national governments can augment without apparently distorting the market? That seems to me repatriation of agricultural support policy.<lb/>
It just happens that I have with me a document produced by Mr. Brynmor John, the Labour Party's agricultural spokesman in another place. It says:
<quote>"it is necessary to address what appears to be an essential precondition for any solution: the partial repatriation of agricultural policy".</quote>
<col>102</col>
Only this week in <i>Farming News</i> Mr. David Curry, a Member of the European Parliament and chairman of an important committee in the European Parliament, writes:
<quote>"The Brussels proposals to pay direct income aid to farmers mark an important milestone in the political evolution in the CAP &#x2026; The proposals for direct aid &#x2026; mark yet another step in the renationalisation of the costs of the CAP".</quote>
If the agricultural spokesman for the Labour Party, Mr. David Curry, and the European Commission all appear to be saying more or less the same thing, it is perhaps time to take heed.<lb/>
To conclude, I do not have the time that I should like to deal with ALURE or the diversification proposals and so on, but I should like to put the discussion in a wider context. I refer to a lecture by Professor Kenneth Blaxter, formerly director of the Rowett Research Institute, which was reprinted in the <i>Lancet</i> of February this year. It was entitled "Future Hunger", and attempted to answer the question:
<quote>"are the resources of the world sufficient to provide the food necessary to ensure that future generations of all its peoples will be free from hunger"?</quote>
In the lecture there were many statistics, but I shall quote only two:
<quote>"It is expected that the population of the world will grow to 2.2 times the present level and it is necessary to increase food intake per head by 30 per cent. if the world is to be properly fed.".</quote>
That means world food supplies must be trebled. On the base line of 1985, world food production must increase by 75 per cent. by the year 2000&#x2014;only 15 years away. In all our deliberations we should never lose sight of the simple fact that we live in a hungry world and that hunger will, I fear, be the lot of many millions in the years to come.<lb/>
If we bear in mind the figures that I have just quoted, notwithstanding all the problems of European agriculture, it might help us to keep a sense of perspective if we remember the wise remark that I heard made many years ago by the late A. G. Street:
<quote>"The most important thing for farmers all over the world is not the decisions of politicians or bureaucrats&#x2014;it is whether or not it is going to rain tomorrow".</quote>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00841"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is my good fortune to be the first to speak after the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and to congratulate him on one of the best maiden speeches I have heard since I came into your Lordships' House. I have known the noble Lord for quite a long while. We have discussed farming matters in a non-political context on many occasions. I expected nothing less of him, and I certainly was not disappointed. I am sure that we all hope to benefit from his knowledge, even if on this side we may not always agree with his politics. I hope that we shall hear from him on many occasions.<lb/>
At the same time, I should like to pay tribute to our chairman, who does a wonderful job and draws the best out of the various people whom we interview and talk to, which is an integral part of producing these good reports. This report is a particularly good one. I shall go so far as to say&#x2014;I have often thought it and I expect many others have&#x2014;that if only one could sweep away the Commission and the Council of Ministers and replace them with Sub-Committee D we
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0060"/>
<col>103</col>
should probably be in rather less of a pickle than we now are, because it is the endless putting off of decisions that has brought us to a serious situation. Although I appreciate the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, that in a wider and longer context it is an ephemeral problem, I do not think that we can consider it as that here and now. It is a serious and practical problem.<lb/>
I think that the noble Lord said early in his speech that we must remember that these are only proposals. I shall deal later in my speech with the timing. These are only proposals. I think that the Ministers meet again on 18th May. One hopes that they will produce something then. I shall not go into the detailed figures. That has already been done well by a number of noble Lords. I have an awful feeling that when it comes down to farms in this country and the rest of Europe, the worst of both worlds will be attained. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, that farmers and therefore farmworkers are in for a rough time. I have an awful feeling that the Council of Ministers will not solve the surpluses problem. I shall return to this point, but some other ingredients must be added to make things work.<lb/>
The nub of the question, as the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, said, is encapsulated in the Treaty of Rome, which contains certain requirements for supporting agriculture and the agricultural economy, although there is just not the money to fulfil them. Where does that get us? These proposals are complicated, I suppose for political reasons. One must agree with the report that if only the price mechanism could be used in a strightforward and consistent manner from year to year, it would be no harsher on farmers than the immensely complicated packages which are produced at the moment, with the timing and quality of intervention being controlled.<lb/>
That merely confuses, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, says, the messages that come through to the farmers. Farmers will sit down and work out what it means in terms of reduction in net income. The message would get through a great deal quicker if they could see that they would get considerably less for their crops. Then they might think hard about whether to grow them on marginal land and perhaps the Government, the Commission or the Council of Ministers would think about what to do about the ensuing hardship.<lb/>
It is important that something is done but I fear that we shall miss out and that nothing will be done. A number of measures should be taken even if they are not successful or perhaps not properly designed initially. One of them is the voluntary set-aside. A system of voluntary set-aside that is financially attractive enough to take a large lump of marginal land out of cultivation should be put into action as soon as possible.<lb/>
<col>104</col>
Your Lordships know well that an immense amount of what I should call marginal land has crops grown on it that never should have been grown on it. Very often winter wheat is grown year after year on poor land.<lb/>
The set-aside situation and the abandonment of land brings with it the troubles that the noble Lords, Lord Mackie of Benshie and Lord Carter, mentioned. It is very hard, except in one respect, to think of alternative crops for the land and there will be hardship for the people who work on it.<lb/>
If farmers set aside land and are given money for doing so they can either abandon the land, which will make the situation worse, or they can&#x2014;to use an awful word&#x2014;extensify farming. That is the course that would be favoured. However, my point is that someone should do something now in order to give it a run, so to speak, even if it is painful and does not work too well to start with. Then perhaps at the next set of price proposals the proposed solution can be polished up and something better will come about.<lb/>
The next matter which is of considerable importance both in this country and in Europe and which should be considered very carefully is a subsidy to persuade people to grow trees on a commercial scale. It is no good having a subsidy for people to grow just a few trees, which are usually, although not necessarily, of the broadleaved variety. A subsidy should cover commercial forestry too. The people who may find themselves thrown out of work in that sector can find some kind of a job.<lb/>
In that sector I see something being added to the gross national product. Ideas have been suggested, although they seem a little paltry on first sight. I should prefer to be subsidised at a slightly higher level along the lines which I believe were suggested by the Country Landowners' Association. The point I should like to make is that I think a start should be made now so that we can get going, see what the mistakes are and see if it can be proved another year.<lb/>
There is another matter which I believe must be rammed home. It has already been brought out that the timing has become atrociously bad in Brussels. The report brings out that the proposals&#x2014;I use that term advisedly&#x2014;which are going to be rediscussed again on 18th May should really have been decided in August 1986 so that farmers could decide for themselves whether they would put in winter wheat and decide on spring crops, oilseed rape and so on. Farmers have been left guessing. That is no good as regards getting messages for restricting production through to them.<lb/>
I shall end by saying again that the real horror that one contemplates must be rural unemployment. I suppose that that would lead to direct aid of some sort. But I think that the sooner firm decisions are made, the sooner the Ministers and the Council stop fudging the issue and get on and do something, the better.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00843"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on his maiden speech. It is a great pleasure to welcome to this House someone who is going to be an agricultural spokesman. It does not often happen. Peers have many interests but agriculture is an interest which not many Peers have and I congratulate the noble Lord on his speech and look forward to hearing him on many occasions. I should also like to pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, our chairman. I think that this is perhaps the fourth report which he has chaired, and all of them have been excellent. I am most grateful to him for the way in which he handled the committee and the people who came to give evidence. We are all most grateful to him.<lb/>
I believe that I have played a part in nearly all the reports made by the committee. I believe that this is the seventh such report and the same theme runs through most of them: surplus production, about which we have all been speaking; not enough enthusiasm in selling produce to encourage people to buy more (I do not think that we do nearly enough about that); and uncertainty as to what the Commission is proposing until it is too late to alter production to fit policy.<lb/>
In paragraph 82, we draw attention to those matters. Many of your Lordships have mentioned the same matters. We have pointed out in several of our reports that in growing cereal crops or producing cattle it is necessary to have a minimum of nine months' notice or more. Agriculture is not like an industry where one turns the engines off and on at a moment's notice. It seems to me that some of the commissioners must have little idea of how nature differs from the power of oil, coal or electricity. The powers that be in Brussels seem to forget those differences, and that adds to the complications in EC policy. I should like to suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that we should have a five-year policy. It would be a great help if we could persuade the Commission to think as far ahead as that instead of thinking something like five months ahead.<lb/>
I remember that before the war we produced only 30 per cent. of what we consumed. Today we produce over 80 per cent., which ought to spell success. However, in the Western world and in America we do not consume enough and we do not sell enough. We mention all those factors in our report, and in many ways they are rather depressing.<lb/>
The set-aside which has been discussed tonight is one of the ways in which we may certainly help the situation. There is the question of using land for other purposes and for forestry, for those who are prepared to wait, because there is very little return on forestry. In that respect one is planting for the next generation. As regards all the proposed changes, some of which will definitely come about, farmers must receive some compensation. Farmers cannot live on nothing; they cannot live on trees. They must live on what they can earn and if they are to be prevented from receiving their returns from many crops, then undoubtedly it is necessary that there should be compensation. Such compensation would be considerably less than the amount spent on overproduction in the EC today.
<col>106</col>
Therefore I do not see why it should not be agreed by the EC as well as by individual countries.<lb/>
There must be careful monitoring of the changes which are being suggested. A very severe drought or very heavy rain at the wrong time could automatically throw out all our plans. One cannot just say "Stop producing". There must be a margin of production. I cannot imagine anything worse than not having enough production with people in a state of starvation as they are in many parts of the world today. I am always haunted by the knowledge of starvation in the third world and the disasters of war which seem to make it impossible for the Western world to help. I find the situation very disheartening. We all want to help the starving millions but it seems to be impossible. Surely some method can be found.<lb/>
Milk quotas have been successful, certainly in some areas. I stayed recently with a dairy farmer who sells all his milk to the Milk Marketing Board. It is made into cheese. Sometimes he fails to produce even the amount of milk that the Milk Marketing Board requires. That in a way is an interesting fact. I know of other dairy farmers who are making and selling produce made from milk&#x2014;not pure milk, but products such as yoghurt and cheese. They are making money, and are able to carry on with their dairy by finding another way of selling. I know of one or two dairy farmers living near towns who have started small summer restaurants. People can look around the gardens and then have a nice meal in a small teashop. That venture has also been successful but it is necessary to be near a town.<lb/>
In the less favoured areas, particularly in the Highlands, the border hills and parts of Wales, there is no overproduction of sheep or of store cattle. To cut down on sheep production would be foolish since we can sell mutton and lamb successfully.<lb/>
When the Select Committee interviewed the Minister he assured us that he would oppose the proposal that the present sheep subsidies and production should be changed. He told us that he would fight such a proposal. In paragraph 68 of our report we stress very strongly that we do not wish the EC policy to be carried out; we prefer the existing policy, which is favourable. I speak with authority and interest because as noble Lords know, I am a sheep farmer.<lb/>
Other suggestions have been made, but whatever is agreed the farming community must play a big part in our national life. Our enormous urban population would be seriously deprived if the land went to ruin and nobody could go on holiday in the country. Only last weekend I stayed in Cumbria and on Sunday afternoon was taken all through the Lake District&#x2014;to Buttermere, Windermere and many other places. The roads were crowded with people, all holidaymakers out for the day. The inns were full and the public were enjoying the lovely holiday. That applies to hundreds of different areas in the United Kingdom. Without farmers and farmworkers these lovely areas would be ruined.<lb/>
Farming must continue and be assisted by the Government since the public reap many benefits. I believe that it is an investment. It is not a mad way of
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0062"/>
<col>107</col>
squandering money. It is an investment and it is not an unrewarding investment. The public gain, as do the farmers. I believe that must continue and I hope we shall always continue, in our reports and elsewhere, to back up the farming industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00844">9.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00845"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first I offer my congratulations to the noble Lord&#x2014;I think I can call him my noble friend&#x2014;Lord Carter, for what has rightly been described as a first-class and truly remarkable maiden speech. Of course he speaks with enormous practical knowledge. There is a great deal of practical knowledge among your Lordships. We have a reputation for knowing what we are talking about. That is particularly so as regards agriculture. With the noble Lord now among us that fund of experience and knowledge will be very greatly enhanced.<lb/>
In addition, it is not only that he has knowledge and experience but he has, if I may say so, very great wisdom, because the views he expressed are almost identical to mine. That is not always the case with other noble Lords who possibly have even more wisdom than I have but with whose views I do not always agree. Therefore, my sincere congratulations to the noble Lord. It is not purely convention which encourages me to say that I hope we shall hear him frequently on this and other subjects.<lb/>
My congratulations also to the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, who has once more guided his committee into producing a very valuable, wise and sensible report. It is a report with which I find myself in almost complete agreement. It is not 100 per cent. agreement and the noble Lord would not expect that. He probably would not believe me if I said it was. However, I certainly find myself in agreement with the gist and the bulk of the report. I pick out one or two paragraphs which I think are particularly apposite and need full, whole-hearted support. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, in replying will give the report that whole-hearted support.<lb/>
Turning purely to the summary of conclusions, which is quicker than going through the whole report, I refer to paragraph 92 on oils and fats. Even though there may be an element of hypocrisy in this, as my noble friend Lord Mackie of Benshie suggested, that does not in any way weaken the recommendation that the committee is vehemently opposed to an oils and fats tax. That is undoubtedly the right line to take.<lb/>
An oils and fats tax would bring in some much needed money to Community coffers and might to a minor extent help the production of vegetable oils within the Community. However, against that it would raise the price of edible oils&#x2014;cooking oils&#x2014;to a large section of the population, particularly that section which is among the poorest and most vulnerable to price rises because they cannot afford the more expensive animal fats. It would also have a devastating effect on many areas of the third world which rely upon the importation into the Community of their vegetable oils, particularly palm oil. Therefore, I give my wholehearted support to that.<lb/>
I now come to paragraph 97 on consumer prices. It is frequently forgotten in these debates that the price
<col>108</col>
that the farmer receives has a major effect on the price that the consumer pays. Although one of the main objectives of the common agricultural policy has always been to ensure remunerative prices to farmers, it is also directed towards ensuring a good supply, at reasonable prices, of food, to the consumer. That is another area where it is helpful to be reminded of that.<lb/>
I am picking out only one or two of the points, but I agree completely with paragraph 101 on joining the European monetary system. That is something which has been delayed for far too long and where conceivably, but I do not have very much optimism, the Minister will give us a little hope. Paragraph 102&#x2014;and other noble Lords have mentioned this&#x2014;deals with the timing of announcements. It is ridiculous to think that there can be any effect on agricultural production by producing prices when harvesting is just about to start. I support strongly the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that if we are to have an orderly agricultural policy and a reasonable form of change we must have at least a five-year policy so that farmers know where they stand and what is wanted of them and can lay their plans accordingly.<lb/>
There are one or two points which I must mention where I am not in complete agreement with the report; in fact where I am in disagreement with it. Paragraph 86 refers to a sustained policy of price reductions over a period of years as the best way of cutting agricultural surpluses. There I disagree. I am not specifically against price reduction but I think it is purely wishful thinking to believe that we can control the problem of over-production by the price mechanism. After all, over many years the prudent policy has been tried of not putting up prices sufficiently to cover inflation, extra costs and so on. What has happened? We continue producing more and more and the surpluses rise higher and higher. A price policy is therefore not the answer, although it may be of help if other steps are taken in order to solve this problem.<lb/>
Quotas have also been tried and, although they have had some effect on milk production, we still have butter mountains. They are still growing. The quotas have not achieved what they should have done. We all know that they were introduced with insufficient thought and caused a great deal of difficulty, both bureaucratic and personal, to farmers. Unless very great changes are made in them, quotas are clearly not the answer.<lb/>
We now come to the suggestion that there should be set-asides: that farmers should be paid to leave their land fallow or to grow some crops which are not in surplus&#x2014;and there are precious few of them. I must confess that I am sceptical about the ability of the set-aside to solve this problem. The effect of it will not be in the main cereal growing areas, if one takes cereals specifically. There are very few cereal farmers who can afford to give up any of their land; and there are few other crops which can be grown on it. Some of the farmers in the less favoured areas will give up if the incentive is sufficiently high but the amount that they contribute to the surpluses of food&#x2014;and I am not talking only of this country but of the Community as a whole&#x2014;is very minor. We shall be deceiving ourselves if we think that set-aside will solve all our problems, just as we deceived ourselves when we
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0063"/>
<col>109</col>
thought that quotas would solve the problems of milk and that a prudent price policy would solve overproduction over the years. I agree very strongly with my noble friend Lord Mackie of Benshie when he mentioned the importance of rent and interest rates in achieving any results from set-aside.<lb/>
Having been somewhat destructive, but I hope not unduly so, what is the answer? Some noble Lords will remember that I have put forward on more than one occasion what has been described as the quantum method. I shall not weary your Lordships by repeating that. That has so far been rejected by Her Majesty's Government and by Brussels, although I hope that they may not have thrown it completely out of the window.<lb/>
However, assuming that that is not a starter, I agree very strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Carter. I do not use his exact words, but he said that we must decouple the economic from the social aspects of our agricultural policy. On the economic side, we must allow the price mechanism to play its part and run its course. That does not mean to say that we have a price mechanism which is fixed in Brussels, with intervention and all the complications of the cost of that. It simply means that world prices have their effect. Abolish intervention, my Lords, and leave farmers completely free and unprotected to weather the storms of world prices whether they be high or low. That is a pretty tough policy, but I believe that that is the only way in which one can control overproduction and the inordinate cost of the common agricultural policy unless one is going to go back to a quantum or some idea of that kind which has already been rejected.<lb/>
Then one comes to the social effects. They will be devastating. The Community will step in with its social fund greatly enhanced because of its savings from the costs of the CAP, costs which are always escalating. From the social fund it should allocate to every member state as much money as it can afford. I should not like to quantify it. That member state can distribute it in any way it sees fit among its disadvantaged farmers. The member state should also be allowed the freedom to supplement the amount which comes from Community funds if there are special cases of hardship and&#x2014;let us be frank about it&#x2014;if there are special political reasons for doing so, or any other reasons influencing the way they wish to spend their own money.<lb/>
I believe in the present situation, the most likely way in which overproduction can be brought under control is for economic forces to be left free to have their effect and that the hardship&#x2014;not only to farmers and farm workers but to the ancillary industries and the rural economy as a whole&#x2014;can be mitigated to the advantage of the general public as well as those living in rural areas.<lb/>
Finally, we normally, and quite reasonably, look on discussions of the common agricultural policy as being concerned solely with production, farmers, farm workers and the agricultural industry as a whole. However, I would urge this fact upon your Lordships. The common agricultural policy is the most important aspect of the whole of the Community. It takes up far and away the greatest part of the Community's
<col>110</col>
expenditure. It is its best known feature and has the greatest impact on individuals in all member states. If it fails&#x2014;and we must not blind ourselves to the fact that it is today in a very critical condition&#x2014;the whole existence of the European Economic Community will be put in jeopardy. Already much of the effort which should be devoted to new initiatives, to bringing Europe closer together, to making it a real force in world politics, is dissipated because of the detailed internal discussions on the common agricultural policy. We must put that behind us and allow the energies of those who are trying to build Europe to concentrate on the constructive aspects of Europe. Until the problems of the common agricultural policy are solved the prospects of being able to do that are as slim as they are at present.<lb/>
I urge Her Majesty's Government to accept that a speedy solution to this is of really vital importance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00847"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like first to congratulate my noble friend Lord Gallacher and his committee for an excellent report that is factual, full of information and makes many useful suggestions, although some I am not too sure about. Nevertheless, we are grateful to my noble friend for guiding his committee towards producing this first class report.<lb/>
My friend, now my noble friend, Lord Carter, I have known for many years. He made a speech which many of us will remember as a maiden speech to be copied. It was brief and full of first-class words. I liked the point he made about farm workers and the reduction in farm spending which helped to create unemployment. That is something to be examined in agriculture today.<lb/>
Many noble Lords have said that a depression in agriculture goes much further than the farmers it affects. We were pleased to hear from my noble friend Lord Carter. He has a record in public work as well as his own work: he is a CA, an agricultural consultant and a farmer. These are qualifications second to none for helping us in our agriculture discussions in this House.<lb/>
Speaking second last, as somebody put it, to a House that has only retained experts on agriculture left at this time of night, it is difficult to say much new about the report. Many of the points have been covered. However, I should like to mention the point made in the report where it says that the Community is now the world's largest importer of certain food and agriculture products while the export potential is also increased. I should have liked that to have been expanded with some figures. It seems extraordinary that in this era of surpluses we are still the largest importer of food.<lb/>
The continual theme running through the report, which many of your Lordships have mentioned, is the effect on many farmers. Paragraph 9 says:
<quote>"A large number of farmers are experiencing financial difficulties and some may go out of business as a result."</quote>
The NFU gave evidence that the figure may be as high as 10 per cent. going out of business. This is something which we would regret. There is no doubt that if a farmer goes out of business because of financial difficulties, that farm, generally speaking, will be
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0064"/>
<col>111</col>
linked with the next farm, and that will be another agricultural unit going by the board. The noble Lord, Lord Middleton, emphasised this point. It is one which we should examine. Whatever we do, whatever method we use, we must see that it does not happen.<lb/>
A point that has not been mentioned by any noble Lord is the Australian Government's evidence&#x2014;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, is listening&#x2014;that actions by the EC could have ramifications far wider than Europe. They were thinking in particular of themselves and New Zealand. We know that it looks ridiculous to be bringing 76,000 tonnes of butter into a country, or area, which already has 1 million tonnes in cold store. But we made a deal with New Zealand in 1972 or 1973 when we entered the Common Market, and I think we should maintain that agreement.<lb/>
We must also be careful, in getting rid of these surpluses, not to send them into markets which have been built up with painstaking care over the years since the Common Market started. If they look like losing their market, we must not destroy the market by shoving surpluses at cheap prices into it. I know there are many ways of getting rid of milk surpluses. One that I should like to see&#x2014;it is not, I believe, impossible, although the Milk Marketing Board, without exactly pooh-poohing it, did not think it practical&#x2014;is that the milk going into butter at the moment should be converted into UHT milk in fairly large containers and sent to Mozambique and Somalia. That would give New Zealand the market for its butter.<lb/>
Everybody has mentioned the sustained policy of price reduction. Like several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Walston, I do not agree with that at all. I happen to remember the sustained price reductions from 1924 to 1932 and it took a long, long time to reduce even at disastrous levels. My father had a low ground ewe flock which he valued at between &#x00A3;10 and &#x00A3;12 in 1923 and by 1924 it had dropped to a value of &#x00A3;3. Potato prices in 1927 and 1928 were as low as thirty shillings a ton and wheat dropped in 1929&#x2013;1930 from 45 shillings a quarter&#x2014;I am sorry to use the old measure but that is the figure I remember&#x2014;to 18 shillings. Still production Went on. As the noble Lord, Lord Walston, said, it will take a long time to have any effect. The farmers, at any rate for the first few years, will simply do their best to increase production to make up for the sustained price reduction which we want. We must remember that before we go any further along the road.<lb/>
I know that the committee mitigates the point in paragraphs 86 and 104. It says that long-term reform of the CAP will require consistent price restraint combined with new initiatives to ease the adaptation of the farming industry. I hope that the idea is maintained; otherwise, it would be as disaster for the farming industry.<lb/>
On the question of cereals in particular, we are always reminded of the huge surpluses, the taking out of land and the setting aside of land. Like my noble friend Lord Carter, I have read Sir Kenneth Blaxter's article in <i>The Lancet</i> on the world food situation. If we are to take land out of production, it will have to be on a short-term basis. If we do it, we must take it out in
<col>112</col>
such a way that it can go back into production if Sir Kenneth's predictions are correct, as I think they are.<lb/>
I should like to see land taken out on a mandatory basis, right across the board, whatever percentage is considered necessary, but not allowing farmers to select bits and pieces of their worst land. It must be on a rotational basis and fallowed around the farm. I have seen this done in Minnesota in the USA where I spent a whole afternoon with a government agent. It is perfectly easy to police and, in my opinion, is the right way to do it.<lb/>
There is a small point on the question of the levy on cereals. I had a discussion with the millers the other day. They pointed out that farmers could be better rewarded in the market price from merchants if the levy was paid directly by agriculture. There is a point in that. You get &#x00A3;100 a tonne and &#x00A3;3.37 has to come off it, whereas if you paid that, you could probably squeeze the miller up another couple of pounds. This point should be looked at.<lb/>
Beef and sheep have been discussed. I am a beef producer and this year our beef returns will be way down compared with last year. Something will have to be done there. With regard to the green pound and whether it will be reduced, we may hear something from the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, about what the Government will press for; and whether they will stick to the 4, 10 or 15 per cent., I do not know. Certainly something will have to be done.<lb/>
I turn to the question of small farmers and part-time work for them. I went to Italy and Germany a few years ago and especially in Bavaria I saw industrial factories right out in the countryside where farmers could go to work part-time. In Italy factories have been built on the new motorway from Naples to Brindisi where small farmers can get work. That is not the case in this country but there is the question of farmers diversifying and using their buildings for small industries and suchlike and probably taking part themselves. That might be a solution of the small farm problem. If prices come down, farmers will have a problem.<lb/>
On the question of the green pound, which I have already mentioned, I find this a difficult matter to understand. I have bought treatises on it and have tried to read and understand, but I noticed the other day that I am in good company as the Governor of the Bank of England does not understand it either. What I do understand is that if we can get a 10 per cent. reduction it will help beef prices in particular in this country.<lb/>
I do not want to say much more except that I had a look through the appendix. I do not know how many members of the public will read a report like this. On page 27 the target and intervention prices are shown. If these are compared with what we get, it must give a lay person a funny idea of the position. He will ask "If those are the prices farmers get, what are they complaining about?" But those are nothing like the prices we get. I feel that some explanation might have been better there.<lb/>
I read the two or three pages of the report on commitment and action. The noble Earl, Lord Radnor, mentioned this. If your Lordships read
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0065"/>
<col>113</col>
through it you will see that every second one has not appeared. They are described as "under active discussion"; "referred back for further work"; "this has not yet been adopted"; "the Commission's proposals remain on the table"; "no proposal has yet been made"; "no decision taken because"; "no commission proposal tabled"; "no specific proposal made"; "we await formal Commission appraisal"; and so on. If they are the actions and commitments then there is an awful lot that needs to be done. Have the action and the commitment straight away, because we wait too long. As the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, said, and as other noble Lords have emphasised, it is quite ridiculous to be facing a harvest where we do not know what our prices are to be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00848">10.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00849"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should first of all like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on the speech that he has made this evening. It was exactly the sort of speech which attracts the interest of the House, for the noble Lord has, as many of your Lordships have said, a detailed working knowledge of agriculture and gave us the benefit of his knowledge in a speech which was closely argued and very interesting. There was just a hint of politics without actually being political, and it was certainly uncontroversial and yet authoritative. The noble Lord ended attractively on a severely practical note which I would guess is typical of him. I certainly look forward to hearing the noble Lord again in the near future, and I know all noble Lords who heard the noble Lord speak this evening will agree.<lb/>
I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, on the committee's report. There is little between us concerning the conclusions in it. The committee has reiterated that the best way of tackling common agricultural policy surpluses is a sustained restrictive price policy, and the Government endorse this conclusion. But I would add that the United Kingdom's consistent pressure for such a policy has already brought some significant results. In the last three price fixings we have seen reductions in support prices across the Community which the Commission estimates total 9 per cent. in real terms. That is after account is taken of any devaluations in the green rates of national currencies.<lb/>
In this context I remember that earlier this year your Lordships debated the possible effect of the reforms of the common agricultural policy agreed so far, including the major agreement on milk and beef reached in the Agriculture Council last December. That debate understandably concentrated on the difficult adjustments that have to be made by some producers in the light of such measures. Once again this evening concern has been expressed by my noble friend Lord Middleton at the beginning of the debate, by the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, at the end of it, and by many other noble Lords about the decline in the purchasing power of farmers' incomes. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Carter, put his finger on the problems that this raises so far as concerns employment in the industry and so far as concerns investment.<lb/>
However, the Government are committed to reform of the common agricultural policy because we are not
<col>114</col>
prepared to consider the alternative of waiting for the CAP to collapse in chaos. We believe that that would be far worse for our producers. I agreed with my noble friend Lord Middleton when he said that a prudent price policy ought to have been pursued years ago, but finding the common agricultural policy as we have in the last few years we feel that we have no option but to try to provide producers with the long-term stability that they need by pursuing the policies we have been pursuing.<lb/>
However, the Government have been concerned that a necessarily tough approach on prices must be accompanied by complementary measures to help the industry to find new opportunities, and on 10th March we published a number of documents dealing with our wider policy towards the rural economy in the years ahead as agriculture copes with these adjustments. In the publication <i>Farming UK</i> we set out our view of how the industry, we believe, needs to adapt. The level of production in Europe must, we believe, be brought back closer to consumption. We have to look at alternative uses for land. There must be more attention to the needs of the market and the legitimate demands of the environment.<lb/>
In any negotiations we are also determined to ensure that the necessary measures must be fair between member states, between different regions of the United Kingdom and between farmers, traders, the food industry and consumers. It is these three principles, the need for reform of the common agricultural policy, the need for a package of measures to help our farmers adapt, and the need for measures between member states to be fair, that guide the Government in the price-fixing negotiations that continue in Brussels later this month.<lb/>
With certain important exceptions, we have given a general welcome to the Commission's proposals. Broadly, we support the Commission in its four-pronged approach to a reform of the CAP by sustaining a tough price policy, by limiting intervention buying, by extending and strengthening guaranteed thresholds, and by reforming the green money system.<lb/>
On the key commodities of milk and beef, as your Lordships well know, the Commission's proposals are relatively straightforward following the major agreements recently made. These proposals, which do not change support prices, are in line with our approach, but we are opposed to the proposal to end intervention for salted butter. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, and others of your Lordships who said it would make no sense if producers in the United Kingdom and Ireland had to make a type of butter for which there is little market demand simply to put it into intervention.<lb/>
Perhaps I may respond to some aspects of the committee's report on milk and comment briefly on the agreement on beef. I have to admit there is one suggestion which comes from the Committee with which the Government do not agree; that is, that the choice of 1981 as a base year for allocating milk quotas was unfair to the United Kingdom. It so happens that there were member states who received a greater cutback in milk production than the United Kingdom. Their combined share of the Community milk market was 42 per cent. There were member states who received a smaller cutback in milk
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0066"/>
<col>115</col>
production than the United Kingdom. Their combined share was also 42 per cent.; so that the United Kingdom was at half-way in the league table of cutbacks.<lb/>
One understands that milk producers are anxious for greater flexibility in the quota system, but it is also difficult to see how this could be done by transferring quota between member states, which is the recommendation in paragraph 90 of the report. It would mean some member states giving up quota overall, and I do not see that as being negotiable at present.<lb/>
We should not underestimate the value to the industry, of the agreement we have achieved. Producers will receive compensation for quota suspended at the rate of 61&#x00BD;p per litre, the average profit per litre of milk being 3p to 4p per litre. As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, pointed out, average profitability per litre is perhaps not the only relevant yardstick against which to measure the value of compensation. The noble Lord put it a little more trenchantly than that, but 6&#x00BD;p per litre is also roughly equivalent to the average level of fixed costs of milk production and about half of total costs. I therefore feel that the compensation can be considered as generous as it was reasonably possible to expect in a difficult situation for many producers.<lb/>
It is worth adding that figures recently published show that milk producers' net margins rose by 45 per cent. in real terms in 1985 and 1986, and in each of the last two years dairy farm incomes have increased in real terms. Those figures lead me to believe what I have always guessed, that dairy producers in this country are resourceful in meeting what has been for them, I know, a very difficult situation.<lb/>
On the question of beef, perhaps I may emphasise that the variable premium arrangements, so important to United Kingdom producers, were maintained in the December agreement and safeguarded for two years. That is the longest run for this system which has ever been negotiated. The Government are aware of concerns about the effect of cow cull beef, and my right honourable friend the Minister has said that he will watch this market very carefully.<lb/>
The Commission has rightly chosen cereals as a sector requiring major changes. My noble friend Lord Middleton asked me what the stocks were now in this country. My information is that as of February this year there are in store 762,000 tonnes of feed wheat and 755,000 tonnes of barley, whereas in December 1985 there were some 2,000,112 tonnes of barley and 4,000,060 tonnes of wheat. That is a remarkable reduction which, as your Lordships know very well, was due to the strong market, particularly so far as concerns Spain because of the drought last summer.<lb/>
It is also the case because over the last few years many people in the cereals sector have looked ahead and provided splendid grain handling facilities, not least in the ports around our coasts, almost always with private sector capital. That is something which I very much applaud from the point of view of forward planning and also the splendid husbandry which our cereal farmers have shown in this country. I rejoice that it was rewarded in that way in the last selling season.<lb/>
<col>116</col>
Despite the sceptism of the noble Lord, Lord Walston&#x2014;I have listened to him speak about cereals on many occasions and I am always interested in what he has to say&#x2014;I am grateful to my noble friends Lord Middleton and Lord Radnor in particular for what they said in support of the idea of a cereals set-aside scheme, because the Government recognise that the surplus situation in this sector cannot be solved simply through the price mechanism.<lb/>
In March the Agriculture Council agreed the outline of a scheme under which farmers would be compensated for reducing the production of cereals, beef, wine and possibly other products. This extensification scheme is to be implemented in every member state's nationally determined rules, though participation will be optional for the individual farmer. I think that this is a concrete result of our advocacy of a Community-wide cereals land diversion scheme, voluntary at the level of the individual, applicable for a number of years and with a range of possibilities for alternative use of the land. We are now working on the practical details of the United Kingdom scheme. Over the next few months we shall be consulting the interests concerned. We shall try to ensure that the scheme suits our particular farming circumstances.<lb/>
In the oils and fats sector, where the regime is very expensive, reductions in support are needed and should be achieved by improving the guarantee threshold system, as the Commission proposes. However, I agree entirely with those of your Lordships who have spoken about this sector that the Commission is not justified in seeking to link this with its edible oil stabilisation scheme&#x2014;its oils and fats tax, which is, if I may say so, repugnant both in its name and in the effect that it would have. We are opposed to the scheme because it is not CAP reform simply to raise extra money by taxing consumers, particularly the least prosperous consumers, because that is what would happen.<lb/>
We are also opposed to an oils and fats tax because it would damage the Community's trading relations with a large number of countries including some of the poorest. We believe in particular that it would be folly for the Community to provoke a new quarrel with the United States over agriculture so soon after settling the last one. I am grateful to the committee for what it has put forward on this subject from an all-party point of view. The Government will continue to oppose this part of the Commission's proposals.<lb/>
Lastly, as regards commodities, the Commission has again proposed to limit payment of the annual, ewe premium to 1,000 ewes in the less favoured areas and to 500 elsewhere. This is clearly discriminatory. I assure my noble friend Lady Elliot of Harwood that we shall, as last year, oppose it.<lb/>
The Commission's proposals to reform the green money system concern the way in which the common price level itself is determined. Its proposal is designed to prevent the inflationary price increases which are the consequence of tying the common price level to the strongest currency&#x2014;the deutschemark. And of course it is too early to say at the moment how the negotiation is going to go. But the Commission has made a number of proposals for devaluation of member states' green rates. For the green pound it proposes a
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0067"/>
<col>117</col>
4 per cent. devaluation. I think the only way in which I can respond to the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, and the noble Lord, Lord Carter, is that given the situation in which we find ourselves and the problems of the industry, we have made it quite clear to the Commission that we want to improve on that figure of 4 per cent. and we shall certainly expect to secure a bigger change than France or the Republic of Ireland, who, as your Lordships will know, have smaller MCAs than we have.<lb/>
The Commission's proposals are tough, but they need to be because the Community faces a serious budgetary situation. The price proposals would, the Commission says, save 1,300 million ecu in 1987 and 3,600 million ecu in 1988, with the oils and fats tax. However, as my noble friend Lord Middleton and the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, brought out very clearly in their speeches, the forecasts for CAP expenditure in 1987 exceed the budget provision by almost 4,000 million ecu. Clearly the prices settlement, without the oils and fats tax, must be tough. Savings additional to those in the Commission's proposals will be needed, either during the price fixing or subsequently. The 1987 budget must be balanced.<lb/>
In effect, my noble friend Lord Middleton asked in his speech: how is it going to be done? At this hour perhaps I may just say that the Commission has of course committed itself to bringing forward proposals for balancing the budget and it is expected to propose a number of measures, including a technical change whereby member states will be reimbursed for their CAP expenditure, after the event rather than in advance; and of course that will make a saving which will depend on the extent of the delay, and it will also improve budgetary management. But of course that goes only part of the way.<lb/>
While the CAP is much the biggest influence on our farming industry, full weight must be given to the action which we are taking on a national basis, as outlined in <i>Farming UK</i>. This recognises that farming for food will remain agriculture's main task, but encourages farmers to look at the possibilities for diversification and to play their part in protecting and enhancing the countryside.<lb/>
The initiatives in <i>Farming UK</i> are, first, the farm woodland scheme, offering annual payments as well as planting grants for farmers who establish woodlands on productive agricultural land. We are still considering the many constructive comments we have received from the wide range of interests involved on the consultation document which we put out as a prelude to legislation. The document makes clear that it is our intention to build in environmental safeguards and to give special encouragement to broadleaved trees. It is a scheme which we estimate will cost &#x00A3;10 million a year. Some of this will be new money for Forestry Commission planting grants not provided for in its programme at present. The expenditure on the annual payments will gradually build up as more and more land is planted under the scheme.<lb/>
The second proposal is for some further expansion of traditional forestry, with more planting down the hill. The third proposal is the doubling of resources committed to environmentally sensitive areas. I am glad to report to your Lordships that these have got off
<col>118</col>
to a promising start and I hope the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, who made a very interesting speech, will agree with me that it is significant that as a result of the socio-structural package this scheme is now going to attract a Community contribution.<lb/>
The fourth element of <i>Farming UK</i> is the new scheme to help farm diversification, including&#x2014;and I hope my noble friend Lady Elliot will be pleased to hear this&#x2014;assistance for feasibility and marketing studies. This scheme had its origins in an amendment made to last year's Agriculture Bill in your Lordships' House. I should like to report that we are now well advanced on the preparation of a consultation paper on the scope, encouragement and coverage of the new diversification scheme.<lb/>
Finally, we are ensuring that in our R &amp; D and advisory programme more emphasis is to be placed on novel crops and livestock, which could have considerable long-term potential, and on the socioeconomic and environmental implications of the changing farm scheme. These new initiatives are expected to cost about &#x00A3;25 million a year when fully operational. It is a substantial new investment, even in the context of a lower level of CAP support. To say that this is not enough, as some critics have done, is easy, but that criticism carries the implication that the policy is a good one, and I am sure the package is going to be very welcome to those who benefit in the farming community and in the countryside generally.<lb/>
To pick up three points to which I have not been able to refer, the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, and my noble friend Lady Elliot of Harwood mentioned the need to see that farming continues in the hills. The Government very much agree with this. It is for that reason that my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture successfully negotiated a major extension to the less favoured areas two years ago.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Walston, and the noble Lord, Lord Carter, spoke in slightly different ways about the Commission's ideas for income aids. The Commission has said that it will bring forward proposals. We expect those to be published imminently. From the Government's point of view we welcome the suggestion that nationally paid income aids should be brought under proper control, since some massive payments made have threatened to undermine CAP reform and to distort competition. We shall examine proposals for European Community funded income aids closely, but we are sceptical about using agricultural EC funds for purely social objectives.<lb/>
We are also very aware of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, that United Kingdom farm structure is greatly superior to that elsewhere. We believe that we need to take particular care that such measures as the Commission proposes do not disadvantage us relative to others.<lb/>
Finally, a particular point was put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, about wine. We welcome in principle the Commission's proposals to strengthen the control arrangements in the wine sector. Along with many other member states we are seeking clarification of the Commission's intentions to ensure that the measures introduced will be the most effective means of improving regulation of this sector.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0068"/>
<col>119</col>
The Commission has indicated that it anticipates unquantifiable savings following improvement of controls, in particular a reduction in fraudulent claims for aid. If I may say so, that shows that the chairman of the committee asked a good question.<lb/>
I have listened with considerable sympathy to your Lordships' criticisms of the timing&#x2014;or perhaps I should say the lack of timing&#x2014;of the price fixing negotiations. However, I cannot say when this year's price fixing negotiations will be finally completed. Some member states have already demonstrated their hostility to the proposals put forward. However, we are determined that the measures agreed must be effective in taking forward the battle against surpluses and their associated costs, and they must do so in a way that does not discriminate against the United Kingdom.<lb/>
The issues have been described and discussed very clearly by the committee. I should like to repeat my thanks for a report which is particularly relevant at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00850"><member>Lord Gallacher</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the discussion on the committee's report, including of course my noble friend Lady Elliot of Harwood. The level of the discussion has amplified many of the propositions contained in the report. It has been sustained at a high level, as I should expect, having regard to the participants.<lb/>
I hope that the debate has been useful to the Minister, whom I should also like to thank for the very detailed reply that he has given us. I was almost grateful in a sense that he found two points of disagreement in the report, otherwise we may have been in too great accord; and that in the ultimate would have done no good to his Ministry or, indeed, to the committee.<lb/>
I hope that the Minister will convey to his right honourable friend our best wishes for a successful negotiation at the Agriculture Council in May, and for a safe return to the United Kingdom. I commend the Motion to the House.</membercontribution></p>

To ask Her Majesty's Government when they expect to reach the targets for reducing unemployment which they set themselves at the last general election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00865"><member>The Secretary of State for Employment (Lord Young of Graffham)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government did not set themselves specific targets for reducing unemployment. Since the last election we have seen continuous economic growth and the creation of more than 1 million jobs, and unemployment is now falling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00866"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Secretary of State recall that during the last general election campaign the Chancellor of the Exchequer made the specific statement that if a Conservative Government were re-elected there would be a reduction in unemployment? Is it not a fact that, had the criteria for assessing the figures not been altered on innumerable occasions since the last general election, there would be an increase in the figures? Is that not an outstanding example of the Government indulging in something which they often accuse local authorities of doing these days&#x2014;creative accountancy to produce the figures that they want, which are not the real figures?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00867"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord Lord Dean of Beswick, does not serve the House well by repeating the story that the figures have been changed on innumerable occasions. It is some years since the figures were changed. They were changed for good reason, and since then unemployment is down. It will continue to go down. If I may echo the words of my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if the country elects a Conservative Government unemployment will continue to go down into the indefinite future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00868"><member>Lord Kinnaird</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that in the present circumstances it would save the
<col>122</col>
country a great deal of money if we did not bother with an election and just carried on as we are?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00869"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suspect that this is not the correct House in which to make such a suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00870"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we appreciate that the noble Lord must make the best case that he can, but, despite the economic growth to which he referred, does he agree that unemployment is deplorably high in many areas of this country and that a reduction of a few thousand per annum does not help those areas? For example, in my area, unemployment is about 25 per cent. of the insured population. The same is true in many other areas. What are the Government going to do about that great crisis?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00871"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to assure the noble Lord that I did not by any means make the best case that can be made for the tremendous decline in unemployment that we have seen over the past eight months. We should not underestimate the change that has taken place in this country. For the past eight months we have seen unemployment fall by an average of 25, 000 a month. I suspect that it will continue to do that. However, no one in your Lordships' House or in the country should delude himself. As unemployment comes down stagnant pools of high unemployment will be left. Promises made by political parties will not deal with that problem. It is a serious problem and one to which I hope we shall begin to find some answers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00872"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I assure the noble Lord that all of us on this side of the House appreciate and welcome any decrease, however small&#x2014;25, 000 or whatever it may be. But he has not answered my question. What are the Government doing about the problem in extensive areas of this country&#x2014;Wales, Scotland, the North-East and North-West&#x2014;where unemployment is unacceptably, nay, deplorably high? How is the economic growth evincing itself there?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00873"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a very simple way. Unemployment has fallen fastest in the North-East and Wales and is now falling in all regions of the country. The Government do not have control of all aspects of the destiny of employment or unemployment in this country. However, we are seeing the economy growing faster and better here than in any other country. We are seeing unemployment dropping faster in this country than in any other country. Unemployment is falling at a rate which noble Lords may consider to be unsatisfactory, but a reduction of 180, 000 in the past eight months must leave all of us feeling satisfaction that the direction has changed. What we can do is work to see it accelerate faster. I assure the noble Lord that when we see unemployment substantially below the present figure we shall still have, unfortunately, some areas in the country where it is too high. In that respect we must work a great deal harder.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00874"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not my noble friend agree that one of the most important measures
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0070"/>
<col>123</col>
for reducing unemployment among youngsters is that they should be trained? Is he aware that many of the schemes cannot find enough people who want to be trained or are prepared to stick to the courses for more than a few days?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00875"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are now in a period in which we offer a nationwide guarantee to all school-leavers under the age of 18 that they have a place awaiting them on the youth training scheme. I hope that they will accept the offer of a place. We shall need to look carefully at the position if young people persistently refuse to accept such places.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00876"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are skillcentres in the South-East which have been unable to provide courses due to lack of instructors? In one area with which I am familiar a young man tried last October to train in painting and decorating. The skillcentre accepted him but he has not yet been offered a place because there is no instructor. That is becoming a common situation in the South-West and South-East.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00877"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware that there is a considerable skill shortage in the construction industry. That is apparent particularly in the South-East, but there are signs of it all over the country. We are urgently looking at ways to improve the standards of skill training within the construction industry. I believe that the job training scheme is one method which will prove a good way of helping to remedy the situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00878"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the Minister recall that in October last year, in a lengthy Written Answer to a Question that I tabled, he listed in great detail the very many changes that have taken place in the calculation and definition of unemployment figures, thus producing figures lower than those produced by previous calculations? How does that square with his claim, in answer to the Question on the Order Paper, that there have been no such changes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00879"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suggest that the noble Lord reads the Answer in <i>Hansard</i>. He will see that during my time as Secretary of State for Employment the only change has been to delay the count by two weeks, thus reducing an overrecording of 65, 000 a month to an overrecording of 15, 000 a month. The majority of the other changes&#x2014;there were three substantial changes&#x2014;took place following the change in 1981 and 1982 when we went from a period of voluntary registration to one of benefit count. The only other indices of unemployment are through the Labour Force Survey, which is a method used by many other countries and which shows that unemployment is under 3 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00880"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord saying that the Government can do nothing about persistent pools of unemployment? Is not that contradicted by the experience of the Highlands and Islands Development Board and other government-sponsored bodies?</membercontribution></p>
<col>124</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00881"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government can do a great deal but what they must never do is make promises which they cannot keep and deliver. I believe we are entering a period in which a great many promises may be made, but I hope that all Members of your Lordships' House appreciate that the only promises this Government will make are those which we can and will deliver.<lb/>
The problems of unemployment, and the stagnant pools to which I referred, are in the South as well as in the North. They are often in the inner cities, in the suburbs and on large council estates. They are proving difficult to cure but I suggest that they are problems to which all sides must turn their attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00882"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since training schemes for young people are so important and basic to the questions being discussed, since it is understood by the Secretary of State as much as by anyone else&#x2014;perhaps more&#x2014;that there are unsatisfactory aspects of the schemes that are causing blockages and the inability of young people to move into positions of real training, and since also a great many young people will never get a job despite the fact that they are on these training programmes, is it not time for him to introduce a debate in this House on that aspect of unemployment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00883"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will do well to look at the facts. Nearly two-thirds of young people who left the one-year YTS went into employment. Far too much is made of statements that young people are not going into jobs. There are some areas in the country&#x2014;but very few&#x2014;where the employment situation is difficult for young people. However, in that part of the country where I live 98 per cent., or 95 per cent., of young people leaving school go into jobs. I hope that under the two-year YTS the percentage of young people going into employment will increase substantially. I am the first to admit that not every YTS in the country is perfect, but we have had compulsory education for 110 years and not everyone in your Lordships' House thinks that the education system is perfect either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00884"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the Minister aware that even with his own figures, which he is claiming are a success, over the past 12 months there has been an average loss of 7, 000 jobs a month in the manufacturing sectors of our industries? That loss is continuing, with no sign of abatement. Is not that a dangerous trend? Can he indicate when we can expect those losses to stop? If they do not stop the future of this country as an industrial nation will be absolutely devastated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00885"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought that the noble Lord was going to congratulate the Government on actually reducing the rate of job losses in the manufacturing industries. In the 10 years after 1966 manufacturing jobs were lost at the rate of 10, 000 a month. They have been lost on a fairly consistent basis throughout every industrialised country in the world. They are now being lost in Japan at a fairly fast rate and are even beginning to be lost in Korea. That is a sign of the world changing, with more third world countries going through an industrial revolution. We must ensure that we have a profitable
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0071"/>
<col>125</col>
manufacturing sector and also pay regard to the fact that the majority of jobs in the future will come through the service sector.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00886"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is accustomed to making favourable comparisons on an international scale. Can he answer&#x2014;and answer directly&#x2014;the question that I have asked him on previous occasions? Which developed country in Europe among our competitors has a percentage of unemployment which is higher than that in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00887"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is keen to make international comparisons of an unfavourable nature. If he would care to put a Question down I should be happy to answer it in considerable detail. However, I recall that certainly the Benelux countries, which are the only other countries in the Community that have similar social security systems, have unemployment rates considerably above ours. France and Italy have unemployment rates of the same order of magnitude as ours. If the noble Lord would care to put down a Question I should be more than delighted to answer it in full detail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00888"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that unemployment has fallen marginally in the last few months&#x2014;and we welcome that&#x2014;not because of the Government's policy in their first seven years of office but because they have changed their policy in the last six or nine months? If by any chance they are re-elected, which policy will they follow? Will they follow the policy of the last six months or the one of the previous seven years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00889"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if, unfortunately, unemployment had gone up by 180, 000 in the last eight months, I wonder whether the noble Lord would have said that it had risen marginally. Nevertheless, I am not aware that the Government have changed their policy over the last few months. We are now seeing the fruits of eight years of consistent monetary control and growth. I suspect that we have before us another eight years in which we shall reap the fruits.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00891"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether any qualifications or other requirements are necessary before entry into the opinion poll industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00892"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are no statutory qualifications or requirements necessary to carry out opinion polls, although market research firms employ statisticians to plan and interpret surveys. I understand that the industry does exercise self-regulation in the conduct of market research and opinion poll work.</membercontribution></p>
<col>126</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00893"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his reply. Considering the influence that these polls exert on the timing of certain constitutional events, is it not strange that anyone can start in this business without training or a licence? Does he foresee a day when instant sampling has been brought to such perfection that it will no longer be necessary for the country to go to the trouble and expense of holding general elections?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00894"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suppose that one could say that the general election is the ultimate opinion poll.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00895"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend agree that polls which sample 1, 500 people are touching no more than 0.005 per cent. of the electorate?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00896"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have a calculator with me but if my noble friend says so I am sure that he is correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00897"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, even at this late hour will the Government consider issuing some kind of order prohibiting the publishing of the results of polls during the fortnight preceding a general election?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00898"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. The Government do not believe that there is a case for doing so. However, I should draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that a Bill is tomorrow being presented in another place entitled Political Opinion Polls (Regulation) Bill. It is being introduced by George Foulkes, MP.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00899"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that in 1970 the opinion polls on the Sunday before the general election showed Labour to be winning by 14 points? That is ominous, as that is the figure indicated today. The Minister will know his history. In 1970, on the Thursday, Labour were defeated. I do not know where the polls got that 14-point lead from. Perhaps he can explain it all to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00900"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly cannot explain the figure to the noble Lord. However, I should point out that the polls at the 1983 general election predicted the outcome accurately.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00901"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do we understand from the Minister's reply to the supplementary question that one should disregard existing polls, and that whenever the general election comes the public will not necessarily reflect them but might favour the Labour opposition?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00902"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Lord would like to disregard the current polls. I suspect that he might wish to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00903"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that there have been complaints from the older established practitioners that newcomers in this field have not carried out polls thoroughly? For example, they have taken telephone polls and produced results without taking into account that part of the population that does not have a telephone.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0072"/>
<col>127</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00904"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there are deficiencies in the sample&#x2014;and telephone polls would only reflect opinion among people who have telephones&#x2014;I do not believe that the reputable press in this country would wish to have anything but an accurate reflection of opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00905"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the light of what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, has said, what action can the Government take to ensure that these curiously biased opinion polls are not reported in the popular press? What opportunities are there for the Government to take action?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00906"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a biased opinion poll has been brought to my attention which was circulating somewhere in west London two or three weeks back. I believe that the responsible elements of the press would not wish to publish such blatantly wrong information. I do not believe that they would ultimately sell many newspapers if they continued to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00907"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord like to define further what he means by the "responsible" press?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Dowding Memorial</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00909">3.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00910"><member>Lord Balfour of Inchrye</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what would comprise "a sufficiently influential body of public opinion to support the proposal [to erect a monument to Lord Dowding] and to raise enough money to pay for the erection of the statue and its future maintenance, " these being words used by the Minister on 18th March. (H.L. Deb., col. 1418)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00911"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Lord Skelmersdale)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there appears already to be sufficient public support in principle for the erection of a statue to the late Lord Dowding. However, before giving his consent under the Public Statues (Metropolis) Act 1854 my right honourable friend will want to be satisfied that all the costs of erection and maintenance can be met from the funds subscribed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00912"><member>Lord Balfour of Inchrye</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I very rarely worry your Lordships these days but I must tell the House why I have done so today. I find that I am the only member of the Air Council of 1938 and 1940 and I worked alongside Lord Dowding daily for a long time. Therefore, I could not let this Question go by without asking leave to pay tribute to him.<lb/>
It is not for me to say anything except to ask a question. My question to the Minister is this. He is no doubt well versed in his history. Does he know that two actions by Lord Dowding in 1940 removed from
<col>128</col>
this country the dark, grey cloud of possible defeat which then existed? The first action of Lord Dowding was to demand to see the Air Council and to get an assurance from it that no further aircraft would go to France. He obtained that and we withdrew our force from the wreck of France. The second was that he deployed a force inferior in numbers against the Germans and won the Battle of Britain. Those are the reasons why I think that it is worth recording his great achievements.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Minister this. Is he willing to pursue the matter of getting the negotiations completed for the statue for Lord Dowding? I am grateful for the reply today which said that there is sufficient public support to do it. On the other hand, there is still outstanding the matter of finance. The finance required is not great. Some &#x00A3;50, 000 will probably cover the whole matter and leave money for maintenance in the future. However, one cannot expect to demand money from the public if, on the other hand, there is no permission given by the Government. Directly the permission is given by the Government then the money can be collected. It is a case of which came first, the chicken or the egg. I hope that they will get together now with the Battle of Britain council and come to an amicable arrangement for both sides which will allow the appeal to go out forthwith.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00913"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that series of questions. I shall answer the last and most important one. I can inform him and the House that I am in correspondence with Air Chief Marshal Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris in his capacity as chairman of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association. In a letter to me dated 31st March this year he said:
<quote>"The matter of Government sponsorship &#x2026; does not arise in this case".</quote>
My advice to the Battle of Britain Fighter Association would be to submit an application for consent as soon as possible with supporting documentation and as much information as possible about the support and funds obtained so far. When that application is received, I assure the noble Lord and the House&#x2014;bearing in mind not only the feeling exhibited all round your Lordships' House, but also my own feelings on this matter&#x2014;that it will be sympathetically entertained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00914"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that I have in my possession a letter from the Prime Minister on this subject which indicates in principle support, but states that the Government are bound by a decision taken in 1956 not to have any more monuments placed <i>in situ</i> by successive governments? Is he also aware that the letter says that planning permission has been given and a site provided by Westminster City Council? It is hoping now that funds will be made available. Does the Minister not agree that I speak for the vast majority of your Lordships when I say that though that is distinctly desirable, it is still the view of the majority of us that what Lord Dowding did was so tremendous in the history of this country that a monument ought to have been provided before now by the nation that he served so well and not by public subscription?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0073"/>
<col>129</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00915"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord's last point; but I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Dean, has misinterpreted my right honourable friend's letter which I have in front of me. I should like to quote from that:
<quote>"It has been the policy of successive Governments since 1956 not to sponsor further memorials to leaders of the Second World War".</quote>
That does not mean not to have memorials of this sort. Westminster City Council has granted planning permission on a pedestrianised site in the Strand between St. Clement Danes and Australia House so one hurdle has already been overcome.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00916"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that one problem that has been put forward is the cost of maintenance of the statue once it is erected? Can he confirm that the trifling sum involved will be covered if necessary by the Government in acknowledgement of the enormous services, of which we have already heard, given by the late Air Marshal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00917"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. It would be a very sweeping thing for me to suggest that the Government could cover what my noble friend calls the trifling sum involved. It is suggested to me at this moment without knowing details of the statue in question that the capitalised sum for maintenance could be between &#x00A3;15, 000 and &#x00A3;25, 000. In other words, what we are expecting is a capitalised annual maintenance for some 15 years. It would be difficult for the Government to commit themselves to that at this time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00918"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how mean can we get?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00919"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: As has already been made clear&#x2014;not by me in answer to supplementary questions, but by my noble friend Lord Balfour who asked this Question&#x2014;it has been the policy of successive governments, all governments, since 1956, not to make payments of this nature.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00920"><member>Lord Harvington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend whether he is aware that perhaps I too can join the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, in this business of being one of the Few? I am probably the only Member of your Lordships' House who commanded a flight in a fighter squadron in 1940. I can only say that this news we have had today that Her Majesty's Government will, provided certain requirements are forthcoming (which I am quite sure can be made to be forthcoming), have a favourable attitude towards the idea that there should be a statue, is something that those of us who are left who were involved with the late Air Marshal would very much like to see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00921"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am certainly grateful to my noble friend for putting into a very few words what I have been attempting to explain to your Lordships in rather too many.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00922"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend, in using the phrase "to sponsor", wish to encourage a financial contribution towards the erection of a statue?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00923"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, sponsorship means exactly that; namely, the provision of a capital sum.</membercontribution></p>
<col>130</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00924"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that I received a number of very touching letters after the last occasion this matter was discussed in the House which included cheques from pensioners who remembered with great gratitude what Lord Dowding had done for them 40 years ago? In view of the feeling expressed and the Minister's own very co-operative attitude, will he not approach his right honourable friend in order to make an exception at least to maintain the statue if the erection is paid for by public subscription?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00925"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said on 18th March, the first thing that has to happen is that we have to have a proper application which I advised the association today to submit to my right honourable friend as soon as possible. I think that would be, if I quote my words correctly, sympathetically entertained. What the noble Lord has just said in his supplementary question is proof of my opening remarks this afternoon. There appears already to be sufficient public support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00926"><member>Lord Irving of Dartford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the whole House will welcome the change of attitude on the part of the Minister to this proposition. Now we have a sponsor and now we have planning permission will the Government make sure that their contribution is as generous as possible, especially in view of the neglect of the contribution made by Lord Dowding?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00927"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think I can usefully add anything to the words I have already uttered on this subject: "sympathetic" means sympathetic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00928"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe the Minister told the House on one occasion that he was born in 1945. Will he join with me in saying that the pleasures of the Question this afternoon have been the tribute paid to Lord Dowding and being able to hear the voices of the last of the Few in this House? Can I, as president of the British cleaning industry, suggest that, since he was unprepared to make, as he said, a sweeping contribution to the cleansing of the statue if it is erected, the British cleaning industry itself might be prepared to sponsor the cleansing and maintenance of it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00929"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, sponsorship comes from surprising places, as occasionally does advertising in your Lordships' House. I am sure that suggestion will be welcomed by the sponsors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00930"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I just point out to the House&#x2014;because it is a point of interest and I must do so&#x2014;that my presidency is an unpaid position and I have no financial interest whatsoever?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00932"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0074"/>
<col>131</col>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what support they are giving to the Watch Trust for Environmental Education in the continuation of its project on acid rain, and whether they are encouraging other youth organisations on projects to mark European Year of the Environment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00933"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government approved last year a grant of &#x00A3;23, 667 to support this worthwhile project and I am glad that I am able to tell the House that we have now agreed to make a further &#x00A3;10, 000 available in the current year.<lb/>
The United Kingdom European Year of the Environment Committee regard it as particularly important to involve school children and young people in the year. As part of this it is making a grant of &#x00A3;5, 000 towards the cost of extending the Watch Project to other European countries during the year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00934"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I know that the Watch Trust too will be very grateful for what he has just said. Does he agree&#x2014;I think he does from his answer&#x2014;that it is important in terms of environmental care for the future that we should involve young people and do everything we can to draw in as many as possible? Can he say whether further grants will be forthcoming for Watch, because the sum which he has just mentioned, generous though it is, is something like 50 per cent. of the amount it has asked for?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00935"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords; I understand that it is in the region of 75 per cent. and that Watch asked for about 16, 500 for the current year. As I said in my original Answer, the Government are giving &#x00A3;10, 000. The project has attracted a considerable amount of private sector sponsorship&#x2014;in excess of &#x00A3;40, 000&#x2014;which is why the individual packs are remarkably cheap. The involvement of young people generally in the European Year of the Environment is a distinct project of the British Committee for the European Year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00936"><member>Lord Hunt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the second part of the noble Baroness's Question, does the Minister agree that the BBC provides a splendid service for education in environmental and wildlife programmes, especially for young people, through some of the episodes of its "Blue Peter" series? Is he aware of the excellent work done by young people through the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers and by the national park authorities through their information and interpretation centres, which are visited by many thousands of young people from schools and youth organisations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00937"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. I certainly agree with both the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The Government are most grateful for the work of my noble friend Lord Buxton, who chairs the media panel of the European Year of the Environment Committee. The "Blue Peter" series and also the "Wild Side of Town" programmes on BBC2 have made a tremendous environmental impact among
<col>132</col>
children. There has also been Television South-West coverage, more BBC 2 coverage and coverage by Yorkshire Television, and Super Channel satellite television is screening or preparing a series of programmes directly related to the theme. I too have seen BTCV projects involving young people and I regard them as very valuable both as social programmes and as environmental programmes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00938"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to what extent are the recipients of this poison&#x2014;notably Norway and Germany&#x2014;blaming us for its production?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00939"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to a certain extent. I received a delegation from Norway at the end of last year on exactly this subject and I had to make the point that not only is this transboundary pollution but there is also a certain amount produced in the countries which are themselves complaining.</membercontribution></p>

With the leave of the House, I should like to say a brief word about the length of speeches in this afternoon's debate standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, to which your Lordships have agreed to apply a five-hour time limit. On the principle that the mover is allowed approximately 20 minutes and the Minister should rise to reply not less than 25 minutes before the scheduled end of the debate, all other speeches should be limited to a strict upper limit of 12 minutes.

<title>Post-School Education</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00944">3.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00945"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member> rose to call attention to the state of post-school education; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00946">The noble Lord said: My Lords, a number of noble Lords, including some of my own Benches, have asked me why the title of this Motion on the Order Paper has changed more than once since it was first put down. The second change was an error in which I had no
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0075"/>
<col>133</col>
part, and an unimportant error at that. The reason for choosing the title "post-school education" rather than higher and further education was deliberate on our part and I think it is necessary for me to share our thinking on this with the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00947">The first reason is simply a matter of numbers. The number of students in our universities is 290, 000. The number of students in the non-advanced further education sector is 1, 619, 000. But if we take the non-advanced further education sector and the adult and continuing education sector, which is included in the title "post-school education", we have a figure of 4, 852, 000 students, which is more than 10 per cent. of the post-school population and is educated in something like 600 colleges throughout the country. It is for that reason that we have chosen this wider title.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00948">It is our firm belief that we will not get a true analysis of the status of tertiary education in our country by confining our analysis to the higher education sector or even to the higher and further education sector. No doubt individual Lords taking part in the debate will have things to say about the particular sectors of education in which they are experts&#x2014;and that is no bad thing&#x2014;but the House as a whole must in our view be concerned with the full state of post-school education in this country and the effects of the state of post-school education on our economy and society.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00949">Before moving to that analysis I should like to say something about the question of education and training, which appears sometimes to be an obstacle to a full understanding of these issues. Far too often vocational training, particularly vocational training at entry to working life, is training for the first job that a person enters into. But we know very well now with the rate of technological change in our society that the first job a person enters into is certainly not going to be the last, and the skills that are relevant at the age of 16, 18, 21 or 25 will almost certainly not be relevant later on in a person's working life. For those reasons it is important to recognise both the fact that education is a wider concept than the vocational training first entered into and that it is a concept relevant and continuing throughout life.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00950">There should be no need for us to deny the importance of the broader issues to which I have referred, or indeed to deny the great gap between our present performance and the performance of our competitors in the industrial world and the needs of our society. Perhaps I may look first at all at the issue of workers with recognised qualifications. In Germany, 66 per cent. of the labour force have a recognised vocational qualification. In the United States, 78 per cent. of the civilian labour force have a high school diploma. In Japan, 60 per cent. of the adult population have a lower secondary diploma. In comparison, the figures for the United Kingdom show that only 50 per cent. of the working population have even one certificate of secondary education. That by any comparison is a severe criticism of our existing system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00951">If we look at those bodies which have been considering the projections of future demand it is clear that, even taking into account the advances which have been made in recent months in government thinking&#x2014;and I pay tribute to them as I have done on
<col>134</col>
previous occasions&#x2014;the official projection of an increase of 4 per cent. in the number of students by the year 2000 is, to use the words of the Committee for Industry and Further Education,
<quote>"at odds with the UK's ambitions for renewal and growth".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00952">The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals calls that figure too unambitious and says that the need for mature and part-time students over the next 10 years means an increase of 50 per cent. in the numbers of mature and part-time students. Thus there is no doubt that we have needs greater than are being recognised at present by society or by government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00953">What is the present position so far as concerns government policies and the effects of government policies on the provision that is available? I know that the Government object very strongly when we use the word "cuts" to apply to higher, further and advanced and continuing education, but the facts are without doubt. Let us look at the vacancies for university teachers. In biological, mathematical and physical sciences there are 175 vacancies for lecturers and 44 for professors. In engineering and technology there are 162 vacancies for lecturers and 27 for professors. In administrative business and social sciences there are 159 vacancies for lecturers and 15 for professors, and in medicine and dentistry, 152 and 15. If we look at the recurrent grant for education in real terms, taking into account changes in the funding system, in 1985&#x2013;86 it was 89 per cent. of that in 1980&#x2013;81.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00954">The White Paper made welcome concessions for higher education, but even after those welcome concessions we learn from this morning's newspapers that Hull University, with an academic staff of 346, is forced to cut 90 academic staff from that number or face a &#x00A3;7 million deficit by 1990. That is despite the fact that it has achieved a 37 per cent. increase in external funding of research and has already cut its academic staff by 50. If one takes the Government's current predictions for the Open University, which is universally recognised as being the most successful innovative educational institution in the country, even on the higher projection that the Government have now accepted, there is no proposal for an increase in the number of Open University students.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00955">If we look at the funding side and the most recent government attitude, Mr. George Walden, speaking at the Universities Council for Adult and Continuing Education on 14th April this year, is using phrases such as "maximising income from students" and "keeping fees at a realistic level". In gross terms the money available in the government thinking does not square with the student numbers that they are projecting. They talk about 50, 000 more students by 1990 or 33, 000 full-time equivalent of students, but about an increase in grant between 1988&#x2013;89 and 1989&#x2013;90 of only &#x00A3;3 million, from &#x00A3;2, 327 million to &#x00A3;2, 330 million. That &#x00A3;3 million will not provide the funding for the additional 50, 000 students. On any reckoning of the success or seriousness of the Government's approach to post-school education there are serious defects.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00956">I want to go further than that. I suggest that there are barriers to development and change in our post-school education system which are not simply the responsibility of government but deserve the serious
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0076"/>
<col>135</col>
consideration of all who are concerned with these matters. They have lessons for the academic institutions concerned, employers in industry and commerce and in the public sector, and the Government. I suggest that there are things that need to be done by all those if there is to be the kind of improvement that the country needs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00957">The first barrier to change and growth to which I want to refer is that of formal education qualifications. It was a great step forward in its time when the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, as Secretary of State for Education, established the principle that there should be a place for everybody who had two A-levels and had found a place in an academic institution. I pay tribute to him for that. It was a necessary step on the road to expansion in higher education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00958">I pay tribute also to the fact that in the recent White Paper the Government restated their belief in the Robbins principle that all those who have the intellectual competence, the motivation and the maturity shall have an entitlement to post-school education. However, it is still the case that far too many academic institutions at all levels are treating academic qualifications in themselves as part of the screening process without recognising what is now very well established&#x2014;that those without prior academic qualifications perform extremely well at all levels of the post-school education system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00959">The Council on Industry and Higher Education in its recent report called A-levels a convenient ticket for limiting entry to a small academic world. The Council for National Academic Awards has indeed made significant progress in recent weeks towards opening up the higher education system. Even so, the general certificate of education is to be used as a benchmark and the use of access courses, which is very much to be welcomed, will remain only peripheral in its thinking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00960">If we are to expand the post-school education system, can we afford any longer not to be giving serious consideration to the entry into that system of those with qualifications from the technical and vocational education initiatives, from the CPVE and indeed from the YTS and JTS? Why, for example, should the de Ville review of vocational qualifications apply only to the further education system and not to the higher education system? We simply have not made enough effort to force academic insititutions and educational institutions in the broader sense to recognise the skills that are available in the country for more people to take advantage of post-school education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00961">In this context the old saying&#x2014;I am sure that Mr. Kingsley Amis will not be grateful for its being revived&#x2014;that more means worse has been proved so conclusively to be untrue since it was first made that no one has taken the trouble to learn the lesson that more means different; and difference is what is to be welcomed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00962">The second barrier to which I wish to refer is that of finance. I have referred to it to some extent in talking about government financial policies. We are still at a very early stage of thinking coherently and consistently about student grants and the relationship between grants for part-time students and mature students and
<col>136</col>
the barrier of six hours' education for those on unemployment benefit. All those will be referred to by my noble friends who are much more qualified to speak about such matters than I am, in particular my noble friend Lady Blackstone, to whose maiden speech we are much looking forward this afternoon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00963">We have not yet faced up to the fact that mandatory grants must take a larger role and discriminatory grants&#x2014;grants in which anyone, whether it be government departments, employers or local authorities, can discriminate against certain kinds of applicants&#x2014;must play a smaller part. We have yet to take account of the huge financial pressures, placed by the Government on local education authorities, which have forced them to charge what Mr. Walden calls "realistic fees", which are in fact the full cost of much provision and have done a great deal to inhibit growth in provision.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00964">The third barrier is the barrier of geographical accessibility. Here there are prospects with distance learning, with open learning, for many of these barriers to be overcome, particularly by those organisations such as the Open University which have taken care to use distance learning where it is appropriate, but to. make face-to-face access available wherever possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00965">The fourth barrier, perhaps the most important barrier of all, is the barrier of the structure of our educational system. Our post-school educational system is divided almost arbitrarily into what is called higher education, further education, and adult and continuing education. Even the changes taking place within the CNAA, and even the changes proposed in the recent higher education White Paper, go far too short a way to overcome those barriers. We are abolishing the University Grants Committee and the National Advisory Board, but we are not creating one body in their place; we are creating two bodies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00966">The credit accumulation and transfer scheme of the Council of National Academic Awards is a worthwhile initiative, but it only applies to public sector higher education and not to universities. The White Paper itself takes the easy step for any government to take by centralising; by taking the polytechnics away from local authority control. It does not take any of the more difficult bolder steps of breaking down the barriers in the binary system between the different parts of our post-school education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00967">Above all, there is still inadequate recognition paid to the need for adult and continuing education. The Council for Industry and Higher Education reckons that 1.3 per cent. of university income, &#x00A3;30 million, comes from the short courses which surely are the central component of the kind of retraining that our industry needs. It describes it as being an "underfunded spare-time activity" of our academics, and it contrasts it with the way in which the departments of continuing education in very many United States universities draw on the academic strength of the whole university.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00968">If anybody should think this were too recent, Sweden has had the 25-4 system, which says that anybody who reaches the age of 25 and has been in work for four years shall be entitled to continuing education throughout life whether it is in the form of retraining, the form of purely academic pursuits, or in
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0077"/>
<col>137</col>
any other way that the student wishes it to be. That retraining has taken place since 1969 and it has successfully raised the calibre of the Swedish workforce in a way that cannot be compared with any activities in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00969">I have said that there are demands on our institutions, our Government and our employers. I am conscious of the time and I certainly cannot repeat in any way what I have been saying about the institutions. It is obvious that a partnership between government, employers and our institutions is going to demand great changes on the part of our universities, our polytechnics and our colleges. We can no longer afford for our academic institutions to be producers' co-operatives as they have been in the past.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00970">Demand on industry and employers has been in my view very much mistaken by the present Government. They have talked as though contribution towards, for example, city technology courses is an adequate demand to be made upon employers. In fact, the demands upon employers are going to be much greater. They are going to be in terms of support for students, support for collaborative research, support for certain kinds of academic staff posts, for courses and for buildings, and only in the last resort for cash. Employers are going to have to learn to take the responsibility for their employees throughout their working lives for all the retraining which is going to be necessary as the world changes around them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00971">So far as concerns government, the demands have been throughly set out in many of the documents from the unions, from the academic organisations and from those other public bodies which have commented; and not least the Council for Industry and Higher Education. If, to take one example only, the Government cannot get their act together as between the Manpower Services Commission and the Department of Education and Science, and if we still have the situation where the job training scheme is in competition with MSC-funded non-advanced further education places, it is clear that the Government have not thought through the whole range of the problem of our futher, higher and advanced and continuing education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00972">More means different. It means changes for all of us. It is not going to be easy for us to achieve. It means a recognition of the lifelong rights of our people for a better education. It means the creation of a learning society. It will certainly not be done with present policies or even by demanding more of the same. It can only be done by a recognition of the partnership of all those involved. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00973">3.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00974"><member>Lord Blake</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we all welcome the Motion proposed by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey. It is important that we should discuss these matters. As he said in his opening remarks, there are a wide number of subjects to be discussed and each person contributing to this debate will have his own field that he would like to talk about. I am going to concentrate on the university field, which is the one I happen to know something about, and with particular reference to the White Paper to which the noble Lord referred.<lb/>
<col>138</col>
I welcome some features of it. It is right that the polytechnics should be removed from local authority control. This removal will be generally appreciated, though possibly not by the local authorities themselves. The recognition that the polytechnics and colleges are national and not local institutions seems to me to be important and that is a good thing.<lb/>
I also welcome the projection of student numbers in the White Paper. It may be a bit of a deathbed repentance on the part of the department to produce figures which correspond faintly to reality, unlike previous ones, but still, deathbed repentances should be welcomed along with others. Certainly it is much more realistic than what has appeared before.<lb/>
I also welcome the creation of a new body to replace the University Grants Committee. This largely follows the lines of the report by the noble Lord, Lord Croham, though not entirely. I think it is right that we should have a body which is more representative of non-academic interests and less exclusively dominated by academic interests. This is a change for the good.<lb/>
However, I am worried about the White Paper in certain respects. In a short speech, as this has to be, I can only pose this briefly. I am worried about exactly what is intended by the new University Funding Committee&#x2014;the UFC&#x2014;which is to replace the UGC. It is apparently to be a strong and independent body but it does not seem as though it is in a position to advise the Government. At least it does not look like that from the recommendations of that report.<lb/>
However, there is some obscurity in its role. What is meant exactly&#x2014;and I hope that the Minister may be able to explain this when she replies to the debate&#x2014;by the substitution of "contracts" for "grants"? Who exactly contracts with whom, for how long and on what basis? The whole affair is somewhat obscure. I hope that we shall be told just what is meant.<lb/>
I have a faint feeling that this business of contract in the White Paper&#x2014;something which at any rate does not appear in that form in the report of the noble Lord, Lord Croham, &#x2014;is a belated, bright idea thought up by someone or other in Whitehall or elsewhere rather late in the day. It reads as though it has been superimposed on the document at the last moment. If its purpose is to restrict still further universities' independence and ability to decide their use of resources, I am somewhat depressed by the prospect. One cannot make contracts to produce Nobel prizewinners.<lb/>
There is in the White Paper a certain spirit of utilitarian commercialism which bodes not too well for our future. What will happen to universities which fail to win contracts? On one interpretation, this new body will have enormous power; on another, it will be the UGC under a new name. I think that clarification of this point will be welcome.<lb/>
I can see all too easily the possibility of elaborate bureaucratic supervision which will hamper and hinder the natural development of ideas and initiatives. We do not want the kind of rigid control which prevails in the highly centralised state-run universities in continental Europe, where even the most trivial issues must be referred back through endless tiers of authority for final decision.<lb/>
After all the battering, cuts and shifts in finance, what is now needed in the university world is a
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0078"/>
<col>139</col>
measure of predictability. It is essential to see a least some distance ahead. I note that the White Paper, if accepted, substitutes a rolling programme rather than the fixed triennium which the noble Lord, Lord Croham, and his colleagues recommended. I am far from sure what that means. It sounds all right and it appears in the context of a statement recognising:
<quote>"the importance of giving higher education institutions as much advanced information as possible about total resources likely to be made available".</quote>
That total is absolutely crucial.<lb/>
I revert to my uneasiness about the UFC's role in the matter of finance. It is disturbing that it does not appear to be in a position to advise the Government on this matter. In the White Paper there is a specific statement that the UFC's essential responsibilities relate to allocation of funding between universities rather than to its overall amount, which is a matter for the Government to decide after considering all the evidence. Under our system the Government must have the last say in funding. What is the evidence that the Government will consider? Would not advice from the UFC at least be a useful element in that evidence?<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like to make certain suggestions which may seem slightly outrageous. When Mr. Gladstone lost a certain election in Oxford he came to his new constituents and said, "At last I am come among you unmuzzled". There are perhaps remarks that one can make towards the end of one's time in academic life which are difficult to make when one is currently involved. I have two points which I believe the Government, or whoever is involved in university education, should consider quite seriously.<lb/>
First, can this country afford to have research spread over 46 universities? It is the scientific research which costs money. I know of all the difficulties that might be involved, but is there not a possible case for considering whether advanced scientific research in that sense should be confined to a smaller body of universities; 10 to 15, rather than 46? I think that economies could be made in that respect which might be important.<lb/>
The second suggestion which I should like to float to your Lordships is this. Is there anything sacrosanct about all dons and professors being paid more or less equally? Is there not a case for considering whether certain talents and suchlike are in short supply, and that those should be recognised by additional payment? After all, that is a normal feature in most aspects of life in the country. I cannot see that this rather dullard egalitarianism, which prevails all too often in the university world, should continue.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-00976"><member>The Lord President of the Council (Viscount Whitelaw)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat in the form of a Statement the Answer to a Private Notice Question which has been asked in another place on the need for a review of the
<col>140</col>
operations of the Security Service in the mid 1970s. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"Mr. Speaker, the right honourable gentleman the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth has today called for an inquiry into recent allegations about the security service in relation to the Government led by the right honourable and noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, between 1974 and 1976.<lb/>
"Allegations of this nature first gained currency 10 years ago, in July 1977. They were summarised in a speech in this House on 28th July 1977 by my right honourable friend the member for Blackpool South. The allegations ranged widely, but were to the effect that the security service had sought to discredit the duly constituted government of the day, and in particular its Prime Minister; or that some members of the security service had conspired together to do so.<lb/>
"On 23rd August 1977, the right honourable gentleman the then Prime Minister issued a statement in which he said that he had conducted detailed inquiries into the recent allegations about the security service and he was satisfied that they did not constitute grounds for lack of confidence in the competence or impartiality of the security service or for instituting a special inquiry. On 8th December 1977, he told the House that Lord Wilson associated himself with that statement and therefore there was no reason to carry the matter any further.<lb/>
"I accepted the right honourable gentleman's statement and conclusions without question. I believed them, and I still believe them, to be correct.<lb/>
"Early in 1978 a book was publised, entitled <i>The Pencourt File</i>, which contained fuller accounts of these allegations. My honourable friend the member for Woking has let me see copies of correspondence which he exchanged with the right honourable gentleman the then Prime Minister. My honourable friend drew the right honourable gentleman's attention to the contents of the book, and in particular to a number of statements attributed in the book to the then Sir Harold Wilson. My honourable friend urged the then Prime Minister to arrange for a full inquiry to be undertaken by the Security Commission.<lb/>
"In his reply dated 20th February 1978, the then Prime Minister said:
<quote>'So far as I can see, there are no significant statements about matters of national security in this book of which the authorities were not aware when I issued a statement on allegations about the Security Service on 23rd August last; I put the statement in the <i>Official Report</i> on 8th December.'.</quote>
He concluded&#x2014;and I again quote&#x2014;
<quote>'I have nothing to add to it.'.</quote>
"In recent weeks these allegations have been given renewed currency in press reports which the right honourable gentleman, in his statement issued this morning, says go into greater detail than the 1977 inquiry knew about.<lb/>
"It would not be appropriate for me or other members of this Administration to see papers relating to that time, and we have not asked to do so.<lb/>
"I can, however, tell the House that the Director General of the Security Service has reported to me
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0079"/>
<col>141</col>
that, over the last four months, he has conducted a thorough investigation into all these stories, taking account of the earlier allegations and of the other material given recent currency. There has been a comprehensive examination of all the papers relevant to that time. There have been interviews with officers in post in the relevant parts of the security service at that time, including officers whose names have been made public.<lb/>
"The director general has advised me that he has found no evidence of any truth in the allegations. He has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular he has advised me that all the security service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine Lord Wilson and his Government when Lord Wilson was Prime Minister.<lb/>
"The then director general has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right-wing views and he has further stated that he had no reason to believe that any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service. Further, the director general has also advised me that Lord Wilson has never been the subject of a security service investigation or of any form of electronic or other surveillance by the Security Service.<lb/>
"The right honourable gentleman the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth, in a statement he issued on 22nd March this year, declared that he had every confidence in the integrity and ability of the present Director General of the Security Service. So do I. I accept the assurance and the advice which he has given me.<lb/>
"This latest investigation, taking account of recently published material, confirms the conclusions reached and announced by the right honourable gentleman in 1977, which I then accepted without question. That was in accordance with the tradition of bipartisan Front Bench support for the security and intelligence services and the work they do.<lb/>
"Like the right honourable Gentleman in 1977, and again in 1978, I do not propose to institute any other inquiry into these matters. In the light of the director general's assurance and advice, I do not believe that any further inquiry would be justified.<lb/>
"So, Mr. Speaker, once again, as in 1977, detailed inquiries have confirmed the conclusion that there are no grounds for lack of confidence in the competence or impartiality of the Security Service or for instituting a special inquiry. It is time to stop raking over the embers of a period over 10 years ago and to assert confidence, as I readily do, in the Security Service's strict adherence to the directive under which it carries out its duties, and in its skill and loyalty in carrying out the tasks which it is called upon to undertake in the defence of our security and freedom."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00977"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are very grateful to the noble Viscount for repeating the reply to
<col>142</col>
the Private Notice Question, and we also appreciate the detail in the Statement itself. I personally say at once that the director general's words must be taken seriously. Nevertheless, I am sure the House would agree that in a parliamentary democracy there is nothing worse than a conspiracy to overthrow the elected government. If there is any doubt whatsoever that such a conspiracy may have been contemplated by individuals in positions of authority, then the circumstances should be examined in detail by an independent tribunal or committee.<lb/>
The Statement has referred on a number of occasions to the inquiry of 1977, but it is the fact that the inquiry of 1977 was directed to a very narrow study and examination. As I recall, it was directed to the question of bugging. Since then of course far wider issues have been thrown open. Mr. Peter Wright, in his book, is reported to have accused a number of security officials of this most serious offence and, whatever our views of him may be, I believe we are obliged to take his words very seriously indeed. A failure to do so would make us uneasy about the future of our democratic form of government. If it is true that there was a plot, the country should be told who was involved and they should be brought to account for their actions. No one, including the director general or anyone in the security system, is above the law.<lb/>
I would stress that it would be quite wrong to prejudge the question of whether any security officers had planned to destabilise my right honourable friend's government. However, the accumulation of charge and accusation and the increasing list of names referred to by the noble Viscount appearing in the press from day to day make it essential, in my view, that this whole thing should be cleared up once and for all. With the greatest possible respect, I do not think that this Statement by the Prime Minister satisfies me. I therefore hope that the matter will be reconsidered&#x2014;as I think it will have to be before long.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00978"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a very important Statement and we are most grateful to the Leader of the House for repeating in full the Answer to the Private Notice Question by no less a person than the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition and in connection with a statement made by an ex-Prime Minister relating to issues affecting another ex-Prime Minister.<lb/>
The totality of these circumstances make it immensely important that we should get the right answer. From these Benches it is hardly necessary for me to say that we accept completely the integrity of and the total trust to be placed in the director general of the service. I repeat, my Lords, completely. What we have to deal with is another question. We have to deal with the question of whether these allegations, on whatever foundation they rest, will be dissipated satisfactorily without a full and independent external inquiry.<lb/>
It is my view, and the view of my colleagues in the Alliance that that will not take place. We therefore urge the Government to hold an inquiry in the interests of the health and the morale of the service, and with a view to removing any doubt whatever about the inaccuracy of these allegations. I very much hope and believe that they can be removed. We take the view that it is essential for the protection of the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0080"/>
<col>143</col>
services and indeed for the protection of democracy that there must be a proper external inquiry as to the incidents involved.<lb/>
For that reason we would support the suggestion made in another place that a senior judge should be appointed to head that inquiry after the fullest consultation. I am bound to add&#x2014;I am sorry to take up your Lordships' time&#x2014;that if we are concerned with expelling all doubts whatsoever in the public mind, it is essential that the fullest consultation should take place before such a judge is appointed so that he can be seen to have the confidence of our people. We want this removed once and for all.<lb/>
Questions would also arise as to setting up machinery with regard to the future of the services. Perhaps this is not the appropriate occasion, in view of the Prime Minister's surprising judgment&#x2014;I hope I may be permitted to say that in my view it was an error of judgment&#x2014;to consider that fully. However, I hope that I may add one further suggestion and ask the Leader of the House whether he is aware that we feel the morale of the service, which has suffered considerable blows recently, will be helped and restored if they find an ally to whom they can turn and to whom they can explain their difficulties, perhaps in the form of a committee of chosen Privy Councillors who could be relied upon to listen (and only to listen) and to present a report which would not include any detail whatever of what they had heard. Without such an ally and such encouragement, I fear that the morale of the service may not adequately recover.<lb/>
So I am bound to support what has been said by the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition in this House; that further consideration should be given to this most serious matter in order to reach the same conclusion that every person in this House wants to reach: that there is nothing whatever in these allegations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00979"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00980"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so to the noble Lord, I fully appreciate that he wishes to question me, but I think it right that I should answer first, in the normal form of this House, the noble Lords who have spoken from the two Front Benches.<lb/>
I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and to the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, for their very strong confidence in the Director General of the Security Service. I think we should all start from the extremely important premise that both of them were prepared to accept immediately the total integrity of the Director General of the Security Service. I am very grateful to them for what they have said.<lb/>
Therefore, it is important to look at everything that has been said subsequently against the background of the conclusions reached by the Director General of the Security Service. His conclusions were perfectly clear and set out very fully in the Statement: that he had found in extensive investigations in the service no evidence of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson or his government. Those are important statements from someone whose integrity both noble Lords have fully endorsed. So I would start from that point.<lb/>
<col>144</col>
Despite his confidence in the director general, the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, feels that it is still important that further bolstering, if that is the right word, of that position is necessary in the interests of the morale of the services. The noble Lord, Lord Diamond, suggests that further investigation should be made to confirm basically what were the views of the Director General of the Security Service.<lb/>
I have to point out that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, having had the benefit, as the Prime Minister of the day has, of a report from the director general, has come to the same conclusion as the right honourable gentleman the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth came to when he was Prime Minister&#x2014;that no further investigation is necessary. Both Prime Ministers have had the benefit of evidence from the Director General of the Security Service, in whom both noble Lords have trust. That is a very important factor and one that I must put before the House.<lb/>
So far as any comments in Mr. Wright's book are concerned, I think the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, will realise, as I am advised, that it would be totally improper for me to make comment on anything which concerns that particular legal action. Although I understand it would be perfectly in order to do so, I think it would be wrong for a Member of the Government so to do, and I will not take that point.<lb/>
I note the views expressed by the two noble Lords and of course I shall report them to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, but I have to come back to what I have said very plainly&#x2014;that, as in 1977, as the right honourable gentleman the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth decided that no further inquiry was necessary, so my right honourable friend the Prime Minister decided today. I hope the House will see that there is a certain logic and clear continuity in the views of both my right honourable friend and the right honourable gentleman the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth, whose integrity in these matters I know all noble Lords would wholly accept. Bearing in mind that they have both had the great responsibility of being the Prime Minister of the day, I think that conclusion on both their parts is something of great importance for this House to understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00981">4.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00982"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will recognise that I have a rather special personal interest in this matter. I am grateful to the noble Viscount for repeating the Statement, but what he has said is that the security service has investigated itself and given itself a clean bill of health. In no way do I impugn the integrity of the director general, but I find that totally unacceptable.<lb/>
It will surprise noble Lords to hear that I have not heard a word from the Director General of the Security Service. He knows about the allegations concerning myself. Why has he not asked to see me or to see the documents which I have? There has been no word from him in this investigation. I find that absolutely unacceptable.<lb/>
I agree with my noble friend Lord Cledwyn and with the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, that there must be an adequate inquiry of some kind which has power to
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0081"/>
<col>145</col>
send for persons and papers, including, may I say, police records, which are extremely important in this matter&#x2014;to send for them and require their presence. If nobody else will do it I hope that a Select Committee of the other place, or perhaps a joint Select Committee, will do it. But I must tell the noble Viscount, for whom I have enormous respect, that I am not going to let this matter drop and nor will my friends. We shall continue pressing day in day out until it is investigated thoroughly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00983"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would be quite improper for me to comment on the personal position of the noble Lord, which he has set before the House. He will be the first to appreciate that when these matters were investigated in 1977 it was the view of his then Prime Minister, the right honourable Gentleman the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, that there was nothing in the various allegations. I understand from what he has said, and I have to accept it, that that does not satisfy him. Clearly it is not for me to pursue that matter further. I can only say that I regret the understandable feelings that the noble Lord has and I shall certainly see that his views are passed to the appropriate quarter.<lb/>
I do not think it is possible for me to go further than to state my belief in what the right honourable Gentleman the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said on that occasion about these allegations and many others, which has been confirmed by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00984"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lords, Lord Cledwyn and Lord Diamond, said that we should have an inquiry to clear up the doubts. Having watched governments in this place for the last 36 years, I am convinced that if an inquiry were set up now it would add to and exaggerate the doubts. It is not possible for an inquiry to clear away the slurs in that way in view of the categorical statements made today by the Prime Minister and by the right honourable Gentleman the Prime Minister in 1977.<lb/>
If ever there was a time when Members of the two Houses of Parliament should be prepared to accept the authenticity and objectivity of statements from the Dispatch Box this is it. Damage to the morale of people at home and of our allies abroad could be immense, to a point which can hardly be exaggerated, and to have an inquiry now would confirm the doubts which have been expressed by Mr. Wright, who has gone back on his undertaking not to disclose these matters. To take that risk now would be dangerous and wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00985"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note what my noble friend has said. In accordance with the position that I have taken so far I think that it would be appropriate if I did not comment further on what he said. Above all I do not think it is for me to seek to second-guess not one Prime Minister but two.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00986"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Viscount answer the specific point that has been made by my noble friend Lord Glenamara? How can an inquiry be considered deep and widespread if it has not been given an opportunity to question the noble Lord, who has been mentioned in these matters?</membercontribution></p>
<col>146</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00987"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only tell the noble Lord that I said that I shall pass on the point that has been made by the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, to those who are most nearly responsible, and I shall do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00988"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount is being ingenuous. The right honourable Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has made it perfectly clear both in statements and today in another place that he regards the inquiry of 1977 as reflecting a situation that is quite different from the one today and that further evidence has come to light which needs investigation.<lb/>
It is quite ingenuous to put together the Statement made by the right honourable Member who was Prime Minister at that time in 1977 and the Statement that has been drawn out from the Prime Minister and the noble Viscount by the statement of the right honourable Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. The noble Viscount has not said what the Government intend to do now. Surely if the Government have any regard for the morale of the security services they will recognise that no matter what they do there are newspapers in this and other countries that will dribble out the information in the book of Peter Wright, whether it is false or true. What will the Government do about that constant dribble of information?<lb/>
The Statement mentions the honourable Member for Blackpool, who in 1977 commented on an article in the <i>Observer</i> and matters that were public knowledge. Do the Government now intend to try to stop the public from having information about what is contained in Peter Wright's book? If they are, then they are doing a grave disservice to the security services which they now profess to be safeguarding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00989"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord considers that I am being ingenuous in repeating the Statement made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and associating with it the statements made by the right honourable Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth at that time. I do not at all accept that 1 am being ingenuous.<lb/>
Equally I do not think that it would be right for me to proceed down the road to which the noble Lord wishes to direct me. First of all, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, I have made clear that I think it would be wrong for me to comment on any of the matters described in Mr. Wright's book and the case that is taking place in Australia. I hold very strongly to that.<lb/>
So far as concerns other statements being dribbled out in the press, I note what the noble Lord has said but my right honourable friend has made perfectly clear&#x2014;indeed, so did the noble Lords, Lord Cledwyn and Lord Diamond&#x2014;that she has complete confidence in what the Director General of the Security Services says. If one has such complete confidence and believes that that is right I think that one can accept, as the noble Lord says, that statements in the press are likely to drip out&#x2014;I think that was the term he used.<lb/>
If that is what the press want to do, they will do it whether or not one has an inquiry, and they will still do it even after there has been an inquiry. The noble Lord
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0082"/>
<col>147</col>
and everyone else knows it. There comes a time when one has to decide whether something is right or wrong. My right honourable friend has made her position very clear.<lb/>
Since noble Lords have made their representations to me, I think it is right for me to say that I shall bring to the attention of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister the views that have been expressed in your Lordships' House. It is my duty to do that and I shall do it. I believe that the House will recognise that I am in the position of repeating a Statement and therefore that I must report to the person who made it initially. Of course I shall do that but I am not prepared to be pushed down the road indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, when he says that information may be dribbled out in the press. I am one of those people who, had I gone down that road during my 30 years in public life, certainly should not be here today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00990"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount agree that the Statement vindicating the conduct of officers of the security services tends to support rather than quash the numerous allegations that have been made against named people that they are security risks? I think that it tends to increase fears about the vulnerability of No. 10 to the intelligence services of foreign governments during this period. I am not now speaking about a conspiracy against the Prime Minister, but is there not a need to clear up these apprehensions and to draw lessons from them to make sure that such a thing does not happen in the future?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00991"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I can only say that those who have a complete belief in the integrity of the director general have to take into account the advice he has given to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister that he has found no evidence of any truth in the allegations. The Statement says:
<quote>"He has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false".</quote>
I must ask the noble Lord to consider that.<lb/>
My right honourable friend says:
<quote>"In particular he has advised me that all the security services officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine Lord Wilson and his Government when Lord Wilson was Prime Minister".</quote>
If one believes in the integrity and indeed the strength of the director general of the security services, at least one must take account of the comments that he has made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00992"><member>Lord Parry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount accept that so much depends on the integrity of the leader of the services? During the time that the noble Viscount the Leader of the House was the distinguished Home Secretary of this country he established inquiries many times about difficulties arising within police forces in this country. That did not signify that he was questioning the integrity of the chief constables of those forces. A chief constable would make initial inquiries and then an independent chief constable or his representative would be brought in to examine the charges. Is there not a complete analogy with that case?</membercontribution></p>
<col>148</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00993"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the greatest respect to the noble Lord, I do not think it is a direct analogy. Whether I was right or wrong when I did that, I have to say that some of the people concerned questioned whether I was questioning their integrity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00994"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Viscount clear up one point that appears to be puzzling some of us? Who asked the director general of the securities services to conduct this inquiry? Did he do it as a result of a request from the Prime Minister or did he do it on his own account?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00995"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no question that in view of the various allegations that were made the director general of the security services thought that that was right and proper and I know he conducted this inquiry entirely on his own account. Obviously he realised that he would have to report to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on the many allegations that were coming forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00996"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Viscount recognise that we are not talking about the confidence of the noble Lords, Lord Diamond and Lord Cledwyn, in the integrity of the director of the security services? The events of the past few months and years have led to a grave lack of confidence in the security services felt by. the public at large. Does he recognise that the old saw about justice not only being done but being seen to be done applies in this case, and can he tell us&#x2014;as he repeated in the Statement&#x2014;that there are no grounds for lack of confidence in the competence of the security services? If so, how was it possible that they employed Mr. Wright?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00997"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I simply say to the noble Lord that taking it from the general position of all those who have expressed confidence in the director general, I have considerable confidence in the security services of this country, and so do a very large number of people in this country. If the noble Lord or anybody else were to say that because they found a mistake made by some organisation or some individual they did not have confidence in that organisation or individual over a broad field, there would be very few things in this world in which one would have confidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-00998"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend the Leader of the House aware that there are many noble Lords on this side of the House who find this Statement not only entirely satisfactory but a welcome relief?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Post-School Education</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01000"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the debate is resumed, I think that I should inform your Lordships that the debate in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of. Haringey, is now due to end at 9 p.m.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0083"/>
<col>149</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01001">4.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01002">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01003"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the opening pages of the government White Paper the authors state that the higher education system in this country is one of the "best in the world". One is therefore tempted to comment: "If it is not broken, don't mend it&#x0021;". Why meddle so much with a system which is said to be one of the best in the world? That is not of course to say that there is no room for change and development; quite plainly there is.<lb/>
I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, that change and development is the order of the day. However, along with that change and development it is surely of the highest importance to maintain that quality which is said to be of the best in the world. Because of the short time allowed, and for that reason only, I shall concentrate on the higher education system. Others of my colleagues will be speaking on other aspects of post-school education. I should like to make it quite clear that I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, that the whole field of post-school education needs to be examined thoroughly and with a willingness to make quite radical changes.<lb/>
We say that because we have to recognise that the future is to the highly educated countries. Any country which hopes to hold its place economically, politically and socially in the world of the future must have a far higher level of education than it has had in the past. We in this country are nowhere near the level at which we need to be. A quantum leap is required throughout the whole education system, not just a slight improvement here and an adjustment there.<lb/>
When it comes to higher education I find myself in many respects, though not in all, very much in line with much that was said by the noble Lord, Lord Blake. The changes that we need in higher education are surely of two kinds: an increase in the numbers involved, a development and maintenance, and where possible an improvement, in the quality. As regards the numbers of people entering higher education, it is a good thing that the Government have accepted in the White Paper the higher level projection for the future and not the lower level which it was feared at one time they would consider was adequate.<lb/>
Although that is certainly a step in the right direction, there is also reason for disappointment in that, although the Government agree that there will be an increase in the number of people entering higher education up to 1990, they accept that because of falling school rolls there will be a decrease in the number between 1990 and 1996.<lb/>
In the same White Paper the Government stress the importance of mature students entering higher education. Surely the fall in school rolls gives us a first-class opportunity, not probably to be found again for decades, to make a real onslaught on the entry into higher education of mature students. Why should we not keep up the numbers, and indeed expand them, and see to it that because there are falling school rolls we can attract into the university system many of those now mature people who for one reason or another did not have the opportunities to go or did not take them
<col>150</col>
earlier on? If we are to do that we need to be prepared to keep the upward flow in the numbers, but we also need now&#x2014;and I say now&#x2014;to start preparing ways in which those mature students will be ready for the places that should be there for them in 1990.<lb/>
There are many different categories among those mature students. I wish to mention particularly the very many women who have been under-represented in the higher education system in the past and who undoubtedly have ability, many of whom would now like the opportunity to enter into higher education of that kind. I say this as a challenge to the Minister who will reply. Can we not between now and 1990 study and quickly put into action a plan to make it possible for far more of those people to be ready to take higher education schemes in the years 1990 to 1996?<lb/>
Some specific things need to be done as regards women. It needs to be made very much easier for them to attend courses by virtue of better child care provision. Let us get that one out of the way first because it is an important element. There must also be adequate financing. At present it is often very difficult for women to take courses, let alone access courses. Women need preparatory access courses if they are going to move on to higher education, but it is difficult for them to take those courses because of the regulations which state that people cannot take a course of that kind unless they are unemployed&#x2014;and a married woman is not unemployed, is she? Therefore, she is not eligible.<lb/>
Let us look at the whole question of the financing of women who have good potential for higher education. With that is linked the whole question of part-time students. If we mean business by mature students we must provide facilities for part-time higher education. If that is the Government's intention, I can only say that their behaviour over Birkbeck College, which is the prototype of part-time higher education, does not bode well for the future. Let them think again about that. This is an opportunity certainly not to be missed.<lb/>
On the matter of quantity there are among men as well as among women people who should be coming forward. We need something like the FET courses which were made available to people who came out of the services at the end of the war. I had the privilege of teaching some of those people&#x2014;I am going back such a long way&#x2014;and anyone who taught in the universities at that time would confirm my view that they were some of the best students that we ever had and they were people who had never thought of going to university before they became involved in the war. However, they seized the opportunity of the FETs and it has been of great benefit to the nation that they did so.<lb/>
On the matter of maintaining and improving the quality of our higher education, the Government must not allow the continuing flight from this country of some of the ablest people in the universities. I know that there has been a return brain-drain as well as a brain-drain, but the distinguished list of names of people who are leaving this country is a matter for real alarm and the Government should be deeply concerned about it. They should find ways of reversing the trend. It is not only a matter of money. The penny-pinching over university salaries has obviously not helped, but it is also a matter of providing resources
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0084"/>
<col>151</col>
and opportunities and the sense of being able to do a really first-class job.<lb/>
Part of the raising of quality, and part of the way of giving high-level academics a feeling of doing a really first-class job, is to make sure that there are good graduate courses in our universities. With the extension of knowledge, and with the fact that in the future we need people who are both broadly based and have a high level of specialist knowledge, the graduate course in the universities will be of the very greatest importance. The fourth year, the graduate-taught higher degree, is something which gives encouragement and scope to good academics and which produces the kind of people who in all fields&#x2014;in industry, in education, in the Civil Service&#x2014;can give the leadership which we need and which at the present time we are not getting; and yet we are very under-provided so far as graduate courses are concerned. Will the Minister tell us what thoughts the Government have about this? It is inadequately covered in the White Paper.<lb/>
Along with that I should like to say that I think it is not a good policy to suggest&#x2014;and it will certainly not be encouraging to good academics&#x2014;that there should be universities which undertake research and universities which only teach and do not undertake research. Of course it is sensible to have a certain amount of rationalisation. I do not for one moment defend the small department which keeps going because it wants to keep going with a very small number of students and a very small staff and which cannot possibly support good research. On the other hand, I believe it is a contradiction in terms to talk about a university as a university if it is not doing research. The interplay between research and teaching&#x2014;I know it has been said many times, but that does not make it wrong&#x2014;is of the essence and I strongly oppose the proposal that there should be some so-called universities which do not undertake research.<lb/>
In looking at the White Paper, I find reason for considerable concern about the proposed control of the universities to maintain and improve quality as they see it. As regards this new body which is being set up, this Universities Funding Council, there is nothing wrong with that in itself but, as the noble Lord, Lord Blake, asked: what is the nature of the contract that we are hearing about? A contract implies that the body will lay down conditions presumably which the university has to accept. There is running through all this part of the White Paper a tendency towards central control and bureaucratic interference which is the very contrary of what is needed in a university.<lb/>
For example, the White Paper says:
<quote>"The Government should provide guidelines at appropriate intervals to set the framework for the planning process which the UFC and the universities should conduct".</quote>
Again:
<quote>"Arrangements for the flow of management information and for accountability from the universities to the UFC and onwards to Government should be much improved".</quote>
And, most sinister of all,
<quote>"The Government will, in particular, be concerned to see that the UFC's arrangements for making funds available to universities
<col>152</col>
properly reward success in developing co-operation with and meeting the needs of industry and commerce':.</quote>
I have always been strongly in favour of the close working together of industry and the universities. When I was teaching I did a very great deal of this and in fact I got money out of them, which will surely give me credit on the Front Benches. But that is not what a university is about. That is not what a university is for. At the risk of being corny, I remind your Lordships that what a university is for&#x2014;of course it makes its contribution to wealth creation and to industry&#x2014;is the discovery, dissemination and safeguarding of truth. If that is not compatible with its other duties, then those other duties will have to go.<lb/>
That aspect is not developed by direction from on high. Why do the Secretary of State and his advisers think that they are the people who will be able to create the creativity inside the universities? Creativity does not come in that way. The imaginative leap of research does not come in that way by instructions from on high. The wind bloweth where it listeth. But that sort of wind will not come from the nostrils of the Secretary of State and his civil servants.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01005"><member>Lord Adrian</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this afternoon we are debating post school education. I think we are all agreed that it is a subject of major importance. I think we are mostly agreed that post-school education is in some disarray. We are probably disagreed on the reasons for that state of affairs. But in the relatively short time that I have I shall, like the noble Lord, Lord Blake, and the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and for fairly obvious reasons, confine myself to universities. If I echo what has been said already, I hope that the Government will recognise this as some little force to what has been said.<lb/>
The reason I speak on universities is that I have some direct experience of them and for a brief span some responsibility as Vice-Chancellor at Cambridge. That is an interest that I think I have to declare in this debate. Perhaps I may say at this point how very much I am looking forward to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone.<lb/>
I do not believe your Lordships will need telling that morale at universities is low. It is hardly surprising that it should be. Seven lean years and, much more depressing than that, years of rebuke and criticism, not all of it justified&#x2014;some of it has been&#x2014;not all of it well informed and culminating in the Green Paper of 18 months ago, have reduced our confidence to a low ebb. Therein lies the danger that your universities may become so demoralised that they will uncritically accept whatever is suggested by Whitehall, especially if it is presented with a friendly smile and a little praise.<lb/>
A government who have reduced their universities to merely licking the hand that feeds them may have saved themselves some immediate trouble, but I do not believe they will have done much for our children's future. Universities which simply do what they are told to do by government will eventually cease to be universities, because independent and adventurous minds will no longer wish to work in them. They will go elsewhere. Indeed, they are already going elsewhere.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0085"/>
<col>153</col>
So we must look very carefully at the White Paper <i>Higher Education: Meeting the Challenge</i> to see how it charts the future of universities. As has been done already, we can welcome the Government's explicit commitment to increased access and to their new projection of student members. Now that the Department of Education and Science has at last agreed with universities, the Association of University Teachers, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, the Royal Society and the Confederation of British Industry, that student numbers in tertiary education are unlikely to fall below present levels in the period to the end of the century, we have at least now a common framework.<lb/>
The important task is to develop our institutions and change our universities so that they meet the needs, as they change in the coming years, of those coming to the universities from school, and the wider needs of society and the economy into which those students will graduate. I include in those wider needs both the provision of qualified graduates and the advancement of knowledge and technology.<lb/>
I have great faith that with dialogue, encouragement and support the universities will respond to these needs. After all, Cambridge responded quite early on in the provision of scientific education in the nineteenth century, when it was much more independent of government than it is now, and it was in the very forefront of computer development and molecular biology in the middle of this one. What we need is confidence and some room to take risks. We have not had much of either in the last few years. Universities produce, as was said so eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, ideas and knowledge as well as graduates equipped to build the economy. We must never lose sight of either of these vital functions.<lb/>
In contrast to the White Paper's positive and encouraging stance on student numbers, its other proposals seem to me to endanger some of the few good features of the present system. Like the noble Lord, Lord Blake, I am concerned that the newly proposed universities funding council seems to be deprived of one of the most important functions of the University Grants Committee&#x2014;the provision of advice to government. Section 4.40 says&#x2014;in a way that is all too characteristic of the many rather imprecise details in this White Paper&#x2014;that the Government will have to give further consideration to the terms of reference of the universities funding council. I hope that they will do so. But there is no suggestion in the White Paper that the universities funding council will be asked to provide public evidence or advice to government to aid them in making the decisions they very properly claim to be theirs.<lb/>
Of course I welcome a wide representation on the universities funding council and I hope that it will go considerably wider than just the universities and manufacturing industry, as has been suggested in some quarters. But to get the benefit of that wider representation and membership surely its voice must be heard. If we are to be successful in remoulding our universities there must be public debate. Published advice from the universities funding council must surely be part of that dialogue.<lb/>
<col>154</col>
There is a further major area to which the Government will surely have to give more consideration, and that concerns university and indeed polytechnic funding. The noble Lord, Lord Blake, has already noticed the new phrase that has appeared in the White Paper. Grants are to be replaced by a system of contracting. It is insufficiently clear just what that implies. Until we know more, at this stage we can only speculate. Are we to bid in competition with other universities for contracts? Can we seek contracts from the universities funding council to finance new projects? Contracts may even have attractions: both parties to contracts are bound by them. The noble Lord, Lord Blake, suggested that we could not plausibly seek a contract to produce, for example, two Nobel prizes a decade. However, perhaps we could do better, in view of the Treasury's well-known view that Nobel prizes are an expensive luxury, and contract to produce no more than two Nobel prizes in a decade.<lb/>
More seriously, if contracting means that all funds are earmarked, universities will lose what little control they now have over their own affairs. We must reserve judgment until we know much more about the contracting system. But we can wonder about section 4.41, which says <i>inter alia</i> that financial relationships between the universities funding council and universities should be governed by financial memoranda. Having recently experienced the imposition of financial memoranda on two major grant-aided institutions I am left wondering how these may be reconciled with the notion of contracts between two independent bodies.<lb/>
I remain profoundly sceptical that the White Paper sets the right course as regards funding our universities. If we want diversity and development of the kind suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Blake, rather than uniformity, which has, one must admit, developed in the years of Robbins and thereafter, the universities must regain some degree of independence of action and innovation. Much of the White Paper, though printed in glorious technicolour, is still too green for me.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01007"><member>Baroness Blackstone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must first of all declare an interest in the subject brought forward for debate by my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey. In the autumn I become the Master of Birkbeck College, where 92 per cent. of the students are part-time. I hope very much that the difficult financial situation which faces the college can be resolved. If not, I fear that both providers and potential students elsewhere will be discouraged and will draw their own conclusions about the value attached to part-time studies in our system of post-school education. Birkbeck has a special symbolic importance as an institution which for over 150 years has helped people who work in the day to study at night. I know that many Members of your Lordships' House have supported Birkbeck in recent months and how much this has been appreciated. I also appreciate the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, on this matter.<lb/>
Access to post-school education should be readily available to all social groups in our society. Unfortunately some groups have for many years been
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0086"/>
<col>155</col>
under-represented, especially in what has traditionally been known as higher education in the universities and polytechnics. These include women, young people from working-class backgrounds and the black and ethnic minority community. Moreover too much of our post-school education has been concentrated on the years immediately after leaving school at the expense of older people, many of whom could greatly benefit from returning to education with the advantage of more experience and maturity.<lb/>
When I was visiting Canada recently I was told at the University of Toronto of a student who is 96. She is slowly working towards obtaining a first degree on a part-time basis. She now has 10 credits out of the necessary 15. Everyone at the university is very much hoping she will live long enough to get her degree. Recently, when the press were seeking to interview her, it was discovered that she was travelling around Europe on her own. She is currently so fit and energetic that the auspices are good. I am not suggesting that it is necessary to wait until the age of 96 to become a truly successful undergraduate, but I am claiming that we should get away from the absurd idea that education should be largely confined to those aged between five and 22.<lb/>
One way of broadening access is to make it easier for older students to get back into education. Let me illustrate with the example of women. When I went to univerisity in the early 'sixties about a quarter of undergraduates were women. Today the figure is 44 per cent.&#x2014;a big improvement, although it ought to be 50 per cent. I contend that many of those women caught in the gap between the 25 per cent. then and the 44 per cent. now who missed out earlier could benefit from returning to study in their thirties or even later.<lb/>
There are two ways in which we should make it easier for them and similar groups. The first is to relax the entry requirements in higher education for older students on a much greater scale than at present. I believe that to expect older people to go through a two-year A-level course is unreasonable, and will put off many prospective students. Instead encouragement should be given to local education authorities to provide a network of short access or return to study courses along the lines of those successfully established by the Inner London Education Authority.<lb/>
I also take the view that to ask for A-levels is unnecessary. Recent research at Brighton Polytechnic funded by the Council for National Academic Awards, based on a large sample of students in both universities and polytechnics, demonstrates that. The degree results of those accepted on the basis of entry qualifications other than A-levels were slightly higher than for those accepted on the basis of A-levels. The non-A-level group did, however, include people with other recognised qualifications for higher education such as Higher National Certificates. When these are excluded, those in the non-standard entry categories still fared no worse on average than other students. The research also found that degree performance improves with age up to the age of 40. So providing opportunities for increasing numbers of mature students and relaxing entry requirements for them will not affect quality adversely. If anything it will improve it.<lb/>
<col>156</col>
The second way to help older students return to education is to have more part-time places. Many potential students over the age of 25 will have jobs which in these days of high unemployment they will be reluctant to give up; many others will have dependants and the associated financial commitments which mean that they cannot afford to become full-time students; some will simply prefer to combine work and study. In the United States, Canada, Australia and a number of European countries a high proportion of students are taking courses and holding down jobs at the same time. In the UK, in spite of the excellent work done by the Open University, the proportion is much lower, partly I suspect because of the way the system discriminates against part-time students.<lb/>
It is a strange anomaly that full-time students automatically have their fees paid by their local authorities, however well off they or their parents are. Part-time students automatically have to pay their own fees, however poor they may be. Part-time students cannot set these fees against tax as happens in some other countries. It seems extraodinarily inequitable that students who are taxpayers and work much harder than most other people, combining a job and a degree, should be treated in that way. Moreover, their cost to the Exchequer is much less than full-time students because they are not eligible for maintenance grants. They do not even receive small grants towards the extra costs of studying, such as purchasing books and travel. Surely those hard-working and highly motivated people, committed to self improvement, deserve better treatment than that.<lb/>
In the Government's White Paper on higher education there is a welcome reference to the need to extend access to a wider range of students and to encourage more mature students. Positive action must now be taken to make that happen, along the lines that I have suggested. Central and local government, the UGC and NAB (or their replacements), the universities, polytechnics, colleges and, last but not least, employers will need to work together to achieve the necessary change. Employers can play a big role by encouraging their employees to obtain further education and training, by giving them some time off to ease the burden of part-time study and full-time work and by providing some financial support.<lb/>
Improving access to post-school education, especially to more part-time students, would do two things: it would enrich the lives of people deprived of the benefits of education that many of us have had, and it would also be in the country's longer term interest. Noble Lords in all parts of the House will agree that investment in our human resources has not matched that of many of our industrial competitors.<lb/>
We cannot afford to waste talent. There are thousands of people all over our country with undiscovered or unrecognised talents who have not had the chances to have them developed that they so richly deserve. We ignore them at our peril if this nation is to flourish. As the numbers of 18 year-olds decline in the next decade there can be no better time to increase the number of older students. I hope that the means will be found as a matter of the greatest urgency to make that happen.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01009"><member>Lord Butterworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will agree with me when I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, on an excellent and confident maiden speech. Those of us, and I know that there are many, who regard adult and continuing education as of vital importance at present will have found what the noble Baroness had to say imaginative and moving. The noble Baroness has the widest experience not only now of Birkbeck College, but, going back through the ILEA, of some excellent reports from the think tank. We look forward with the greatest pleasure to her future contributions.<lb/>
I should have liked to follow her on this important subject of education for the mature, but I must recall that I was deputy chairman of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Croham, on the future of the UGC, and so I think that like a cobbler I had better stick to my last this afternoon.<lb/>
The Croham Committee has, I think, cause to congratulate itself on the fact that so many (not all) of its recommendations have been so speedily accepted. The new universities funding council (the UFC as it is to be called) has in some sense become the precedent for the PCFC (the Polytechnic and Colleges Funding Council). When the polytechnics become independent, there will be a dual structure with the UFC on one hand and the PCFC on the other.<lb/>
There was one sentence from the White Paper quoted by my noble friend Lord Blake which has attracted considerable comment. I shall quote it again. It states: "It"&#x2014;that is to say, the Government
<quote>"wishes to emphasise, however, that the UFC's essential responsibilities should relate to the allocation of funding between universities, rather than the overall amount, which is a matter for the Government to decide after considering all the evidence".</quote>
That sentence is unexceptionable as it stands, unless of course one sees in it evidence of the Treasury and other organisations creeping cat-like through the White Paper.<lb/>
It would be a pity, as has been said, if there is cut out from the duties of the UFC the duty of advising government on a whole range of university issues, including the financial provision which should be made for them. The Croham Committee recommended that the terms of reference should include the duty and the power to give that advice.<lb/>
The present UGC has four complementary functions in its relationship with universities. First, it is to give advice to government; secondly, to distribute to individual universities the resources made available by government; thirdly, the collection and publication of information about universities; and, fourthly, to maintain systems of financial control and accountability for resources which the UGC allocates to universities. The Croham Committee considered that the role of advising government and the executive role of distributing resources to universities are not in practice wholly separable. It said:
<quote>"An advisory body which did not have to deal with the consequences of its own advice would be less credible and might be less responsible".</quote>
If I may put forward a personal view, as the NAB had the duty to publish its advice it was commonly agreed that the advice of the UFC and the PCFC should also be published. The difficulty about
<col>158</col>
published advice is that the advisers tend to become more firmly attached to it by virtue of the very act of publication, and may find themselves slipping into arguing or lobbying on behalf of the universities and therefore carrying out the function which is more appropriately served by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. The UGC and therefore the UFC is not outside the machinery of government. To be successful, it must be an integral part of it.<lb/>
Much has been said this afternoon about the problem of contracts. The Croham Committee foresaw the advantages of something akin to a contractual relationship being developed between the council and the universities, a relationship which would entail a continuous review by the council of the academic plan of each university, assisted by performance indicators and the like. Indeed, the Croham Committee wanted the staff of the universities funding council to be strengthened to enable these duties to be carried out. So far, so good, my Lords. If, however, the contract with the university became too detailed, so that the block grant was converted into a series of earmarked grants each to be contractually enforced, the autonomy of universities as presently understood would be greatly impaired.<lb/>
As has been said this afternoon, one of the most valuable consequences of that autonomy has been the initiative which universities have continually taken to meet new demands and new needs. No council can foresee everything that will be needed nationally from the universities. So often the function of the UGC, and therefore of the universities funding council, will be to respond to the initiatives of the universities and to reconcile their separate strategies with perceived national need.<lb/>
I should like to speak briefly about medical education and to consider the difficulty of applying the contractual concept to medical education. Medical and dental schools account for about one-fifth of the UGC's total recurrent grant, although dental and medical students amount to only one-tenth of the total undergraduate population. That, however, is only part of the financial story. Training in medicine and dentistry relies not only on the resources of the UGC. An equally substantial contribution comes from the NHS, especially in the teaching hospitals, and the time of NHS staff. Capital is dealt with by what is known as the Pater formula. An important aspect of this formula is that recurrent costs incurred by NHS staff are not strictly accounted for but are considered to be parallel to the contribution made by the UGC-funded staff to the health services, on the basis of mutual uncosted assistance, as it is called. It is the famous knock for knock principle. To put it more bluntly, it means that no one knows or works out the costs of these mutual contributions.<lb/>
It was graphically explained to us in this way. Let us take a professor of surgery doing his rounds, accompanied by a group of his students. As he leans over a patient it is impossible to say whether the professor is devoting his time to teaching, research or patient care. Hence we have the knock for knock principle. The relative contributions of the UGC and the NHS vary from institution to institution and indeed among specialisms.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0088"/>
<col>159</col>
Let us take one example. The UGC contributions to medical schools historically have always been higher in the provinces than in London. Therefore when the UGC moved from historical funding and based itself on the actual cost of a student in different disciplines the application of that principle to medicine resulted in additional resources being moved into London just at the time when the national policy, as expressed by RAWP, tended to withdraw NHS resources from the London teaching schools.<lb/>
How shall we apply a contractual machinery to this situation? Who are to be the contracting parties? Is the NHS to be a contracting party? How would performance indicators and the like be adjusted to measure the respective contributions funded by the NHS and by the UGC? I submit that the organisation and funding of medical schools might first be the subject of a special inquiry. That inquiry should consider the problem of enabling universities to pay to clinical teachers the salary award made by the medical profession because the universities have just given notice that they may have to break the link between the pay of clinical teachers-and hospital doctors and dentists since they are not in possession of the funds to carry out their undertaking.<lb/>
The Croham Committee pointed out that the mechanisms for joint policy development between the DES, the health departments and the UGC are weak. Recently a joint note between the DES and the health departments has been produced, which is one step in the right direction. At least it recognises the existence of the problem. However, the content of that note is bland. It is clear that these bodies have a long way to go before any solution is found.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01010">5.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01011"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should first like to add my congratulations to those of the noble Lord, Lord Butterworth, to my noble friend Lady Blackstone on her excellent maiden speech. I hope that she will not mind my saying that I saw her work at close quarters when she was a member of the central policy review staff&#x2014;if that is what it was then called; it has had many changes of name. I was delighted when she became a Member of your Lordships' House. I hope that we shall hear much more from her in the years ahead.<lb/>
I intend to confine my remarks entirely to higher education. In the Green Paper published in November 1986 the Government put forward a thoroughly depressing view of the future of higher education. However, this present White Paper has an expansionist tone. The tone at least is, by contrast with the Green Paper, very welcome.<lb/>
The question for the House is whether we can trust this Government to provide the resources to turn their expansionist plans&#x2014;produced on the eve of a general election&#x2014;into reality if they are returned at the election. If the record over the past eight years is anything to go by&#x2014;and that is the only guide we have&#x2014;we certainly cannot trust them to do so.<lb/>
The number of students in higher education is crucial to the whole debate. The Green Paper in November 1986 put forward two projections. The first was called projection P. It assumed that a constant
<col>160</col>
percentage of sixth formers and other groups&#x2014;mature students, women and so on&#x2014;would go into higher education. I hope that that projection has been abandoned and that we shall never again hear anything about it. If we as a nation are not to go into economic decline in the two or three decades immediately ahead, we must achieve in full the numbers in projection Q; that is, numbers based upon an increasing percentage of sixth formers, women, mature students and so on going into higher education&#x2014;but especially an increased percentage of sixth formers. The sheer arithmetic of demographic change demands this.<lb/>
The position is quite simple. Between now and 1996&#x2014;which is not very far ahead&#x2014;the number of teenagers will drop by a third but industry and commerce will not need a third fewer recruits. Indeed, with their growing sophistication and dependence on technology especially electronics, they will need more, not fewer, recruits. The percentage last year of sixth formers going into higher education was 14.2. That percentage will be quite inadequate in the late 1990s.<lb/>
In the White Paper projection Q estimates that the number of sixth formers going into higher education in the year 2000 will be 18.5 per cent. That is after a considerable and dangerous drop in the middle 1990s. It also estimates that the number of sixth formers qualified to go into higher education in the year 2000 will be 20 per cent., which it is already, I may say, in Scotland; therefore, 20 per cent. qualified in the year 2000 and 18.5 per cent. going into higher education.<lb/>
At a number of points in the White Paper the Government make the claim that they are so improving our schools and the education in them that this target will be achieved. That is rich coming from a Government who have presided over the greatest and most devastating demoralisation in the education service in my lifetime. If English and Welsh schools reach the 20 per cent. target in the year 2000 it will be in spite of the Government and not because of them.<lb/>
There is a considerable reservoir of ability in this country which is not being tapped as it should be. If it were tapped it would enable us to reach that target in the year 2000 and, indeed, to surpass it. The vice-chancellor of Durham University made a speech to the Institute of Bankers in March of this year. He said that,
<quote>"the untapped reservoir is mainly within the working class; it is in our large, inner-city comprehensives that need, urgently, to get a good supply of maths, physics, chemistry and language teachers, with first-class equipment".</quote>
How right he was&#x2014;the large inner-city comprehensives, where a considerable proportion of our secondary school population is taught and where they under-achieve in old, very often much demoralised schools.<lb/>
I can only assume that the Secretary of State has also reached this conclusion, but the remedy he has put forward is the wrong one. It will make matters worse. His remedy is to establish city technology colleges. Have the Government really considered the effect that these city technology colleges, if they get off the ground, will have on existing comprehensive schools in our inner cities by denuding them of their keenest and most able students? Anybody who understands schoolmastering will know what effect that will have on the schools in which the vast majority of our
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0089"/>
<col>161</col>
secondary school pupils will continue to be taught. I believe such colleges will make the position worse, not better.<lb/>
The answer surely is that there should be more generous provision of resources with more and better&#x2014;indeed, the best&#x2014;qualified teachers, especially in science, mathematics and languages. With that approach I believe the 20 per cent. target can be assured and indeed exceeded. However, it is needed now because this autumn's intake into the secondary schools could be the newly qualified graduates in the year 2000.<lb/>
If the Government's White Paper&#x2014;an expansionist White Paper&#x2014;is to be more than a pre-election bauble, adequate resources must also be provided in higher education for student support and for teaching support. The colleges, polytechnics and universities have proved in the past eight years that they can make bricks without straw, but they at least need clay. We are rather afraid that the clay will not be forthcoming. In the past eight years the Government have eroded the unit of resource to such an extent that universities and polytechnics are now teaching the country's best brains with second best equipment.<lb/>
Of course the Government call all this an increase in productivity. I find this constant reference to productivity&#x2014;which I do not equate with getting value for money and which is altogether different&#x2014;in a White Paper on education to be nauseating. Look at what has happened. Unit costs from 1980 to 1986 are down by 5 per cent. in the universities, by 15 per cent. in the polytechnics and by 20 per cent. in the voluntary and other grant-aided colleges. The Government call that higher productivity. I say that it is an appalling under-funding of institutions which are absolutely vital to our national well-being. What has been achieved in the universities and polytechnics during the 1980s reflects no credit whatever on the Government but it reflects a great deal of credit on the dedicated people who are working in the universities, polytechnics and colleges.<lb/>
Many noble Lords can speak with much more knowledge that I about funding but I should like to make two points. First, the White Paper rejects the Croham proposal that funds should be set in cash terms for three years. The noble Lord, Lord Blake, referred to this. The so-called rolling programme of the annual public expenditure planning process is no substitute for that; and, like the noble Lord, Lord Blake, I have never known quite what it means. It is no substitute for the certainty of a three-year horizon which allows the universities and the polytechnics&#x2014;it will apply to them&#x2014;to plan ahead. When I was Secretary of State there were quinquennial reviews and now they are denied even a triennial review.<lb/>
Everyone accepts&#x2014;the universities and everyone else&#x2014;as did the Croham Committee, that in a national emergency planned allocations might have to be altered. We understand that. However, short of that&#x2014;and I hope the noble Baroness will answer this&#x2014;why on earth do the Government reject this sensible proposal for a three-year horizon?<lb/>
Secondly, in paragraph 4.41 the White Paper states:
<quote>"The Government should provide guidelines at appropriate intervals to set the framework for the planning process which the UFC and the universities should conduct".</quote>
<col>162</col>
This is clearly essential and also endorses the recommendations made by the Croham Committee. However, the White Paper omits an accompanying Croham recommendation for two-way communication and consultation, including advice from the UFC to the Government on the views, aspirations and funding requirements of the university system. The rejection of these two Croham proposals is extremely disappointing and I invite the Government to reconsider them.<lb/>
In conclusion, there is one aspect of the White Paper which I greatly welcome. I refer to the proposal to remove the polytechnics from the sphere of local government. I do not welcome it for the reasons given in the White Paper. I am sure that the Government are doing that because of their non-stop vendetta against local government. The polytechnics, which were formed by the Labour Government in the 1960s, are the real success story of education in Britain over the past two decades. However, the Labour Government never intended that local authorities should dominate the polytechnics indefinitely. Indeed, I remember expending a considerable amount of time and effort to ensure that their articles of association did not allow them to do so as far as their governing bodies were concerned.<lb/>
Legally of course they are owned by the local authorities and their staff are local authority employees. The articles of association cannot change that. The local authorities have nurtured those bodies from designation to maturity with, on the whole, a commendable sense of responsibility and sensitivity and with considerable pride. However, like all our offspring, they have outgrown the context in which they grew to maturity. It is now almost like the tail wagging the dog, with some large polytechnics of 15, 000 students owned by and governed by a relatively small local authority, and that is not satisfactory. The provision for capital expenditure having to come through the local authority has reached the point where it is positively harmful to the polytechnics. Therefore, I think this proposal is very much to be welcomed.<lb/>
At the same time I hope very much that the polytechnics will retain links with the local authorities. I have here a letter from a director of a very large poloytechnic. He says this:
<quote>"My line is to draw an analogy with a teenage son becoming of age and leaving the family home and standing on his own feet&#x2014;and without any 'topping-up' pocket money. This then allows the son and his parent to have a much better relationship as two relatively equal adults, rather than an adult-child relationship.</quote>
<quote>"I thus see the more independent Polytechnic having an improved relationship with its local authority&#x2014;and with other neighbouring local authorities, as we are regional, not local, institutions.</quote>
<quote>"I personally undertake to ensure that Newcastle Polytechnic develops even closer links with [the] &#x2026; Local Authority".</quote>
I hope other directors will take the same view.<lb/>
Finally, as one who was present and assisted at their birth&#x2014;I designated most of the present polytechnics &#x2014;I wish them success in their new independent status. I know they will make an increasingly valuable contribution to the well-being of our country in the years ahead.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01013"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was technically outside the Chamber when the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, made her maiden speech, but I heard it well and clear because I was standing behind the Woolsack. I should like to endorse what both my noble colleagues said before me that she performed in a most impressive manner, managing not merely to be non-controversial but to utter one or two sentiments which were quite welcome on this side of the House as well. I hope that we hear from her often, though I do not suppose that she will be as uncontroversial in the weeks to come.<lb/>
The debate is about a crucial aspect of education. I am sure your Lordships are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for directing your Lordships' attention to it. I hope that the Secretary of State for Education, advised by my noble friend, will himself take note of its content. The advantage of a timed debate is that it means one has to cut out the trimmings and get straight to the facts. That makes the task of looking at the debate easier.<lb/>
The fact which I find most immediately interesting is that the debate is concerned with the superstructure of the ship for which the Secretary of State is responsible and not for its hull. Even if the design, maintenance, crewing and general arrangements of the superstructure are perfect, if the hull is rotten the ship will sink. The hull is the school education system, since all but a handful of both staff and students in it come from the primary and secondary schools. There can therefore be no doubt that the quality and product of our post-school system depend upon the quality and product of our school system. That makes one part of our post-school system of paramount importance: it is the part that trains our teachers.<lb/>
The Government have taken recent and welcome steps to ensure that this sector accepts only applicants with the right qualifications and, I emphasise, the right characteristics for the job. They have also established minimum criteria for the content of the courses that these students will follow and have established the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education to apply them. The CATE will be joined in the fullness of time by the PCFC announced by the White Paper. I hope that neither body will overlook the need for practical as well as academic training in these courses. I raise this simply because I know that at least one course of admirable intellectual content some years ago entirely neglected to provide a single session upon how to mark the register or how to keep order in the classroom. You cannot capture the imagination of a child if you cannot first capture his attention. It seems to me that in this debate we should remember the practicalities of the training of teachers and the situation into which they find themselves catapulted as soon as they qualify, and should teach them how to deal with those matters as well as with the intellectual management of the material they have to transmit to their students.<lb/>
On the subject of the White Paper, incidentally, it would not be out of place to mention how very different this document looks from the White Papers we have been accustomed to see in the past. I think for a Secretary of State for Education to produce a White Paper that is readable and challenging deserves a good
<col>164</col>
mark for achievement and, noble Lords opposite should accept, for effort at least.<lb/>
Another new and welcome departure by my right honourable friend has been to recognise the urgent need to recruit more teachers to shortage subjects: those subjects from whose short supply industry and commerce are already suffering, as the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, reminded your Lordships a moment ago. This year, in spite of the well advertised discontent of existing teachers with their present pay and condition arrangements, I was delighted to see that applications to all initial teacher training courses are up by 14 per cent. and applications for courses covered by the bursary scheme have risen still more sharply: for maths postgraduate certificate courses by 44 per cent.; for physics postgraduate courses by 82 per cent; and for craft, design and trade courses by 88 per cent. That seems to be an early answer to the prayer which the noble Lord quoted a moment ago.<lb/>
It is all of 15 years since I taught in a college of education and a great deal has changed since then, but I believe the priorities remain the same. Of these, the first must be the overriding duty of all concerned in teacher training to serve the interests of the pupils whom the students will teach. Neither the interests of the lecturing staff, the aspirations of the students, the reputation of their institute or department nor the intentions of government should override the primacy of the welfare of the children who are to be taught and who will make up the education system, indeed the government, in years to come. That therefore means that the graduates the system produces must be both profesionally and morally competent to have the care of the children and to lead them to and equip them for their adult lives. That in turn means that it is of great importance to staff departments and institutes of education with men and women of ability and experience.<lb/>
Coming down again to practicalities, the first thing I ask the Secretary of State to do in a practical sense is to consider the relationship between the salaries of senior teachers&#x2014;teachers with authority as well as experience&#x2014;and the salaries which they may receive if they join the staff of teacher training colleges. A few such people are invaluable in every college, not only because what they say carries great weight with the students but also because it carries great weight with the staffs of the schools in which those students will have their teaching practice.<lb/>
If one had to single out a sole aspect of teacher training, one would select classroom practice before qualification as being that part of the students' education which gave most value for the time it took: in fact I believe it is indispensable. We must therefore do what we can to make it as effective as possible. I think this process carries on after qualification in the probationary year&#x2014;I believe it is now called the introductory year.<lb/>
Secondly I ask the Secretary of State to consider the difference in the arrangements made&#x2014;in the allocation of time and resources given by different local education authorities to this process in their schools. Presumably the local education authorities will still be involved after the changes foreshadowed in the White Paper. I accept that it is expensive because what is needed is not merely to take the newly
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0091"/>
<col>165</col>
qualified probationary teacher out of the classroom but also to take a senior teacher from somewhere to give the benefit of his advice and counsel.<lb/>
Teaching is a profession where you have to live with your mistakes as long as you are in the institution in which you first committed them. How often we have seen very able people commit disasters in the first week of their first term and have to wait for the witnesses of those disasters to grow right through the school, take their final exams and leave, and then for the rumours and tradition left behind to evaporate as well before the difficulty is overcome.<lb/>
The first weeks in a teaching career are of crucial importance beyond that of almost any other. I think that the Secretary of State should concentrate on that. Indeed, there would be something to be said for establishing and monitoring net minimal criteria for it.<lb/>
I shall take only a moment longer. On the matter of in-service teaching, I notice that the Secretary of State is proposing&#x2014;and I for one welcome it&#x2014;to give greater autonomy to the heads of individual schools. In preparation for this he will no doubt be considering giving suitable training to the head teachers, and perhaps the deputy head teachers, of these schools. I have a moment of anxiety about this. It has always seemed to me one of the central anomalies of our educational system that people are promoted for teaching well, and the further they get promoted the less often they teach. When a headmaster or headmistress is responsible for an autonomous school it would be a great pity if important resources were devoted finally to extinguishing his or her teaching load. Adding extra expenditure to make sure that they carried out new duties for their abilities for which they had not been promoted and about which nobody necessarily knew anything until they were promoted&#x2014;then it may not have been a pleasant surprise&#x2014;would be a pity too.<lb/>
I hope that my right honourable friend will think a little about the Bursars who still persist in the private sector or, if that is not a popular model, some other way in which the purely administrative and managerial functions of a headmaster, where they do not affect his pastoral functions, could be devolved to some other stream within the profession which might well take into it those unfortunates who come into the profession longing to teach and find that they do not have the greatest gift for it but who are very good at organising timetables and doing other things without which a school cannot function.<lb/>
In conclusion, I repeat that I believe that the salvation of this country rests in the hands of the teachers of the future and that they will succeed if teaching is a profession and a vocation rather than a trade. I believe that the great majority are such people. I have great confidence in them&#x2014;more confidence, may I say, than I have in their leadership. I believe that they will come through their present difficulties and I hope that they will do so swiftly and that the Secretary of State's Green Paper will allow them to do so.<lb/>
The children who are now 12 to 15 and deciding what a teacher is are looking at the teachers of today. The teachers of today are therefore determining to some extent who will be the teachers of tomorrow. That is why it is important to get out of our present
<col>166</col>
difficulties quickly. I believe that teachers of the next generation deserve the confidence of this country provided they see that the trust which they have is for the generation beyond theirs; our grandchildren.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01015"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my first concern in this debate is not only to add my warm congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, on a memorable maiden speech but to support her argument that the part-time facilities offered at Birkbeck College to women as well as to men are a most important encouragement to obtaining qualifications which would otherwise remain out of reach. "Flexi-time" is vital to many women whose careers have been interrupted by domestic responsibilities, particularly a career in science or technology which almost inevitably will require updating or extra qualifications appropriate to a more senior position. So to withhold grants or to reduce facilities, as has been proposed at Birkbeck, is surely counterproductive, wasteful and to be deplored.<lb/>
Meanwhile a record of women returners who are qualified and who wish to take up scientific research, either academic or in industry, is now being compiled by Professor Daphne Jackson at the University of Surrey, that place to which vice-chancellors go, or not, as the case may be, to be trained in business management, where special courses are arranged for them. Towards this task Professor Jackson has received the rather less than munificent sum of &#x00A3;2, 000 from the Department of Trade and Industry. But she has collected many thousands of pounds from non-governmental sources in order to provide updating fellowships for women who are concerned with a career in science or technology. Twenty such women have already been supported. There is a waiting list of 90, so I am reliably informed. I am sure that someone from the serried ranks of British industry who are listening so attentively to this debate on education will be able to provide some of the resources that are required for this admirable enterprise&#x0021;<lb/>
Even more flexibly perhaps the Open University has been meeting the needs of women students and has proved its worth despite having been under a cloud of official disapprobation only a few years ago. A number of noble Lords have no doubt received a short video presentation recently produced by the Open University and circulated, I understand, to Members of both Houses of Parliament who are likely to be interested. The most telling moments in this presentation are surely the juxtaposition of two graphs, one showing the apparent increase in Government support for the Open University over the past few years, and the next one showing the persistent decline in those resources if calculated in real terms.<lb/>
Right at the end of the second of the Open University graphs there is a tiny upturn, in real terms, due to the official mind having at last grasped the fact that the Open University provides a most helpful way to combat the very dangerous decline in maths and physics teachers, for which extra funds have now been made available to it. This is to be greatly welcomed, as at a different level is the work of the Open College; but the facilities in both these organisations depend for full
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0092"/>
<col>167</col>
use on the student having at least the necessary basic scholastic attainment. Not everyone has this.<lb/>
Anyone familiar with adult education, as opposed to continuing education in the more professional sense, knows that some otherwise intelligent adults in their last years at school simply drop out, mentally if not physically. Often this is due to psychological problems&#x2014;the break-up of a family, the loss of a parent or sibling and so on. It is for such people in particular that the very few residential adult education colleges which we possess can be so very important.<lb/>
We have one in Wales at Coleg Harlech, funded directly by the Welsh Office, called familiarly "the College of the Second Chance". It is well known to the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, and to other noble Lords with Welsh connections. About 90 per cent. of its students go on to university or polytechnic degree courses which they could not possibly have achieved without the intensive preparation which such a residential college provides. Like village schools, such colleges have their special significance; but like so much else in our post-school system these colleges are finding their funding, again in real terms, diminishing at quite an alarming rate. The discrepancy between the academically-related inflation index&#x2014;the so-called Tress-Brown index&#x2014;used by the CVCP and the deflator and forward assumptions still in use at the DES makes a significant difference.<lb/>
In referring to Harlech, perhaps I may say in parenthesis that this is the only reference I propose to make today to post-school education in Wales despite the very obscure references to the Principality on page 36 of the White Paper. High level discussions are in progress which preclude current comment. At the University of Wales the Institute of Science and Technology with which I am myself connected is competently managed. We had adopted the acceptable parts of Jarratt long before that report appeared.<lb/>
All Welsh colleges are in serious difficulties. One major difficulty is that the majority at least have no substantial industrial hinterland on which they can depend for support either in cash or in kind. So far we feel that the University Grants Committee has not adequately appreciated this difficulty in the Principality. These institutions, like the others that I have mentioned and other universities in England and Scotland, are also aware of the discrepancy between academic spending and the spending in domestic life&#x2014;the retail price index and so on&#x2014;which seems still to be used by Her Majesty's Government even in situations that are not appropriate to it. The relationship between supposition and reality is crucially important in the area which causes perhaps the greatest concern of all, the funding of university science and technology and the science base, on which so much of our future depends.<lb/>
I am not a scientist, but I can turn to those who speak with authority in this field. Last week I received a letter from a correspondent. I am not at liberty to name him because I have not asked his consent. Suffice it to say that he is a Fellow of the Royal Society and professor of inorganic chemistry at a large provincial university. He wrote to me as follows:
<col>168</col>
<quote>"I can presume to speak only for chemistry. But here the problem"&#x2014;</quote>
that is to say, of the funding of scientific work&#x2014;
<quote>"can be stated quite simply. Our community has responded enthusiastically to the challenges of new and more multi-disciplinary research initiatives but once we actually try to start a new direction we find there is too little money available. It is the classic underfunding of research. To remain internationally competitive today is quite an expensive business. In January 1986 the SERC Science Board (on behalf of chemistry, biology, mathematics and low cost physics, that is to say, excluding nuclear physics and astronomy) put forward a request for some &#x00A3;100 million over five years to build up our major instrumentation in these areas to a respectable international level. No money has been made available for this.</quote>
<quote>One of our new initiatives is Molecular Recognition".</quote>
He goes on to explain in lay terms what that means and continues:
<quote>"This initiative was designed to compete with similar projects in the United States. A reasonable effort could be achieved for a total cost of some &#x00A3;18 million over a five-year period. We have been given &#x00A3;4.7 million and only for three years. Three-quarters of the problem will therefore remain untouched. Further, although the Research Councils were recently given money to compensate for the new salary awards to university staffs, this is guaranteed for one year only. The consequence is that we again have diminished resources for the future and we cannot offer sufficient moneys to our other initiatives, for example, the very important and timely "synthesis of 21st century materials", to say nothing of our real blue skies research, which most people would argue is our prime role to support.</quote>
<quote>To be of real use to industry academic science research is a longterm effort and must therefore have long-term funding. Instead funding is becoming capricious. We are trying to get started the few "new blood" people we have in the system. Within a cash limits situation, if we fund the young we will not be able to fund older, established groups. Almost the worst aspect of the present mess in which university science finds itself is that now that the "new blood" scheme is finished there is no real way forward to recruit young people with new entrepreneurial ideas into our now seriously ageing profession. Please let me know if there are any points I can clarify further".</quote>
That is a very serious letter from a highly experienced academic. It is against this depressing background that the universities have to seek industrial support in areas where it is appropriate or to struggle on where it is not. Some noble Lords may be going on tonight to the Royal Society to discuss these problems yet again.<lb/>
In many areas there are of course very encouraging success stories, but it is hard to persuade industrialists that unless their munificence fully covers overheads the relevant departments may turn to using other departmental funds which should be used to teach and train the next generation rather than to solve the immediate problems of industry. There is all too little in the White Paper to sustain the hopes of those who realise that ends without means are an illusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01016">5.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01017"><member>Lord Annan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can think of few whose appearance in your Lordships' House has been more eagerly awaited than that of the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and after her maiden speech it is quite clear why. I congratulate her warmly on it. I agree wholeheartedly with her that continuing education is not only a wonderful therapy for a lady of 96 but also a matter of retraining people in their thirties and forties.<lb/>
Everyone knows that the last six years have been grim years for those in higher education, and morale is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0093"/>
<col>169</col>
very low. The dons feel that they are in the dog-house. Their pay has been reduced in real terms, many have been forced to retire and many others prefer to emigrate to America; they are doing so in quite large numbers. They feel despised by government.<lb/>
But these grim years have been made much worse because the Government have failed to tell the institutions of higher education what their policy is. Can the Government not take a leaf out of Field Marshall Montgomery's book? You cannot get people to change their ways and do disagreeable things unless you explain to them why it is necessary and how it is to be done. The equivalent for a don of landing on the beaches in Normandy is to be told that he must move his department to another university, and has got to be convinced that it will be the death of his subject and of university education as a whole, unless savings in costs can be made.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, may well say to me, "Have you not read our White Paper?". The noble Baroness will remember that I said some rather disobliging things about the civil servants who drafted the Green Paper. I want to congratulate her and them on the White Paper, which is in a totally different class. It is full of good sense. However, if I may say so, it is a document more for vice-chancellors, principals and directors to read than for those who teach and research in higher education. It is all about productivity, planning, access and efficiency. Those in higher education want something more which, I suspect, it is impossible to give them until after the general election. They want to be told what is going to happen to their individual institution and to their own department.<lb/>
The White Paper is full of information about polytechnics, but is much less full of information about universities. One cannot tell people in universities that unless one has answered a question which I hear the Secretary of State shortly after appointment put to the University Grants Committee. He asked:
<quote>"Where should universities be in 10 years' time?"</quote>
I do not quite know whether he received an answer, but should it not perhaps have run something like this? Quite recently the UCG set up a peer review of the work in each university. Every department was subjected to a review of professors in that field. Of course when the results came out there were loud gnashings of teeth. My information is, though few dons say so in public, that there is general agreement among academics that the review got it right.<lb/>
What did the review show? It showed that seven to eight multi-faculty institutions are in a class by themselves in research. It showed also that about 10 institutions are below average, and some really very poor. Most of these are small campuses of 3, 000 students or fewer, often in Scotland or Wales. If we are to save the reputation for research in those top seven universities, if they are going to keep the reputation of our country in the world as great institutions of teaching and research, with all that that implies for industry and business, there will have to be fewer resources for the bottom ten.<lb/>
The bottom ten will have to change their character. Some places will no longer be able to do science. They will have no graduate students, just like many
<col>170</col>
first-class colleges in America such as Swarthmore. Others will have to obtain their research money mainly from business and industry, like Salford. Science will have to become concentrated in fewer institutions&#x2014;that is expensive fundamental science&#x2014;just as engineering and medicine are concentrated at present.<lb/>
It does not mean that those institutions, which are not great research places, gaining large sums of money from the UGC or the research councils, will not be able to do research. But they will have to get it funded from another source, and that will direct them, as in Salford, to get their research money from, and to direct their research towards, industry.<lb/>
The first thing that the Government should explain is that they are trying to do what Lord Robbins advocated for years. They are trying to arrange for more students to be taught by fewer staff. That is why there have been the so-called cuts. This is not unreasonable. Even now, after the economies of the last few years, the staff student overall ratio is something like one to 11 or one to 12. That is far more favourable than in any other country. Of course this ratio enables British institutions of higher education to have a low drop-out rate. Those who are admitted get their degrees. But I think the ratio could lengthen gradually without ruin. Ask the greatest of the American universities how they do it. It is of course done by a different system of teaching.<lb/>
The second thing that the Government should explain is that they are trying to rationalise resources. Should not this go a good deal further than it has at present? The University Grants Committee has the remedy in its own hands. It has a formula for financing. Why not apply it with financial sanctions and say, "No university will get a grant for any major subject in a department with fewer than 16 staff and 250 students"? Small subjects would then be concentrated in a few universities. There really is not much future for scientific departments, or even departments such as economics, much smaller than this.<lb/>
The alternative of course is for the University Grants Committee itself to arrange shotgun marriages. I am afraid that it will be shotgun because persuasion does not work. The rationalisation of small subjects, like Russian, has been fought with terrible intensity. For example, in London the merger of colleges is still largely a paper exercise. There will never be major savings until sites are vacated and small campuses closed.<lb/>
Why on earth, you may ask, is this necessary? My Lords, we set up 25 years ago a system of higher education which no country&#x2014;not even America&#x2014;could afford. We doubled the number of university institutions. We funded them all on the same scale. In America staff at Oxford, Mississippi, are not paid the same as staff at Cambridge, Massachusetts. But let me not be thought to apply that comparison to such named institutions in this country.<lb/>
We next founded 32 polytechnics. They were given parity of esteem (and indeed almost parity of salaries) with the universities. They were to teach three-year degree courses. We upgraded further education colleges. We founded business schools, the Open
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0094"/>
<col>171</col>
University, two new research councils, four new medical schools. We created student services for health, sport, careers, and lavished funds on the student unions, and all students of course got grants. That is why the White Paper demands the better use of resources. I think the White Paper spells out admirably, and in far greater detail, the Government's plans for the public sector of higher education. The polytechnic and college funding council will be set up and will make contracts with each polytechnic.<lb/>
There is one vital set of institutions which will fall under it, and that is the colleges which provide teacher training. I hope that the Secretary of State will at once detail part of the inspectorate to monitor the work in those places where teachers are trained, because many of us think that some of the worst instances of bad teaching in the schools spring from the wrong kind of training in these colleges. The low expectation of achievement in some of our schools is due to inadequate instruction as to how to teach a given subject, and this monitoring exercise need not wait upon government legislation.<lb/>
It is a matter for regret, I think, that the White Paper admits that it will be several years before these new arrangements can come into being. It may well be that no executive decisions can be taken in regard to the polytechnics as a whole, but surely discussion between the new PCFC and individual institutions could begin at an early date so as to give those in each polytechnic a clear idea of what the Government require of them so that they can begin discussing how to achieve that end.<lb/>
I do not want to labour the point that I have made in the past that the universities and polytechnics have in part brought their troubles upon themselves by alienating Westminster and Whitehall in refusing to vary the model that was set up in the 1960s. From Mrs. Shirley Williams's 13 points, government initiatives to reduce expenditure were so often rejected. Then in 1981 push came to shove, but the Government respected the autonomy of the universities and did not dictate how they were to meet the cuts which were imposed upon them.<lb/>
I shall say no more about how they responded to meet them except to say that they allowed so many of their best staff to go, and made no attempt really to get rid of the dead wood among staff recruited during the crash programme of the 1960s which is causing the log-jam in promotion.<lb/>
I think that the Government need to build a new structure, but they cannot do so without the help of the dons, and they will not get that help from academic staff unless they tell them what they want and where they hope to see each institution go. I should like to lay symbolically at the door of the Department of Education and Science a carrot. That is why we need to set up the new universities funding council and the polytechnic and college funding council as quickly as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01019"><member>Lord Stewart of Fulham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord McIntosh may well feel gratified at having set on foot this most interesting and, if I may say so, widely
<col>172</col>
informed debate, and a debate that has been greatly embellished by the fine maiden speech contributed by my noble friend Lady Blackstone. I trust that we shall hear her on many future occasions.<lb/>
I want to devote my ration of time to a field of post-school education which for those of us who sit in Westminster is under our noses. I refer to the network of classes and courses of instruction that are provided partly directly by ILEA through its evening institutes, partly by co-operation between ILEA and the Workers' Educational Association and partly by co-operation between the Workers' Educational Association and the University of London.<lb/>
If we look at these all together we find that they provide for the needs of all ages, from those who have just left school to grandparents and they provide every kind of course, from those regarded as the most strictly utilitarian that will help you to put up the wallpaper in your house, to those which some people will regard as a sheer waste of the ratepayers' money like trying to help people to understand great pictures or great writing.<lb/>
This is not new, but I believe that it is of special importance now because London has become a city which for the first time has begun to suffer seriously from unemployment. The great depressions of the past never struck London as hard as it is being struck now. Also London has become, as never before, a multi-lingual and multi-cultural city. The problems of getting people of different races and languages to live together are of exceptional importance.<lb/>
This kind of structure of adult education is not peculiar to London. Other great cities have something similar but none has developed it to anything like the same extent. That is partly due to the sheer size of inner London. If one wants to set up a wide range of courses within reach of the people who want to attend them, one must have a large population living fairly close together. The proportion of the population who will want to learn Russian is rather limited at any time. It will not be possible to provide adequate facilities unless there is a fairly large population in a fairly small area. That is one of the justifications for the continued existence of the Inner London Education Authority.<lb/>
It was rather disquieting that in the discussions we had on the government of London so many noble Lords spoke of ILEA as though it did not have that kind of educational provision and as though the schools were the sum total of ILEA's work. I should like to look at the relationship of those courses of instruction to the problem of unemployment. One of the reasons for unemployment, though only one, is that in some cases jobs are waiting to be done but there are insufficient people with the necessary skills to do them. The vocational courses provided at many evening institutes are one remedy. I believe that a considerable proportion of those who pursue the professions of accountancy and banking began to equip themselves for them in an ILEA evening institute. There are many other examples of useful vocational education, the value of which nobody disputes.<lb/>
There are also classes in the teaching of the English language. Many of those who came here from other countries to make their homes found that the evening
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0095"/>
<col>173</col>
institute was not only a place to learn the English language but a place where they could make friends and begin to belong to the community. It is rather remarkable that at the time when it became apparent that we would have a considerable immigrant population there was not much of a concerted national effort to help integrate those people into the society in which they were to live. In its modest way the ILEA education service was achieving that through its language classes and through the social activities that grow up round an evening institute.<lb/>
There were also classes dealing with sociological and, if one dare use the word, political matters. One could pursue a course of study on how local government was supposed to work. I do not know whether it is still true, but in the past many people became London borough councillors partly as a result of the courses of study they pursued either at evening institutes or through the workers' educational associations. It is true that they did not follow the tenets of the party opposite to the extent that that party would have liked, but they made good borough councillors nonetheless.<lb/>
Some courses of instruction have been of a purely vocational character, but I think none the worse for that. If one is suffering from unemployment it is useful to be competent about the house; to be able in your enforced leisure to do things in the house which you had not previously been able to do and which you might not originally have had the skill to do. When one visits an evening institute and finds people learning how to put up wallpaper, one realises that this is at all times a useful thing to learn. It may be particularly useful for a man who is unemployed to acquire a skill of that kind.<lb/>
As I suggested, there will be courses of a purely cultural character. In this connection one sees letters in the local paper asking why the ratepayers should pay for someone who wishes to study Greek drama and why he cannot pay for it from his own pocket.<lb/>
One rather solemn reflection occurs to me. If we study the statistics of crime it is painfully apparent that we now live in a more violent and, I am afraid, less civilised community than that in which we lived 10 or 15 years ago. I believe that we are living in a more greedy and acquisitive society. Therefore it is important that there should be some element in the state which helps to promote the nobler aspects of human nature. If anyone has the idea that ratepayers are being reduced to poverty and that businessmen are being driven into neighbouring boroughs because of excessive expenditure on cultural classes at evening institutes, he has not studied his figures correctly.<lb/>
What ought governments to do about this problem? First, they should refrain from penny-pinching. When governments have been short of money it has always been a temptation to push up the fees charged to students at evening classes. We might remember that most of those who attend classes do not have a great deal of money in the first place; and they are people who know the value of money, spend it carefully and do not waste it. I hope that in future governments will try to avoid pushing up the cost to the individual of the evening institute and workers' educational association study.
<col>174</col>
The second point as regards London is that government must leave alone the Inner London Education Authority. It is its existence that makes the important contribution to adult education possible. If the area covered by the Inner London Education Authority was divided up into the dozen different constituent boroughs and each borough was told to run its own education, they would not find it too easy to achieve that as regards schools and they would find it absolutely impossible to provide adult education facilities on this scale. We may be told that they could group together and form a joint committee to achieve it; that is to say, the excuse for cutting the thing to pieces is that one can, with trouble and care, sew it together again.<lb/>
I stress that point because it seems to me that at the moment we have the misfortune to have a Secretary of State who dislikes teachers and dislikes London. At the present time those are particularly unfortunate characteristics for a Secretary of State to possess. I hope that he will reconsider matters and possibly entertain the idea that some of the difficulties he has may be partly due to an excessive hastiness in his approach to the matter.<lb/>
The network of adult education which I have described is paid for by the joint contributions of the individuals who benefit from it and from public funds. In effect, it is a civic achievement. It is something of which any great city or local authority may be proud. I trust that London will always continue to be proud of this extremely valuable, if modest, and straightforward contribution to civilisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01020">6.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01021"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in his introduction to this debate, for which we are very grateful, invited us to speak on our own sectors of interest. I shall seek to speak today on the training and education of social workers.<lb/>
When I enrolled at Birmingham University to train as a social worker, I was somewhat taken aback when at the first lecture we were told that throughout our social work career we should learn to work for our own extinction. Our role, we were told, should be to work alongside the vulnerable in society in such a way that ultimately, wherever possible and practicable, the vulnerable should be enabled to grow towards a belief in themselves, to acquire skills and to be independent so as to lead their own lives in their own families and in their communities. To this end, we were told during our training to show sensitivity to the needs&#x2014;physical, emotional and material&#x2014;of each individual with whom we worked alongside, to learn to make a commitment to their needs and to acquire a knowledge of the tools by which we could help.<lb/>
The fields of social workers are wide: mental health, law, public health and the social structure of our society. While good work is being done, often unsung and unrecognised, by many social workers, nevertheless their reputation has received some hard knocks of late. This morning we read in our papers of the dreadful death of a child. We read in the Clough Report of the plight of old people in homes in Camden.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0096"/>
<col>175</col>
I contend that all political parties must be responsible for these very sad occurrences. The training of social workers has been inadequate, and I pay tribute here to Her Majesty's Government who are now seeking to review the situation. The Council for Training and Education of Social Work was set up 15 years ago. The council was given an impossible task. Prior to 1970 there were two councils. One carried out training for work with the elderly, the disabled, the mentally-handicapped and the mentally ill; and the second council carried out training in childcare and in working with families.<lb/>
Each council provided a two-year course, followed up by refresher courses and post-qualifying courses. For instance, my authority allowed three members of staff each year to go to the Tavistock Clinic twice a week. In 1970, with the setting up of the social service departments, the Council for Training and Education of Social Work was started. However, the two councils were merged and there was then one course only for the two sets of social workers from both councils. The course was telescoped from two separate two-year courses into one two-year course. Furthermore, courses mushroomed throughout the country to meet the needs, often with tutors who were inexperienced in the subjects they had to teach.<lb/>
Again, since 1970 there have been changes in legislation, changes in social needs and changes in responsibilities and in the expectations of society. I would refer particularly at this moment to the change from institutional to community care. I have to tell your Lordships that for community care to be carried out sensitively, adequately and well takes training, experience and money.<lb/>
I would make three pleas to Her Majesty's Government. The first is that social work training should be extended to three years. To train for two years only means that we do not train the social workers adequately, and we do not give them the tools to do their work. In fact it is not cost-effective because if they do not learn properly how to do their job we have wasted that period of two years' training.<lb/>
Secondly, I would ask that we take on mature students for training in social work. Here I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, for her splendid speech; and I should like to support her in respect of the training of mature students as well as students from the ethnic groups.<lb/>
I believe various speakers have already mentioned mature students, and I would include not only women but men. In my own area we started a course at the Oxford Polytechnic for mature students, and we took on a number of men between 45 and 50 who in fact had been in the services and had retired at that age. The mature men and women were absolutely invaluable in the field of social work. However, I also have to say that serious consideration must be given to mandatory grants. I recall that the first amendment I ever won in your Lordships' House was one that concerned mandatory grants. I won that amendment with a considerable majority but, alas, it fell in the other place<lb/>
Thirdly, I suggest that local authorities must pay heed to the provision of good and well-supervised
<col>176</col>
practical work. Without the combination of practical training in the field with academic training in the polytechnic, the college of further education or the university, you do not get a balanced qualification.<lb/>
I should also like to say that I think post-graduate courses should be included in the training of social workers: there should also be refresher courses. I believe that social work should be acknowledged and should live up to the reputation of being a profession. Sadly, in our profession of social work and&#x2014;dare I say it in your Lordships' House?&#x2014;in education, party politics so often overlay the performance of professional skills. To use the vulnerable for party political motives instead of providing professional service is to diminish those who so badly need help. It is humiliating to use them in this way.<lb/>
I pay tribute to the newly constituted Council for Training and Education in Social Work and to Professor Saul, the vice-chancellor of York University, who is the president of that council. I should also like to pay tribute to the new director, Mr. Tony Hall.<lb/>
I make this plea to Her Majesty's Government to support the extra year's training for social workers; and to the social work profession and those who train social workers to provide a professional social work service to the country, whereby knowledge and skills are translated into accountable professional practice.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01023"><member>Baroness Lockwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise to the House, and in particular to my noble friend Lord McIntosh, for not being in my place at the opening of the debate. I was fulfilling a long-standing educational engagement downstairs, which had a threefold purpose. The first was to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, for her 15 years' service as president of Hillcroft College. The second purpose was to celebrate the diamond jubilee of that college and the third purpose was to launch an appeal for funds. I think those are all very relevant to the debate today; so I hope I may be forgiven.<lb/>
Hillcroft College is the only adult residential college catering solely for women. For 60 years it has been offering "second chance" education to women who, for a variety of reasons, stalled at the barriers to higher education in their youth. It is now adapting to the changing circumstances of the times. As well as offering full-time residential education, it is also offering part-time access education. But, like the majority of educational institutions, no matter how relevant they are to the country's needs&#x2014;and I think the education of women is very relevant to the country's needs&#x2014;it is suffering from a lack of finance; hence today's appeal.<lb/>
I want to concentrate the remainder of my remarks this evening on some of the barriers in higher education, and to draw on experience from three of the universities with which I am associated.<lb/>
The White Paper <i>Higher Education: Meeting the Challenge</i> is based on the need to widen access for both young people and mature students. Paragraph 2.15 of the White Paper states:
<quote>"Not only will entry requirements and procedures have to be changed; institutions of higher education will have to adapt their teaching methods and the design of their courses to accommodate new types of student".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0097"/>
<col>177</col>
That is absolutely true. We are not just talking about numbers; we are talking about a new approach to higher education of which the universities, perhaps with the exception of Birkbeck College, have so far had little experience. How, then, will they adapt and respond to the new approach outlined in the White Paper? We might also ask what incentives there will be for them to modify their present procedures and courses.<lb/>
About a year ago most of the universities in the country were discussing their response to the Jarratt Report, which among other things was concerned with efficiency and performance indicators. The two premier indicators revered by universities in the past, not only because of their intrinsic merits but also because of the financial advantage placed on them by the UGC, have been A-level scores and research grants. In the 1981 cuts a number of universities, among which was Bradford, suffered on the grounds of A-level scores, and in the recent changes which the UGC has introduced on selective funding for research Leeds University has not come out very well on that score.<lb/>
I have to say that unless there are other criteria&#x2014;I am not knocking A-levels and research grants, but I am saying that unless there are other additional criteria&#x2014;which are given equal weight in the future, paragraph 2.15 will remain merely a paragraph in a White Paper. Bradford University is planning to take its first clutch of TVEI students in the next academic year. Those students will not necessarily possess the same A-level qualifications as would normally be expected from 18 year olds, but they will have performed well on their TVEI options, and the university feels that the TVEI courses will have given them a wider experience than that of the average youngster.<lb/>
Bradford University has some experience of what adaptations will be necessary based on its experience with B. Tech. students and it is now hoping there will be a 20 per cent. intake of those on some of its degree courses. Experience has indicated that adjustments to presentation and pace have to be made. In some cases special teaching has to be provided, and more counselling is required. But once the hurdle of the first year has been passed students have performed extremely well. They possess a maturity which other students tend to lack and which benefits all on the course. You might say that that is very commendable and a valuable input into the university, but it brings no bonus points to the university because, unlike A-level scores, the UGC attaches no financial implications to it.<lb/>
Leeds University is very closely associated with industry, which is one of the areas on which the White Paper has placed some emphasis, but the university feels that its close contact with industry for research purposes brings it no increased ratings from the UGC. Indeed, it feels that it suffers financially as a consequence. In a letter which I have had from the Vice-Chancellor of Leeds University he indicates that while the reearch might be important to the national economy of the country it has disadvantages to the university for two reasons. Incidentally, in 1986 Leeds University was rated by the ABRC as coming third
<col>178</col>
only after Oxford and Cambridge for its industrial research contracts.<lb/>
The vice-chancellor says:
<quote>"First, for Research Council Contracts the UGC provides full compensating 'overheads' as an additional grant to the universities gaining them. For Industrial Contracts it does not, and overheads that we obtained from industry may be either inadequate or restrictive.</quote>
<quote>"Second, and more important, this industrial research may be quite unknown to the UGC or those who advise on selectivity of UGC funding. The value judgements made in selective funding will thus reinforce universities whose main source of research income is the Research Council and deprive those whose main source of research income is industry".</quote>
So there is not much incentive there for the university.<lb/>
My third area concerns part-time education, which has already been mentioned by my noble friend Lady White, and which was mentioned by my noble friend Lady Blackstone, whose speech I was lucky enough to hear from behind the Bar. I look forward to working with her not only in the House in the future but also when she takes up her appointment as Master of Birkbeck.<lb/>
Your Lordships have concerned yourselves with the problems of Birkbeck College on a number of occasions in recent months. You are familiar with the fact that undergraduates are solely part time in Birkbeck College and that the new UGC funding formula has worked against the financial interests of Birkbeck. A number of factors in relation to Birkbeck must be taken into account. One of them was mentioned by my noble friend. The cost of a degree from Birkbeck is much lower than that of a degree from any other university. Secondly, the cost to individuals is quite considerable. Part-time students do not qualify for a mandatory grant. Therefore the majority of Birkbeck students have to pay their own fees out of already taxed income. Thirdly, because students are mainly self-financing, student fees are cut to the very minimum by the college. In that way the college is squeezed at both ends.<lb/>
It may be felt that Birkbeck students fit exactly into the criteria of the White Paper&#x2014;namely, access, maturity, updating and continuing education, as well as encouraging self-help&#x2014;yet the college is penalised and is now facing a very real financial crisis. With the help of your Lordships, among others, the crisis was stayed during the current year but the college is now advised that the special factor assistance that was given to it during the current year will not be available in the coming year. That is despite the fact that the college has again sought to help itself, and there has been a review of the college carried out under the chairmanship of Sir Barney Hayhoe.<lb/>
Recommendations have been made for restructuring and rationalisation with a view to economies. There have also been recommendations for a link with the ILEA in order to widen access even further, particularly among women and ethnic groups. Again, one should have thought that such an example of self-help would be rewarded by at least a continuation of the special factor funding, but that was not so.<lb/>
Therefore we must ask: what are these institutions to do when they find that far from their being rewarded for their efforts, the system penalises them? I suggest that in the case of Birkbeck there are two essential steps for the Government to take. One is to extend the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0098"/>
<col>179</col>
mandatory grants to equivalent part-time students. That would immediately relieve the position of many students and at the same time enable the college to be more realistic in setting the level of fees. The other measure for the Government to take is for them to do with part-time students what has been done with continuing education through the pick-up scheme; namely, to provide an earmarked sum for the UGC to use both for the introduction, of adult and part-time education and for the continuation of activities such as those in which Birkbeck is involved.<lb/>
The whole thrust of my remarks has been toward illustrating that however welcome in emphasis the White Paper may be, there will be no real changes unless both the Government and the UGC are prepared to put funding behind the principles.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01025"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not previously ventured to take part in a debate on education and I rise with considerable diffidence to make a modest contribution as an amateur among so many professionals. The terms of the Motion have permitted an important and very wide-ranging debate to take place and we are fortunate to have had it illuminated by such a distinguished maiden speech. For my part I propose to speak only about universities.<lb/>
I cannot help being concerned when the president of my Cambridge college, the college of Erasmus, tells me that we must look for damaging changes that are likely to affect adversely the future life of the college and when the university itself&#x2014;if my noble friend Lord Adrian will forgive me for saying so&#x2014;seems to have lost some of its former glory. However, on the wider issues I want to make only one point, to underline a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Blake, earlier in the debate.<lb/>
I find it disappointing that in paragraph 4.42 the White Paper rejects a key recommendation in the Croham Report, following a similar recommendation in the Jarratt Report, for a longer funding horizon for universities and prefers instead that there should be a rolling programme and that the Universities Funding Council should give universities planning parameters for the medium and long term. Leaving aside the fact that it is deplorable that the word "parameters" should be so utterly misused in a document purporting to deal with higher education, I find it rather sad that, while telling everyone else what changes to make, the Government themselves refuse to act on a matter within their competence to which successive independent reviews have drawn attention.<lb/>
For the rest, I shall limit myself to the experience of one of the constituent colleges of London University simply as a practical illustration of how present policies impinge on one of the perhaps less glamorous university institutions. The college of which I am speaking is Royal Holloway and Bedford New College.<lb/>
A few years ago I joined the councils of Royal Holloway College and Bedford College which were then separate institutions. The university already had well advanced plans for concentrating and reducing the number of science sites in the university and for
<col>180</col>
cutting down on the total of multifaculty schools by a process of merger. One of the mergers then in prospect was that of the two colleges that I had joined.<lb/>
A declaration of intention to merge was made in July 1982 and it is a quite remarkable achievement that the new college was able to come into existence on 1st August 1985. By that date an Act of Parliament had been passed and millions of pounds had been committed to new buildings. Bedford College had given up its site in Regent's Park and moved out to what the Post Office, with its somewhat uncertain geographic touch, regards as Egham but which is actually Englefield Green, where just a century earlier the astonished inhabitants had seen the Chateau de Chambord rise up in the green fields of their village. I expect that a number of noble Lords have gazed at the building with some fascination as they have driven past it on the A.30. It is now accompanied by many others and on that perfectly splendid site there exists a well equipped college for nearly 3, 000 students. What is more, there has been a proved saving of some &#x00A3;1 million a year compared with the annual costs of the two separate colleges.<lb/>
I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Annan is not in his place because I can assure him that that did not seem like a paper exercise. However, a price had to be paid for achieving the merger in such a short time, and I do not mean simply that for some months everyone had to walk around the site in a sea of mud. Student examination results did not suffer but research undoubtedly did. For example, low temperature physics experienced a complete hiatus between the closing down of the old laboratories and the coming into being of the new. So when the UGC formula for grant allocation was applied, with the weight given in it to research, the new college did not fare all that well.<lb/>
By the end of the first year, the council of the new college was faced with the fact that the savings that had been achieved, along with such special help as had been received for the merger, had been swallowed up by the continuous real reduction in grant, and despite all the improvements in management which had won a ministerial encomium from the DES, no less, a substantial deficit seemed inevitable for 1986&#x2013;87, with even worse prospects to follow. So we again buckled to and commissioned an efficiency study, with professional help from outside, to examine every activity in the college and assess whether it was essential and, if so, what was the minimum level of staffing required. It does great credit to the staff, academic and non-academic, that they accepted the need for this unpalatable exercise and accepted the conclusions, even though they meant abandoning some activities and reducing the staff bill by some 10 to 12 per cent. over 18 months.<lb/>
Once those reductions had been made the outcome in the council's view would be to leave the college with the minimum of staff and activities needed to ensure that it remained a viable academic body. But now, after all this, we have had an indication of grant levels for the coming two years which paint a financial picture even worse than anything we had ever envisaged. So, far from being able to put all our efforts into attracting more mature students and students from overseas, making sure that all our graduates are numerate, exploiting our location in the Thames
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0099"/>
<col>181</col>
valley to develop still more our links with industry and commerce, and all the rest of our plans, we are instead thrown back on a new round of introspection and self-examination with, at the end, no very obvious way of finding a solution which will not render nugatory all the investment of time and money in creating the new college. We are doing our best to raise funds from sources other than government, but we feel that we are teetering on the very edge of viability.<lb/>
I am not saying all this to make a special plea this evening for more money for the college. I am saying it to illustrate the kind of problems that one college faces, given the present resources allocated to the university system. Nor incidentally am I suggesting that London University should step in and solve our problems, although I must say a rather more generous allocation would certainly be welcome, for we are only too conscious of the fact that the university itself is struggling with inadequate resources to meet its manifold commitments.<lb/>
Against that background, when the college is finding all it has hoped to do put at risk, how can we keep up the feeling of mission and commitment among the staff? How can we plan for our research projects, and attract and retain the necessary high quality people? How can we fully develop the great attractions of our site and make our contribution to carrying out the fine words of the White Paper?<lb/>
Just the other day the Prime Minister was speaking of the booming optimism of industry and the new found pride of the British people in their country. I fear that optimism and pride are in somewhat short supply among the members of the Council of the Royal Holloway and Bedford New College.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01027"><member>Lord Taylor of Blackburn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel privileged to enter this debate this evening. I congratulate my noble friend Lady Blackstone on what we in Lancashire would say was a gradely speech. For the benefit of the noble Lords who do not understand that, it means that the noble Baroness did a very good job indeed and we are very proud of her. Long may she continue to do so in this House.<lb/>
I do not wish to mention my sorrow at the findings at Lancaster and my connections with the university there over the past 23 years. Neither do I wish to dwell on the difficulties that we are facing at the Lancashire polytechnic based in Preston. I wish to go down a different road entirely and recall my experience in education over a number of years.<lb/>
In my early days as a member of the education committee, I remember being privileged to serve as a governor on what was named the People's College. The People's College in Blackburn was a tripartite college with the extra-mural department of Manchester University, the Workers' Educational Association and the local authority joining together. That was a first-class institution where people could go and do all the things that my noble friend Lord Stewart of Fulham mentioned earlier. I acknowledge that we could not do all the things that the ILEA were doing, but nevertheless we had a shot at trying to help people to lead a fuller life. That is what further education is about: to lead a fuller life and to enjoy life to the full.<lb/>
<col>182</col>
We also used to run what we used to call night schools in those days. I am sure that that is just a different way of saying evening classes. We used to encourage people to go to night school to improve their opportunities at work. Many of our boys in Lancashire were able to take their higher national certificates and to benefit a great deal from the work that they did at night school and at technical college.<lb/>
I also remember encouraging a study in politics during my time as a member of the governing body at the People's College. I regretted that a few years afterwards because a number of people who attended that college and took that particular subject started opposing us and they became members of the Liberal Party. After a time I was a little worried as to whether we had done the right thing in starting that course because for many years, until the course started, there had been no Liberals at the college. Their education certainly was expanded and they benefited from that course.<lb/>
We then progressed to another item which gave a great deal of encouragement to people; that was the extension of our schools to make them institutions as well, because we realised that no manufacturer would invest a considerable amount of money in his school and only use that school for 190 to 195 days per year from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. Therefore, we encouraged our schools to become community schools and for the facilities in them to be used for the benefit of the people who lived in those districts. That was a good opportunity again for people to use their leisure. We realised&#x2014;it is certainly coming to pass now&#x2014;that people were starting to receive more leisure time than ever before and they wanted to use it wisely and get the benefit of all the advantages that they could from education. We felt that it was incumbent on the local authority to start courses in those community schools.<lb/>
I have learned a lot during my lifetime in education. It has been a privilege to serve in education. One of the things that I have learned is that one is not always right. When my local authority decided to introduce comprehensive education, it did not rush into it but took a long time over it. We consulted other authorities which had had a lot of experience. We consulted teachers. We consulted universities. We consulted parents. What is more, we worked together with the political parties in our area. Therefore our reorganisation never became a political difficulty. We went step by step together.<lb/>
We decided that every secondary school would go from 11 to 18, because we did not believe that a school would be a good school without its sixth form, or as I prefer to call it a school with a top to it. We thought it right and proper that we should do that. We realised that it would be expensive, because it would be difficult to provide courses for every youngster who wanted to take the 27 options for GCE A-level in this way. Nevertheless, we tried to do it and we introduced all kinds of systems, such as making certain teachers peripatetic where there were small classes, and even in some cases moving students from one school to another for the lesser known subjects. But it worked.<lb/>
Then came the years when the falling roll started. By that time I had left the local authority. The local authority was then reorganised and the new county took over the role of the county borough. What
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0100"/>
<col>183</col>
happened in the county borough was that the new authority decided that there had to be a tertiary college built in, because it fitted in with their plans. I strongly objected to that tertiary college, but I now acknowledge publicly that I made a mistake.<lb/>
The tertiary college became very successful indeed and we are now producing from that college young people who are more articulate and more inquisitive than any generation before them. They are people who do not want to go on to higher education in the form of colleges or universities, but they want to get more out of education. Therefore there are more young people going into technical colleges and into higher education of that type than ever before.<lb/>
That is a remarkable achievement due to the tertiary college, because at 18 they were fed up with the 11 to 18 school. They liked their life in the tertiary college which made education more enjoyable. Therefore I acknowledge that tertiary colleges are a stepping stone to a better and fuller educational life.<lb/>
I want to spend the last two moments at my disposal on the training of teachers, because that is one of the things that I feel has gone wrong during my period in education. Some of the finest teachers that we ever employed in Blackburn were the people who came out of the forces and had had two years' training. Those teachers proved to be excellent and gradually quite a number of them became head teachers. I used to think that those schools were very well-run indeed.<lb/>
There were very few problems from those schools. I think that was because those people had a wider vision of the world and greater experience than some of the teachers that we now find in the schools, though that does not mean to say that all the teachers are of the type that I shall tell your Lordships about. But I find that there are too many teachers who go from school to college, from college to university and then back into teaching, and who know so little about what is going on in the world that after a period of time they start acting like the children whom they are teaching. That presents all kinds of problems and I am sure that we ought to look more closely at this aspect.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will take a leaf out of my book and from time to time admit that they, too, make mistakes. I am glad to see that yesterday the Secretary of State made the U-turn that he did in withdrawing his circular about closing smaller schools. I hope he will do that a little more often and realise when he has made a mistake.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01029"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad to have a chance to speak in this important debate on education. I should like to say something about agricultural education, which is a specialist sector of post-school education. But before I do so I should like to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, on her maiden speech. As someone who made his own maiden speech at 9.15 last evening, I think that I can fairly claim to be the most recent authority on the matter.<lb/>
I should like to congratulate her most sincerely on the lucidity and clarity with which she advanced her arguments and, like all your Lordships, I am looking
<col>184</col>
forward very much indeed to hearing her speak in the future on education and on the other areas of interest which I know she has. The noble Baroness spoke as a provider of further education. I speak as a consumer through agricultural college and the night schools to which my noble friend Lord Taylor referred.<lb/>
Before I turn to agricultural education, I should like to pick up and reinforce a point made by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, at the start of this debate when he referred to education throughout life and to the importance of the mature student. I had the rare experience of going to Oxford at the age of 40&#x2014;a mere stripling compared to the 96 year-old Canadian lady referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone&#x2014;to read for a second degree without having a first degree. This was through a research fellowship that was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture. Sadly, I believe that such fellowships are no longer available.<lb/>
But I have to say that a two-year mid-career sabbatical is of immense value. I would argue that mature students are highly motivated and add considerably to the life of the educational establishments which they attend. The White Paper emphasises the need to increase the access of mature students and we welcome this. I was interested to see a statistic that nearly 40 per cent. of entrants to full-time degree courses without the normal minimum qualifications went on to gain first-class or upper-second degrees.<lb/>
Turning to agricultural education, this is a specialist sector of further education. To use an agricultural analogy, it is almost in a ring fence. There is an excellent relationship between the agricultural education sector and the agricultural industry&#x2014;both the farmers and the ancillary industries. There really is a sense of partnership.<lb/>
I should first like to make the plea that this sense of partnership must not be lost in the reorganisation which is envisaged in the White Paper. There is indeed a need for expansion in agricultural education and for new disciplines in rural land use, in diversification in the countryside and in forestry. There is another and wider role. I repeat a statistic which I gave last evening in the agricultural debate. It has been estimated that world food supplies must eventually be trebled if the world is to be properly fed and there must be expansion in the order of 75 per cent. by the year 2000. In that whole area there is an important role for all our universities and colleges as regards research, development and training.<lb/>
I shall deal first with the university departments of agriculture. I was interested to read figures which were given by the conference of agricultural professors indicating the number of graduates who in 1985 found jobs at the end of their degree courses. The figures showed that 93 per cent. of the graduates in agriculture, 91 per cent. of the graduates in agricultural science, and 97 per cent. of the graduates in agricultural economics found jobs. Despite that considerable success story I must report to your Lordships&#x2014;and I am sure that you know this&#x2014;that morale is very, very low. There is a constant battle for funds. I was told by one professor that he reckoned he spent up to 10 per cent. of his time in the last two years just defending his department. Every year he was asked to give up
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0101"/>
<col>185</col>
subscriptions to learned journals and there was rarely the chance to take on new ones.<lb/>
There are three direct grant colleges in the agricultural sector and there are many county colleges with strong local links. The three direct grant colleges&#x2014;namely, Seale-Hayne, Harper Adams and Shuttleworth&#x2014;are listed in Annex E of the White Paper to be transferred to the new PFC. There is one county college, at Writtle in Essex (and I must declare an interest because it is the college which I attended) which is listed in Annex D as having a choice whether to go to the PCFC or to stay with the local authority. The question that I should like to ask the noble Baroness concerns how the choice is to be implemented. Is it to be a choice for the local authority or for the institution alone? The White Paper does not make clear how that is to be done.<lb/>
Another point which concerns me is that the four colleges will represent a small sector within the PCFC and I fear that there is perhaps a danger of their being swamped. I wonder whether there is a case for an industry sub-committee structure in the PCFC to ensure that the interests of various industries are represented. Obviously agriculture would be a natural candidate for such an arrangement. Direct grant colleges offer some non-advanced level courses, and I should like to know how they will be organised and funded under the new structure.<lb/>
The county colleges, which used to be called farm institutes, are extremely important at county level. Their local links are very strong and they provide a large number of part-time courses and have links with the YTS. I am sure that the noble Baroness knows that eight of those colleges already offer HND courses&#x2014;advanced-level work. How are they to be organised and funded under the new organisation?<lb/>
Turning to more general points, the White Paper refers to the need to attract private funding to support research and development. Again, I am not entirely clear how that is to be done in the agricultural sector. There are not that many farming businesses which are large enough to support the direction of funds. I should be very concerned if the multinationals become very involved in this area because, for example, a chemical and fertiliser company might not exactly encourage work on crops which need less nitrogen.<lb/>
The development of new courses is extremely important. I understand that the NAB has kept a very tight rein on this matter. For example, a county college is to start an HND course in September this year which it applied for in November 1983, which was four years ago. Another example is a county college which devised a new HND course in landscape contract management with widespread support from industry, the local authority, the DES and others but was told that such a course would be incompatible with the number of places approved for the county, which was Surrey. The only way in which the course could be mounted was if there were a college in the county that was prepared to give up some further education places to provide places for the new course. Industry wanted the course and jobs were available at the end of it. What will be the organisation for the development of new courses under the new arrangements?<lb/>
<col>186</col>
As regards the transfer of assets, the White Paper says that there will be no compensation to the LEAs for transfer of physical assets, and I understand the reasons for that. However, the agricultural colleges have substantial assets; namely, farmland, working capital and houses which technically are council houses. I should like to know how they will be transferred.<lb/>
I have raised a number of specific points which I hope will be answered at the end of the debate. I should like to conclude by repeating that the agricultural education sector has a first-class relationship with the agricultural industry in its widest sense and it is vitally important that that relationship is maintained, and indeed improved, in the new arrangements which are now proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01030">7.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01031"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, you will not expect me to follow the interesting account that we have been given about agricultural education. I can only sympathise with my noble friend on the Front Bench at having to get up in an hour's time to deal with yet a new area of expertise. I do not propose to burden her with any questions.<lb/>
I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for introducing such an interesting debate. It has supplemented the discussions that we had on the Croham report and it has taken us to some broader issues such as those illuminated in the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. I reveal to the House in her absence that I gave her some advice about being a maiden speaker. I said that she could not go wrong it she talked about Birkbeck&#x2014;like apple pie and motherhood, everyone would be in favour of it. However, she has done more than that.<lb/>
We are faced with a particularly difficult set of issues which it is tempting to put down either, as many noble Lords have done, to lack of funding&#x2014;for example, if the Government were more generous these problems would be solved&#x2014;or to institutional deficiencies in the ways in which we spend or allocate the money that is available. As the noble Lord, Lord Annan, pointed out&#x2014;not for the first time in your Lordships' House&#x2014;we have, at least in the higher education sector an extremely elaborate and expensive system by comparison with other countries and it is difficult without grave upsets to adapt that to a quite different set of demands. What worries me from time to time is the feeling that one reason why we do not adequately fund higher education and further education&#x2014;or, if one prefers, post-school education in general&#x2014;is that it is an area which at the moment is not as close to the heart of the British people as it was a generation or two ago. I should say that the great drive towards expansion out of a very limited area of higher education&#x2014;three universities for the whole country&#x2014;took place in Victorian times. There are many things that we now look to with admiration: night schools, to which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Blackburn, referred; Birkbeck; the whole apparatus of university extension; and the Workers' Educational Association.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0102"/>
<col>187</col>
All these represented not a government saying, "It would be good for you to have more education. We should defeat our competitors. We should have a more integrated society". They came out of a drive from below. Unless that is rekindled, I do not think that any government, whatever their complexion, are likely to put in the money those of us in this House&#x2014;noble Lords who have given their lives largely to this area&#x2014;would regard as acceptable.<lb/>
It is difficult again because we do not know whether the comparisons that are so frequently made, especially with our European competitors, are valid. They are usually made in terms of the numbers of a particular age group with access to higher or further education. I have not seen them made with regard to the total expenditure per head of population in those countries. I suspect that providing for more people more cheaply may mean that the pressure there, though differently directed, is not all that different from this country.<lb/>
After all, whatever noble Lords may say about maldistribution, it remains a fact that the average income per head in this country, as in all Western industrial countries, has increased substantially over the past few decades. People now have motor cars, television sets and videos&#x2014;all the apparatus of modern life. They are all widely distributed. People may say that they are not yet widely enough distributed, but they are widely distributed, so people are prepared to spend. Are they in fact prepared to spend, either through national taxation, local taxation or direct expenditure, upon the higher or further education of their families? There is something here which needs to be looked at.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01032"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I know that it is not the tradition to interrupt in this House. I was listening to him with some attention. Would he say that the continuing demand for courses at the Open University, for example, which was not only high at the beginning, but has continued throughout its life, would have been anticipated? Would he say that a knowledge of what is available is a significant factor in assessing future demand, and that the expectation that the thrust will always come from the bottom is not always true?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01033"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no, I would not suggest that it is always true. The example of the Open University is a good one. Clearly, until we had it, we could not measure the demand. The noble Lord will be as aware as I am that the demand did not in fact come altogether from the quarters whence it was first thought it would come. It has in fact recruited a student body which is rather different socially from what was envisaged in the literature of the early period.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01035"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord wish to interrupt again?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01036"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. It is true that in terms of the
<col>188</col>
social occupation of the students it is not what was expected. If we look at the social background of the students and the occupations of their parents, the Open University has heavily penetrated those from poorer backgrounds and the more manual occupations as well, of course, as vastly increasing the numbers of women degree students.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01037"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is of course the case. As the noble Lord has raised the question of the Open University, I shall refer to one point that he made in his speech which I think is rather important when we are discussing wider access. I yield to no one in my detestation of the "A" level criterion for university admission. It is not a good predictor. But there is something other than prediction in relation to previous studies at a school or pre-higher education level, and that is the degree to which one has something upon which to build.<lb/>
The noble Lord, who is so interested in the Open University, will remember that originally it was said that it would take people of promise and allow them to read any of the courses on offer. It was discovered&#x2014;I am pretty certain of my memory here, but I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Perry, is not with us today&#x2014;that with mathematics that just was not possible. One could not start a university-designed course in mathematics, not necessarily because one did not have "A" level mathematics but because one had had no preliminary mathematical training. There are problems if we widen access, as I am sure we should.<lb/>
With regard to what so many noble Lords, and most recently the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, have dwelt upon, I can say only say what I said to this House previously&#x2014;and I shall repeat myself&#x2014;that there is no solution to the universities' problem if they are dependent for their primary income upon annual grants from the Exchequer. The only thing which gives them, and can give them, confidence and enable them to plan is to have an endowment. They must have some source of income on which to build which is independent of the fluctuations in government finance.<lb/>
That is, after all, the lesson of the great universities in the United States. It is a lesson which I think has come home to people here in the light of the experiences we have had, because it is not possible to run 45 universities through a central funding system and not to make errors of judgment and even errors of financial management. It is appalling that the University of Hull, which is a good university, should be in the position which has been described to us by the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood. It is appalling that the University College of Cardiff should be what in any other institution we should describe as a state of bankruptcy. That is not a good mark for the system that we have.<lb/>
I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, said in a public speech a little while ago that he thought that the Treasury should buy out Cambridge and should give it the capital equivalent of its annual grant and let it decide how to spend it. Cambridge would be expensive, but there may be universities which would be happy to be the object of such an experiment. There does not seem to me to be any way to solve the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0103"/>
<col>189</col>
problem however we improve the organisation of the UGC, perhaps by putting on it more businessmen and fewer academics. There is something important about institutions being able to look after their own future. It is important from the point of view of morale, and the damage to university morale has been stressed by one speaker after another.<lb/>
I do not want to end on that melancholy, prophetic note. I should like to make one more cheerful point. The <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> published on two successive Sundays two articles by its industrial correspondent about Cambridge, England and Cambridge, Massachusetts&#x2014;the University of Harvard. Cambridge was depicted, as I am afraid the noble Lord, Lord Adrian depicted it today, as sorely tried and with low morale. Harvard was shown as a glowing campus with well-paid academics constantly taking the plane to Washington, where their advice was being taken and heeded&#x2014;perhaps not in respect of Nicaragua altogether, but generally speaking.<lb/>
This set me thinking about Harvard and Cambridge. I cannot speak for their contributions to medicine, engineering or the natural sciences but in the areas about which I know a little professionally I would say that the University of Cambridge has nothing to be ashamed of in its contributions to scholarship compared even with Harvard over the past two decades.<lb/>
The proof of that is that we speak about the brain drain&#x2014;I have referred to this in previous debates&#x2014;and the way in which our scholars are attracted across the Atlantic by higher salaries and greater facilities. What interests me is that, with the whole of the population of the United States to appeal to, universities in the United States still come to the British market to buy these characters. That seems to be a point of optimism.</membercontribution></p>

He taught me one thing&#x2014;at least, he re-taught me social history. I always thought that as far as the WEA was concerned it was Tawney who came to Rochdale rather than Rochdale sending for Tawney. I may be wrong and no doubt the noble Lord can tell me afterwards if I am.<lb/>
My first duty is to congratulate my noble friend Lady Blackstone on her maiden speech, which was fully in accord with the high expectations that we had of it. As I listened to her my mind went back to the fact that when she was in her cradle enjoying her first sips of Lord Woolton's orange juice I became an occasional student at Birkbeck, which was then very near to Fleet Street. I was 32 years of age and I learnt a great deal in the two years I was there. I did not have the stamina of my noble friend Lady Jeger, who took a good degree there while working full time in the Civil Service.<lb/>
My subject today is a little remote from the main theme yet it is appropriate. I am concerned about university libraries in general and the University of London library at Senate House in particular. The university library is one of the important implements
<col>190</col>
of its students and the mature scholars engaged in research. It is cramped by a lack of funds at a time when books grow dearer day by day and students find their grants, and university teachers their salaries, failing to keep pace with the cost of lving.<lb/>
The University Grants Committee got out its pruning knife in the 1950s&#x2014;not without justification. I was taking a holiday from journalism and working for the Nuffield Foundation and I was put in charge of an inquiry&#x2014;a kind of Beeching inquiry&#x2014;on behalf of the UGC into the use of university libraries. Faced with the foundation of a number of new universities the UGC wanted to know whether there was need in the new universities for the pretty lavish provision that had been made for the redbrick universities.<lb/>
At that time the research libraries throughout the world were doubling in extent every 16 years. In most universities a professor could order any book and it was almost impossble for anyone to say no. It was only too easy to add to a library, but was very difficult to subtract from one. It required a whole faculty to consent to the discarding of a book and to its relegation to what was known in the trade as a place of secondary access. In any case, to discatalogue a book cost even more than to catalogue it. My report pointed out that universities in adjacent cities could share their collections for senior members of the universities, though not of course the limited libraries they needed for undergraduates.<lb/>
Those were the innocent days of university libraries. There was not a computer in sight and not even a copying machine. Scientific studies on the use of libraries and library co-operation were in their infancy and largely confined to America. Many librarians regarded their libraries as absolute sovereign territory. But that was long ago and today university libraries recognise that they must co-operate with others in the region and that they must be complementary rather than competitive.<lb/>
As regards London University, from the inquiries I have made it seems to me that it is well down the road of rationalisation. It has reduced its staffing level by 18 per cent. during the past seven years. It has done so in spite of an increasing workload through a greater demand on its services. The recommendations on regular staff appraisal and cost-effectiveness in the Jarratt Report are being carried out. However, how far can universities go? The inflation rate for books and periodicals is well ahead of the general rate of inflation and has been so for many years. Academic libraries feel that they are harder hit than some other departments.<lb/>
The University of London library has a special role. It is a federal university and has an important responsibility to the college libraries which it supports for undergraduate purposes and which it complements for research purposes. The colleges are obliged to reduce their library provision and the student grant gets relatively smaller as textbooks get relatively more expensive. Therefore, the role of the central university library becomes more and more important. It is the only library in the university available to all staff and students and it underpins the unique London external degree scheme. It is used by scholars from all parts of England and, indeed, from all parts of the world.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0104"/>
<col>191</col>
However, the future of this distinguished library is grim. The intention of the UGC is to reduce the grant for what it defines as the central activities. It intends to reduce the grant by 1990 to 50 per cent. of what it has been&#x2014;that is, in three years' time. I believe that that presents a wicked threat. The existence of the University of London library in anything like its present form is threatened. All we can do is pray that the body which replaces the UGC sees the light and that the new government who we expect soon to have will be more sympathetic than the present Government have been to learning, culture and scholarship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01040">7.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01041"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it gives me particular pleasure as the last of the Back-Bench speakers to congratulate my noble friend Lady Blackstone on her excellent maiden speech. She and I were colleagues at the London School of Economics some years ago. We went our separate ways. I went on to found the economics department at Queen Mary College and my noble friend took a more circuitous route, ending up as Master of Birkbeck. Perhaps more significantly, like so many good academics, our paths converge again and we now appear together in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I begin by speaking a little about higher education and particularly about its economic aspects. It seems to me that the White Paper and the Green Paper that preceded it have bought what one might call the standard economics package; that is, that higher education is and can be made productive in the sense of making our economy richer than would otherwise be the case. Indeed, they buy that package in one of its cruder forms; namely, that increasing the science and engineering ratio within that package is even more productive.<lb/>
The Green Paper states:
<quote>"The Government believe it is vital for our higher education to contribute more effectively to the improvement of the economy".</quote>
The White Paper refers to meeting the needs of the economy. It also refers to taking a broad view of the nation's requirements for highly qualified manpower.<lb/>
I am in the higher education business. I am also in the economics business. I therefore do not wish to undervalue that point of view and ruin my own product. However, I hope that the officials advising the Minister have told her that after 25 years of research, no matter how plausible these hypotheses are, we seem to have found it impossible to substantiate them empirically. I should like to believe that the hypotheses are true but I am not sure that one can accept that position with as much confidence as we find in the White Paper.<lb/>
As another of my former colleagues, the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, said, the connection between higher education, economy and society is a rather subtle one. I hope that the Secretary of State can be persuaded not to blunder into this area in the rather crude fashion that he appears to wish to do in the rest of the education system.<lb/>
Let me now turn to the productivity of higher education institutions. I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, that one should view some of
<col>192</col>
the calculations from economists, including myself, with scepticism and suspicion. However, that is the way that productivity is typically measured in the economy. It is the way that the productivity of industry is measured. It is not uninteresting therefore to know that in both the universities and polytechnics, productivity, if measured conventionally, has risen very drastically indeed, despite the criticisms that one might make of such measurement. If one then follows the tenets of classical microeconomics, if a sector is shown to be relatively more productive&#x2014;both through time and in terms of international comparisons&#x2014;then the comparative advantage that is thus demonstrated ought to lead to a far more rapid expansion of that sector compared with the rest of the system.<lb/>
I find it puzzling that on the one hand the White Paper acknowledges the productivity of higher education institutions but it does not follow through the logic of what has been said. I would go further. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry told us that in his view the future of our country lies in the area of the provision of services. If there is one area where we have demonstrated how efficient we are at providing services it is that of higher education. Far from that being in any way held back it ought to be encouraged forward at a much more rapid rate. In higher education we ought to be much freer to earn overseas income than we are at present. Although I appreciate that there may be a notion that we ought to be operating a cartel and therefore cannot be entirely free to set our own fees, on the whole I believe that our educational institutions ought to be free to set their own fees and to take account of marginal rather than average costs.<lb/>
In a system of this kind it also makes good sense not merely to respond to what one might call the more optimistic of the projections in terms of demand for places, but I believe that we ought to go back to the days when we were actively encouraging people to pursue education at all levels and certainly at the higher levels. I note in the White Paper certain cryptic remarks about student grants. I do not believe that the demand for places can be regarded as independent of other assistance to students. I hope that we may have a debate on that subject. As one or two of my noble friends are aware, I regret to say that I have rather idiosyncratic views on student finance, but I shall save those for another occasion.<lb/>
I have one rather acerbic remark to make on universities. Given the advance in productivity in higher education I think that the Jarratt experiment was exactly the wrong way round. What we require is for British manufacturing and other industry to come to higher education to see how well we are doing so that they can learn lessons from us, rather than telling us to learn lessons from industry&#x2014;which on the whole is not that successful in world terms.<lb/>
I turn to the issue of the polytechnics and the proposals there. I agree with what is in the White Paper and what was said again by my noble friend Lord Glenamara. We spend too much of our time denigrating education in this country. It is a great mistake to do so. However, if we have one achievement that stands out it is that of the polytechnics. That was arrived at by the efforts of the local authorities and by the enormous efforts of the CNAA. Perhaps I ought
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0105"/>
<col>193</col>
to record an interest. I was a member of the CNAA and the first chairman of its economics committee. That body did a tremendous job, as did the local education authorities, but, quite rightly, the time has now come for the polytechnics to go their own way. They can now stand on their own feet.<lb/>
The White Paper is a little blurred on this issue. It seems to me that the time has come for most polytechnics to become independent of the CNAA or to move in that direction. The White Paper goes almost as far as the Lindop Committee suggests and then stops. I should like to hear from the Minister whether she believes that no polytechnic is yet ready to stand separate from the CNAA; I certainly believe that they are.<lb/>
I shall not use my remaining few moments to ride the higher education/university hobby-horse or to say how excellent a place Queen Mary College is and how we too need vastly more resources, as we do. I should like to turn to non-advanced further education. The consequence of the LEAs moving out of the polytechnic sphere is to give them much greater significance and a chance to achieve new successes in the non-advanced FE area. My noble friend Lord McIntosh has emphasised the scale of the non-advanced FE field. That is entirely right; it is enormously important. Indeed, in some ways one might regard the emphasis in this debate on higher education as somewhat misplaced compared with the enormous importance of non-advanced further education. I would also emphasise its diversity.<lb/>
If I may refer again to classical microeconomics, if it is diversity and innovation that one wants and responsiveness to consumer demands, then for the most part a decentralised system is the best way to achieve that. That again serves to emphasise why the local education authorities at this time are the relevant bodies to do precisely this kind of work.<lb/>
I hope that as the system advances we do not lose sight of its diversity. I hope that we do not interpret the non-advanced FE system as simply a place where one prepares yet again for A-level and that it will be judged in only one way: by how many of these people are saved for higher education. Sometimes what the system achieves is of a remedial character; sometimes it stimulates an interest in education for the first time. Certainly one hopes that it tempts adults back into education. All those aspects are enormously important. I have to emphasise&#x2014;one may not like it but it is important&#x2014;that courses in non-advanced further education will still provide the students at all levels and ages with some kind of credential. I know that it is horrible to have to say that one must have a piece of paper to show what one has achieved, but that is the kind of world in which we live.<lb/>
In that connection I am having great difficulty keeping up with the many new bodies that are being introduced, but the one that strikes me as being of enormous significance is something called the National Council for Vocational Training, which I hope will have a connection with non-advanced FE. I hope it will have a role in establishing the credentials of people who work in that area.<lb/>
I have one last point on that matter before I come to my final points. Anybody looking at this field, and
<col>194</col>
several noble Lords have mentioned this, cannot but be aware of the enormous anomalies we have right across this area in student support and in fees. I might add to that the way that the social security system works in this area. We ought to be able to clarify this and have some kind of consistent system so that decisions will not be taken to go on a particular course or to stay on at a particular institution on an irrational basis.<lb/>
My last two comments before I sit down are, first, to revert back to the polytechnics. The polytechnics were diverse institutions. They have made great progress. I wish to see them stand on their own feet, but I hope that in doing that they do not follow the worst examples of the universities. I hope they do not give up their non-advanced work and I certainly hope they do not say that the only way they can have a status is to become completely full-time. That would be a terrible mistake.<lb/>
The second remark I should like to make is raised in a very important way in the White Paper. We are seeing in the secondary schools a broadening of the secondary curriculum. It is vital that the universities&#x2014;which have a powerful influence here, although they always say that they are not guilty when it comes to A-levels&#x2014;do not sabotage the broadening and improvement of the curriculum by demanding still very narrow criteria for entry.<lb/>
I am not certain, as I am still a comparatively new boy, whether I may congratulate my noble friend Lady Blackstone twice in the same speech, but one reason I found her speech particularly significant was that it had an uplifting quality about it which derived from the fact that it was actually about education. Ultimately whatever one says about economics, economy and resources the purpose of a debate such as this is to emphasise the value of education overall and to reiterate the belief, which some cynics say does not apply today but which I think does, that education is a very good thing for everyone.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01042">7.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01043"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for introducing this debate, even though we have not all followed the lead that he gave us by changing the title to "post-school". I am afraid that I shall not be as helpful to him as I ought to be. I want briefly to try first to appraise the Government's approach to higher education as outlined in the White Paper and then to touch on some specific concerns.<lb/>
Despite the genuflections in several parts of the paper to the advancement of learning, the Robbins principle and, by implication, to the discovery of truth referred to by my noble friend Lady Seear, it is clear to me that what we are being offered is an exercise in manpower planning on a very ambitious scale. This, dovetailed with the emerging plans for the schools if implemented as proposed, would give us a centralised education system with the overriding object of satisfying the needs of the economy. The accent is therefore very much on manpower planning rather than on higher education, and this is confirmed by paragraphs 2.10 to 2.13 of the White Paper, by the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0106"/>
<col>195</col>
dual system of control which is proposed and to which I shall refer.<lb/>
On the manpower planning side there is a serious question. For a party which does not believe in big government we are looking at a very <i>dirigiste</i> policy. I see from the DES paper on <i>Changes in Structure and National Planning for Polytechnics and Colleges</i>, a subsidiary paper to the White Paper, that it is planned to have 11 industrialists, which is by far the largest single named constituency on the polytechnic boards of 20 to 25 members. That is fine. It enhances the industrial commitment to the institutions but one has to remember that industrialists have not always been notably good at giving clear signals to the education system of what they want out of it. We need to be a little careful there.<lb/>
I turn to some more specific areas of concern. On student numbers there is obviously a sense in which the White Paper represents a considerable advance on the much criticised Green Paper in that it adopts the Projection Q of demand for higher education places, which is much more likely to reflect the real pressure on those places than the Projection P which generally speaking assumes a constant demand from a shrinking number of qualified young people of the relevant age group. Now the Government recognise in paragraph 2.12 that:
<quote>"There is no reason to suppose that employers' requirements for graduates and diplomates will fall in parallel with the one-third fall in the size of the 18&#x2013;19 year old age group by 1996".</quote>
That is a welcome recognition. The noble Lord, Lord Blake, also called it a deathbed repentance. But even so we are looking at a net decrease from 726, 000 in 1990 to 691, 000 by 1996&#x2014;years which were referred to by my noble friend Lady Seear, years which will clearly be crucial years during which the CBI has stated a likely growth of demand from industry at 4 per cent. per annum, which would indicate a figure much nearer 850, 000 by 1995. The Government envisage a heady 20 per cent. of school-leavers with two or more A-levels knocking on the door of higher education and they are flexing themselves to meet that demand by planning for an age participation rate in the region of 18 per cent. rather than the dismal 14 to 15 per cent. planned under Projection P.<lb/>
Our view is that the age participation rate of traditional entry students should be increased to 20 per cent. and that there should be an increase in the total number of students of 30 per cent. by 1995. That is what we should be setting our sights on for, as my noble friend said, the future is for a highly educated country. This means that we have to aim for a quantum leap.<lb/>
On access I should have said a number of things, but time does not permit. The Government recognise the pressing need to widen access from mature nontraditional entrants who had missed out the first time round. This is recognised in paragraph 2.20, and that is welcome too though nothing is said about the financial stimulus to that end. As the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, pointed out, part-time students in higher education will still have to pay their own fees even if they have never had a crack at higher education at an earlier stage in their lives.
<col>196</col>
Here I should like to slip in my congratulations to the noble Baroness. It is in order to congratulate her just once, not twice, on a very impressive maiden speech. The noble Baroness and the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood will both be glad to know of the Alliance commitment that part-time higher education should be free to those undertaking first qualifications. All this funding will come by way of fees to give maximum incentives to institutions to initiate part-time courses. Both noble Baronesses will agree that we are on the side of the angels in that sphere.<lb/>
When I came to continuing education in the White Paper I smiled a wry smile. The White Paper says solemnly at paragraph 2.26:
<quote>"The importance of adult continuing education is now widely&#x2014;albeit belatedly&#x2014;accepted".</quote>
"Belatedly" is the word, but to whom does it apply if not the Government? I can barely remember the date of the Russell Report. It is so far back in the mists of time&#x2014;was it 10 or 15 years ago? The noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, will probably remember. No action followed other than disbandment of that small but useful quango the Advisory Council on Adult and Continuing Education, presumably as a mark of commitment to the whole of that idea. Well, my Lords, better a late conversion than a continuation in error, I suppose, but we are being told very little about the resources.<lb/>
On the question of quality, efficiency and funds, our attention is directed in paragraph 3.3 of the White Paper to a fall in unit costs in the past seven years by 5 per cent. in the universities, 15 per cent. in the polytechnics and local authority colleges and 5 per cent. in the central institutions in Scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred also to the dramatic improvement in productivity in the higher education field. Then we come to the Government's central funding message in paragraph 3.4 in which they say that they are,
<quote>"committed to achieving further gains in value for money that will be needed particularly if access to higher education is to be widened in the future".</quote>
The whole of the expansion, so far as I can see, is posited on further gains in productivity and efficiency.<lb/>
I am all for exercises such as Jarratt and indeed the NAB's management board report, which I hope will not just be put on the shelf because that body is due to go into demise. There is no way according to the principal of the University of London, that the higher projection envisaged in paragraph 2.13 of the White Paper can be delivered without loss of quality on a declining funding basis, but that is what is proposed. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to an increase of perhaps &#x00A3;3 million in the coming year. The university refers to a declining amount of &#x00A3;126 million between 1986&#x2013;87 and 1989&#x2013;1990. I think that probably covers the whole of both the further and higher education fields and that accounts for the discrepancy between the figures of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and mine.<lb/>
However, the fact remains that this is the kind of flat funding or declining funding that is proposed while on the White Paper's own evidence student numbers are expected to grow from 693, 000 in 1985 to 726, 000 in 1990. Can the noble Baroness explain to me how that growth is to be achieved on that declining or flat budget?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0107"/>
<col>197</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Blake, mentioned funding. One of the key recommendations of both the Jarratt and Croham reports was for a stable planning horizon. The Croham proposal was for triennial funding which is to coincide with the period now covered by the annual expenditure White Paper, subject of course to the inflation rate not rising above 5 per cent. But even this modest amount of stability is turned down. The Government say:
<quote>"It will be undesirable to insulate university management from the need to plan for changing circumstances".</quote>
They propose a rolling programme rather than a fixed triennial funding. This seems to me to be a recipe for a further period of uncertainty and short-termism. I wonder whether the Government would like to reconsider that recommendation which came from two distinguished committees.<lb/>
I come now briefly to the mechanisms proposed in the White Paper. These are, for the universities, the Universities Funding Council to replace the UGC, and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council to replace the NAB&#x2014;what I think the noble Lord, Lord Butterworth, called the dual system. Both operate through contracts rather than grants; that is to say, the institutions on both sides of the binary line would be obliged to enter into a contract with their appropriate funding body to provide certain services. It is not quite clear what those services are meant to be.<lb/>
On the university side, this immediately raises important questions. To date, contracting has been largely confined to measurable things such as courses designed for special purposes and research contracts. There has been no general purpose contract, and how on earth do you measure the advancement of learning or the enhancement of civilisation? Do you add 20 per cent. for that, or 50 per cent., or do you add zero if you think such things are unimportant? Can the noble Baroness tell us how the Government see this contract working in the university context? I think the noble Lord, Lord Blake, called this a belated bright idea. Perhaps she can cast further light on it.<lb/>
It also appears from paragraph 4.41 of the White Paper, if I have not misunderstood it, that the UFC will have power to require that funding is or is not spent for a particular purpose. Bearing in mind that the Secretary of State is to have reserve powers to issue directions to the council, how far does that take us down the road of government direction of university disciplines and subjects? I do not mean only the kind of rationalisation which was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Annan, about whether a faculty would be of a viable size. The question has another type of importance because it could have sinister implications for the political control of higher education, a point referred to by my noble friend who I think also used the word "sinister". The Government are anxious to weaken political control in other areas, quite rightly I believe. Are they living up to their own precepts here? I should certainly welcome the noble Baroness's comments on that.<lb/>
The changes proposed for the polytechnics are more far reaching than those for the universities because they are due to move to a new type of corporate status. This is to be welcomed. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, welcomed it. The Committee of Directors of
<col>198</col>
Polytechnics favours direct funding from central government. Although there is an alternative model which might be called the ILEA model I assume that the Government will stick to their version. If they do there are quite serious grounds for alarm over the possible erosion of polytechnic local links&#x2014;and here I declare an interest as a member of the independent committee on this topic under the chairmanship of Sir Alexander Pilkington, a matter which I have already brought to the attention of the noble Baroness. On that occasion she was good enough to assure me that our report would be studied&#x2014;and I hope responded to&#x2014;when it comes out.<lb/>
I have a specific point which I told the noble Baroness I would raise with her. It concerns Goldsmiths' College. I declare an interest here too as a member of the delegacy of that college. I see from Annex E that Goldsmiths' is listed under other grant-aided colleges as due to come within the ambit of the PCFC, but there is an asterisked footnote with the words:
<quote>"unless London University accepts Goldsmiths' as a school of the university".</quote>
I hope the noble Baroness will be able to tell me that nothing will be done to inhibit and everything possible will be done to encourage the current negotiations between the college and the university, which if successful would give the university a valuable extension south of the river.<lb/>
In conclusion, there is no doubt in my mind that the Government's proposals bring us much nearer to a national, centrally directed, higher education service aimed at strategic manpower planning under central control which will be supported at the lower level by a more centrally directed school system. Some people may argue that this is the only way to confront the modern world, but it carries considerable dangers in that it opens the system to central control by Whitehall and it could become a potent instrument in the hands of an extremist government of whatever complexion. There is also the concern that it is not easy to get manpower planning objectives right in a fast moving world even if you believe that that is the be all and end all of higher education, which we do not.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Adrian, said&#x2014;and I noted his words&#x2014;that universities will cease to be universities if they simply do what the Government tell them, and independent and creative minds will go elsewhere. Those are wise words to which we need to pay attention. If the Government are by any chance reelected and a Bill is introduced along these lines it will be the duty of this House&#x2014;and we shall certainly participate&#x2014;to give it prolonged and searching scrutiny.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0487P0I0108"/>
<col>199</col>
During the 1983 general election a leading political figure in this country said of the universities:
<quote>"The period of contraction is now nearing the end. The universities can look forward to a thoroughly healthy future".</quote>
For those who may not recall that speech, let me tell noble Lords that that was the parliamentary candidate for Finchley speaking on 9th June 1983. I think that all Members of the House will accept that she was a person better placed than any other to guarantee the promises that she was making at that time. What followed was a nightmare for many people in universities. The two years up to 1983 paled into insignificance against the harsh attack that followed the election of Mrs. Thatcher's second government.<lb/>
Expenditure today is 11 per cent. less than it was in 1979. Student numbers have fallen from 250, 000 to 241, 000. Cuts have fallen unevenly and unfairly on the technological universities. Salford was cut by as much as 28 per cent., Bradford by 19 per cent. and Aston by 18 per cent. Academic posts have fallen by 4, 500 and non-academic posts by nearly 3, 000.<lb/>
The Comptroller and Auditor General has condemned the government policy for
<quote>"the damage, disorder and diseconomy inflicted on the universities".</quote>
The 12, 000 to 15, 000 young people who qualified to enter our universities have been unable to do so. A much smaller proportion of the relevant age group has qualifications at first degree level than in the United States, where it is 22 per cent., and Japan where it is 24 per cent. The number of science, technology and engineering graduates has been falling since 1983. Polytechnics too have been cut. The expenditure on polytechnics and colleges has been reduced by one-fifth in the years since 1981. Annual investment on each student in the polytechnics has been reduced by 15 per cent.<lb/>
Happily, the Government have been forced to rethink their attitude to higher education, as we have seen in the White Paper, but their response is still far from adequate. Despite the impression that Mr. Baker gives that he is fighting for excellence and chastising the less good, few realise that every university has lost money in recent years as part of government policy.<lb/>
The proposal in the White Paper to increase student numbers is not to be accompanied by extra funding for those places. Instead they are to be funded out of greater productivity. In this context <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 12th April said that these are:
<quote>"weasel-words that mean lower standards and serious diseconomy as well as genuine productivity gains".</quote>
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals has given expression to major reservations to the White Paper. It shares the view of the Council for Industry and Higher Education that
<quote>"raising the proportion of 18 year olds entering higher education from the present 14.2 per cent. to 18.5 per cent. is too unambitious".</quote>
Information from employers suggests that there will be a demand for between 2 per cent. and 5 per cent. more graduates each year. The government plan will
<col>200</col>
produce about 8 per cent. overall by the end of the century. The highest of four recent Government statistical projections now suggest that the student population at the end of the century could be little more than 4 per cent. higher than it is today. In the event that industry should grow at no more than 2 per cent. per annum&#x2014;we want it to grow much faster than that&#x2014;the student population would have to grow eight times faster than its present supply of qualified manpower.<lb/>
It is not only the universities and the polytechnics that have been disabled. The Social and Economic Research Council recently reported that 59 per cent. of its highest rated projects which had been funded five years ago are not being funded today. They will be squeezed even more because the Government have so far failed to provide extra cash to maintain the level of projects now that increases for all academics have been agreed. Report after report of the Advisory Body for Research Councils says that in some universities the well-founded laboratory no longer exists.<lb/>
Labour agrees with the Council for Industry and Higher Education&#x2014;and I congratulate the group of industrialists on an excellent report, with which we agree&#x2014;which said
<quote>"the United Kingdom prosperity, vitality and international standing depend on its becoming a more highly educated nation which recognises skilled brain power and applied ingenuity as its distinctive assets &#x2026; The officially projected 4 per cent. increase in student numbers by the year 2000 is at odds with the United Kingdom's ambitions for a new growth".</quote>
Labour will set up not two councils but one higher education council to focus on higher education as a whole and provide similar funding for similar work. It will also establish a Ministry of Science and Technology to oversee the whole business of research and development.<lb/>
It will provide the security of funding which higher education so badly needs, and extra reserves to widen access and to make it possible to admit a greater proportion of 18 year-olds to enter into higher education, at least a 20 per cent. participation by 1995 and a 25 per cent. participation by the end of the century.<lb/>
It will allow for more second chance opportunities and a wider range of qualifications&#x2014;a question raised by a number of Members. It will increase continued education and provide money for research. It will extend the opportunities for older students by designating courses for award purposes; for example, national diplomas and certificates, professional courses and access courses for those preparing for entry to higher education.<lb/>
If we are to survive as an advanced nation, we have to move towards providing all our citizens with opportunities for education and training throughout their lives. Access to education at 18 has been confined to a small minority, but it does not make economic or social sense to confine resources in this way. As has been said all adults can and should benefit by education throughout their lives.<lb/>
In America and Germany more than eight out of 10 young people aged 16 to 18 are still being educated or trained, yet in Britain industrial apprenticeships have gone down by two-thirds since 1979. Sixteen out of the 28 industrial training boards have been abolished. It
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0109"/>
<col>201</col>
may cost a lot of money to invest seriously in education, but the price of not doing so will be ruinous to our standing as an industrial nation.<lb/>
The partnership in education has been broken. Labour rejects Tory centralism because it is less accountable and less efficient. In place of this centralism, Labour would propose a new partnership between central and local government to widen educational opportunities, revise educational standards, ensure proper resourcing of education and increase parental involvement.<lb/>
At the heart of the new approach would be a new Education Act which will re-define objectives and functions to meet modern needs and aspirations and, like the 1944 Act, provide a new basis for consensus. As part of its commitment to education and training for all, Labour will establish an adult Skillplan. An incoming government would undertake early discussions with both sides of industry to give statutory backing to paid educational leave, and Labour will seek to develop a new educational entitlement.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Peston made the point that it is important for people to have pieces of paper to collect in some kind of portfolio achievement which they can keep for the rest of their lives.<lb/>
The entitlement would be phased in over a number of years. In the first instance Labour would give priority to the unemployed and to adults in further and higher education. We would establish a foundation programme. In the first two years Labour will establish 75, 000 places on this foundation programme for young people to assess the needs of 16- to 17-year olds. It would also establish an extended training and education programme for 18- to 19-year olds who currently graduate from YTS schemes.<lb/>
It has been said more than once this evening that proper education maintenance allowances will encourage more 16-year olds. Student financial support is the key to progress in all these fields. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, made the point effectively. Education must be seen as an investment. As the National Council for Industry and Higher Education say:
<quote>"an investment on which part of the return is measured in competitiveness, efficiency and confidence in new ideas."</quote>
Within two years of coming into office Labour will aim to achieve the following targets as part of its strategy. It will provide a statutory training framework and have it in place, and all large establishments will have set up joint workplace training teams and prepare their workplace training plans. It will establish a national training fund and this will be fully operational, and training levels in manufacturing industry should by that time have doubled.<lb/>
It would introduce paid educational leave for workers throughout industry. The National Council for Courses and Assessment&#x2014;which will be a new body&#x2014;and the Education and Training Inspectorate and the new Research and Intelligence Institute on Education and Training will also have been established. The 75, 000 16-year olds already mentioned will enter the first year of the foundation programme, and the 75, 000 18- and 19-year olds whom I have also mentioned will enter an extended
<col>202</col>
training scheme of continuing education, training and work experience.<lb/>
Education maintenance allowances will encourage thousands more 16-year olds to remain in full-time study. A further 75, 000 unemployed adults will enter adult traineeship leading to recognised qualifications over a period from six months to three years. A hundred thousand unemployed adults will enter project-based training places linked to agreed training plans. Public service traineeships will be available for the unemployed, offering them both a skill guarantee and priority for public sector jobs.<lb/>
The job-training scheme will be replaced by a scheme providing quality training and a reasonable training allowance. Unemployed people will be given unrestricted access to education and training courses suitable to their needs.<lb/>
When the economic miracle happens in this country, as I believe it will, the thing that will hamper it will be the loss of skills over the past 10 years. We must not allow that to happen.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01047"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, just slightly adapting the opening words of the recent White Paper, <i>Higher Education: Meeting the Challenge</i>, I should like to start by making quite clear the Government's conviction that:
<quote>"education has a crucial role to play in helping the nation meet the economic and social challenges of the final decade of this century and beyond".</quote>
I think it is fair to say that this thought has underpinned all the speeches we have heard in this afternoon's broad-ranging debate which has, if I may say so, maintained the high standards and perception of your Lordships' consideration of education matters. In thanking all noble Lords for their contributions, perhaps I may add my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, to the many which have been so justifiably passed to her.<lb/>
Post-school education provides us with a very broad canvas, as the speeches have proved. In the time available I fear that I shall not be able to do justice to all the varied and interesting points and suggestions that have been made. These are, however, all on the record, which I shall study closely&#x2014;and perhaps in particular the revelations made by the noble Lord, Lord Irving&#x2014;and will be drawn to the attention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.<lb/>
We have been dealing with an almost bewildering range of provision in terms of level of work, length and type of course, and type of institution. At one end of the range are short courses of evening classes in liberal adult education. At the other there is full-time postgraduate study and research at universities and specialist institutions to the highest international level. In between there is provision of many non-vocational and vocational courses at both non-advanced and advanced levels.<lb/>
I emphasise this range deliberately both in response to the point expressly made by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in opening the debate and because it does not seem to me that it was always borne in mind during the debate. Most speakers dwelt upon higher
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0110"/>
<col>203</col>
education and in particular the universities. Far less attention was paid to non-advanced further education, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, remarked, despite the fact that there are now over 1.7 million students on non-advanced courses in England. These students will form a crucial part of the skilled workforce of the future, and the importance of the sector should not be forgotten.<lb/>
All sectors of post-school education are important, and I want to make it quite clear that the Government do not value one element any more highly than another. Nor do they value one element any less. I would endorse the statement of the noble Lord, Lord Stewart, about the value of adult education, which is sometimes seen as something of a Cinderella. What matters generally is that each course is well designed and efficiently provided in order to give proper benefit to those taking it and, through them, to the nation as a whole.<lb/>
In referring to all this as a broad canvas, I must also say that it is a very expensive one. In the current year the expenditure on post-school education throughout the United Kingdom is planned to exceed &#x00A3;5.2 billion, and since the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and indeed others, alleged under-funding I should add that this &#x00A3;5.2 billion is planned to rise in cash terms to more than &#x00A3;5.5 billion by 1989&#x2013;90. In real terms this means that the Government are maintaining their spending on post-school education at about its present level. This is just about the same level in real terms as in 1979, and not in fact less as the noble Lord, Lord Irving, suggested. We believe that these resources are now being used much more efficiently.<lb/>
I am always wary of international comparisons of higher education participation rates, mainly for the reasons given by my noble friend Lord Beloff. But, since the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, raised the subject, I have to say that in terms of proportion of relevant age groups gaining degrees and diplomas, on the best like-for-like comparison available, Britain is on a par with achievements in France and ahead of the rest of the European Community, though a little behind the achievements of Japan and the United States.<lb/>
Time will clearly not permit me to deal with every initiative the Government have taken, but I should like to give your Lordships some illustrative examples, particularly as some of these touch on areas not covered by contributors to the debate. We have, for example, introduced the Certificate of Pre-Vocational Education. This is available both in non-advanced further education and in schools. It filled a longstanding gap for those 16 year-olds&#x2014;especially those with modest qualifications&#x2014;who were not yet set on a career path and who wanted to stay on in full-time education for another year if they could find something worth doing. Introduced in 1985, there are now some 35, 000 students on this scheme.<lb/>
Then there is the Youth Training Scheme. There are now around a third of a million trainees on YTS programmes. Some 65 per cent. of schemes include college-based education and training. A priority for the two-year YTS is that it should provide participants with the opportunity to gain recognised qualifications,
<col>204</col>
or credits towards qualifications. This is a major new area of work for colleges, requiring close co-operation with employers and managing agents so as to provide a positive solution to the twin problems of youth unemployment and an under-skilled workforce.<lb/>
There has also been the introduction of the MSC's work-related non-advanced further education development schemes. The planning that these have brought about is not only a good discipline but also helps to gear local provision more closely to local needs, particularly for trained manpower. I think we can see a highly productive partnership emerging between local education authorities, colleges and the MSC. It is that kind of co-operation which has been called for by many of your Lordships during the course of this debate.<lb/>
Another important initiative is the programme known as PICKUP (Professional, Industrial and Commercial Updating). Further and higher education has an important role to play in keeping industry and commerce competitive by providing training to meet the updating needs of firms. The PICKUP programme is encouraging the growth of such training by colleges and universities and has ensured that the volume of updating training is now growing by more than 10 per cent. per year. In some institutions, growth has been in the region of 30 to 40 per cent. The PICKUP programme aims to achieve a five-fold increase over the coming years and to ensure that PICKUP work becomes one of the mainstream activities for all institutions.<lb/>
Moving with PICKUP into higher education, in spite of some suggestions made this afternoon, opportunities for young people to enter universities, polytechnics and colleges of higher education have never been better. There are more students in higher education now than ever before. Gains in efficiency have secured better value for money and have allowed institutions to provide 160, 000 more places than they provided seven years ago while maintaining the quality and high standards of which the nation is rightly proud.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Elton referred to the action which the Government have taken to improve initial teacher training courses and to relieve teacher shortages in particular subjects&#x2014;with some success on the basis of the latest figures which he quoted. We have also introduced a new specific grants scheme to ensure much better targeted in-service training. I can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend's criteria for initial teacher training emphasises that they should all contain substantial teaching practice and pay due attention to class management and control, and that in no case should qualified teacher status be awarded to a student whose classroom work is unsatisfactory.<lb/>
The Government welcome and have done much to promote the major growth in recent years between universities and industry. Between 1982 and 1985 universities' direct earnings from industry rose from &#x00A3;23 million to &#x00A3;48 million, much of which was in the field of research. Earnings from industry, however, amount to only 2 per cent. of total university income and we would wish to encourage the further development of collaborative links. Not only do these
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0111"/>
<col>205</col>
links bring financial benefits to the universities, they have to do with establishing greater mutual understanding of each other's needs and of the ways in which each operates. That can only be for the good. In this context, I commend to your Lordships the excellent report <i>Towards Partnership</i>, which was published recently by the Council for Industry and Higher Education and to which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, referred.<lb/>
We can be justly proud of the high quality of academic research in our institutions of higher education and of the outstanding record of our scientists. The Government are committed to maintaining and enhancing the strength and quality of the science base. Since 1979, the science budget has been increased by 14 per cent. in real terms. However, because of the increasing costs of undertaking world-class research, there is a greater need for selectivity in the funding of research. We welcome the moves made in this direction by the UGC and the Advisory Board for the Research Councils, and we would wish to see this process taken further. This meets one of the suggestions put forward by my noble friend Lord Blake.<lb/>
I hope that it has been helpful to the House to illustrate what has already been achieved. However, there is always room for improvement. One of these areas in non-advanced further education where we are looking for progress and which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, and others is in rationalising the structure of professional qualifications. The present structure is often described as a jungle. It will never be wholly straightforward because of the need for a range of options. But it does not have to be as confusing as it is now. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications was set up in September 1986 to classify existing vocational qualifications into a progressive series of levels and it will aim to ensure that all such qualifications require a combination of vocational education and relevant training with particular emphasis on the application of skills and knowledge.<lb/>
As far as higher education is concerned, the Government's plans are set out in the White Paper. I am glad to observe that this continues to enjoy a generally warm welcome from your Lordships.<lb/>
The Government's commitment is to the widening of access to higher education and to increasing the efficiency, quality and accountability of universities, polytechnics and colleges. There are three main strands in their proposals. The first concerns student numbers and access to higher education, to which there have been several references during our debate. I stress first that there are more students in higher education than ever before. Overall numbers have increased by 160, 000 in the past seven years; nearly half the increase has been in part-time numbers. There is a higher proportion of women students. Mature student numbers have risen by 25 per cent. The Government's policy is that there should be further increases. As the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, noted, we are working on the basis of projection Q; that means 50, 000 more students by 1990 and one in five of our young people participating by the end of the century compared with one in five now.<lb/>
<col>206</col>
Much emphasis has been put on broadening the base of higher education entry. We want to encourage more students with the non-traditional academic background referred to by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey. The noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, gave an interesting example of what can be achieved. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, I look forward to the day when there is an equal proportion of men and women in the system. However, I must emphasise that already since 1979 we have moved from 40 per cent. to 44 per cent. We want further increases in mature student numbers-and we want to see more part-time students. We welcome the contribution made by many institutions to the needs of these students. My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State's review of student support is looking particularly at the question of support for part-time students of all types.<lb/>
As regards the specific question of Birkbeck College, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, and others noted, has been raised before in your Lordships' House, I hope that the outcome of various current initiatives will enable the relevant authorities&#x2014;the UGC, the University of London and the college itself&#x2014;to reach fair decisions about its long-term organisation, role and funding. In the meantime, I hope that noble Lords are clear that the UGC allocation is to London University as a whole, which has received a proportionately greater share of the increased funds available for 1987&#x2013;88. The university decides on the distribution to its constituent colleges.<lb/>
Finally on this subject, I stress the Government's view that there is no evidence that wider access should be at the expense of quality. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and other noble Lords, that successfully increasing access requires a collective effort on the part of all involved.<lb/>
The second strand to the Government's White Paper proposals is building on the success of the polytechnic and college sector, which has grown enormously in recent years and done excellent work. Legislation will be introduced to reward these mature institutions by a greater degree of independence. Polytechnics and other mainly higher education colleges in England will be removed from local authority control, thereby increasing their entrepreneurial spirit and facilitating greater links with industry and commerce. I believe it was my noble friend Lord Blake who particularly welcomed this recognition of polytechnics as national institutions. Funding will be provided through a new polytechnics and colleges funding council, and also to be brought under these new arrangements will be the valuable provision made by the voluntary and grant-aided colleges for the training of teachers and other degree work.<lb/>
Thirdly, the White Paper accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Croham Report to replace the University Grants Committee with the smaller yet more effective universities funding council. That will include a strong element of people from outside the academic world.<lb/>
My noble friends Lord Blake and Lord Butterworth, together with the noble Lord, Lord Adrian, I believe, referred particularly to paragraph 4.40 of the White
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0112"/>
<col>207</col>
Paper. I believe it was my noble friend Lord Butterworth who noted that it was unexceptionable as it stood. To help allay their fears, let me say that of course there will be provision for the UFC to advise the Government, although the decisions on levels of public funding must be for the Government alone.<lb/>
Perhaps I may also answer the specific points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, concerning Goldsmiths' College by confirming that the proposals in the White Paper create no obstacles to the current discussions about Goldsmiths' College becoming a fully-fledged school of London University. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, Goldsmiths' will be funded via either the new UFC or the PCFC:<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, asked the Government to reconsider their decision on triennial funding. While I accept that there are arguments both ways for the reasons set out in paragraph 4.42 of the White Paper, the balance seems clearly to come down in favour of the rolling triennium that we have adopted.<lb/>
The detail of the proposals of the two new funding councils is further explored in consultative papers to be issued by the Department of Education and Science, in connection with which your Lordships' comments today will be welcomed. One of these consultative papers has already been issued covering the polytechnics and colleges. Two more, on the UFC and on the contracts, are in the pipeline. I believe these papers will help to answer many of the questions raised by your Lordships in the course of this debate.<lb/>
Concerning particularly the nature of contracts, let me say that the Government fully recognise that the sharper planning and accountability requirements that would be set up by the new contract-based arrangements must accommodate and respect the essential nature and purpose of our higher education institutions. The consultative document on the PCFC, which was published at the end of last month, will help to answer the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and I will arrange for a copy to be sent to him. In particular it makes clear that it will be for the maintaining local education authority to decide whether the Writtle Agricultural College shall come under the PCFC arrangements.<lb/>
At the outset the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, argued that we should forge a new structure for the organisation of post-school education. I would argue that there is a general coherence in the Government's policies which overcomes the apparent fragmentation, and it may be that as things develop we shall find further ways of reducing that apparent fragmentation.<lb/>
I have not had time to deal with all the specific points that have been raised. Perhaps I should refer particularly to the points raised by my noble friends Lady Faithfull and Lord Butterworth on social work and training and medical and dental education respectively. Nor indeed have I been able to deal with the points put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Ardwick, on university libraries. I am sure there are other points too, but, as I said at the outset, I shall study the record and follow up as appropriate.<lb/>
In conclusion, I feel that I should end on an optimistic note. Thanks to the hard work and
<col>208</col>
increasing co-operation of all those involved, there is much that is good in our post-school education. We aim to make it even better. The Government are confident that institutions will tackle the challenges they face vigorously and successfully. A wider section of the population can therefore expect to benefit from improved post-school education, to their own and the nation's advantage.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01055">8.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01056"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
I hope to be able to explain that, although this is a short Bill, its brevity belies its real significance, since it aims to put members of the armed forces on a par with their fellow citizens in peacetime by allowing them or their dependants the right in future of access to the courts to sue for legal fault in cases of death, personal injury or illness attributable to their service. It seeks to do this by repealing Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.<lb/>
I believe that the Bill is largely uncontroversial and has received a wide measure of support both in another place and in the country at large. Therefore I am glad to be given the opportunity to introduce it into your Lordships' House, since it seeks to remedy a discrimination which has become more and more evident over the years between member of the armed forces and their fellow citizens in civil life in seeking damages in cases of injury or death arising from the negligence of others. I trust that your Lordships will be able to give a fair wind to what I believe is a very commendable and popular measure and one which deserves our full and early support.<lb/>
Section 10 of the 1947 Crown Proceedings Act was originally enacted because members of the armed forces, by the very nature of their profession, were called upon to perform hazardous tasks which can go beyond anything likely to be encountered in normal civil employment. I quote the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Shawcross, the then Attorney-General, during the Second Reading of the Crown Proceedings Bill in another place in July 1947:
<quote>"it is necessary in the course of service training, in order to secure the efficiency of the Forces, to exercise them in the use of live ammunition, in flying in close formation and, in the Navy, in battle conditions with, perhaps, destroyers dashing about with lights out, and so on. These operations are highly dangerous and. if done by private citizens, would no doubt be extremely blameworthy".</quote>
Parliament then accepted that it would not be right for service personnel, even in peacetime when it is often essential to push training to the limits of realism, and with risks which are similar to those encountered in actual operations, to be able to bring civil actions for negligence against each other. It was considered in the atmosphere of 1947 that to do so would run counter to the fundamental requirement for mutual trust, confidence and loyalty essential for an effective fighting force.<lb/>
Forty years have now passed. The general climate of public opinion in the whole field of civil and human rights has changed considerably since the legislation was enacted. There is less willingness in society to accept that the special circumstances of life in the armed forces justify depriving the servicemen or the servicewomen of the rights and benefits enjoyed by their fellow citizens, particularly in peacetime.<lb/>
I believe that this change of opinion goes in the right direction and that we should heed the message which society is sending us. Section 10 of the 1947 Crown Proceedings Act is now outdated and puts at a disadvantage a section of society in peacetime in a way
<col>210</col>
which does not apply to those of us who do not wear the serviceman's uniform.<lb/>
Section 10 is not a complete ban on legal action by servicemen, but in very broad terms it provides an absolute defence for the Crown, and for other servicemen, against actions alleging negligence brought by servicemen, or their next of kin, who are injured or killed in circumstances attributable to their service. Servicemen are, however, eligible for a no-fault system of payments under which they receive a special gratuity and pension when they leave the service. From the serviceman's point of view this means that at present he loses the prospect of seeking, through litigation, a lump sum award from a court, but instead, if he is entitled to an invalidity pension, he does not have to prove negligence, and the pension is payable irrespective of the presence of negligence, even if the negligence is his own. Furthermore, the pension is tax free; it is adjusted each year for inflation, and can be further increased if there is a deterioration in the serviceman's condition.<lb/>
Let us not forget that Section 10 was enacted four decades ago, and much of what was valid then is not so today. If I may refer once again to the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Shawcross, during the Second Reading in another place of the original Bill in July 1947, he acknowledged that if a soldier who had been injured on duty remained in the service he would receive proper medical treatment and care, and if a soldier was invalided out of the service, or if he died, then he or his dependants would have pension rights. He then went on to say:
<quote>"the capital value of the pension rights, in terms of money is, in general&#x2014;I am not saying it is so in every case, because one cannot be certain in every case what damages will be awarded&#x2014;as valuable as the probable damages which may be recoverable in an action at law if such an action lay".</quote>
That is no longer the case. In recent years the tendency has been for courts to award steadily higher damages, and these have now risen to a level which can be considerably greater than the benefits which members of the armed forces might be eligible to receive. Furthermore, many civilians in similar circumstances can also obtain largely comparable benefits, but those civilians have the added advantage of being able to pursue in court a claim for civil damages against a wrongdoer. This is the anomaly which the Bill seeks to correct.<lb/>
The Bill seeks to repeal, from the date of its enactment, Section.10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, while retaining the power to reactivate the section in the event of actual or impending hostilities or at a time of great national emergency. I believe that there is general agreement that when servicemen are in battle they should not be able to sue one another for negligence; and so this provision to reactivate Section 10 in such circumstances, embodied in Clause 2 of the Bill, is clearly sensible.<lb/>
Clause 1 of the Bill states that the provisions of Section 10 will continue to have effect in relation to those wrongful acts or omissions giving rise to injury which were comitted before the date of enactment. In other words, the repeal of Section 10 will not be retrospective. There are several very good reasons for this. The first and perhaps most obvious one is because of the commonly-held principle that new legislation is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0114"/>
<col>211</col>
for the future and not for the past; it is prospective, not retrospective.<lb/>
Secondly, if repeal were to be made retrospective, then logically the Government would have to consider any claim arising since the enactment of the original legislation in 1947, as there is no logical cut-off point in time since then beyond which claims could not be accepted. Consider the injustices which would result if some cases could be brought to the attention of those responsible and argued coherently because witnesses and papers were still available and memories were still intact but many others could not.<lb/>
Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, it would surely be wrong and unfair to impose retrospective legal liability upon a serviceman for his past actions, even though the individual may not in practice be financially at risk, because it would be the Ministry of Defence that would generally be sued, and in any event the department would stand behind him. Irrespective of whether the Crown as the employer has or accepts liability for the cost of settling claims or damages awarded against a serviceman by a court, and whether or not the individual was sued personally, it would still be necessary to turn back the legal clock because in most cases the liability of the department must depend first upon proof of the fault of the individual serviceman. That may be a point of law, but it is also a very important point of principle which argues strongly against making the repeal of Section 10 retrospective.<lb/>
I am aware that this issue of retrospection has generated much interest both in another place and also outside Parliament. I understand the very deep sincerity felt by those who believe that it is unjust to exclude from the provisions of this new Bill those who have been injured, or who have been tragically killed, as a result of incidents in the past and who will not therefore benefit from the repeal of Section 10. But I find compelling the arguments for not legislating retrospectively. I believe that we must avoid at all costs creating more injustices, more disappointment and more bitterness. As I have already mentioned, there is a system of automatic payments of disability and pension benefits for those who have been injured in the past and for the bereaved dependants of those tragically killed which ensures that they are not left without any form of financial assistance.<lb/>
Turning to the remaining clauses of the Bill, these are largely technical clauses dealing with consequential adaptations of existing enactments, with the financial and public service manpower implications and with interpretation and extent.<lb/>
In conclusion, I suggest that the time has now arrived when we should remove what has become an anomaly from the statute book and provide servicemen and servicewomen with the right of access to the courts in cases of death or personal injury sustained during the course of their employment, which is something that their fellow citizens have long enjoyed. I therefore commend the Bill to the House. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01057">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second&#x2014;(<i>Lord Gisborough</i>.)</p>
<col>212</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01058">9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01059"><member>Lord Meston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we should all like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, for the introduction of this important Bill and his careful explanation of it. Shortly after the Falklands war a friend of mine who served as a doctor in the Army Medical Services described to me the circumstances of three soldiers who were lying in adjacent beds in the hospital in Woolwich. One had been on duty in an open vehicle travelling along a road in Germany. An unlit French tank came in the opposite direction with its barrel pointing to the side into the roadway rather than straight ahead. The barrel caught the British soldier whose neck was broken and who was rendered tetraplegic. That soldier would receive a disability pension and what I think is still called the war pension but would have no lump sum.<lb/>
The second soldier had been seriously wounded in the Falklands. He would receive a lump sum out of the funds subscribed at the time by the very great generosity of the public but he would have no clear idea of how the sum was calculated. The soldier in the third bed had been wounded in Northern Ireland. As I understand it, he would have received payment under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. So, there were three soldiers who all had injuries and impairments that were attributable to military service, each of whom would be receiving different sums on different bases from different funds.<lb/>
It is trite, but I think quite fair, to say that a serviceman has no choice about the precise circumstances in which he is injured. Those disparities unfortunately will not be removed by this Bill. But if there had been a fourth soldier in a fourth bed who had had the wrong leg amputated by the carelessness of my friend&#x2014;who, I hasten to say, is a very careful doctor&#x2014;as the law stands he would have no redress at all. Meanwhile, if next door in a civilian hospital there had been people who had been injured in road or industrial accidents, they would be able to claim a full range of damages for their injuries and their financial losses. Those civilians might be policemen, prison officers or firemen who had been injured in the course of their duties. In short, the case for the repeal of Section 10 is obvious.<lb/>
I should like to congratulate those responsible for its promotion. It is a valuable piece of reform and entitled to all-party support. If one looks back to the debates that took place on the 1947 Act before it became law, as the noble Lord has just done, it was then considered almost unthinkable that servicemen should have a right of action for negligence. It was also argued, as the noble Lord told us, that they would receive compensation <i>ex gratia</i> or pensions roughly equivalent to common law damages. Since then, as he has told us, the measure of damages recoverable at law has become not only more sophisticated but substantially more generous. In itself that must be another good reason for equating the position of the serviceman with his civilian counterpart.<lb/>
We are all aware of the pressure that has been imposed to make this Bill retroactive. The noble Lord has dealt with the arguments. To me there seem to be at least two problems. First, as he told your Lordships, Parliament is naturally reluctant to make legislation retroactive, particularly in this kind of case, if it would
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0115"/>
<col>213</col>
impose a liability for acts and omissions committed up to 40 years ago. Secondly, one suspects that there is a practical problem in that to amend the Bill at this stage in this Parliament would be to lose it altogether.<lb/>
However, the existing victims of negligence and worse have a strong moral claim. In some respects it is even stronger if Section 10 is to go. The honourable Member in another place who promoted this Bill suggested the establishment of a fund to compensate past victims of negligence and worse than negligence. As I say, that should now be seriously considered. Those who are exposed to risk in working for the state have a strong claim to be compensated by the state for injury.<lb/>
Finally, one cannot overlook the fact that, as the Explanatory Memorandum states, there will be financial and public service manpower effects from the Bill. I suspect that it will impose a considerable extra burden on the Treasury Solicitor's department. At this stage it is entirely appropriate to say that all government departments are very well served by the Treasury Solicitor's department. The skilful and careful way in which that department deals with claims is an object lesson to many lawyers in private practice.<lb/>
Unless and until we have in this country a system of no fault liability, as has been said, compensation for personal injuries is and will be a lottery. If it does nothing else, this Bill allows the servicemen and servicewomen of this country an equal place in that lottery.</membercontribution></p>

I had no intention originally of speaking but there is one small point on which I am not entirely clear and perhaps when my noble friend answers at the end of the debate he can clarify it for me.<lb/>
It is absolutely essential that our forces are properly trained. Should there be an accident, are servicemen responsible for training others likely to be personally liable or will the services pay the claims? If they are to be personally liable, they will need to be properly insured and a proper scheme will need to be brought out. If they are going to be personally liable they may be frightened to make the training realistic and we could end up with poorly trained services.</membercontribution></p>

We are very indebted to the Government for their recently announced decision to promote something along the lines of this Bill and to amend Section 10 of the 1947 Act. We are also entitled to place on record our appreciation to the honourable Member for Davyhulme, Mr. Winston Churchill.

I also remind the House that I am no stranger to this issue. In your Lordships' House on Monday, 19th
<col>214</col>
May, I attempted in the Committee stage of the Armed Forces Bill to introduce exactly that matter about which we are talking tonight. I appreciated at the time, on advice from the Table, that perhaps it was not strictly in order to do so, but the generosity of your Lordships' House on that day allowed a debate to take place. It was in that debate that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, said in <i>Hansard</i>, at col. 14 on 19th May, that a review was taking place, the outcome of which we are debating tonight.<lb/>
We are trying to redress grievances. There can he no greater grievance than that of any person who believes that as a class of person he is being treated differently from another class of person. One of the arguments that has been put forward has still not been answered; that is, that there are classes of public servants, such as firemen and policemen, who have the right to sue in court, despite the way in which their terms of pay and conditions allow them to receive compensation. The Bill seeks to make sure that the serviceman who has been injured and the relatives of a serviceman who may have been tragically killed will, if they are 'not satisfied, have recourse to the courts in order to get their grievance put right. That is a proper principle.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, quite properly drew our attention to the words of a former Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Shawcross, who said in 1947:
<quote>"It is necessary in the course of service training, in order to secure the efficiency of the forces, to exercise them in the use of live ammunition.".</quote>
It is a strange coincidence, but on 6th May 1944&#x2014;that is, one month before D-Day&#x2014;I took part in a live ammunition exercise in preparation for D-Day. A terrible accident happened in which two of my colleagues were killed and I finished up on the side of Llanberis at the foot of Snowdon with my guts in my hands. I had been shot through the back with a Bren gun. That was a terrible accident and it certainly took me out of the major action on D-Day. That accident in peacetime would have merited anyone, let alone myself, considering that he had a grievance. Yet, without the amendment to the Bill, that grievance could not be pursued. At least the Bill, as it is at present constituted, will provide a serviceman who, in the light of the need to be adequately trained and properly aware of the dangers of battle has a terrible accident in training, with the right to sue.<lb/>
Of course he will not sue another serviceman. I do not accept that difficulties arise of a serviceman suing another serviceman. He does not sue the Crown. but the Crown pays. One cannot sue the Crown in the court because the courts are the Crown courts. However, as has been said in another place and in your Lordships' House, the Ministry of Defence stands behind any serviceman who may be the person who has to be sued for negligence. When the compensation is allocated, it is not the individual who pays; it is the Crown. That was said in precise terms by my right honourable friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, Mr. Jack Ashley.<lb/>
What I find unacceptable is that the whole <i>raison d'etre</i> of what we are talking about relates not to the future but to the terrible tragedies of the past. The noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, asked: where does one draw the line? It is difficult. The line was drawn
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0116"/>
<col>215</col>
precisely in an amendment moved by my honourable friend Jack Ashley in another place at the date when the 1947 Crown Proceedings Act came into being. I know that there will always be problems about having the right to prove a case, papers not being available, witnesses who cannot be found and people who have died. But if the House is looking for a better solution than starting on 8th December 1986, the solution was provided in that amendment.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Meston, whose speech I appreciated, I do not see any easy outcome. It is not black and white. But I have the memory of what I have just told the House was my own experience, and I certainly think that the Minister and his friends are entitled to reflect very seriously indeed before they say&#x2014;and I hope they do not say it tonight, because we have not yet reached the Committee stage of the Bill&#x2014;that they are not prepared even now to amend the Bill.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, pointed out, things have moved on in the last 40 years. Who would have foreseen the easements in Crown immunity which are coming about? Crown immunity has been removed from hospital kitchens. I see the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, in his place. He had a great deal to say about that. Such matters were more or less unable to be debated and were unheard of. We now have the question of Crown immunity in the case of our prisons. Certainly the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, will be much better equipped by his previous incarnation than any of us to know about the state of the interior of our prisons. So we are now in a good situation where matters are being eased.<lb/>
I may be asked: can you not be satisfied with what has been offered? I can be satisfied, but I should like to get a little more. Having met the Section 10 group, their terrible cases are etched on my mind and I ask the Minister and his advisers to think hard even now. I believe that they will benefit the House and a great many of those outside if they give us some assurance.<lb/>
I do not have a great deal more to say. There is no dispute that many good things are being done. The Bill should receive a speedy passage, but it can be improved. If I am asked about the cost and about retrospection, I would say that this Government do not hesitate to legislate retrospectively on issues from which they believe they will profit. There are Bills of a local government nature going through the House at this moment which take retrospective action. Do not raise the principle of retrospection. It happens very rarely. It does not happen easily or lightly, but it can be done. I believe that it should be done for the tragic individuals and their families who have suffered not by their own negligence but by the oversight of members of the armed forces. I give the Bill a very warm welcome, but I say to the House that the opportunity will be presented to it to make it a better Bill than it is at the moment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01065"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord Glenarthur)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to congratulate my noble friend Lord Gisborough on the very clear way he has introduced this Bill and to thank him
<col>216</col>
for sponsoring in your Lordships' House such a worthy measure which was piloted so ably in another place. Let me confirm immediately that the Government support the Bill wholeheartedly and hope that it might secure a very swift passage into law.<lb/>
The whole question of the way in which Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 has operated broadly to prevent actions alleging negligence being brought by servicemen or their next of kin, who are injured or killed in circumstances attributable to their service, has been the subject of intense interest and debate inside Parliament and outside for a considerable time. The Government are conscious of the strength of feelings expressed&#x2014;and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, has given personal experience to illuminate this&#x2014;by those who have believed that the law should be changed. That is why we set up in October 1983 an inter-departmental working group to review the operation and effects of Section 10. That review was a major task. It was necessary to approach the problem most carefully and objectively so as to ensure a proper examination of the complex legal and administrative issues involved and then analyse the options which were identified.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Trefgarne told your Lordships when we debated the Armed Forces Bill a year ago, the Government were anxious that we should not be rushed into the wrong solutions by calls to speed up this very comprehensive inquiry. That is why it took a little time to arrive at a reasoned and balanced conclusion. That conclusion was announced on 8th December last year by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence. He confirmed the Government's decision to repeal Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. I am glad to say that the general response to that decision has been overwhelmingly favourable.<lb/>
This Bill, which was introduced to give effect to the Government's proposals, has received a wide measure of all-party support in another place. It will also be welcomed, I am quite sure, by those members of our armed forces who will in future benefit from its provisions, because as my noble friend so rightly said, the Bill seeks to provide servicemen and servicewomen with the same right of access to the courts to sue for damages for death or personal injury suffered in the course of their employment in peacetime as their fellow citizens have long enjoyed.<lb/>
Having heard Lord Meston's remarks I think that those of us who have served in the armed forces will be able to produce further examples similar to those which he gave. He suggested that it may be possible to set up a fund. I am not convinced that that would be the right way to proceed. Claims would have to be considered on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, if that course were to be adopted. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence explained in December last year why legislation to repeal Section 10 could not be retrospective, and I shall return to that point later. There would also be serious practical difficulties attached to the introduction of an <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme for past cases. In the circumstances in which Section 10 applies, servicemen have never been able to sue the Crown for personal injury, although before the 1947
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0117"/>
<col>217</col>
Act they could sue each other. There would therefore be no logical cut-off point for considering claims and wherever a line was drawn there would always be some cases which fell on the wrong side. Furthermore, some past cases would be impossible to assess because the necessary documentation, evidence and witnesses would no longer be available.<lb/>
That is why I think that the proper way to proceed is through modification and amendment to the existing system of benefits, and we shall ensure that that is done. As the noble Lord quoted the example of a service doctor perhaps amputating the wrong leg, I can say that where a serviceman believes that he has suffered injury as a result of negligence by another serviceman in the execution of his duties, he is now able to pursue a civil claim for damages. As regards the question of whether a serviceman is able to sue a service doctor for medical negligence, the answer is yes. Moreover, what I have just said in relation to the question of the serviceman now being able to sue senior officers also applies because in most cases the doctor would be the senior officer, so the two are tied together.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Swinfen was concerned that a soldier may be personally liable. Generally speaking, the case would be brought against the Ministry of Defence. A serviceman would not be financially at risk because if he was sued the Ministry of Defence would stand behind him. I think that provides the assurance which my noble friend was seeking.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Gisborough referred in his opening speech to the issue of retrospection of the Bill's provisions, and explained why the repeal of Section 10 cannot be made retrospective. That is the point which of course was taken up in large part by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton. I have little to add to what my noble friend said on this matter as he explained the arguments against retrospection cogently and persuasively.<lb/>
While I have listened, with considerable sympathy, to the noble Lord who has argued that we should legislate somehow to turn back the legal clock, to use my noble friend's words, and extend the provisions of the Bill to those, or their next of kin, who have been sadly injured or disabled, or even tragically killed, as a result of accidents in the past, I have to say that this just is not possible. As my noble friend Lord Gisborough has pointed out, it would be both wrong and unfair to impose the burden of legal liability retrospectively upon the shoulders of a serviceman for acts he may have committed in the past, irrespective of whether the Government as his employer stand behind him and pay the cost of any damages awarded against him. But to make this sort of legislation retrospective would, I suggest, create many new examples of unfairness and injustice, since the Ministry of Defence and ultimately the courts would be unable to assess properly where liability might lie, and the right level of damages to award, in those old cases where the necessary evidence is no longer available, and where peoples' memories of events have faded.<lb/>
But there is already a satisfactory system in being to ensure that those unfortunate ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who have been injured in the past, and
<col>218</col>
the dependants of those killed, are not left without any financial assistance; and my noble friend has mentioned the benefits which are payable on a no-fault basis to those who are eligible. I would suggest that these benefits payable under the armed forces pension scheme, taken in conjunction with the provisions available under the war pensions scheme of the Department of Health and Social Security, are fair and adequate; and this system of benefits will continue, so providing financial assistance where it is needed. That is why, while understanding the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, there are enormous practical difficulties to doing what he suggests.<lb/>
It is perhaps also worthwhile reminding the House that, as my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence confirmed in his announcement on 8th December last year, special arrangements are being made with regard to claims resulting from accidents which occur between the date of the announcement last December and the date of enactment of this new legislation. Assuming they meet the necessary criteria, such claims for compensation, which would be accepted but for the continued operation of Section 10, are now being considered by the Ministry of Defence and dealt with on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, although settlement of claims will be deferred until after enactment of the Bill. I am grateful for the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Meston, who referred to the Treasury Solicitor and to the Ministry of Defence claims department.<lb/>
In conclusion, my Lords, I believe that the change in the law which this Bill seeks to introduce should be welcomed as a remedy to a situation which keeps the members of our armed forces at a disadvantage when compared with their fellow citizens. The review of the operation and effects of Section 10, which I mentioned earlier, pointed out certain anomalies which the Government recognised had to be tackled, and our conclusion is that the repeal of Section 10 is the only really satisfactory way to remove those anomalies. The measures sought by the Bill introduced by my noble friend will be warmly welcomed by the armed forces, and have already won the support of those in another place. I wish the Bill a safe and speedy passage onto the statute book.</membercontribution></p>

He effectively argued against many seductive suggestions for retrospection. I am grateful to the Government for their offer of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments back to December of last year. The Bill has been steered through unamended. I hope that it will be possible for it to be on the statute book in this Parliament.<lb/>

<title>Broadcasting: EC Quota Proposal</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01069">9.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01070"><member>Viscount Torrington</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in accordance with the recommendation of the 4th Report of the European Communities Committee (HL 67) they will oppose the inclusion in the draft EC directive on broadcasting (6739/86 COR 1) of quotas for television broadcasting time to be reserved for EC productions and for independent productions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01071">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I am conscious that the hour is late, and in introducing this short debate I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible. I am encouraged in that endeavour in that I see on the list of speakers a number of fairly senior members of the television industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01072">The Question is of course something of a Trojan horse since it serves to introduce to the House the report of the EC Committee on European broadcasting. Your Lordships may recall that last year the House debated a previous report entitled <i>Television Without Frontiers</i>. The starting point of that report was a Green Paper produced by the EC Commission which set out to examine the entire structure of television broadcasting in Europe and proceeded to arrive, by a process of navel contemplation, at the conclusion that legislative action was needed in five main areas to harmonise national regulations and to allow the free cross-frontier flow of television broadcasting within the member states. The five areas were: common advertising standards, the maximum content of advertising within a programming hour, the subject of copyright, the right of reply and the protection of minors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01073">Your Lordships may recall that the committee came. to the conclusion that Community competence in the broadcasting field, and the need for Community action therein, was far from clearly demonstrated. In fact, the committee stated in paragraph 39 of its earlier report:
<quote>"While there are aspects &#x2026; to which the Treaty provisions clearly apply, there are other areas, for example, the composition of programmes, where the arguments against the application of the Treaty seem to the committee to be much stronger".</quote>
That quotation brings me rather neatly to the essential difference between the recommendations of the Commission's Green Paper and the proposed directive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01074">The quotation to which I have referred could be translated into rather less parliamentary language by saying, "No EC interference in editorial freedom". To be fair to the Commission, the Green Paper contained no real attempt to suggest such interference, but the draft directive cannot escape that charge. To be exact, it introduces a totally new concept; namely, two types of quotas. The first requires broadcasters to use a certain minimum amount of works of Community origin and the second requires them to utilise a minimum quantity of works by independent producers within the Community. I do not for a moment suggest that these concepts are universally unwelcome, but they pose a number of problems and raise some serious points of principle.</p>
<col>222</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01075">The Commission's avowed aim is to remove restrictions which either have hindered or may in the future hinder the cross-frontier flow of television broadcasting; in other words, to take action in the name of liberalisation. It therefore seems somewhat regrettable that what is intended to be a piece of liberalising legislation should contain some fairly restrictive components. The other side of the coin is that a minimum quantity of EC-origin material means a maximum quantity of non-EC material; and a minimum amount of independent material means a maximum amount of non-independent material&#x2014;whatever that may be. It creates a problem in itself because the BBC would probably describe itself as the world's largest independent producer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01076">Of course the <i>dirigistes</i> in Europe will shout, "Great, <i>wunderbar, d'accord;</i> of course we must ration American soap to the masses so that our own industry will not perish under a blanket of transatlantic suds". However, such protectionism is getting perilously close to editorial interference. As the committee's report implies in its conclusions, the aim may be laudable but a rigid framework could well be undesirable. It would apparently apply to all channels, even if under the same management, which in this country would perhaps require a fundamental rethinking of the relative roles of the two independent channels and indeed the two BBC channels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01077">In practice, the BBC uses some 85 per cent. of material defined to be of Community origin in its programming&#x2014;far higher than the proposed quotas. The cynics might suggest that if the BBC did not have a self-imposed quota somebody would impose it on it. But this is all part of the principle of self-regulation and indeed self-discipline.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01078">Where discipline might prove to be more lax is among the new commercial satellite channels aiming for market share by any means possible. It is here that the committee felt that the general provisions of the EC's draft directive might have more relevance than being applied primarily to national broadcasting channels such as the BBC and IBA.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01079">There are several other changes of emphasis between the Green Paper and the draft directive on which the committee has commented in its report. I shall not detain your Lordships by going through the entire catalogue in turn. Those noble Lords who are interested in the subject will have read the report and the Government will no doubt have taken some note of its conclusions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01080">I shall therefore mention only one further aspect. The Commission has widened the scope of the directive to include sound broadcasting, which, except for a little man-made interference in the East, has so far as I know been crossing international frontiers in Europe for something like 80 years without any problems. I submit that no EC directive, or the absence of one, will alter the position very much. Is it therefore worth the legislative time to mess about in that area?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01081">However, the Commission tries to come up with a new definition of broadcasting which tries to cover all
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0120"/>
<col>223</col>
transmissions ultimately intended for public consumption. I have a certain amount of sympathy with this aim, but the proposed definition conflicts with the accepted international telecommunications union definition. Low power satellites, for example, transmit primarily to cable companies. Accordingly what they transmit is at present defined as a telecommunication although what is actually "telecommunicated" is a broadcast by any other name. Clearly this is something of a nonsense and an area which in due course will have to be sorted out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01082">I finally return to the question of quotas. It is clearly desirable that we should have, as we do now in Britain, a strong television broadcasting sector catering to all tastes and shades of opinion and not dependent merely on ratings, which tend to require the lowest common denominator to produce the highest ratings. I recently heard a friend remarking&#x2014;I have not watched this programme&#x2014;that the French serial "Chateauvallon" was, in his words, jolly good in the original French but ludicrous in its dubbed version.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01083">It is Europe's misfortune, at least in the broadcasting arena, that we are blessed with a diversity of languages which makes the mass marketing of audio-visual material more difficult on this continent than on the continent to the west of us. Both the linguistic and cultural diversity will long mean that production costs in relation to market size in Europe will be higher than in the United States, although we in Britain may have a small edge in having a common language with the United States. However, let us resist the urge for protectionism if we can, at least until it is proved that there is a need for it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01084">9.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01085"><member>Lord Buxton of Alsa</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Torrington for introducing this Unstarred Question and giving us the chance to make brief observations on the draft directive. I am happy on this occasion to be able to congratulate the Government. So often one finds that on a subject about which one is deeply concerned one is not supporting the Government of which I am a BackBencher. However, on this occasion they are doing very well in dealing with the problem of the draft directive and the quotas.<lb/>
First, I must declare an interest, as I should when talking about anything connected with television. I am chairman of Anglia Television in the East of England.<lb/>
The Minister, David Mellor, made it clear in a debate in the other place on 20th January that the Government are opposed to quotas being reserved for EC productions and for independent productions. He spoke very strongly, and provided he lives up to his robust professions of intent the Government should certainly be congratulated on the soundness of their arguments and their stance. He rightly talked (at col. 842 of the <i>Official Report)</i> about the dangers of the Commission:
<quote>"bringing to bear on sensitive issues like broadcasting the same skills used in the manufacture of pork sausages".</quote>
<col>224</col>
For the Minister to clarify the issues so lucidly is certainly encouraging in view of the pre-eminence in the world of British television. He also made it clear (at col. 843) that whereas the Community may have competence to deal with:
<quote>"matters that pertain to economic and industrial aspects, [such competence] does not relate to the broader aspects of cultural and other matters in broadcasting".</quote>
So far so good. That is fine and the Government are absolutely right to fight for these principles and to defend British standards. Although I admit the Minister in another place seemed somewhat less than confident of the outcome over the directive, we must applaud his endeavours and the fact that the Government have declared themselves against quotas in principle.<lb/>
That being the case and the principle being vital in the national interest, one must trust that the Government will not weaken their position by continuing to talk and think about quotas for independent productions at home. That would simply pull the rug from under the British negotiating position in Brussels and make any Minister who seeks to oppose quotas there look extremely foolish and even two-faced.<lb/>
In view of the robust position taken on quotas in Europe one must conclude that the Government's stance will be consistent and equally robust at home, otherwise the Minister may have given away the position in Europe almost before he starts. It would be wrong to argue that these two situations are different or that the second&#x2014;that is to say, the quota question at home&#x2014;is not a vital part of this debate. One cannot say that pork sausages are not pork sausages simply because you are standing in a different place.<lb/>
The Minister in the debate on 20th January made the following observations, if I may quote them because they are extremely relevant to the debate that my noble friend has introduced. David Mellor said:
<quote>"There is certainly no case for fixed quotas imposed on everyone from Brussels".</quote>
Secondly;
<quote>"we cannot agree to quotas being established directly by officials, for example, in the Commission who believe that this is just an extension of the regulations on the contents of some agricultural product".</quote>
And finally he said:
<quote>"We are back in the sausage meat regime that I have already regretted".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Commons</i>, 20/1/87; cols. 846&#x2013;848.]</quote>
This sound position, articulated with such clarity, would surely fall apart in Brussels if the Government tried to face in the opposite direction at home. Officials are the same sort of people where programme origination is concerned whether they are in Brussels or in Whitehall. We must assume that the Government will not be two-faced therefore and will not continue to talk about quotas at home in the same breath as opposing them in Europe. If unfortunately they did they would be implying that Ministers and Whitehall officials know better what the audience and the nation want and expect than the BBC, the IBA, the ITV companies or Channel 4.<lb/>
The Government therefore will be in a weak position on quotas when arguing the case in Brussels unless they are consistent and honest with principles. If they lose this vital argument in Brussels it would or
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0121"/>
<col>225</col>
could be through lack of plausibility and credibility. Other countries will not accept that our Ministers believe what they say, especially when at one point the Home Office was pressing for a 25 per cent. quota at home for independents but resisting a 5 per cent. quota in Europe. The situation was grotesque. How can one possibly reconcile these two positions?<lb/>
Of course the Government need not worry about the problem or their position on independent producers. Having swallowed the very successful independents' lobby hook, line and sinker, and having made up their mind on the independents issue before comprehending all the implications&#x2014;in other words, the Home Office at that stage seemed to be asking "how?", long before it ever asked "why?"&#x2014;the broadcasting services do not intend to embarrass the Government and prefer to massage their neck, sticking out though it may be.<lb/>
Provided the freedom of broadcasting and scheduling is maintained in the interests of merit and for the benefit of the national audience, and not for,
<quote>"some daft and rigid quota system".</quote>
as it was described in a debate in another place, the independents will have a reasonable proportion of air time, provided their productions are good enough for the public. Will my noble friend please confirm that the Government are not saying that the public will have a quota of programmes imposed on them whether they like it or not and whatever the merit or quality of the productions? That is the danger of the quota. Will he be clear please on this vital point, because this is hardly the moment to be telling the electorate that Ministers or officials in Whitehall will in future be deciding what people should view and where the programmes should come from?<lb/>
There is often the danger that the long-term implications of direct government interference in something like programme scheduling is not fully comprehended. That was certainly the case, or it seemed to me to be so, when the Home Office was arguing for quotas. In order to appreciate the implications one has only to picture a change of government, with thereafter perhaps an extreme Right-wing or an extreme Left-wing regime, and recognise what could be done by manipulation of the quota system. There would be a straightforward opportunity provided on a plate for every form of political skulduggery in the exposure of material&#x2014;and not only in exposure of material but also in its suppression. There is a clear threat to the traditional independence from political control and I cannot believe that this Government would want to risk that. But that is the real threat in any quota system.<lb/>
The independents can be satisfied, if they have merit, by being afforded across the services a fair proportion of air time. That is the appropriate phrase &#x2014;"a fair proportion". That is surely reasonable and a statesmanlike position by the broadcasting services. Independents have suddenly, post-Peacock, emerged as crusading knights in shining armour, whereas in fact they are perfectly responsible and genuine people. Many independents and many independent companies are simply producers who have not fought for and won a television franchise.<lb/>
Finally, will the Minister please tell us, if he can, what the Government will do if, regrettably, they fail
<col>226</col>
to prevail upon the Commission over this draft directive and, for example, are outvoted on the quota question? Although the debate has been going on for months there has been no indication of what will happen in that unfortunate event.<lb/>
I should like once again to thank my noble friend Lord Torrington and also to congratulate the Government on their strong stance on quotas in Europe. I merely implore them not to make their position more difficult, if not ridiculous, by blatant and unprincipled inconsistency at home.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01087"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your permission and approval, I intend to make the shortest speech of this debate. I begin by declaring an interest of a direct association with the trade union ACTT, which I think the House will appreciate has something valuable to say in a debate of this kind.<lb/>
I do not wish to go down the road of the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, whose position I respect and whose views I listened to with great attention. I believe that he painted a grotesque picture of consequences. The quota&#x2014;the 86 per cent.&#x2014;is the bedrock of the agreement on television with the IBA and the BBC. If what we are to argue about is deregulation or regulation, that would be a sad situation. What we are interested in is surely to assist the Government better to understand that some vital interests are at stake. One can take the view that there are other people &#x2014;those who make money and who have goods to sell&#x2014;whose interests are of prime concern.<lb/>
At the conclusion of this short speech, I come to some of the consequences of the Government taking insufficient care to ensure that our home product is protected. There may be those in the House and outside who say there should be no protection. I remember when we debated the Cable Bill, as some other noble Lords present may remember. I remember when we debated the Films Bill, as some other noble Lords present may remember. The whole House was very concerned on those occasions. There were deep divisions and debate about protecting the quality and standard of what the whole world knows is the product &#x2014;yes, of members of the ACTT, but of many others too, British craftsmen with British skills. It is no exaggeration to say that it is cheaper to import foreign products than to make one's own, not least in this respect.<lb/>
Reference&#x2014;one might say that it was a smear&#x2014;has been made to the fear of being faced with the heavy use of American produce, particularly by satellite. We know the size of the American market. It is not an improper fear for trade union workers to say, "What about us?". They are not wholly protected. They say not that there should be massive quotas but that the Government should take on board that, unless they fight for some protection, there will be a dilemma.<lb/>
The Minister's noble friend argues that the Government should stick to their guns. I understand the reference. This Government&#x2014;and the next government, whether of the Minister's persuasion or of mine&#x2014;will be able fully to protect what is precious, an industry, technicians and craftsmen with skills of which we are all proud. We must have an adequate
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0122"/>
<col>227</col>
regulatory structure and framework with a strong minimum EC quota and content. I am not prepared to leave it to what noble Lords may say is the will or whim of the market place. Let us judge by experience.<lb/>
The Minister and his colleagues are going to another place to argue the case. I hope that they will look after the interests of Britain and of British workmen and the high achievements of the British film-making industry over the years.<lb/>
I remind the House of a Question that I asked last week about the potential sale of the film library of Thorn-EMI, Movietone, involving Cannon. Twelve months ago, when this was a current issue, we advised the Minister to take care what happened to this element of our cultural heritage, the library. The Minister said that all such matters would be taken into account. We find now that an American interest is on the verge of buying, if it has not already bought, the library. How will it be used? How will it be abused? If it is taken away from British control the only considerations will be commerce or money, to the detriment of British interests.<lb/>
I hope that the Minister will not be galvanised into taking the advice from those in the House who say that there is a stark choice between regulation and deregulation. I am prepared to leave the Government the advice that they are given from many sources, that the best interests of the British people, British industry and British craftsmen must be somewhere between the two.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01092"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour I shall not keep your Lordships very long. There are one or two things that must be said about the report of the Select Committee under the chairmanship of the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, a name which rings a chord in my memory and for which I am grateful. I am also grateful for the labours that they undertook, and that the noble Viscount has taken this opportunity this evening to give us a further opportunity to discuss the report.<lb/>
There are a variety of points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, and by the noble Lord,
<col>228</col>
Lord Graham of Edmonton, which will come up in the course of what I have to say. I can only say at this stage that I read the report with great care and interest. I share the general view of the BBC and the IBA, and the evidence they gave under cross-examination, that the proposals by the European Community are, in general, undesirable, and I suspect will prove to be&#x2014;and I shall come to this later&#x2014;ineffective.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, that in particular the introduction of radio in the second of their reports was a somewhat gratuitous intervention, if I may put it in that way. There was no place in the previous paper on broadcasting across frontiers for radio. Radio is a different medium from television. It has a long and splendid history of broadcasting across frontiers. What indeed were the BBC's external services invented for? I may add, where would the world be had it not been for the BBC's external services? That reference seems to me to be a gratuitous and unnecessary irrelevancy in their report.<lb/>
Then there is the matter of quotas, which the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, emphasised&#x2014;and rightly emphasised. In response to the report, the IBA and the BBC sang the same tune in what I think used to be called close harmony. It was a cosy tune. They did not like quotas, although they both operate quotas. The figure in the report is 14 per cent. There is no question that there are quotas; but they are what are called informal quotas. Informal quotas are somehow more ethically respectable than formal quotas. That is a nice point and one that one could discuss with doctors of divinity.<lb/>
Quotas were an interference with editorial freedom. Maybe, my Lords. They were not frightened by the 60 per cent. quota because they produced 86 per cent., or 85 per cent. of home-produced wares. Quotas would produce some problems in scheduling. They would not be insuperable problems, but there would be some problems. They might require legislation in the case of the BBC on the question of its promotion trailers. Why exclude news, sport, events and game shows? Why indeed, my Lords. I have no conceivable idea why this exclusion should have been included.<lb/>
I must admit, having read all this material from the BBC and the IBA (for whom I have great affection and respect), that I felt that it was shadow boxing. After all, the European Community directive is aimed against the United States television industry. That is what it is talking about. The small countries, Norway, Austria, and so on, are frightened (and I do not blame them) of being overwhelmed by products from the United States which are in effect dumped by the United States in European markets. I should like to take this up with the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton. I am sorry that the report did not pay more attention to what is dumping. The United States produce "Miami Vice", "Dallas", "Dynasty" or whatever it may be. The overheads are written off in the United States and any sale elsewhere is net profit. In effect we are faced with not so much cultural imperialism as simple dumping. That is something to which I think we ought to pay attention and to which we have a right to pay attention, as we have in dumping in any other area.<lb/>
It must be accepted that the EC directive is a measure of protection designed to encourage the European TV industry. I admit that I regard this as an
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0123"/>
<col>229</col>
area where we should tread extremely carefully. Characteristically, and I think rightly, the BBC said that TV was a cultural rather than an economic activity. That is a very rare view to maintain, but at present&#x2014;and God knows what it will be in the future&#x0021; &#x2014;it happens still to be true of it. However, if economic protectionism is dangerous, I believe that cultural protectionism is even more dangerous. I believe that the free flow of ideas, the free flow of programmes, the free flow of plays, drama and films across frontiers is something that we should protect, in a different sense of that word, with the utmost care. In this respect, quotas are in effect a kind of censorship. That is something we should watch carefully before we introduce it by the back door.<lb/>
Is it not possibly the case that the EC directive has been overtaken by events? I do not pretend to be an expert in this matter and I think that in what I am about to say I am asking questions rather than giving replies. In reading the evidence in the Select Committee's report, it seemed to me that the crux of the matter was reached in the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, given on 13th November. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Buxton of Alsa, is familiar with DBS&#x2014;I believe that Anglia Television is part of BSB and is one of the consortia which has the BSB contract. The noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, said that on DBS there is a real problem. The IBA were then advertising a DBS contract. The noble Lord went on to say:
<quote>"That will be an entirely private sector operation, unlike those in France, Germany and most other countries".</quote>
I ask the noble Lord, Lord Beaverbrook, whether he will address himself to this question: am I right in thinking that unlike France, Germany and elsewhere our Government will have no control, or very little, over what BSB broadcasts? That is a rather essential question in connection with this debate. I add that BSB, like most of the applicants, according to the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, will have an almost all film channel. The noble Lord, Lord Kearton &#x2014;who I regret is not present tonight&#x2014;then put his finger on the crucial question, He said:
<quote>"if programmes do not exist to fill the DBS, except imports from the US, is it a prime necessity that we should have DBS?"</quote>
This put the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, in some difficulty&#x2014;I have told him that I was going to speak about this. He said, and I quote from page 17, paragraph 34:
<quote>"It is not.&#x2026;primarily a, decision for the IBA, it is a decision which has been taken by the Government, supported by Parliament. Having taken it, it would be better to make a success of it rather than a failure. This will be the third time the United Kingdom has sought to get into the DBS arena. There is going to be an added dimension of broadcasting in the decades which are ahead. Given the decision to do it we had better make sure it succeeds."</quote>
That means the all-film channel in effect will be 80 per cent. American films, many of them presumably supplied by Fox, which is Sky, which is Mr. Rupert Murdoch&#x2014;and so we go round and round. There is another DBS in France and another DBS in Germany. I think, although I may be wrong, that there is also one in Ireland.<lb/>
All these will have to fill their programmes and all of them will probably turn to the same kind of sources. What therefore will be the control of the EC directive on DBS programming? It seems to me that the EC
<col>230</col>
directive is a kind of Maginot Line which has already been outflanked by a Schlieffen plan of modern tehnology.<lb/>
I comprehend the response of the British broadcasting authorities, the IBA and the BBC. I agree with the Question of the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, but I would ask: is it relevant, given that DBS represents broadcasting across frontiers which is absolutely beyond the control of the European Community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01093">10.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01094"><member>Viscount Chilston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the first of these two new proposals to impose a minimum quota for European programming should, on the face of it, benefit Europe and arguably Britain in particular; while the second, to impose a minimum quota for independently-produced programmes, should be of huge financial benefit to the rapidly growing numbers of independent production houses in Europe and in this case particularly in Britain. At this stage I should declare an interest. Apart from being British and a committed European I am, as it happens, an independent producer&#x2014;or perhaps, as my noble friend Lord Buxton suggested, a crusading knight in shining armour.<lb/>
A 30 per cent. content of European material in our television programming is very much a minimum requirement and even when it is doubled to the proposed 60 per cent. in three years' time it will be substantially less than the 86 per cent. currently broadcast by the ITV companies. In the case of the BBC, as my noble friend Lord Torrington pointed out, 85 per cent. of their material is European but it is not just European: it is British and nearly all of it is produced almost entirely in-house by the corporation.<lb/>
If we accept that the current mix of United Kingdom broadcasting is about right, do we then suggest that the EC should impose an even higher quota, or do we simply regard it as yet another piece of unnecessary European legislation and ignore it? If we were simply to regard it as superfluous legislation having no effect on British broadcasting, we should not be altogether correct. British law would need amending and an Act would need to be passed through Parliament which would erode that special, politically-independent status of British broadcasters, and no immediate positive effect would be achieved.<lb/>
However, it should be considered that while existing national broadcasters in Europe generally provide a healthy ration of home-grown product, the new breed of DBS broadcasters are likely to rely upon a very much higher proportion of cheap American imports. It was, I think, the concern of the French and the Italians in particular that prompted the late inclusion of these two quota clauses after the Green Paper had been issued.<lb/>
I must agree with my noble friend Lord Torrington that if there is any possible way of establishing these criteria they must be the right criteria to guarantee the minimum amounts of European input into broadcasting. Much as I detest legislation when it replaces effective voluntary agreements like this, no one has yet suggested a viable alternative that might well be workable in the wider context of Europe.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0124"/>
<col>231</col>
As it stands, the directive excludes from those which are to be subject to quota certain categories of programme such as sport, news and&#x2014;I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord, Lord BonhamCarter&#x2014;very surprisingly, games shows. Why games shows?<lb/>
Specialist channels transmitting solid news or continuous sport would automatically be excluded, but what about non-stop music channels or a channel transmitting an exclusive diet of feature films? Some form of relief would have to be found, and presumably could be found, to limit any organisation broadcasting an exclusive diet of one thing or another. Presumably complicated exceptions could be made.<lb/>
To wait until the new broadcasters pose a threat to the established networks responsible for broadcasting seems to beg the question whether the problem is not easier to prevent rather than to cure. European legislation now will inevitably cause minor irritations to existing broadcasters, maybe some particular heavier irritations, but in five or 10 years' time when the child has been fed with the sweets how are we to get it back on to a balanced diet? At that stage any attempt to regulate by law or even by voluntary agreement the content of broadcasting could prove extremely difficult.<lb/>
This and the other quota which calls for a minimum content of independently produced programmes have both been widely criticised for being inappropriate in an instrument primarily designed to promote cross-frontier broadcasting in Europe. Is it really inappropriate to remove barriers and yet establish minimum criteria for broadcasting in one piece of legislation?<lb/>
Professor Peacock's report suggested that a figure of 40 per cent. of the BBC's output should be provided by the independents with 10 years. In turn, the independent producers' associations have been campaigning for a more realistic figure of around 25 per cent. Both the BBC and the IBA companies are critical of quotas. Numerical quotas are too inflexible, they claim, and tamper with the broadcasters' freedom. Any sudden or significant increase in independent production, they argue, could cause redundancies in the broadcasting industry.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, pointed out, the draft directive called for a figure of 5 per cent. growing to 10 per cent. in three years. That is hardly enough to tamper seriously with a broadcaster's freedom, and, certainly when the BBC already admits to a current figure of one and a bit per cent., it is not enough to qualify as a sudden or even a significant increase.<lb/>
Britain, boosted by Channel 4's appetite for independent productions, had the most sophisticated independent production facilities in Europe, to say nothing of the talent that supports and uses it. Any increase in independent production in Europe will draw upon that expertise. English is the most widely spoken language in Europe. Programmes made by European independents for home consumption will have to rely on overseas sales to supplement their production budgets. Sixty per cent. of the world's audiences are in the United States, so I would suggest that no country is better placed than Britain to provide
<col>232</col>
the production and post-production facilities for a mass of high quality European broadcast material for the American market in English at a competitive price. But perhaps by then the United States will have introduced quotas of its own to limit the dumping of European programming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01095">10.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01096"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the other speakers in this short debate I too am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, for giving us a stab at this subject tonight. I found it rather ironic that the moment it was announced that the debate would he televised, the covers were immediately put on the cameras, though I think that it was the lateness of the hour rather than any particular prejudice that led to that.<lb/>
Personally I am very concerned about the directive itself. It seems to me regrettable that the directive has over-reached its stated goals of enhancing the free circulation of television programmes within the European Community and that the good points that it has&#x2014;and there are some dealing with harmonisation of rules for advertising&#x2014;have been swamped by a premature and unsophisticated attempt to solve wide-ranging problems of copyright, into which there is no time to go at the moment, as well as to protect European broadcasters from overreliance on buying programmes from the United States.<lb/>
Ideally the articles on independent production, European quotas and copyright should have been uncoupled from those on advertising and dealt with in separate directives. Although all these issues are concerned with television and to a certain extent are interconnected, each one requires detailed working out and extensive consultation. When they are made part of a package, they engender confusion rather than clarity. Amid the details of whether to adopt statutory or voluntary copyright, or whether to ban all tobacco advertising or just advertisements for cigarettes, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the directive points to the need for some radical thinking concerning the regulation of cross-frontier broadcasting. That has been pointed out by nearly all speakers tonight, including my noble friends Lord Graham and Lord Bonham-Carter.<lb/>
A directive that is solely concerned with European quotas and separated from quotas for independent production might have alerted us to some crucial problems in broadcasting that national governments as well as the European Parliament will have to face. As it is, the debate on the directive has ranged over too many issues to focus on the question of international regulation. However, as other noble Lords have pointed out, we have quotas at the moment whether we call them informal or voluntary quotas. If we are looking to the future&#x2014;and quite frankly it is certainly the legislature's policy and obligation to do so&#x2014;at some point over the next 10 years we shall have to consider whether statutory quotas are essential if the countries of Europe are to preserve their television heritage.<lb/>
So it is doubly sad that the directive lacks coherence in addressing these problems. It is a measure of that confusion that game shows, news and sports
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0125"/>
<col>233</col>
programmes are excluded from the quotas on the grounds that those categories of programmes require little or no creative work, as the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, pointed out.<lb/>
If the authors of the directive had consulted broadcasters, they would have discovered the difficulties and challenges produced by good sports and news coverage. If they had discussed it with British broadcasters they would have seen the enormous pride that broadcasters take in portraying sport as part of our national heritage. Coverage of the Derby, the FA cup final or Wimbledon by American networks does not and cannot convey the tradition of those events or their place in British life. It is a tribute to British broadcasting that it does that, and it would be quite wrong to suggest that such programmes are not creative. Without going into the matter deeply, there is similarly a world of difference between the presentation of news on "News at Ten", for example, and the American cable news channel.<lb/>
There may be a case to be made out for exempting news from quotas concerned with the production of drama and light entertainment, but the criteria that are adopted in the directive are unnecessarily contentious and would result in an endless debate on definitions of creativity. Furthermore, if the aim of quotas is to ensure a predominantly European presence in the schedules of all television channels, the more exemptions that there are the fewer European programmes will be needed.<lb/>
Furthermore, it has been pointed out tonight that the quota is not sufficiently flexible to deal with specialist television channels. There are simply not enough British produced feature films to fill a 60 per cent. quota on the new British DBS film channel. Besides, many films ostensibly produced in Britain are made with American money, by American producers and with the American market in mind. They have as much to do with British culture as the Ayatollah Khomeini.<lb/>
Although it is easy to criticise the directive, it has the merit of bringing to our attention an extremely important issue: namely, the regulation of new television channels. One of the great fears of everyone involved with broadcasting is the downturn in standards associated with deregulation. That was one of the main themes in the debate on the Peacock Committee report.<lb/>
Until now we have been able to rely on the professional pride of British broadcasters to prevent an overreliance on cheap United States imports. When that professional pride has not been enough, we have been able to rely on the BBC Board of Governors and the members of the IBA to protect the public interest. However, in his evidence to the committee, the chairman of IBA, the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, argued that its objection to the draft directive was based on the,
<quote>"principle that these matters which the national bureaucracy has never aspired to administer should be administered by the European bureaucracy".</quote>
He went on to say:
<quote>"it would be wiser to leave it to public broadcasters".</quote>
<col>234</col>
In its evidence to the committee the BBC claimed that:
<quote>"a fundamental principle is at stake &#x2026; Under the directive the BBC, for the first time in 63 years, would be ordered by statutory provision to allocate its resources according to externally imposed criteria".</quote>
The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we will be able to rely on the British system of self-regulation if, for example, this Government are returned and decide that the ITV franchises are sold off to the highest bidder, Channel 4 is privatised and independent producers are guaranteed 25 per cent. of air time.<lb/>
If that happens it will be compounded by the growth of satellite broadcasting, as has been pointed out. In 1988 the Luxembourg satellite Astra will be beaming down over a dozen television stations which will he receivable on 60 centimetre dishes. By 1990 we are led to believe that British DBS will come on stream, adding four new channels. On top of that the French, the German and possibly the Irish DBS operations should be up and running.<lb/>
In those circumstances a new breed of TV entrepreneur will have a profound influence on the nature of broadcasting. They will control channels beamed from other countries, they will be outside the control of the IBA and as profits rather than public service is highly likely to be the prime motivation they will not really worry where the programmes come from.<lb/>
This intensification of competition must affect the present balance. In the difficult days ahead the IBA and the BBC might be glad of a quota system which ensures that anything which is uplinked from an EC country has to take a substantial proportion of its programmes from Europe. Here I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, that a great deal of the evidence which was presented to the committee and which was fascinating to read gave one the awful feeling that those people were still living in the past and were not looking towards an entirely new future situation.<lb/>
In my view quotas should be regarded as a failsafe mechanism if the British system starts to melt down. Ideally the IBA and the BBC should continue to insist on 80 to 90 per cent. home production. But if that cannot be held there should be a line below which the proportion of home production in the schedules will not fall.<lb/>
However, the trouble with quotas is that they are not quality control mechanisms. Indeed, in Canada where they have had Canadian content quotas for many years broadcasters have made cheap and highly uninteresting programmes to fill the quotas. So Canadian broadcasting has become associated with low production values and was seen as second-rate when compared to the United States. It may well be that statutory quotas will not work, but they should not be rejected simply because they have not been used in the past.<lb/>
Ken Collins, the European Member of Parliament and the British <i>rapporteur</i> at the European Parliament on the directive, put the issue clearly when he told the European Sub-Committee B that the problem is whether to legislate now and run the risk that perhaps the dust would settle in a pattern not anticipated, or
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0126"/>
<col>235</col>
whether to wait until the dust had settled and then legislate. As he rightly pointed out, by the time we come round to legislating, ownership of the broadcasting companies might have passed into hands which are not readily controllable.<lb/>
In this country we have been fortunate that our broadcasting has been committed to high standards and we have had the financial and cultural resources to maintain those standards. Some of our European neighbours have been less fortunate. Perhaps then measures should be adopted which will help other members of the EC to achieve higher broadcasting standards. Quotas may well not be the answer. However, the issue of American penetration of European television and the maintenance of quality programmes will have to be dealt with at a European level.<lb/>
As the Peacock Committee's report shows&#x2014;and although the noble Lord, Lord Buxton, said that the debate has been going on for months and months, the debate, in fact, has really only just begun&#x2014;we still have a long way to go and a lot of talking has to be done. All I would say in conclusion is that we have to look to the future and not live in the past.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01097">10.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01098"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had this evening another most interesting debate on the many sided question of how the new transfrontier television services in Europe should be regulated. I should like, first of all, to thank my noble friend Lord Torrington for initiating this debate and for providing us once again&#x2014;along with the other members of his committee&#x2014;with another excellent and comprehensive report on the EC draft directive on broadcasting, which is in every respect a useful supplement to the committee's earlier report on the Green Paper <i>Television Without Frontiers</i>. That report was, I know, widely read in Europe and had a significant influence on the debate which led to the production of the draft directive. I feel sure that this late report will have a similar influence.<lb/>
Our position on the draft directive has been set out very fully in the past, not least in the debate in your Lordships' House in March last year and in the evidence we submitted to the Select Committee in the course of its current review. In brief, we very much share the objectives of the European Commission in seeking to facilitate transfrontier broadcasting by getting rid of any unnecessary obstacles that may result from a lack of harmonisation between countries' broadcasting regulations.<lb/>
We do not rule out the need for some pan-European regulatory structure. That would give us the assurance that incoming services receivable in the United Kingdom would meet certain fundamental standards, particularly as concerns questions of taste and decency and the like. It would also confer a benefit on our satellite programme providers who, both in the past and today, have led the development of the European market in such services. I know they would welcome a common agreement on a set of rules that would give their services the assurance of entry into other European countries, without regulatory or other obstacles being placed in their path.<lb/>
<col>236</col>
But we do not want European agreement on a common set of rules to be overcomplex, legalistic and inflexible. We are looking for regulation in Europe with a rather lighter touch than some of the proposals that the Commission has put forward in the draft directive and the Green Paper has threatened to bring forward at a later date. We still maintain our view that a case has not been made out for Community legislation.<lb/>
We agree with the Select Committee in doubting whether the Community is the right forum within which to reach a lasting European agreement on these matters. In our view, the concentration in the Commission's proposals on economic objectives presented in a narrow and legalistic manner does not give sufficient weight to the wider cultural considerations that attach to broadcasting policy. By contrast, the Council of Europe has much wider experience of dealing with social and cultural issues and has a good track record in the field of international broadcasting regulation. Just as important, it covers a much wider grouping of countries. For these reasons, your Lordships will know that the Government believe that a Council of Europe convention would be a more appropriate vehicle for dealing with these matters, and are playing a full part in the drafting of such a convention that is proceeding in Strasbourg at the present time.<lb/>
On the detail of the draft directive, your Lordships will know that we do not accept the approach the Commission has followed in relation to copyright. We have serious doubts about the proposals for a system of statutory licensing and we continue to seek to maintain the existing system of voluntary agreements freely negotiated.<lb/>
The proposals on advertising are, in principle, less difficult, as the Select Committee has itself pointed out. A lot of work has been done to bring these proposals more into line with the system that we operate in this country under the IBA Code; and accordingly the match with our own regulations is much better than it was before. There still remains the question, however, whether some broadly acceptable proposals of this kind would form the basis for future regulation or whether they would merely be the springboard for the development of further regulations, perhaps extending, as the Commission has hinted, into the regulation of programmes themselves.<lb/>
That brings me to the specific set of issues that my noble friend has chosen for the subject of today's debate: the proposals to set fixed quotas from Brussels for the amount of European Community material and independently produced programmes that should appear in television services throughout Europe. In this, as in some other aspects of the Commission's proposals, we are not opposed either to the objective or to the principle, but to the inflexible manner with which the principles are to be implemented.<lb/>
Let us take first of all the question of independent production. In the past, where we have legislated in this area, as in the case of Channel 4, we have relied upon a general formulation. The Broadcasting Act of 1981 refers to a substantial proportion of programmes to be supplied from outside the ITV system. Last November, my right honourable friend, the Home
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0127"/>
<col>237</col>
Secretary, set out a general target for independent production on the broadcast channels of 25 per cent., and your Lordships will know that discussions on the best manner of implementing that target are now going forward with the broadcasters and the independent producers.<lb/>
The fundamental issue here, however, is that these matters are purely domestic ones for decision in each Community country. They do not have anything to do with obstacles to transfrontier broadcasting, and the appropriate policy can only reasonably be decided in the light of the prevailing circumstances in the television industry, which differ markedly from country to country. We are against fixed quotas set in Brussels which assume that these issues can be treated in the UK in the same way as in Italy, Portugal or Germany.<lb/>
I cannot accept the assertion of my noble friend Lord Buxton that the Government are speaking with two tongues on this subject. As regards quotas on independent production, it is important to recognise that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has not set precise quotas in the domestic field; he has set a broad target towards which the broadcasters have agreed to work over a period of years. The two concepts are not the same. Our approach on this issue is far more flexible than that followed by the Commission in its draft directive.<lb/>
Similar considerations apply to the question of European Community programming. We recognise that there should be a special place for European programmes in our television schedules. Here again, in the Broadcasting Act we have operated for many years a general formula which talks of proper proportions of domestic and other EC material, leaving it to the IBA to decide what the appropriate percentage might be. For 30 years, the proportion has been fixed at roughly 86 per cent., and the BBC has followed suit with a voluntary undertaking.<lb/>
During the passage of the Cable and Broadcasting Act in 1984, your Lordships will recall that we in this House rejected the setting of fixed percentages in this area for cable programme services, but that the Act applies the same general formula of proper proportions. The proportions of course vary from one programme channel to another, according to the kind of programmes they contain; but we agreed in 1984 that it was inevitable that in the early days of their services, the <i>new</i> programme providers could not possibly live up to the high percentages that were current on the broadcast channels. Nevertheless, the figures published by the cable authority in its recent annual report show clearly that the record in this respect is already better than many had expected.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bonham-Carter, asked me about regulating the DBS service. The planned DBS service will be regulated by the IBA. The provisions in the Broadcasting Act concerning proper proportions of European programming will apply, and it will be for the IBA to decide what the proportion will be.<lb/>
We believe that a general formula rather than a fixed percentage will be the way forward for international
<col>238</col>
instruments in this field, leaving it to the individual broadcasting authorities to interpret in the light of their particular circumstances. In this way, the independence of the broadcasters will be maintained, and there will be no danger that programme schedules are distorted purely to meet the quota rather than to provide quality programmes that the viewer wishes to watch. On that issue therefore the Government are, as ever, in firm agreement with the Select Committee's views. A formula referring to reasonable proportions of European programmes was adopted by the Council of Europe last year in its recommendations on audiovisual production. It seems likely that a similar formula will be included in the proposed draft convention.<lb/>
While the process of drafting the convention goes on, we shall of course continue to play our full part in Brussels in the continuing discussions on the draft directive. I should say to my noble friend Lord Buxton that it is far too early to talk about the failure of our attempts to resist the draft directive. The majority of countries in the Community see many of the objections that we see.<lb/>
We shall study very closely the detail of this second report from the Select Committee and the useful contributions that have been made in the debate today, both of which will serve to inform those further deliberations in Brussels. In closing, I should like to repeat my thanks to my noble friend for the contribution he and his committee have made to this important debate in Europe and express my satisfaction that on most of the issues concerned the views of the committee and the Government are as one.</membercontribution></p>

<title>European Air Fares</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01105"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, arising from their answer to her Starred Question on 2nd April (col. 693), legal action has now been taken with the adoption of reasoned decisions against the three airlines concerned or whether, alternatively, all EC airlines have now brought their inter-airline agreements into line with the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01106"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the three airlines concerned&#x2014;Alitalia, Olympic Airways and Lufthansa&#x2014;have entered into direct discussions with the Commission, in the same way as the other airlines involved in the Article 89 proceedings, and have undertaken to bring their commercial agreements into line with the Treaty of Rome. As a result, the Commission has not for the moment proceeded with formal legal action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01107"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I am glad that the Commission has made some progress, may I ask this question? Does this mean that we shall have to wait until all these agreements have been deemed compatible with the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome before any further step forward can be taken?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01108"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. Modification of airline agreements will clearly be a useful step forward towards more genuine competition but will not remove the unnecessary regulatory restrictions imposed by some governments. It therefore remains essential for consumers that we should, if possible, reach agreement at the Council of Ministers on a satisfactory package of liberalising measures. We hope this will be possible in June, regardless of the state of play of the Commission's direct action with the airlines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01109"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that helpful comment, but can he deal with one further point? Is it correct that all the airlines had agreed to set up a tribunal to settle disputes on air fares but that this would fall unless agreement on a general package is arrived at by 9th June? Further to that, if there is a general election on llth June, would that mean that our responsible Minister would be unable to add his signature to any agreement reached
<col>240</col>
and that we should thereby lose the advantage of any progress made?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01110"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the first point raised by the noble Baroness, the tribunal on which agreement has been reached in principle would be established by the governments and not by the airlines. It cannot become effective within the Community unless formal agreement on the package as a whole can be reached. Without wishing to speculate on the date of the general election, should there be an election my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport will then decide who should represent the United Kingdom. In any event, we shall make every effort to secure agreement in June.<lb/>
Noble Lords will be aware that liberalisation is long overdue and there is nothing unusual about senior officials representing Ministers at tile Council if necessary. In fact, it is rare for every Minister to be present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01111"><member>Lord Bethell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not my noble friend the Minister agree that whereas it is true that 10 European airlines have, under pressure from the Commission and under threat of legal action under Article 89, agreed to bring their practices into line with European law, it follows that all or most of them are still in breach of that law? As a result, the European passenger is suffering by paying higher air fares than necessary. Will the Government therefore consider taking powers under Article 88 to regulate this matter and to see that the competition articles are enforced? If not, will the Government at least make a commitment to do so should there not be agreement in the June Council?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01112"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has a Bill along those lines which is currently before the House. If the Council reaches a satisfactory agreement by 30th June&#x2014;the deadline set by the Commission&#x2014;then unilateral action by member states will no longer be legally possible. If no agreement is reached, the Government already have the necessary powers in Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act to establish Article 88 machinery and have already undertaken to do so if necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01113"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to the constitutional question raised by the noble Baroness opposite, is it not a fact that though dissolution creates a parliamentary vacuum it does not create an executive vacuum?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01114"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is right.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Regional Airports: International Flights</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01115">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01116"><member>Lord Gainford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government how many. international destinations are now served from regional airports in Britain compared with 1979.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0129"/>
<col>241</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01117"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are some 150 international routes serving some 60 destinations from regional airports in the United Kingdom. Only about 40 destinations were served in 1979. I greatly welcome this major increase in travel opportunities for the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01118"><member>Lord Gainford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that encouraging informaton. In view of that, is there any possibility of encouraging airlines which are used by the tourist package tours to use more of these regional airports and thus relieve some of the London airports&#x2014;Gatwick, for example&#x2014;of the heavy traffic?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01119"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are already committed to ensuring that the regional airports can develop in order to meet local demand. We do not place any regulatory obstacles in the way of tour operators who see a demand for charter flights to and from regional airports. Indeed, there are already a large number of such flights direct from regional airports.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01120"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the information given by the Minister on the number of destinations is most encouraging, he does not appear to have replied to the Question put by his noble friend Lord Gainsford. The Government say they wish to encourage the use of regional airports, but that appears to be an attitude of hope. What positive policy are the Government following in order to encourage the use of regional airports for charter flights and to enter into discussions not only with airport operators but also with the airlines?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01121"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is our policy to encourage development by improving capital expenditure and by improvement to local authority airports where they are financially justified. Large allocations have already been made. Some &#x00A3;222 million has been made available since 1979. Several important developments have taken place; for instance, the new terminal at Birmingham, the runway extension at Leeds-Bradford and work at Newcastle, which is due to be completed this month. I believe that we are encouraging the use of regional airports.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01122"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not also a fact that the Civil Aviation Authority has pursued a route licensing policy that encourages the use of those airports for a wide variety of routes? Are not its effects reflected in the figures which my noble friend has recently given?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01123"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is right. For example, if one takes Manchester Airport, 25 new routes, including seven intercontinental ones, have been introduced since 1979. I could give many examples. Birmingham is serving nine new destinations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01124"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the Minister mentioned Birmingham, is he aware that many people in and around Birmingham feel that if the airport could be granted gateway status it would greatly help the development of international flights
<col>242</col>
there? Does he feel that his honourable friend Mr. Spicer might be able to look at that matter again?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01125"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly draw the noble Baroness's remarks about Birmingham to the attention of my honourable friend Mr. Spicer. Of course, Manchester is a gateway airport in the North. I admit that Birmingham is in the Midlands, but I shall certainly draw her remarks to my honourable friend's attention.</membercontribution></p>

<title>VAT: Listed Buildings</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01126"><member>Lord Moyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government why exemption from VAT is denied to repairs of listed historic houses while it is granted to alterations to such houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01127"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the repair or maintenance of buildings, listed or otherwise, has always been liable to VAT at the standard rate. On 1st June 1984 alteration work, previously liable at the zero rate, became standard-rated, but zero-rating was retained for approved alterations to listed buildings and scheduled monuments so as not to worsen their position in relation to VAT. This concession was widely welcomed by those concerned with the preservation of our national heritage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01128"><member>Lord Moyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I thank my noble friend the Minister for that reply, I have to declare an interest, in that I live in an old, listed house. The buckets are not at the moment under the roof and therefore my interest is not immediate. Is my noble friend aware that, owing to the VAT anomaly, owners have a tendency to make alterations instead of repairs? Will he consider introducing a flat rate for both categories so as to produce approximately the same amount of revenue? Would the EC accept such an arrangement, which might well be imitated to advantage in Europe? Finally, does not a stitch in time save nine?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01129"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to my noble friend's last question is yes. He asked me a number of other questions. With regard to relief on alterations and whether it may be an incentive to make undesirable changes, we do not believe that is so. Relief is available only for approved alterations. Planning authorities can always refuse listed building consent for work that would affect the character of a listed building or destroy important features.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01130"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that in its most recent report the House of Commons Environment Committee unanimously recommended that the owners of listed buildings should be relieved of the burden of 15 per cent. VAT on repairs and maintenance by allowing them to recover it through the taxation system? I repeat that it was the committee's unanimous recommendation.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0130"/>
<col>243</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01131"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are of course considering all the Select Committee's recommendations and will publish their observations as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01132"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that not only the House of Commons committee but all the voluntary organisations and statutory bodies in the country concerned with this matter have been unanimous in their condemnation of the anomaly? Is the Minister further aware that if there is anything else that they condemn it is the extremely poor argument produced by the Government to justify the system since it was introduced?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01133"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should point out that, while presumably everyone who has to pay VAT on anything would like zero-rating, we believe that zero-rating would be indiscriminate. We give grants where help is most needed. In England this year such help for historic buildings from central government will amount to over &#x00A3;22 million. Local authorities also make grants from their resources, but I do not have that figure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01134"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while declaring an interest a great deal smaller than that of my noble friend Lord Moyne, may I ask my noble friend the Minister how he justifies in logic exempting alterations and charging on repairs? Surely if the object is to preserve such buildings, repairs are, if anything, the more important?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01135"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the repair or maintenance of buildings, listed or otherwise, has always been liable to VAT at the standard rate. My noble friend will no doubt be aware that the Government accept that they have no authority under the EC sixth directive to introduce any new zero rate or to restore one which has been given up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01136"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the noble Lord's reference to buildings, whether listed or unlisted, will he inform the House what the Government propose to do if the present case, No. 816 of 1985, currently before the European Court results in the Government being ordered to levy a 15 per cent. VAT duty on all new houses, thus increasing the average price of a house by some &#x00A3;4, 500? Will he confirm that the only reason why Her Majesty's Government have not thought fit to disclose their pleadings in this case is that they would really like to have the tax levied?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01137"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question refers to "listed historic houses" and I shall restrict my answers to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01138"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not apparent that this is quite contrary to common sense? As has been said, to levy tax on repairs, which are much more important than alterations, is nonsense. If the EC is the stumbling block, can the Minister say what representations have been made? The House should not accept that because this has always been the position it should continue. The whole country must see that such a levy is nonsense.</membercontribution></p>
<col>244</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01139"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have said that there are ways of giving grants other than exempting from VAT. That is what we seek to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01140"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend tell us, in view of the grant of &#x00A3;22 million towards repair of historic buildings, how much has been raised through VAT on repairs to such buildings? Are the two sums by any chance about the same? That seems to be very dotty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01141"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have a figure for VAT charged on repairs to listed historic houses. I understand that there is no definition as such of a listed historic house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01142"><member>A noble Lord</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how do you levy VAT on it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01143"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is this an announcement of new government policy; namely, to abolish the List of listed buildings? For the last 40 years there has been a list of buildings of architectural and historic interest commonly known as the List. Houses on it are listed houses. When the Government say that there is no definition of a listed house, is this an announcement that the List is to be abolished?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01144"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Drinking Water: EC Directive</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01145">3.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01146"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, since the European Commission is expected to institute proceedings against them under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome, they intend to conform to the standards of the drinking water directive 80/778/EEC.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01147"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Lord Skelmersdale)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no water from a public water supply is a danger to health. However, a small percentage does fail one or more of the very stringent parameters in the directive. These are either covered by derogations or are being brought up to standard as quickly as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01148"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer and note what he says about derogations. Do Her Majesty's Government accept that the words "maximum admissible concentration" in the Council of the European Community's directive relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption mean "maximum"? Is the Government's current policy of interpreting "maximum admissible concentration" as a three-month rolling average thus a breach of the directive?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0131"/>
<col>245</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01149"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, breaches of the directive can be settled in the ultimate instance only by the European Court. As to the current position regarding the court, I accept that one, and only one, legal proceeding has been started by the Commission in respect of water in Tower Hamlets.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01150"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Anglian Water Authority is already having to import pure water in order to dilute the water it extracts because of the presence of an excessive amount of nitrates? Does he not think that he has given a rather complacent Answer about the quality of the water being produced for us to drink? Can he say what further action he proposes to take to ensure that the presence of excessive nitrates is guarded against in the future?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01151"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the general comment that I made at the beginning of my Answer&#x2014; that no water from a public water supply is a danger to health&#x2014;includes nitrates as well as any other of the masses of parameters within the directive. However, we are considering the recommendations for action, contained in the report of the nitrate coordination group, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. An integrated approach is needed, with contributions from both the agriculture and the water industries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01152"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say more about the slightly disturbing reference to the water in Tower Hamlets where some of us have family members?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01153"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, again, I must reiterate the point that there is no risk to public health. A programme of improvements on nitrites is already well advanced and an application has been made to the Commission under Article 20. We hope to resolve this matter shortly with the Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01154"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister inform us where and when the meeting with the civil servants of the Department of the Environment and civil servants from other member states to discuss the Commission's proposals to deal with nitrate pollution is to take place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01155"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a detailed and specific question that I shall have to answer in writing. I assure the noble Baroness that I shall certainly do that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01177">Clause 1 [<i>Liability of carriers for passengers without proper documents</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01178"><member>Lord Mottistone</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 1, line 6, leave out ("by ship or aircraft").</quote>
The noble Lord said: I have been advised on the amendments that I have put down by the General Council of British Shipping. It is the shipping interest&#x2014;in particular the interest of the roll-on roll-off ferries&#x2014;to which I shall speak. Amendment No. 1 is a paving amendment. It is one of several consequential on the subsequent amendment, Amendment No. 8. The others are Amendments Nos. 2, 5 and 13. I shall be speaking to all those amendments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01179">The object of this amendment is in no way to spoil, let alone wreck, the Bill, the principle of which is thoroughly accepted. I agree entirely that there should be no real extra difficulty for the airlines, which are the main routes that perhaps need to be controlled. They have the machinery which can fairly satisfactorily deal with the implications of this Bill. However, on ships and in particular on roll-on roll-off ferries with large numbers of people coming on board at ports it will impose an extra burden which my noble friend Lord Beaverbrook appreciated in his opening remarks at Second Reading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01180">The object of this amendment is really to share the load. Amendment No. 8 seeks to include the operators of passenger coaches. I ask the Committee to imagine the situation. When a roll-on roll-off ferry is embarking its passengers the people in coaches will be motored on board in a composite package of people who can adequately be controlled by the agent of the operator; to wit, the driver of the coach. It is simple for him at some stage of the journey, probably even before he reaches the ship, to do the minor checking that is necessary. It was pointed out by my noble friend Lord Beaverbrook that only 20 per cent. of the passengers are expected to be in the category covered by the Bill and the driver needs to check over and do the work that the Bill calls for. That will relieve the load on the shipping company, which will then have to deal only with the ordinary passengers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01181">This series of amendments attempts to modify the Bill slightly to allow that sort of shared load to take effect. I agree fully that the wording of my amendments may not be satisfactory. I also agree that it may be necessary, as I thought afterwards, to define "carrier". In his speech my noble friend Lord Beaverbrook repeatedly referred to carriers, and that
<col>248</col>
may be an understood phrase which does not have to be specifically defined.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01182">It is not my intention to press these amendments, but I hope that my noble friend the Minister will feel that the principle of what I am trying to put across in these amendments is one that he can readily accept; and perhaps he may even agree to come forward with modifications to these amendments himself at the next stage of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01183"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I oppose this series of grouped amendments. The crux of this series appears to be the deeming provisions in Amendment No. 8. As my noble friend has explained, these amendments provide in effect that when a passenger coach is transported by ship, say a roll-on roll-off ferry, the operator of the coach shall be deemed to be the carrier. I agree with my noble friend that the drafting raises problems because of the exclusion of the words "ship or aircraft" by the amendment and the substitution of the word "carrier" in Amendment No. 2. This may need looking at, but I am not concerned with the drafting.<lb/>
This qualification on the liability of a carrier by ship under Clause 1 surely is not broadly acceptable. The identifiable agents of abuse have been the ship and the aircraft, and the carriers who transport by sea surely cannot disclaim responsibility for compliance with Clause 1, because that is what it comes to, by shifting the whole burden to the operator of the coach transported by them. As the Bill stands, it is the owners or the agents of the ship or aircraft who are liable for contravention of Clause 1, not the coach operator. So it should remain.<lb/>
The fact that passengers come on board the ship in a coach instead of in motor cars or on foot, if one looks at the matter objectively, in no way inhibits a routine check of documents such as is envisaged to ensure compliance with Clause 1(1)(a) and (b), subject to the safeguards of Clause 2(1), (2) and (4).<lb/>
This series of amendments to Clause 1 constitutes a substantial departure from the broad intendment of the Bill. As to Amendment No. 13, to Clause 2, I think this stands or falls with Amendment No. 8 and is designed to accommodate the deeming provisions under that amendment as regards the coach operator. The crux of this series is the deeming provisions of Amendment No. 8. The question is whether it is right that in the circumstances the carrier by ship should be permitted to shift the burden. In principle I cannot see that that is right or reasonable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01184"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I hope the Committee will not accept this amendment. It seems to me that the shipowner can be identified. He has a ship and people coming on to it, but where will the operator of a coach start from? Will he start from India or from some other country? When he reaches a port, such as Calais, how are we to know whether he has done his job, who he is and whether he can be reached so that he can be made to pay his 1, 000 or whatever it may be, if he has not properly investigated his passengers? The only person upon whom the responsibility can be put is the shipowner who is transporting not only the passengers on his ship but the passengers on the coach. I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendments.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01185"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: These amendments have the general support of the main agencies caring for refugees whose interests I shall chiefly be defending in my interventions at this Committee stage. Therefore they have our support. The noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, has correctly identified the quite impossible problems which will be caused for the operators of ferries crossing either the Channel or the North or Irish seas. I should perhaps add that I would be more devious than I should wish to be if I did not admit that I also like these amendments because they tend to show what an appallingly hurried, muddled and ill-considered Bill this is. But those are by no means my only reasons for supporting them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01186"><member>Lord Teviot</member><membercontribution>: Like my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, I am afraid I cannot support my noble friend Lord Mottistone in his amendment. Unlike my noble friend Lord Campbell, I cannot deal with the legal difficulties in the wording but I can merely describe the impracticability of my noble friend's amendment and the situation in the bus industry as it is now.<lb/>
There are three basic categories of people travelling to and from this country by bus. One is the operation that takes day trippers shopping to the Continent. I cannot see any problem there as the driver who is acting as the operator's agent only brings back the passengers whom he takes out. It is the same for the next category, which is the coach driver who is returning people who have been on a tour of a few days or more, or even a fortnight. Those categories account for the great bulk of people travelling here by coach. The third category is slightly different: that is, the international express where there are a great number of routes stretching throughout the Continent and people can buy a ticket on a route or receive tickets purchased for them by someone in this country.<lb/>
These groups are operated by Continental travel and a consortium of many other companies, and they are very responsible. In their conditions of travel issued to agents they state the following:
<quote>"Please ensure before booking that passengers have the correct documentation to travel in the various countries they may pass through or visit to avoid cancellation charges. Advise passengers that it is their responsibility to have in their possession a valid passport, together with such visas as may be necessary".</quote>
In order to comply with my noble friend's Amendment No. 8 a driver would have to check any passenger's travel documents on the point of boarding. He could not just pick up somebody in the middle of nowhere and bring him all the way to Calais and then say, "Now I want your passport. You haven't got it; go away". He would have to do it at this point, which could be a capital city, a metropolis or a bus stop in the high street of a small town. Even if it were reasonable for an English national driver to deal with this, I doubt whether he would be expected to know all the visa requirements. It would be totally unreasonable to expect a Spanish, Italian, Greek, Yugoslav or even a Polish driver&#x2014;there are international express routes even to Poland&#x2014;to be aware of such requirements. On that point the amendment is impracticable.<lb/>
Again, I have made inquiries to see whether there is a problem now and to find out how many people who seek asylum travel to this country by bus or coach. I
<col>250</col>
am told on very good authority that it is rare. I then questioned my contact about where he got his information and how he would know if this happened. He said he would know because the coach would be somewhat delayed. Occasionally at Dover a coach is delayed. No specific reason is given because the driver cannot drive off from the port without his complement of passengers unless advised by the authorities. A person may have sought asylum and not been granted it or had it withheld, or he may have been stopped on a customs matter. Such occasions are extremely rare. I even inquired about people coming from the Republic of Ireland and was told that it was even rarer from there. In fact, my contact could not recall a single instance.<lb/>
Some EC countries do not inspect people's passports before they leave their ports to come to this country. I do not blame only France and Belgium. I am told that it is quite possible to travel from Spain or Italy and not be asked to show documents until one arrives here. I am told that it is slightly more difficult when coming from Greece. It is possible, although one might be checked and one probably would not risk it. This is not so much a problem. I am sorry that I have painted a different picture but I am afraid that my noble friend's amendment is not practicable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01187">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01188"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend asked me to give serious and careful consideration to these amendments. Indeed, it would have been wrong for me not to do so considering that not so long ago I had a much greater involvement with the shipping world than I do at the moment; and so I took particular interest in amendments which might affect the lives of ferry operators.<lb/>
This group of amendments would create confusion and uncertainty in the operation of the Bill and they would put a 'wholly new and unreasonable obligation on coach companies. Nor do I think they are workable. There are a number of reasons for this. First, I do not see how in all cases the immigration officer could identify who was a coach passenger and who arrived by other means. As my noble friend said, most will be in the coach, but I have to say to him that there will be those who will not be in the coach. What is to stop someone from leaving his coach group during the ferry crossing and arriving as a foot passenger? How would liability be established in that instance? The scope for confusion and dispute would be legion.<lb/>
Secondly, it would be unreasonable to expect coach companies throughout the world to have an understanding of their obligations under this legislation, a point raised by my noble friend Lord Teviot. They simply cannot be expected to find out about the proposed obligations which as far as we know do not apply to coach companies in any other country in the world. If they were to do so, they could no doubt easily arrange to transfer responsibility back to the ferry company by arranging for their passengers to travel as foot passengers and pick up another coach on the other side of the Channel. That hardly seems to be fair to the ferry companies.<lb/>
Thirdly, it would in practice be very difficult to identify who was the operator of a passenger coach, the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0134"/>
<col>251</col>
point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning. There may well be no representative of the company in the United Kingdom who can be held responsible for paying the charge. The owner of a coach could have chartered it to a club or organisation. He could not reasonably be expected to be responsible for checking the documents of whoever may be travelling on it when it reaches the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I agree again with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, and with my noble friend Lord Teviot, and I have to say to my noble friend that it is just too woolly to say that the point of liability should be where the passenger is&#x2014;I quote from Amendment No. 5&#x2014;
<quote>"setting out on passage to"</quote>
the United Kingdom. Is that to be when he leaves his front door? If it is when he leaves the coach station in Turkey, I am afraid too much can happen between there and the Channel port for there to be any certainty about the documents the coach operator may have seen when the passenger started his journey.<lb/>
On the legal point, I agree with my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway that it is unreasonable to extend this Bill to a whole new category of operators who are not in any way covered by the Immigration Act 1971. That Act clearly establishes the liability of carriers by ship or aircraft, and this Bill builds on that. It would be breaking wholly new and uncertain ground to include coach companies and I do not believe it can be justified. I am sorry to have given my noble friend such a disappointing reply, but I find the arguments against his amendment quite conclusive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01189"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: Has the noble Earl considered the fact that when and if the Channel Tunnel is completed, people will be able to come by train? If he does not like the noble Lord's amendments, could he not include "by any other method" or words of that kind in the Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01190"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: There is a provision for the Bill to be included within the Channel Tunnel Bill. I believe that when we look at the amendments before us there are considerable difficulties in regard to their inclusion in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01191"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry that I did not have more support from other parts of the Committee. I rather felt that in leaping immediately to his feet my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway had not actually listened to what I had been saying and went ahead with what he intended to say anyhow.<lb/>
I see the difficulties emphasised by my noble friend the Minister, but, on the other hand, the principle of what I am trying to achieve would be a better way of sharing this responsibility. I know that my noble friend does not want to share it, particularly with people whose operators are based outside this country. The best I can do at the moment is to read with care what everybody has said, see if I can contrive something for Report stage which will meet the points made and try to achieve what I want to achieve. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01192">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<col>252</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01194"><member>Lord Mishcon</member> moved Amendment No. 3:
<quote>Page 1, line 16, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() Any owner or agent who has paid the prescribed amount shall have the sum refunded if the passenger is subsequently granted refugee status under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees and 1967 Protocol.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01195">The noble Lord said: At the very outset of the debate on the amendments which I hope to move and where I am supported also by members of the Alliance and by those on the Cross-Benches, may I make completely clear the position of my own party in regard to this Bill? During the Second Reading debate in another place the Minister of State said, at col. 779 of the <i>Official Report:</i>
<quote>"We owe it to genuine refugees to ensure, that while their interests are secured, those who try to abuse the system do not get away with it."</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01196">That is where we stand in regard to all the amendments with which my party is associated. We are here to secure the interests of genuine refugees. We are not here to defend those who quite wrongly abuse the system and who are not genuine refugees.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01197">I want to make that position abundantly clear because of what was published by the political editor of the <i>Independent</i> newspaper on 4th May. I told the noble Earl the Minister, as he would expect me to do, that I intended to quote what that article says under the following heading:
<quote>"Conservatives will attack opposition parties over risk of 'flood' of refugees. Immigration row to be key Tory platform".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01198">I read from the beginning of the article:
<quote>"The Tories are planning to use a race gambit against Labour and the Alliance, with an election campaign claim that their opposition to the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Bill risks 'flooding' the country with refugees.</quote>
<quote>Conservative election planning has reached such a pitch that senior ministers are making detailed dispositions for legislation which has not passed through Parliament.</quote>
<quote>Party managers are paying particular attention to the Carriers' Bill, brought forward in response to the arrival of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. The Bill proposes fines for airlines and other carriers of up to 1, 000 for each passenger brought into the country without proper passports or entry permits and papers.</quote>
<quote>Labour&#x2014;the main Tory target&#x2014;has opposed the legislation and will refuse to reach any deal under which the Bill, now in the Lords, might be accelerated through to the Statute Book.</quote>
<quote>If, as the politicians predict, the election is called for 11 June, Mrs. Thatcher would make her announcement next Monday and Parliament would have a week in which to tidy up remaining legislation. Without Opposition agreement, there is no possibility of finalising the Carriers' Bill. Senior ministers have said privately that they are prepared to use that pretext to attack Labour and the Alliance.".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01199">I finish the quotation there.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01200">I merely ask the noble Earl the Minister, when he replies to this amendment, to dissociate himself and his colleagues completely from this article. I recognise at once that he and his colleagues cannot be responsible for what people write in newspapers and what political editors publish. However, when such an article appears, and it is seen by the public, I am sure that the Government will welcome the opportunity of saying that no such smear will take place during the election campaign, and that the allegations made here in regard to the tactics of senior Ministers of the Government will be disclaimed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01201">I finish on this note in regard to the introduction to what I have to say on this particular amendment. I believe that your Lordships in all parts of the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0135"/>
<col>253</col>
Committee would regard tactics of that kind as sordid, and would regard&#x2014;as I believe would most decent, thinking people&#x2014;any conceivable vote obtained by those tactics as being dishonourably obtained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01202">I now turn to the amendment. An amendment was sought in the other place to exonerate the carrier from all liability concerning someone who entered these shores with defective papers and was found to be a refugee, and a genuine one. The answer that was given by the Government&#x2014;and it was an understandable one&#x2014;was that if one did not impose the liability until the whole case had been examined, the carrier would not know where he stood for a considerable period of time, and it would be administratively most untidy to try to exact a penalty at a later stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01203">We have recognised in this amendment the validity of an argument of that kind. Therefore what we have said is that the penalty may well have to be exacted in a certain case within the principles of this Bill, which principles have now to be accepted in view of the fact that the Second Reading has taken place. What therefore we are saying is this. The penalty having been exacted, if it be found that the refugee has had to present defective papers and the fine has been imposed and paid, and subsequently the Home Office itself finds that that person is a genuine refugee within the meaning of the definition of the convention and, therefore is accepted as such, the carrier will have his penalty repaid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01204">I cannot think, if I may say so without exaggerating my case, of a more genuine amendment to a Bill which seeks, as the Minister said in another place, to secure the rights of the genuine refugee. Nor can I think of a more genuine amendment in the interests of carriers who find that they have carried a genuine refugee, that they thought they were carrying such a genuine refugee even though his papers were defective, and that thought has been confirmed by the finding of the Government thereafter. I beg to move an amendment which I hope will have the support of all Members of the Committee in whatever places they sit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01205"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: In rising to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, perhaps I may first associate myself and my noble friends with his opening remarks. I think I made clear at Second Reading my loathing for the racketeers who exploit human misery and who should be the true target of this Bill. I yield to no one in my loathing of such people. As the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said, it is the genuine refugee we are seeking to defend. When I read that article in the <i>Independent</i> my own feeling was that it was just too silly to take seriously.<lb/>
No Bill&#x2014;not this Bill or any other conceivable Bill&#x2014;will ever totally prevent people arriving in this country with defective documents. It is bound to happen. Such people may claim refugee status. Some such claims will fail. So be it. But surely nobody can assert that there will never be an occasion on which some poor devil will somehow manage to get here in spite of his dodgy papers, will claim convention refugee status, and will then be found after the most exhaustive investigation to be entitled to that claim.<lb/>
What ought to happen if the fine has already been levied, if the poll tax has been exacted? This
<col>254</col>
amendment, with almost unimaginable moderation, suggests that the fine should be repaid. This amendment, with one possible exception which comes later, is the minimum concession that the Government should make in order to render this Bill unobjectionable in every quarter of the Committee. I find it impossible to understand how any person with a grain of justice in his heart can possibly oppose the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01206">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01207"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I associate myself with all that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said about the newspaper. I am not sure that your Lordships should accept this amendment. It must be remembered that the policy of this statute is to put an end to people flooding into England, maybe supported by racketeers, without documents&#x2014;or with forged documents&#x2014;and then claiming that they are refugees. In a sense it may be a legitimate claim but it has no legal basis because they are entering without documents or with forged documents. Therefore there is a breach of the Immigration Act. They are guilty, <i>prima facie</i>, of entering the country without leave. The racketeers who encourage them are aiding and abetting them and in a sense, so are the carriers.<lb/>
Now there is a demand for the sum of &#x00A3; 1, 000 to be paid. That is a very effective sanction but it must be remembered that the words in the Bill are:
<quote>"be liable to pay to the Secretary of State on demand the sum of &#x00A3;1, 000".</quote>
Is it not a case where the Secretary of State should consider the matter and in his discretion should not make the demand? Therefore they would not have to pay or the demand would be relaxed. In other words, claims for a refund should not be left to the law. It should be left to the Secretary of State to say, "In this particular case, I do not think it would be fair to charge you &#x00A3;1, 000 so I shall not demand it". I think that this matter should be left to the discretion of the Secretary of State and should not be made a legal point. I do not support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01208"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to the arguments behind this amendment and others to come. Unfortunately, I was not able to be present at the debate on Second Reading, so I had to refer to <i>Hansard</i>, as doubtless did some other noble Lords. I was struck by certain points that arose during the debate and which I think are relevant to the questions that we are now discussing.<lb/>
In the speech introducing the Second Reading of this Bill the noble Lord, Lord Beaverbrook, pointed out that the Bill:
<quote>"is emphatically not aimed at reducing the Government's commitment to the United Nations Convention on Refugees. Our commitment remains as firm as ever".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/4/87; col. 857].</quote>
The noble Lord also pointed out that the needs of genuine refugees will continue to be protected; that discretion will be used reasonably and with good judgment. It seems to me that this particular amendment, together with others which follow, are designed to make sure that the Bill will not be unduly hard on the genuine refugee.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0136"/>
<col>255</col>
The Minister must accept that in many circles in this country there is widespread concern about this Bill, and I believe that that concern should be listened to with great care. In his speech on Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, used striking words when he said, at col. 870 of <i>Hansard:</i>
<quote>"we are entering into a game of pass the parcel with people's lives".</quote>
This amendment appears to be especially concerned with the rights of carriers and how the carriers will regard the legislation which is to be passed and their own future commitments. I think that it also deals with the rights of genuine refugees. I support this amendment and others which follow because I believe that there is a grave danger that a long, honourable and humane tradition which this country has had in the past is about to be transgressed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01209"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I rise to oppose this amendment because I have some rough notes in my hand. I am sure that the noble Lords, Lord Mishcon and Lord McNair, and the right reverend Prelate will not be so uncharitable as to suggest that, because I oppose the amendment, I have not listened to what they have had to say; or that on any occasion I do not listen to what any noble Lords have to say. Indeed, I have often changed my views on account of it.<lb/>
My opposition is the other side of the argument. It is based on what I hope is a reasonable reputation of the suggestion made by the right reverend Prelate that underlies the principle of the argument in support of the amendment: that the Bill works hardship on the genuine refugee. Any person who in good faith seeks entry into the United Kingdom, either for the purpose of seeking asylum under this amendment or for any other purpose under Amendment No. 4, must have some means of establishing his identity. He must have some document establishing nationality or citizenship under Clause 1(1)(a) and, if appropriate, a valid visa.<lb/>
By reason of Clause 1(2) the prescribed amount is not payable if such a document is produced to the owners or agents, or any employee, unless the falsity of the document is reasonably apparent. The regime therefore proposed under Clause 1 is, on the face of it, reasonable. It is not only reasonable; it is requisite to curb the abuse which, on common consensus of all noble Lords who spoke at Second Reading, was a serious abuse and one that had to be curbed.<lb/>
Why should any subsequent ground of asylum or exceptional leave to remain under Amendment No. 4, no doubt on humanitarian or compassionate grounds applicable to the personal circumstances of the passenger, carried by the carrier in contravention of Clause 1, entitle the carrier who breached the law to claim a refund? The logic is not understood.<lb/>
Furthermore, as regards the question of whether it is an unreasonable hardship for the carrier, the exercise of the discretion of the Secretary of State, subsequent to breach of statute by the carrier, is for the benefit of the passenger&#x2014;the person seeking asylum&#x2014;and not for the benefit of the carrier. It is not at all desirable that that subsequent exercise of compassionate discretion should give rise to some automatic refund from the Consolidated Fund; because that is where it comes from
<col>256</col>
As regards Amendment No. 3, the word used is "subsequently". Is that the subsequent granting of refugee status at any time, in any country? It is so indefinite. As regards Amendment No. 4, the words used are "if the passenger". If it is requisite, the passenger will simply not have had the valid entry visa. I should have thought that it was quite the other way: that broadly it is contrary to humanitarian considerations that there should be any association between a payment of money and the exercise of an administrative discretion.<lb/>
The Bill as it stands is fair and reasonable, and there is no logical basis for a refund to a carrier who has breached the statute merely because the Secretary of State, as an act of compassion, or maybe on humanitarian grounds, grants refugee status or the right to enter. I oppose the amendment for those reasons. That is the other side of the argument.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01210"><member>Lord Chitnis</member><membercontribution>: I support the amendment. My support for it was increased when, yesterday, by chance and on a wholly different matter, I met an old friend of mine, Mr. Donald Woods. I can perhaps retell his tale with which some of your Lordships may be familiar.<lb/>
Mr. Woods, a white English-speaking South African citizen, was the editor of the <i>Daily Despatch</i>, a South African newspaper. As a result of things he printed, he was made subject to a banning order by the South African Government&#x2014;effectively, house arrest. Indeed, during that time, an attempt was made to murder one of his children.<lb/>
Mr. Woods decided he might be better off out of South Africa than in it. Disguised as a Catholic priest and carrying a fake Irish passport he managed to evade the control associated with house arrest and was flown by British Caledonian to London. He applied for refugee status which was given to him. After a number of years he applied for British citizenship which was granted. He is now a happy and useful member of society here.<lb/>
The only reason I tell this tale is that there are people in a situation similar to that of Donald Woods in South Africa at present. It is perfectly possible to envisage that they, too, might have to leave that country disguised as priests and carrying fake passports. They may find their way to Britain where they are discovered to be genuine refugees. Any reasonable person would, I believe, admit that Britain is probably the most suitable country in which they should find refuge.<lb/>
I think that even the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, would agree that Mr. Woods blends well into the English countryside. If so and if there are other genuine refugees whom we want and ought to have in this country, I fail to see why, at the end of the process, British Caledonian should be &#x00A3;1, 000 the lighter. I hope that the noble Earl can deal with this kind of case.<lb/>
The Australian Act was used by the Minister as an example which the Government have tried to follow. In Australia, carriers are exempt from payment if they bring in people who are subsequently referred to the refugee determination procedure irrespective of the result of that procedure. If that is not possible here, then, surely, the fine should be refunded where the person is seen to be a genuine refugee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01211"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: I have the greatest respect, as, I am sure, all members of the Committee have, for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning. I have great respect also for the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. But I cannot follow their arguments. Both seem to base their case on the fact that if this amendment were adopted it would encourage a flood of refugees of one kind or another into this country. The amendment does nothing of the sort. It seems to me a very simple amendment based on natural justice. If we can bring somebody into this country, possibly in the case which the noble Lord, Lord Chitnis, has mentioned, or any other cases less dramatic than that, when there is reason to believe that he or she is a refugee or that the documents are in order whereas they are subsequently found to be forgeries, then the carriers are liable. If it is decided by the immigration officer that the documents are forgeries or that the person involved is not a refugee, the carriers are liable to a fine of &#x00A3;1, 000.<lb/>
We are not suggesting that they should not pay that. They should pay it; but if it is subsequently shown on appeal to the appropriate tribunals that the person in question is a refugee and is rightfully admitted into this country, surely it cannot be considered just, fair or equitable that the carrier should still have to pay the fine. He has paid it already, but he must have the right to reclaim it because it has been levied on him before the circumstances have been fully established.<lb/>
It could be said that the fine should not be paid until all the paraphernalia of appeals for refugee status have been gone through. That is one way of doing it. But it can take a long time, so possibly this amendment is rather harsh on the carrier in that it says he should pay the fine immediately. However, all it does is to say that if subsequently it is found that that person is entitled to refugee status then the &#x00A3;1, 000 which has been extracted from the carrier shall be returned to him. I canot for the life of me see how the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, or the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, can say that that is an encouragement to bring in floods of would-be refugees and illegal immigrants. Surely it is simply a way of ensuring that natural justice prevails in this country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01213"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord, Lord Chitnis, told us that interesting story about Mr. Woods, which I now remember. If Mr. Woods were to do now what he did then, he would not be subject to this Bill. I think the noble Lord said that he was dressed up as an Irish priest and used a false Irish passport. So far as concerns the ordinary person, in the case of a shipping line&#x2014;I know in the case it was an aeroplane but I am concerned with the shipping line&#x2014;when the carrier looks at the false Irish passport he will not know that it is false. Therefore he, or his company, would not be subject to this Bill under those circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01214"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may ask the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, whether his contribution to this debate is that we should encourage people to dress up as Catholic priests and come over with really well-forged passports and that that is the way to come into this country. Is that his argument?</membercontribution></p>
<col>258</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01215"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, is far too serious about that. I was merely interested in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Chitnis, much of which dealt with the case. It seems to me that the case he quoted would not be relevant to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01216"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: Some of my best friends are lawyers but I can assure Members of the Committee that they should never trust lawyers on questions of this kind. There is only one issue of the faintest interest with which anybody in this Committee ought to be concerned. That is, that if a genuine refugee comes to this country we shall stand by our word and look after him. I think everybody wants that, our lawyer friends want it, but they are unable to distinguish fact from fiction. That is one of their great difficulties.<lb/>
There is only one point which needs to be established, and it is something which we must wait for. It is to see whether or not the alleged refugee is genuine. That may take time. When it is decided that he is genuine, then we can treat everybody as if he always had been genuine. Anybody but a lawyer can see that this is the only fair thing to do. The position seems so crystal clear that it should not take further argument. We want to receive genuine refugees here; we want to exclude non-genuine refugees. We bring in a law by which the carrier must make a superficial examination. If he does that badly, he pays &#x00A3;1, 000 until we find that his estimate was right. Please support this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01217"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: In order to help those members of the Committee who find the arguments advanced by both sides equally compelling, when the noble Earl comes to reply, can he say whether the words "on demand" (in line 15, page 1 of the Bill) have the meaning which my noble and learned friend Lord Denning attributed to them? In other words, does the Bill, as drafted, permit the Secretary of State discretion as to whether or not to impose the &#x00A3;1, 000 penalty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01218"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: Before dealing with the amendment, perhaps I may take up two points. The first is the article in the paper which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, was kind enough to warn me that he would mention. He knows better than I that even if you tell the press the truth sometimes it does not get printed; sometimes it is taken out of context; and sometimes when you do not tell them anything they may invent a story in order to keep a good headline in front of the Government.<lb/>
The public has never disguised the priority it attaches to a firm as well as a fair immigration control, and we have consistently shown ourselves ready to take action as may be necessary to achieve such control. This Bill, which is being fully discussed at Committee stage is one part of that policy. I am not going to speculate on what may happen in the future or indeed what may happen in an election campaign. I totally agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that we must protect the genuine refugee, as has been our great tradition in the past. We do not wish to disturb that, and my noble friend Lord Beaverbrook made that point on Second Reading when unfortunately I was not able to be here. Certainly I echo that today.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0138"/>
<col>259</col>
The second point I should like to raise is that when the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, said "Never trust a lawyer" presumably he was also referring to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, who supported his arguments. While I understand the thinking behind this amendment, I believe it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and nature of this Bill and the reality of the position of most refugees today who come to this country. It quite wrongly assumes that there is a necessary and inevitable connection between people granted refugee status and their arrival in this country without the proper documentation. This, sadly, is a common misapprehension.<lb/>
This Bill is intended to ensure that people coming to this country fulfil the basic documentary requirements which Parliament has approved. It is not intended to change those requirements or to introduce exemptions in particular cases. These requirements are that passengers should have a valid passport or some other document satisfactorily establishing identity and nationality or citizenship (for example, a travel document) and, for the nationals of those countries specified in the immigration rules, a valid visa. Parliament has rightly accepted that these requirements should not be waived for those who wish to come here to seek asylum.<lb/>
We cannot therefore accept the implication of this amendment that asylum seekers who subsequently are granted refugee status here should be encouraged or assisted to come to this country without the necessary documents. It is simply not the case that the great majority of refugees need to do so. The vast majority of those granted refugee status are already properly in this country. Much has been made in recent weeks of the situation of people who have arrived at United Kingdom ports without documents who are subsequently granted refugee status. This was taken up by the noble Lords, Lord Mishcon, Lord McNair, Lord Chitnis and Lord Walston, and also by the right reverend Prelate. We have made a check of applications granted from the ports last year to see if the facts bear out the concerns expressed. They do not. There were 27 such applications granted in 1986. Of those 15 did not have the right documents when they arrived here, but every single one of those people had come to the United Kingdom from a third country; not one of those 15 had come directly from the country from which they sought refuge. It would have been entirely open to them, therefore, to make proper and orderly arrangements for their future from that third country, either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.<lb/>
It is just not true, therefore, that genuine refugees need to flee to the United Kingdom directly from their home country without documentation. I cannot therefore recommend that the Committee supports an amendment which could encourage carriers in making that false assumption. There is no necessary link between passengers arriving without documents (which is the purpose of this Bill) and the grant of refugee status, which is an entirely separate matter.<lb/>
Nor do I think this amendment is fair on the carriers. It is right that carriers should be held responsible for making sure that a passenger they carry
<col>260</col>
has the documents which they know are required of people coming to this country. It is wrong that they should be encouraged, with the prospects of refunds, to try to form a judgment on whether a passenger without documents, who seeks passage on the grounds that he is an asylum seeker, is or is not a genuine refugee under the terms of the United Nations Convention. In such cases such a decision requires the most careful, delicate and well-informed judgments which no carrier can be expected to make. In practice what would happen is that either the carrier would ignore the saving since he could not hope to make the necessary judgment at the check-in counter&#x2014;in which case this amendment is a dead letter&#x2014;or he would accept all asylum seekers, whatever their circumstances, thus putting us right back where we started.<lb/>
We are therefore dealing with only a very small number of people who are granted refugee status, having applied at the ports. It is by no means certain that on the merits a carrier should have carried even these passengers from their safe third country to this country without the proper documents. A judgment would need to be made on these cases and it is not something that can be dealt with by an amendment of this sort. It is far better dealt with by the sensible use of the Home Secretary's discretion. Here I would confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Monson, that the wording of the Bill provides discretion to my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. He has already told the carriers that he will exercise that discretion in some of the cases that have already come to our ports. It is that very discretion that would take care of the exceptional circumstance raised by the noble Lord, Lord Chitnis.<lb/>
There may be a few very exceptional cases where someone had to flee their home country under the sort of circumstances envisaged in the 1951 convention; where they were in imminent and self-evident danger of their life; where they had no reasonable means of getting the required documents; where the United Kingdom was in the circumstances the only or clearly the most appropriate destination; and where the carrier could not reasonably make any checks with the United Kingdom authorities. Such circumstances are of course very rare, but the noble Lord, Lord Chitnis, mentioned one of them. If they were to happen, and a carrier were to make a compassionate response and accept the person for travel to the United Kingdom, I can assure the Committee that we would be ready to consider not making a charge on the carrier; and the Bill provides for that.<lb/>
We are dealing therefore with a very small number of cases where we are right to give no blanket guarantees and where we must consider all the circumstances to see if, whatever the final decision about a person's refugee status, we can accept that the carrier was right to take the passenger. This amendment is not required to deal with such unusual cases; they are much better dealt with by the use of the Home Secretary's discretion not to make a charge. This amendment would only risk carriers and their passengers being wrongly- and unnecessarily encouraged to think that there was some necessary and accepted link between the genuine refugee and the absence of documentation. That is not the case, and I
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0139"/>
<col>261</col>
invite the Committee to agree with me that it would be wrong to accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01219"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Earl sits down, when the noble Lord, Lord Chitnis, referred to the case to which the noble Earl has himself referred, he said that if the carrier had been prepared to take a risk in a good cause the Secretary of State in all likelihood would look on it with leniency. May I ask the noble Earl personally and as the Minister responsible whether, if British Caledonian had not been prepared to take that risk and Mr. Donald Woods had been left behind in the country from which he was trying to escape, the noble Earl would feel happy about that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01220"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: I do not think, on the hypothetical question put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Walston, that the amendment would have any bearing on the matter. In my view, the amendment would not affect the decision of the carrier. I think the amendment would affect the decision of the carrier in encouraging people to come to this country without the relevant documentation and I am sure the noble Lord would agree with me that that is not what we want to encourage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01221">4.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01222"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I am perfectly sure that the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, would agree with me that there are exceptions which prove the rule; and when he generalised in regard to lawyers in this Chamber he was looking with some degree of affection, I hope, at the exception which proved the rule.<lb/>
I turn immediately to the Minister, who answered this debate with his usual courtesy and clarity. I have interpreted his answer to my request, which arose out of the article in the <i>Independent</i> of 4th May by the political editor, that the Government wish to dissociate themselves from any slur contained in the article and that it is not the thought of any senior Ministers of his Government to cast any such slur in any election. I know perfectly well that he will pass on my observations and any of his own to the proper quarters. I leave the matter there.<lb/>
In the course of this debate we have heard reference made by the Minister and other Members of the Committee to the fact that the vast majority of refugees wising to come to these shores would not genuinely be without papers; such refugees would be very few. I echo the words of the right reverend Prelate about the great tradition that this country has always had in these matters and it is on behalf of those very few that I plead this afternoon with the Committee.<lb/>
With the greatest respect that I and all Members of this Chamber always give to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, perhaps I may say to him how fortunate he is, and indeed we all are, to have been born in this country and to be its citizens and how fortunate it is for him to be a judge of such repute in this country. He cannot possibly imagine, as I can, the situation of refugees fleeing from persecution who find it impossible to obtain adequate papers. It is on behalf of those people that this amendment is moved.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, when he says, with the sturdy eloquence that
<col>262</col>
he uses in speaking in favour of the Government, as he so often does, that he is arguing the other side of the coin and that in his view this measure is completely unnecessary because we are rewarding the carrier whereas the person who ought to have our sympathy is the refugee.<lb/>
In safeguarding the refugee perhaps he will imagine the case of a genuine refugee who for very good reason does not have adequate papers and who pleads with the carrier to save him. The carrier replies that he has been told that according to the Act which Parliament in its wisdom has passed there can be no exception made even though he is a genuine refugee. The carrier says, "I shall have to pay out &#x00A3;1, 000 for you and for every single refugee. I can rely on the discretion of the Home Office if you prove to be a genuine refugee but I do not know if I shall receive it. There is nothing in the Act to say that even if you are a genuine case I shall get back the money.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, speaks of the discretion of the Home Secretary and asks whether we do not have enough faith in the Home Secretaries of this country. I have abundant faith in them. However, it would be fiction (would it not?) if I were to imagine that the Home Secretary of whatever party would consider with the greatest of care the papers leading to a &#x00A3;1, 000 fine on carriers. They will be on his table. He will look at them and ask questions such as, "Has this matter been investigated? Is this man a genuine refugee? Are we going to have an administrative Act whatever government may be in power?"; and he will say, "The papers are out of order. We have to discourage this sort of thing". Then some official, perfectly properly in the course of his duty, will say, "There is a &#x00A3;1, 000 fine to be paid".<lb/>
How will the carrier even know whether refugee status has been granted so that he can ask for the discretion of the Secretary of State in order to get back his &#x00A3;1, 000? How is he to know that? He cannot be expected to be waiting on the refugee's doorstep to find out whether it is true. He will not even know where the refugee goes to. The only person who will know will be the Home Secretary, and under this provision, where genuine refugee status has been proved, the Home Secretary is put under an obligation to return the &#x00A3;1, 000.<lb/>
One may go through all sorts of tortuous arguments in order to try to prove the point. Usually what we have is a gut reaction, if I may use that expression, as to whether or not justice is being done. If the Committee will not think me rude in saying it, I believe that the gut reaction of every Member of this Chamber ought to be to pass this amendment, which will give justice to the true and genuine refugee and to the decent carrier who tries to help him where that is proved justifiable. I ask for the Committee's support for this amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01228">[<i>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 not moved</i>.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01229"><member>Lord Mishcon</member> moved Amendment No. 6:
<quote>Page 1, line 21, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() No liability shall be incurred under subsection (1) above in respect of any person whom the owners or agents are obliged to carry as a result of an order from a foreign Government.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01230">The noble Lord said: The amendment is intended to cover such a case as noble Lords will be familiar with; namely, where a deportation order is made and, this being a genuine government order, the carrier is required to convey the person who is subject to that deportation order. His papers may not be in order. Can it possibly be suggested that it is proper that the carrier should be fined the sum of &#x00A3;1, 000?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01231">It is no good&#x2014;I say this with the deepest respect to the Committee&#x2014;saying that this is one of the cases where the Secretary of State will exercise his discretion. It is surely not for us, when passing an Act of Parliament with some precision, to rely upon a discretion which can be exercised in any number of ways and which one knows perfectly well will be exercised in most cases through an official, as I have said before. It must be obvious that, where a carrier is conveying under an order from a foreign government to carry, it must be an exemption properly in the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01232"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: It may be helpful to the Committee, to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and to my noble friend the Minister if I say that I suspect that
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0141"/>
<col>265</col>
my Amendment No. 10 is very similar to this amendment. Perhaps I may speak to it under this heading to save time. The principle is as the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, has described it. However, I suggest with great humility that my wording is a little wider and may therefore cover rather greater ground than his does, and would encompass his, if the Committee were so disposed to like it.<lb/>
There must be moments when the carrier is put in this kind of impossible position, and it would not be appropriate for him to be charged. Surely it is not entirely right to include it within the discretion of the Secretary of State. I therefore hope that my noble friend the Minister may find that one or other of the amendments is one to which he could give great favour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01233"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I should always be happy to have the noble Lord associated with any amendment of mine. It is a strange experience, which I enjoy when it happens.<lb/>
I wonder whether the noble Lord would consider this&#x2014;and I am not making an argument by way of a reduction to an absurdity. If his wording prevailed, would it not be correct that were someone, for example, to be pushed on board ship, he would not be carried voluntarily? The carrier would be carrying him without proper papers, even though he might not be responsible for pushing him on the ship. Because according to this amendment such a person would not be carried voluntarily, there would be no liability on the carrier. The wording in my amendment seems to be more precise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01234"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: There seems to be one good reason why the Government should accept the amendment or why the Minister should give it careful consideration. There are surely cases under present regulations where the British Government themselves require the co-operation of carriers where people are being deported against their will. In such a case surely we would not welcome the kind of legislation from a foreign government that put penalties on the carrier for doing precisely that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01235"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: It would be convenient not to deal with the amendments together as they raise rather divergent principles. It would be confusing to try to deal with Amendments Nos. 6 and 10 at the same time, although to some degree they overlap in one sense. That sense is the matter of international comity, which in this regard means that a government of one sovereign state is not obliged to recognise the order of another sovereign state save as bound by convention or treaty to which both states are parties. I touched on this at Second Reading.<lb/>
In the absence of acceptance of the principle on a reciprocal basis by some further protocol to the convention on refugees by the signatory states, we could very soon, at the behest or order of a foreign government, become the dumping depot of deportees; and deportees not only from the signatory states, who are all member states of the Council of Europe, which is pretty wide, but states anywhere in the world. Speaking only to Amendment No. 6 at this stage, I respectfully suggest that this proviso or "savings
<col>266</col>
clause" is wholly unacceptable. It is wholly unacceptable that we should be bound in that way by the order of some foreign power. We have never, at any time, accepted, notwithstanding international conventions and protocols, any such erosion of sovereignty. The amendment assumes contravention by the carrier of Clause 1.<lb/>
Surely, if the carrier breaches Clause 1, he should be liable to pay the prescribed penalty subject to the discretion of the Secretary of State. For those reasons I oppose that amendment. There are other reasons why I wish to oppose Amendment No. 10.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01236"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a few words. What foreign government are we considering here? It may be a highly civilised one or it might be General Amin in East Africa. Is a shipping or airline company entitled to obey General Amin and carry someone to this country? No, I do not accept that. Let it be on a discretionary basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01237"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: I may be able to help the noble and learned Lord. As I understand it, Amendment No. 6 raises the question of those countries which have not ratified the UN convention on the status of refugees. They include Malaysia and Bangladesh. For that reason, I hope that the Government will look sympathetically at the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01238"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: The amendment before us offers a general exception when the right course is to exercise discretion in the light of the circumstances of each case. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon suggested that I might reply to him in such terms. While I can assure the Committee that the Government will exercise discretion sensibly when the carrier, through no fault of his own, really has no option but to comply with the orders of a foreign government, there may well be circumstances where it would be right to consider the carrier's liability. For example, the carrier might have been compelled to carry someone to this country because he had carried him without documents in the first place either from here or from another country.<lb/>
He might have been directed to effect removal here only because he had not complied with other directions&#x2014;for example, to take the passenger to another country. It is for that reason that the amendment lacks precision. I venture to suggest that it is quite unusual to find an amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that lacks precison. This one, however, lacks his usual clarity.<lb/>
It would be possible for an unscrupulous carrier to argue that he had been compelled to carry someone when that was not really so. Given the many different systems of immigration control operating throughout the world, it would be quite impossible for the immigration service to check out such claims. I am sure the Committee will agree that one can envisage circumstances in which arrangements could be made between such unscrupulous operators and dishonest officials overseas in which it would be represented that the carrier had no alternative but to carry the passenger.<lb/>
Should that come within the ambit of the amendment? It illustrates how widely the amendment
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0142"/>
<col>267</col>
is drafted. Therefore, it is not an amendment that I can recommend the Committee to accept. But that is not to say that discretion could not, or would not be exercised in appropriate cases. I can only confirm what I said on the previous amendment; namely that such discretion has already been exercised. There will be, and already have been, cases in which the carrier can show that without any fault on his part he was compelled to carry someone, for example, as a deportee from another country. In such cases discretion has been, and will continue to be, exercised. I hope that that solves the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and that he will be able to agree with me that discretion is the right way forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01239"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: It is very difficult to answer a charming speech of that kind with anything other than charm. However, I am not so capable in that respect as the noble Earl. I wish that I could catch his charm, from across the Front Benches.<lb/>
I feel that I owe it to the Committee to answer a few of the arguments that have been advanced. I shall do so very briefly. As I understood it, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, warned us when he spoke on a previous amendment that one should not confuse the case of the carrier and the person conveyed. However with great respect, I rather felt that in his contribution on this amendment, that was exactly what he was doing.<lb/>
No one is saying, as regards this amendment, that a person who is carried in that way and who arrives on these shores shall be admitted to these shores. We are not saying that at all. Indeed that is the answer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning. We are not saying that a host of deportees arriving here should be allowed in because they are deportees under the order of General Amin&#x2014;not a lamented memory&#x2014;or anybody else.<lb/>
If there is an order&#x2014;I concede that maybe the words "valid order" should be inserted&#x2014;from a foreign government, what is the carrier to do? If it looks like a perfectly genuine order, should he still be liable for the penalty? The only answer seems to be the old one that the Secretary of State, in his all-pervading wisdom, mercy, righteousness and so on, will obviously not levy a penalty in that case. Parliament is not doing its duty by giving such a wide answer.<lb/>
As the noble Earl was courteous enough to point out the imprecision of the amendment in many respects, I shall study what he has said to see whether I should bring the matter forward on Report. Alternatively, I may be so convinced by what he has said that there will be no necessity to do so. In those circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01240">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01241"><member>Lord McNair</member> moved Amendment No. 7:
<quote>Page 1, line 21, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() No liability shall be incurred under subsection (1) above where a carrier has reason to assume that to refuse to carry would thereby place the intended passenger in grave or immediate danger.").</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01242">The noble Lord said: This is the amendment to which I referred obliquely when we were discussing Amendment No. 3. Like Amendment No. 3, it is the
<col>268</col>
sort of utterly minimal concession that the Government could make in order to render the Bill less objectionable in its incidental effects while keeping its intended purposes intact.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01243">We failed to persuade the Committee to approve Amendment No. 3; so we shall try again with this one. I must ask Members of the Committee in Hamlet's words to,
<quote>"look here upon this picture and on that"</quote>
and to keep in mind the stark contrast between the kind of life we are lucky enough to be able to live in this country and the lethally turbulent conditions in which all too many people cling to life in some less fortunate places. That applies to places where a Pinochet, a Pol Pot or an Idi Amin may come to power at any moment and face their opponents with an immediate and simple choice: escape or die.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01244">I understand that we may shortly be enjoying a general election in this happy land. Some of us will get very excited. Blood pressures will rise and adrenalin will flow. If someone or other is unlucky enough to get in the way of a well-aimed tomato we shall see banner headlines in the tabloids.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01245">It would take a little more than that to wake up a news editor in, for example, Beirut where tomatoes are for eating and where Kalashnikov rifles are about as easy to get one's hands on as are ball-point pens in this country. I do not wish to labour the point. I merely wish to remind the Committee that those situations of grave and immediate danger have arisen in the past, exist at this moment and that, in unforeseeable places and at quite unpredictable times, they are all too certain to occur again in the future. It is with such circumstances that this amendment is concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01246">When one of these crises suddenly occurs, what is our attitude to be? There may be panic and there will be deadly fear. Some noble Lords may have seen the fear of death in someone else's eyes. It is not a sight that you forget. If a girl somewhere on a check-in desk at an airport is so moved by that sight that she sells a ticket to someone who has been quite unable to obtain a passport and manages to reach this country, what should we do?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01247">The Home Office by, I think, not giving itself enough time to think has put itself in the ridiculous position of saying that our response to the arrival of that wretched person should be to ask to see his papers and, finding them defective, to fine the carrier who brought him here &#x00A3;1, 000. I know that the Home Secretary does not have to impose the fine, and I am sure I am right in assuming that no conceivable Home Secretary would impose the fine. But how is that girl on the check-in desk at God knows where to know that? She may be supporting a large family by working for the airline. She may not dare to risk her job by disobeying the order she will have received from her employers: "No passport, no ticket". She may send the man away to his death.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01248">This amendment seeks to build into the rules a very small safety valve for these occasions of appalling danger, and with this minimal change in the Bill my imagined check-in girl will, with luck, have had a telephone call from her employer saying, "The no-passport, no-ticket rule is suspended during the present emergency". She will sell the threatened
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0143"/>
<col>269</col>
passenger a ticket, and a life which would otherwise have been casually, meaninglessly, rubbed out will be saved I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01249">5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01250"><member>Viscount Tonypandy</member><membercontribution>: I rise to speak in support of the amendment that has been proposed. I wish to bring to the attention of the Committee an experience that I had when I was responsible as Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Home Office for dealing with questions of immigration. At a time when there was a great deal of immigration into our country&#x2014;I am talking of 1964&#x2014;very little came to the Ministers, compared with the number of cases that were dealt with by officials. But we are, I believe, in grave danger of imposing on a carrier a sense of dreadful responsibility if he knows that a person is in grave danger.<lb/>
I recall in my time in office my private secretary coming in to me when I was in the room of the Home Secretary, the late Lord Stow-Hill, to tell me that a man who had been sent back that day had cut his throat in the aeroplane. Apart from the horror of fearing that it was somebody whom I had rejected&#x2014;I soon found out that it was not&#x2014;and the horror of the tragedy for the man concerned, I thought of the poor immigration officer who, having looked at the papers and not being satisfied, said, "No, back you go." If we know that people are in danger, are we to say "No, you may not bring them"?<lb/>
We are proud of the heritage of this land and the whole world looks on us as a country where true refugees can look to a land of liberty, a land where, above all, we have prided ourselves through the years that our shores will protect from tyranny people who are seeking to escape.<lb/>
Amendment No. 7 is to my mind an improvement on Amendment No. 3, which I supported in the Lobby. But I hope and pray that Her Majesty's Government will realise that they are touching a tender nerve with the British people on this matter. People who have a great sense of of responsibility and who are accustomed to public service fear this effort to make sure that we are protected from too much immigration&#x2014;which I think is the wish of our people. I believe that they want to be protected against great crowds coming in again, because we cannot absorb them. But our people have a sense of decency and their instinct tells them that, when we know that people are in danger, it is not in line with our tradition to slam the door in their faces and behave as though we do not care.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01251"><member>Viscount Buckmaster</member><membercontribution>: I also strongly support this amendment and I want to deal particularly with Ugandans. Various noble Lords have mentioned Idi Amin as though he was still in power, so let me remind the Committee that he was overthrown in 1980. I know of several Ugandans now living in Britain who were suffering severe persecution in the Amin reign. This was in the mid-1970s when I was working in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office after a spell in Uganda.<lb/>
Those people were suffering in an appalling way. I shall not go into details, but those noble Lords who
<col>270</col>
have had experience of countries like that where such persecution is rife can appreciate the mental and physical torment that they were in. They were, in the words of the amendment, "in grave or immediate danger" and I would add the words "of their lives". I want to mention particularly that those were ordinary decent, upright, law-abiding citizens. But unfortunately they happened to belong to tribes opposed to Amin.<lb/>
In four cases with which I was personally associated, they had managed to get to Britain on a Ugandan Airways flight without proper travel documents. Ultimately, after protracted intervention on my part, they were granted exceptional leave to remain and two of them were finally granted asylum. Of those four, two have now established themselves in businesses in the United Kingdom and one is working for the British Refugee Council.<lb/>
The point I want to make is that had those people remained in Uganda, I have no doubt that they would have been either killed, as many of their close relations were, or imprisoned in such ghastly conditions that death would probably be preferable to such a fate. So I feel, as my noble friend Lord Tonypandy said, that we must draw on our reputation as a humanitarian country. We must give all the consideration we can to such cases, even though we have not been familiar with the backgrounds. I very much hope that the Minister will give due consideration to my remarks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01252"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I have been greatly moved by the speeches that have been made. Like all Members of the Committee, I wish to extend the traditional hospitality of our shores to those who may be in grave danger. However, on a realistic plane, how can that be done? How can we accommodate all those unfortunate people who may be in grave danger in all parts of the world? Is it really suggested that the amendment as it stands can be operative from a practical point of view? Presumably, in some cases&#x2014;perhaps in all cases&#x2014;it will be the carrier who has to assume a grave and immediate danger from what he is told by a passenger. I assume that the carrier would then have to consider that there is no other place in the world where the intending passenger will be safe.<lb/>
It is with the utmost regret that I speak as I do. I should wish to accommodate in this country everybody who is in grave danger. But I do not regard this as a minimal concession; I think it is a most important concession. The amendment, if carried, will drive the proverbial coach and four through the intendment of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01253"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, does the Committee a service by suggesting that all the refugees of the world are going to come to this country. Past records and statistics show clearly that a very small minority of refugees have done so. It is also relevant to the amendment that the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture is one of the numerous organisations that are highly concerned about the Bill.<lb/>
Our doctors and experts on rehabilitation have established a considerable expertise in the very difficult field of victims of torture. In the post-war period, we
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0144"/>
<col>271</col>
have seen torture exercised on quite a large scale, even in Europe (in such countries as Greece), in countries which wish to become members of the EC (such as Turkey), and in the psychiatric hospitals of Russia. Those are the kinds of cases to which the amendment will apply. I hope that the Government will be able to look at it more sympathetically than they did previous amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01254"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I can well appreciate the telling cases which my noble friend Lord Tonypandy and others have mentioned. However, those are individual cases, and this amendment goes much further. It goes so far that it opens the way to abuse. The words,
<quote>"carrier has reason to assume"</quote>
mean that a receptionist in a far country who checks in the passenger must assume that a refusal to carry the passenger will place the intended passenger in grave or immediate danger. What evidence will the receptionist have of the grave or immediate danger except the word of the passenger? It is too big a responsibility for the receptionist to judge grave and immediate danger. Surely the sensible thing is to allow the passenger to go on and then to fine the aircraft company within discretion. I should have thought that, however well intentioned, the amendment goes too far.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01255"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: I should like to support this amendment as strongly as I can. I was moved by the opening speech of the noble Lord, Lord McNair. It set the arguments before us very powerfully. I must confess that I do not understand the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. He says, "How can we accommodate all the unfortunate people from other parts of the world?" I thought that the object of the Bill, as explained by the Minister and others, was not to keep out genuine refugees and those who are in grave or immediate danger. Am I wrong on that point?<lb/>
I should like an assurance from the Minister as to the purpose of the Bill. If we are concerned, on the one hand, with the potential numbers of those who might be considered to be in grave or immediate danger, or if we are concerned, on the other hand, with abuse, those matters put a different complexion on the Bill. I thought that the Bill was designed to correct abuse but not to keep out genuine refugees. In that case I think it has been admitted on all sides of the Committee that we will be going against a long, honourable and humane tradition in this country.<lb/>
As to the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, about opening the way to abuse, there is always the possibility of abuse in all legislation. We are always dealing with problems of abuse; I have no doubt that that will continue to be so in the future whatever the form in which the Bill finally goes through. However, the great point is where one puts the emphasis. Is the emphasis simply on guarding against abuse, or is it also on allowing for those who are in grave or immediate danger to be protected in some way in this country?<lb/>
I know that this is not the place for anecdotal evidence on this grave matter. However, Uganda was mentioned, and I could not help remembering that some years ago I spent a study leave in East Africa. It
<col>272</col>
was at the height of the Amin r&#x00E9;gime. I was staying at a small college in Nairobi. The only other occupants were refugees from Uganda. I was standing next to a young man making a cup of tea one afternoon. He had reasonable English and in passing conversation with him I asked about his family. I elicited the information that every single one of them had been killed; he was the only one who had escaped.<lb/>
It is people such as those that one has in mind when one thinks of grave or immediate danger. I found very puzzling the words of the Minister when he gave the numbers of persons who had been granted asylum in this country and said that they had all come from a safe third country and not from countries where such problems are taking place. That indicated to me how very difficult it is for anybody from those countries to get directly to Britain in any case. Do we wish to shut those possible loopholes to people who are in danger of their lives?<lb/>
I found the argument of the noble Lord, Lord McNair, entirely convincing as to what the effect might be on airline operators in other countries who come across circumstances of that kind. I should not wish to be a party this afternoon to anything which closed a vital loophole to people who are in grave or immediate danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01256"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: I should like to support the amendment. In doing so, may I reply to a point made by my noble and learned friend Lord Denning. As regards the Vietnamese boat people, they would be adrift on the ocean. There would be no question of anyone checking them in at a desk. If the captain of a British ship is hesitant about picking them up in consequence of the Bill, as seems likely, what will happen to them? If they head back to Communist Vietnam, it is all too likely that they will be thrown into a concentration camp or worse. On the other hand, if they sail on, they will probably, as is statistically true, be drowned in a typhoon, eaten by sharks or robbed, raped and murdered by pirates.<lb/>
Of all the amendments on the Marshalled List today I think this is the most essential. I hope that even noble Lords who support the Bill in general&#x2014;as I do and as I am sure most of the British public do&#x2014;will agree to this small but important modification. I say that not least because it is the one amendment which I believe has majority support among members of the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01257"><member>Lord Bonham-Carter</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to intervene at any length but I am prompted to do so by the words spoken by the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, in regard to the tradition of this country in welcoming refugees and providing asylum. I briefly remind the Minister that in the last century there was a famous diplomatic incident when a bomb was thrown at Napoleon III. It was found that it had "Made in Birmingham" on it. It was believed to have been thrown by a follower of Mazzini. A grave diplomatic incident arose. Lord Palmerston, who was not easily frightened, decided to introduce legislation which limited to a very slight degree the right of asylum in this country. His government fell on that principle. It was replaced by the government of Lord Derby, and that, for the time being, was the end of that.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0145"/>
<col>273</col>
We have a tradition of which we should be extremely proud. I do not want to add to the eloquent words of my noble friend Lord McNair and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, or to the telling point just made by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, about the boat people, but I remind noble Lords opposite, who should not need to be reminded, of the traditions of this country which their party always claimed to preserve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01258"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: Like my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway and many others, I too was moved by the speeches which have been made, and particularly that of the noble Lord, Lord McNair, in moving the amendment. However, I believe that we must look at this matter with a very close eye. This amendment would create a wholly unreasonable expectation on the carrier&#x2014;an expectation which is ultimately untestable. Indeed, it was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, who said that carriers cannot be expected to make careful judgments on whether an individual passenger is or is not in grave or immediate danger. I have to agree with the noble and learned Lord.<lb/>
It would be quite unreasonable to ask people at the check-in desk to try to do that. Further, how could that judgment be tested? It would mean that carriers would have to accept any passenger who claimed to be in danger simply to cover themselves. The carrier would simply have to say that he thought it was a reasonable assumption in order to relieve himself of any liability, and that would be very difficult to test after the event.<lb/>
The nub of the problem is that we have become confused by what is meant by the term "grave and immediate danger". Those are the words which make this amendment so much wider in scope than Amendment No. 3, which the Committee has already rejected. Grave and immediate danger is not the criterion for refugee status which some Members of the Committee have indicated that it means. It is worth while reminding ourselves of the 1951 United Nations Convention, which states:
<quote>"A refugee is a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country."</quote>
The words "grave and immediate danger" and the cases that some Members of the Committee have given this afternoon are so much wider than that definition. Indeed, some of the cases mentioned this afternoon might have fallen within that definition; but that is something we have already decided in Committee. For this amendment to be accepted the words "grave and immediate danger" take the whole ambit of what we are considering much wider than the United Nations Convention on Refugees. It affects everyone who thinks they might be in grave danger or at risk. One can think of a number of countries&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01259"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. I cannot follow his argument. A well-founded fear of persecution would include "grave or immediate danger". I would regard that as being wider than "grave or immediate danger". Perhaps the noble Earl can explain how these two are
<col>274</col>
related, because "grave or immediate danger" is certainly comprehended in the words he quoted from the United Nations Convention on Refugees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01260"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: This is where I beg to differ with the right reverend Prelate, if I may be permitted to do so. The words "grave and immediate danger" are not the criteria for refugee status that I read out. Although one has deep sadness and regret that many countries are involved in civil wars or, in some instances, have been invaded by opposing forces, people in such countries might consider themselves to be in grave or immediate danger; for example, in Afghanistan, certain areas of the Far East or, indeed, in Beirut. They do not necessarily constitute being potential refugees within the definition of the United Nations Convention. That is the important point that I believe has become confused this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01261"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I used the word "refugee" in my speech. I am speaking about people who are in grave or immediate danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01262"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: What I am saying is that that is much wider than the United Nations Convention. We have already decided on that. The amendment is wider and I cannot recommend the Committee to accept it. It would create an expectation that carriers could make judgments or assumptions that they are clearly not in a position to make. Furthermore, that decision having been made it would be extremely hard for it to be properly tested. Consequently this amendment gives enormous scope for abuse and I am sure that is something the Committee do not want.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01263"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has not answered the point I made about the Vietnamese boat people. If the master of a vessel comes across a boat with 40 refugees in it who are still alive, is he to risk a fine of &#x00A3;40, 000 or is he to sail on? I suspect he would probably do the latter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01264"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: In such a case there is the law of the sea and there is also the discretion of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary which is built into the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, referred to the Vietnamese boat people, and the Government can be justifiably proud of their record in that respect. Indeed, I hope that in the not too distant future there will be another announcement which will please the noble Lord, Lord Monson. Therefore I do not believe that the amendment affects the position outlined by the noble Lord. As I said, the amendment widens the scope for abuse.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01265"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: I must take up the Minister on that. It is a question of the meaning of words. There is no ill-intention involved. To say that someone is in immediate danger is a narrower provision than to say that he is in danger of persecution if he goes home. It is a narrower definition. Many refugees who, if they went home, would be in danger are not in danger now. Therefore to my mind the argument put forward by the noble Earl is entirely wrong.</membercontribution></p>

<col>275</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01266"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: I regret to say that to my mind the argument is entirely right. I disagree with the noble Lord. This is where we must both agree, as non-lawyers, that we need a lawyer to be present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01267">5.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01268"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: He appears&#x0021; A great many speeches have been made on this amendment, of which if I may humbly say this as an ordinary Member of this Chamber, I shall always be proud when I remember this Bill. If I may say so it was the House of Parliament at its best, because it was realistically expressing our people's great traditions. I entirely agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, that our people feel that enough is enough with regard to immigration. I do not know that that is a happy situation for any civilised country to put up with, remembering the old wish of Ernest Bevin: that he would live to see the day when passports were unnecessary and people could go where they wanted. We all know that that is a Utopia still far removed from our vision.<lb/>
Our people in saying, "Enough is enough" will never turn their backs on those who are in genuine fear of their lives and of danger. The noble Earl said that we had to keep a close eye on this amendment. I know that he will forgive my saying that he appears to have kept a closed eye on this amendment, because he has not seen the wood for the trees.<lb/>
To advance on behalf of the Government an answer to this plea on behalf of those who are in immediate and real danger of their lives, "Oh well, that is a very much wider concept", as has already been pointed out, "than 'the genuine fear of persecution' ", is to turn logic and words on their heads.<lb/>
I can walk abroad and say that I am in fear of persecution. Many people have a persecution complex. They feel that they do not obtain positions that they should because of persecution. They think that they do not receive rewards that they should because of persecution. There is no doubt that when someone is convinced, as the carrier will have to be, that there is a genuine fear of danger to life or immediate danger, that imposes a much narrower concept than the definition at which we have been looking in the convention. I was surprised that the noble Earl quoted it, because I thought that it was something that he would leave out of his argument upon the basis that we have to admit many refugees, who are not genuinely in immediate fear of danger or death, by virtue of the fact that we are bound by the convention, which has a much wider definition than the proposal we are considering.<lb/>
I hope that we shall be realistic about this. When such words are used, everyone knows that in most cases it will not be an individual case; it will arise because officials of the carrier company are well aware that a dangerous crisis has arisen with regard to a section of people. If we do not pass this amendment, there may be an official, very likely a junior official, who is convinced of the truth of the case of those who are banging at the door&#x2014;one can well imagine it at a ticket office&#x2014;and begging to be allowed in in order that they and their families may be saved. Some of them may push their families in front of them and say, "Don't take me, but take my children". That official will have to take the responsibility if this amendment
<col>276</col>
is not carried. He will not be able to get hold of the chairman or the managing director of the company. He will have to say, "Am I going to get the sack if I admit these 20 people? I do not have &#x00A3;20, 000. My company will be landed with a &#x00A3;20, 000 penalty. I do not have the money. I would willingly give it if I had it. Will my company sack me? They will point out that this was not an exception in a Bill when it went through the English Parliament&#x2014;the British Parliament." I looked at the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, who was angry with me for a moment, but ultimately I said "the British Parliament".<lb/>
Unless we pass this amendment, that would be a responsibility that could not be taken on by an official. The door will be barred. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, then came back once more with the illogicality, with which he is not usually associated, of mixing up carrier and passenger.<lb/>
The Bill does not say that everyone carried whom the carrier believes to be in fear of grave or immediate danger shall be admitted by the United Kingdom. It merely prevents a carrier being fined if he carries such a person in that genuine belief.<lb/>
I have an idea that this is an amendment that appeals to the mind, and rather more particularly to the heart, of everyone in the Committee. I am sure that it is with that feeling of conscience that we shall face the Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01269"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: May I&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01270"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl is stopping me to say that there is no need for a Division, I am delighted to give way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01271"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: No. I do not go that far. The noble Lord would not expect me to withdraw what I firmly believe and what I have said to him. Does he agree that the case he advanced, of a sudden crisis blowing up and people coming to the airport, is a matter on which the Government, rather than the carrier, should take the initiative and say, "Yes, we agree that there is a crisis: we will use the discretion that is provided for the Home Secretary"? The onus is on the Government, not on the carrier.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01272"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I wish crises took place in the world in a way which gave the ambassador to the country concerned (on the basis that we had an ambassador there, and had not withdrawn him because of what was happening in that country) time to communicate with the Foreign Office; that the Foreign Office had time to communicate with the Home Office; that the Home Office had time to communicate with all the carriers in that country and that those carriers had time to communicate with their junior officials and say, "We have heard from the United Kingdom Government. You can now let these people go". Crises do not occur in that way. I wish to Heaven that they did&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01273"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord sits down, does he accept that by this amendment, whether it be right or wrong, he is extending the convention commitments of Her Majesty's Government beyond that convention? Does he
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0147"/>
<col>277</col>
appreciate that my noble friend the Minister was totally right when he said that, under our international obligations through that convention, which are accepted reciprocally by the other signatory states, it is for the Secretary of State and not for the carrier to exercise his discretion? What the noble Lord is doing by this amendment is pre-empting the whole situation. Although there is a sound humanitarian background and a good case has been made, does he accept that as a matter of reality he is vastly extending Her Majesty's Government's obligations under public international law?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01274"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is, most unusually, mentally confused. If it be as a result of my having talked to your Lordships for too long, I humbly apologise to him. His mental confusion is in the following direction: first, as the noble Lord, Lord McNair, said in a clear intervention, he was not necessarily talking about refugees as described in the convention; he was talking about people who stand in grave or immediate danger, as mentioned in the amendment.<lb/>
Secondly, the confusion which the noble Lord insists upon injecting into this place (I do not think that the Committee will accept it) is that he is talking about the duty of countries which have signed the convention to admit people as refugees. That is not this Bill. If this Bill dealt with refugees, the Committee would have many amendments before it which I believe the Committee would want to have before it. They are not before it because the Bill does not deal with the admission of refugees; it deals with the penalties upon carriers. That is the complete answer to the noble Lord. I hope he will accept it as such.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01275"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I accept that as no answer at all. It misses the whole point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01276"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: If I have missed the point, in spite of the fact that I may be imposing upon the patience of the Committee as the noble Lord will do, I invite him kindly to make the point that I have not answered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01277"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: It is precisely the same point in the same form that was made already. In the circumstances of the debate, the noble Lord has not appreciated it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01278"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: Those vague words are not worthy of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01282">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01283">5.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01284">[<i>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 not moved</i>.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01285"><member>Lord Mottistone</member> moved Amendment No. 10:
<quote>Page 1, line 24, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() No liability shall be incurred under subsection (1) in respect of any person not carried voluntarily.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01286">The noble Lord said: I attempted to expedite the work of the Committee by moving Amendment No. 10 with Amendment No. 6. However, the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, did not like it; and the Minister did not reply. I shall therefore very briefly present the amendment to the Committee again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01287">The function of Amendment No. 10 is to deal with the point raised in Amendment No. 6. However, it also covers the situation which might arise when there are stowaways or people smuggled on board ferries without the knowledge of the carrier in the backs of cars or lorries. It does not seem reasonable that there should be an automatic liability on the carrier that he may be fined for carrying such people when he has had absolutely no control over their entry into his ship or aircraft. Therefore this amendment, simple as it is, is worthy of inclusion in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01288"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I oppose this amendment because if a carrier has a person on board not carried voluntarily in the sense that he is a stowaway who has paid no fare, I do not understand why his presence should not be discovered on arrival in the United Kingdom by the ship or by aircraft before he disembarks by the very type of routine check of tickets issued which any passenger has to produce before he is allowed to leave the ship or aircraft or indeed to leave the office accommodation of the carrier in the United Kingdom. I do not understand why there should be no obligation upon the carrier to carry out the form of routine checks which should be done with the safeguards to ensure compliance with Clause 1.<lb/>
But there is an injustice. I ask my noble friend the Minister whether this can be considered, although I oppose the amendment as such. The injustice is that if the carrier has used all reasonable diligence (and can satisfy the Secretary of State that he has done so) to conduct that sort of check as is envisaged to ensure compliance with Clause 1, and the wily stowaway has evaded the checks and has evaded detection then (speaking personally only for myself) it seems that the
<col>280</col>
carrier ought to be excused and there ought to be no liability. But that is not what this amendment proposes. That is one thing. But it is quite another to suggest, as the amendment proposes, that because a person is not carried voluntarily, the carrier should be able to land him without liability in the UK under Clause 1.<lb/>
We have touched upon the deportee situation before to some degree. Is a deportee a person not carried voluntarily? It is thought not, except where the carrier is subject to an order from a foreign court where the carrier, for example, in some of the Iron Curtain countries is a state carrier which is obliged to follow the orders it is given. This has been raised in another amendment which the Committee has already considered.<lb/>
Where the carrier is subject to an order from a foreign government&#x2014;again, because such a person is not carried voluntarily&#x2014;there is, nonetheless, no reason why he should be landed in the United Kingdom without liability under Clause 1&#x2014;having regard to the matter on which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and I had a somewhat inconclusive discussion a moment ago that save by convention or treaty the government of one sovereign state is not, according to the comity of nations, obliged to recognise the order of another foreign state.<lb/>
The amendment was first circulated by the General Council of British Shipping on 3rd March 1987. If accepted by the Committee, it would permit stowaways and deportees to be landed in the United Kingdom by carriers. It would or could in effect work much mischief. Therefore I respectfully suggest that it is not acceptable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01289"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: Is not the short answer to this amendment that the Minister can deal with it at his discretion and would remit any fine?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01290"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: As my noble friend who moved this amendment has said we have already discussed a somewhat similar amendment to remove responsibility from carriers who were obliged to carry a passenger as a result of the order of a foreign government and some of the arguments are the same. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, added one of his own when we discussed it earlier when he said he did not like Amendment No. 10. It would be unsatisfactory to leave such a saving in this legislation. It would not be right for a carrier to be able to claim that he was required to carry a passenger when it might be very difficult indeed to substantiate such a claim. How would it be possible to know after the event the basis of the requirement, who issued the instruction, whether it had or could have been challenged, or what the alternatives were? It would be a recipe for dissension and dispute as it would require a very difficult subjective judgment to be made; namely, was the carriage voluntary? It appears to be enough under the terms of the amendment for the carrier to do no more than state that the passenger was not carried voluntarily for responsibility to be removed. Indeed, it might be enough for the carrier to argue that if he had known the true status of the passenger he would not have carried him so that the carriage was indeed not voluntary. A blanket provision like this creates too
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0149"/>
<col>281</col>
dangerous a loophole since it can take no account of individual circumstances.<lb/>
Nor do I think that we should be accepting that the carrier can do nothing to deter stowaways. Certainly it would be very hard always to distinguish at the immigration desk the difference between a passenger who may have destroyed his ticket and a stowaway, particularly when ferry companies find it difficult to produce passenger lists.<lb/>
These are matters which need to be considered in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. There may of course be circumstances when a carrier is obliged to carry a passenger by another government's authorised agencies and we accept that the carrier had no reasonable option but to comply. There may also be circumstances where it would be unreasonable to charge a carrier for a stowaway because, for example, we are satisfied the carrier had done everything reasonable to ensure he only brought in people authorised to use his service. If so, I assure the Committee, particularly my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway who raised this matter, that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary would use the discretion available and would consider not imposing a charge. This is a matter, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, so succinctly put it, where discretion rather than legislation is the best course because the circumstances are central to the decision.<lb/>
While I cannot recommend these amendments, I assure the Committee that the Government fully recognise the concerns of the shipping companies. We have had a number of meetings with their representatives to go through the detail with them. My right honourable friend the Minister of State has seen them and senior members of the immigration service have had a number of meetings with them and offered written advice and guidance. Such guidance is readily available to the airline companies and we are ready to use discretion sensibly when it would be clearly right not to charge a carrier and to take careful account of any representations they may make.<lb/>
At this stage I divert from the amendment to pay tribute to the immigration service. Whether or not one agrees with the principles of the Bill, the immigration service has gone out of its way to be as helpful and co-operative to the carriers, to give them as much advice by means of video recordings, letters and other methods to make sure that when the Bill becomes an Act, as I hope it will shortly, it will operate as smoothly as possible. I believe the whole Committee would like to join me in paying tribute and giving thanks to the immigration service for the job that it has undertaken recently.<lb/>
In the circumstances I have described and with the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, I fear that I cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment. I know that it will be a disappointment to my noble friend, but I really cannot accept it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01291"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: I am most grateful to my noble friend the Minister for giving such a full reply on this amendment and for covering all the ground and the points raised by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, whose support on a particular point I much

appreciated even if he disagreed with practically everything else.<lb/>
It is reassuring to hear not only that the Secretary of State will use his discretion in appropriate cases such as stowaways and presumably people who are smuggled in the backs of cars but also that the immigration service is now taking such trouble to help the carriers. It is probably fairly easy for the airlines in the broad sense but it will be an enormous load for the ro-ro ferries which unfortunately will have to adjust to this. However, having said that, my noble friend's answer is satisfactory and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01294"><member>Lord Mishcon</member> moved Amendment No. 11:
<quote>Page 1, line 26, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() The Secretary of State shall by Order in Council establish an appeal tribunal to which carriers found liable to a penalty under this Act may appeal.").</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01295">The noble Lord said: On so many occasions this afternoon mention has been made by the Minister and others&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01296">certainly the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, has mentioned it&#x2014;that one has to leave to the discretion of the Secretary of State whether or not a penalty is to be exacted. Instances have been given where it is thought that the Secretary of State would exercise his discretion in a proper manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01297">When we have considered the question of a penalty being imposed we have always taken the view that there should be a right for the person against whom the penalty is charged to appeal. When I put down this amendment, I wondered what would be the appropriate place to address such an appeal. I flirted with the idea, which I believe was raised in another place, of a county court being the appropriate place. It seemed to me that once one puts a civil court in charge of an appeal of this kind the limitations would normally be that the Secretary of State had not exercised his discretion in a proper manner or that he had not gone through the proper procedural steps. Judges do not like&#x2014;and there is a whole line of precedents in regard to this&#x2014;to substitute themselves for the user of the discretion vested in Parliament so far as concerns a Minister.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01298">I therefore moved away from the idea of the civil court and putting the judge as a substitute for the Minister to exercise his discretion and I felt that there ought to be a tribunal. Then I said to myself that it is not very sensible to set up a special tribunal to deal with a few appeals&#x2014;one hopes there would have to be only a few appeals&#x2014;that might take place in the course of a year. So my final decision was this, and I hope the Committee will think it to be a sensible and reasonable one: there ought to be a right of appeal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01299">The Government most likely have thought about this and may well decide to put forward, if there is to be an appeal, an appropriate tribunal, an appropriate couple of people whoever they may be who would have independent minds on this matter. I thought that the sensible thing to do would be to put down this amendment at Committee stage as a probing amendment, leaving the Minister of State to reply by telling us why he thought, if that was his view&#x2014;I hope
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0150"/>
<col>283</col>
it is not&#x2014;there should not be any appeal at all; or constructively to tell us that if there is to be an appeal then a certain body may be an appropriate one in which this appeal right should be invested.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01300">Before I sit down I should like from these Benches to join in the tribute the Minister paid to the immigration service. Many&#x2014;indeed most&#x2014;of the officials of the immigration service are kindly and courteous. I know that the Minister will agree with me that the minority against whom from time to time complaints are made are very much a minority. One wants to see that minority become smaller still as the years go by.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01301">If this Bill finds its place in the statute book&#x2014;and the Minister will have a chance to deal with this point, if not at this stage then at another stage if such a stage is reached&#x2014;I hope that the Secretary of State himself will see that, in regard to all the matters that have been mentioned where sympathetic consideration has been given by the Government because they see that there can be hard cases, guidelines will be given to the immigration service so that when officials have to come to a decision with regard to a carrier or indeed make a recommendation, this will be done upon lines that at least would meet with the approval of the Committee, having regard to the various matters we have raised this afternoon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01302"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, who puts this forward as a probing amendment, perhaps I may briefly suggest to him that no appeal to a tribunal is necessary, and for this simple reason. Here you have the Secretary of State. It is true that he must exercise his discretion but it is also true that he must exercise it in accordance with the principles and the basic concept of natural justice. If he does not do that then the Divisional Court will set aside the exercise of the discretion.<lb/>
This amendment reflects, I think, an amendment proposed by the General Council of Shipping on 23rd March 1987. At that time it was suggested that it would be an appeal to a court. It is now proposed that there should be an appeal to a tribunal. With the greatest respect, is it not very much to be doubted whether an appeal is necessary?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01303"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: I should like briefly to support this amendment and to express my hope that the noble Earl will at least say that he will consider it sympathetically and carefully.<lb/>
We all know that the Secretary of State has discretion. We also know that the present Secretary of State is a man of the highest integrity and intelligence, as his predecessors have been and as undoubtedly his successors will be. But we also know as realists that in a minor matter of this kind&#x2014;and in a great department of state like the Home Office this is a minor matter&#x2014;when we say it is the Secretary of State who has the discretion it is not the Secretary of State who studies the papers, who looks at the passport to see if a reasonable man might have detected it as a forgery. It is not even a permanent secretary, a deputy secretary or probably not even an assistant secretary. It is done on the word of the immigration officer, the officer on the spot. I have no personal experience but I am sure that the noble Earl and my noble friend Lord
<col>284</col>
Mishcon are right in paying tribute to the efficiency and integrity of immigration officers. However, they are not necessarily the wisest or the most balanced people to decide matters of this kind.<lb/>
I believe that the Home Secretary has said that an aggrieved carrier would always have the right of appeal to the courts. I am sure that that is correct. But for a carrier to appeal is cumbersome and time-consuming, even to a court of a fairly low level. The chances are that in many instances a carrier who thinks he has been aggrieved and wrongfully fined his &#x00A3;1, 000 will say, "Well, it is gone now. It is not worth going to the expense, possibly losing, possibly winning; it takes a long time", and so on.<lb/>
A tribunal seems a much better way. It is simpler; it is more informal; it is less costly. It enables the carrier who feels aggrieved to know that he is not being fined simply on the say-so of some relatively junior official, to which the imprimatur of the Minister of State or Secretary of State is then attached but that there is an entirely independent and unbiased tribunal to which he can go. I hope that the noble Earl will at least say that he feels there is something worth considering here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01304"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I hope that this amendment will not be accepted. Although, in most cases that are justiciable, I would be in favour of an appeal, this is a special jurisdiction. This has been emphasised by the number of times today that we have said that it is at the discretion of the Minister whether to enforce the fine or not.<lb/>
All these matters are discretionary in so far as they deal with immigration. I should like to recite part of a judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Templeman, only this year in an asylum case. The noble and learned Lord said:
<quote>"Applications for leave to enter and remain do not in general raise justiciable issues. Decisions under the Act are administrative and discretionary rather than judicial and imperative. Such decisions may involve the immigration authorities in pursuing inquiries abroad, on consulting official and unofficial organisations and in making value judgments".</quote>
That is just the case that we are considering&#x2014;whether to enforce the &#x00A3;1, 000, or, discretionarily, to disallow it.<lb/>
It may involve inquiries abroad from our consular officers and the like whether it should be enforced or remitted. It is really not a justiciable issue which should go before any appellate tribunal, whether it is the county court or any other tribunal.<lb/>
The reserve power of judicial review in the High Court is available in case of unfairness, procedural irregularity or otherwise unlawful action. There is that reserve power. It is hardly every brought into play but it is there.<lb/>
Apart from that&#x2014;I think it has been mentioned before&#x2014;there is the reference on occasion to the United Kingdom Immigration Advisory Service. That may do away with the necessity for any appeal at all. On the whole I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment and that the matter be dealt with in the manner I have suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01305"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: Surely the appeal would not relate to whether an immigrant should be allowed in or not, or whether he is a refugee or not. The appeal would relate
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0151"/>
<col>285</col>
simply to whether the carrier was reasonable or not in thinking that the passenger had a valid document. with great respect, I should have thought that that was a justiciable matter, and certainly one that a tribunal could decide upon rather than having a fiat from the bureaucracy at a fairly low level.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01306">6.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01307"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: May I first be permitted to answer one point of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and confirm to him that guidelines will be issued to the immigration service. I am grateful for his kind words, and I shall make sure that they are passed on to the immigration service who equally will be very grateful for his support.<lb/>
This amendment would in effect remove an important element of the Secretary of State's discretion from where it rightly resides with him to another body. It would allow an appeal tribunal to substitute its own judgment on the use of the Secretary of State's discretion for that of the Home Secretary. The amendment is unnecessary if its purpose is to ensure that questions of fact arising under the Bill may be determined by an independent body. This is because if liability is identified and the Secretary of State decides to make a charge, the carrier can decide not to pay because he believes that no liability arose under the legislation: for example, the passenger in question was a British Citizen, or the falsity of a document was not reasonably apparent.<lb/>
If the Secretary of State still wishes to recover the debt he would have to take action through the county court, who would be able to decide whether or not a liability existed under the legislation. The carrier therefore has an opportunity to make a case to the court if he considers he is not, in fact, liable to a charge. Although the noble Lord, Lord Walston, said that this is cumbersome and time-consuming for the carrier, so, too, is it cumbersome&#x2014;on the noble Lord's basis&#x2014;and time-consuming for the Secretary of State is he wishes to go there. But, surely, the county court is the right place to go.<lb/>
The amendment is also unacceptable since, as drafted, and perhaps as intended, it would substitute a tribunal's judgment on matters of discretion for that of the Secretary of State. We believe that it would be quite wrong for a tribunal to try to replace its own judgments for those of the Home Secretary on whether discretion should be exercised in any particular case notwithstanding that a clear liability existed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, took the Committee through his thought process of where was the appropriate place for such an appeal. Surely the right place to challenge the Home Secretary on the exercise not only of his judgment but of his compassion is, if thought necessary, this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01308"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I am wondering upon which side of the House the noble Earl will be answering such a question in the future. I would assure him that this Front Bench is a very comfortable one, and he would occupy any position on it with distinction and grace.<lb/>
I turn immediately to the noble Earl's answer and to the other contributions made in the debate. I tried to make it clear&#x2014;I hoped that I had done so&#x2014;that many
<col>286</col>
instances have been raised this afternoon in various amendments where a carrier might feel aggrieved. He light feel aggrieved because of the grave circumstances in which the passenger approached him. He might feel aggrieved because his official, while being as efficient as one would reasonably expect, genuinely thought that documents that were shown to him were in order. He might feel aggrieved at the penalty being exacted because the situation of the person concerned made him feel that he was a genuine refugee. That may turn out to be wrong, or, indeed, it may turn out to be right. But still, as the Bill now stands, the Secretary of State in his discretion might exact the penalty.<lb/>
We are thinking not only of one passenger. It could be a group of passengers, and so the penalties might be heavy although the facts were the same. There might be a group of 20 passengers with penalties exacted of &#x00A3;20, 000. In Parliament we are in the habit, as I understand it, where any administrative act occurs and penalties are exacted, of being able to appeal against them.<lb/>
I am answered by the statement of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, that the courts have the power of a judicial review. I tried&#x2014;I apologise if I did not make this clear&#x2014;to say that the answer to that, as the noble and learned Lord so rightly said, was that on an application for judicial review one has to show, by and large, that the discretion has been wrongly exercised or that the Secretary of State did not go through the motions that he should have done. I am trying to cover the point where one would not be able to show to the satisfaction of the court that the discretion was wrongly exercised so that nobody could reasonably come to that decision.<lb/>
In most cases the Secretary of State would have gone through the right motions. I merely tried to find a place where a perfectly respectable carrier, facing what may be a heavy penalty&#x2014;it may be 20 passengers; &#x00A3;20, 000&#x2014;wants to say that the Secretary of State has in this case unjustly imposed a penalty. He will not be able to obtain that remedy from the High Court on a judicial review for the reasons that I have just stated. All he asks to be able to do is to go to some independent body. If it says, "No, you are wrong; on the facts we feel that the decision was right", he must pay a penalty.<lb/>
In his reply the Minister also said that if the carrier thinks it is unjust he can say that he will not pay and leave it for the Secretary of State to sue him. It is my reading&#x2014;and if I am wrong I apologise to the Committee and stand to be corrected&#x2014;that the Secretary of State under the provisions of this Bill will say that he has exercised his discretion and that under Clause 1 or 2 of this Bill, whichever it may be, he is entitled to exercise his right to impose a penalty; and he will sue, as a civil debt, for the sum of &#x00A3; 1, 000. I do not think that a defendant would be heard in the court, if the Secretary of State sues in that way, as he will, to say, "Please, judge, I want you to try this case again. I now rely upon your discretion and not that of the Secretary of State".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01309"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: With respect, I think that the noble Lord has it slightly wrong. The carrier can simply not pay. Leaving aside the question of
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0152"/>
<col>287</col>
discretion as to whether the prescribed sum is imposed, the carrier can say to the court, "Look at Clause 1(2); look at Clause 1(4); by virtue of those, look at the evidence. The Secretary of State should not have imposed anything at all". Therefore there is a safeguard, quite apart from the exercise of the discretion of the Secretary of State. The sum would, by judicial interpretation of the statute, be rendered irrecoverable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01310"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, who obviously intended to assist both me and the Committee by his observations. I respectfully differ where it is purely a case of discretion&#x2014;I notice that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, is nodding his head and I take that to be a mark of approval of my submission. I think that it would be a matter of the carrier being unable to question whether the Secretary of State had exercised his discretion in the way that the carrier thought he ought. If the Secretary of State had exercised that discretion in an honest way (if I may put it in that way) there would be no answer to a county court or High Court action for the penalty. Again, I am encouraged by the fact that the noble and learned Lord has nodded his head. It is something that I used to look for in the Court of Appeal but found all too infrequently when I was the appellant.<lb/>
Obviously there are matters which must be considered in the light of what the noble Earl has said. I am hoping that between now and Report stage he will give further consideration to the points that have been made. If he does that, we might be able to agree upon a sensible tribunal. I must reconsider this matter and in those circumstances I ask leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01311"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord withdraws the amendment, is it not a curiosity of this Bill that the penalty is so absolutely rigid? It must be &#x00A3;1, 000 or such other sum as the Secretary of State states by statutory instrument. He is not allowed to say that there are some mitigating circumstances and that he will not exact &#x00A3;1, 000 but will make it &#x00A3;500. I am surprised at the absolute rigidity of the penalty in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01312"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I have a doubt in my mind as to whether it would not be within the power of the Secretary of State, where in an Act of Parliament he has a penalty of &#x00A3;1, 000, to say that he will not exact the whole amount but will ask for only &#x00A3;500. I think that if he has the power to exact a penalty of &#x00A3;1, 000 it would be perfectly proper for him to exact a lesser sum. However, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for pointing out something which deserves consideration between now and Report stage.</membercontribution></p>

On how many such occasions has he exercised his descretion and refrained my doing so?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01317">I should have given the noble Earl notice of this question and I shall fully understand if he does not have the answer on the spot. It will be quite sufficient if he prefers to write to me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01318"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McNair, for moving this amendment. Unfortunately I could not find the paper but I now have it to hand. The date in question is 5th March and not 4th March. Since then there have been over 600 notifications. If the Bill receives Royal Assent we shall follow up the notifications with request for payment. However, it will then be open to carrying companies, as it is now, to make representations that the charges should not be levied in individual cases.<lb/>
Once again, I can assure the Committee that each case will be carefully considered in the light of such representations. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord McNair, that in 100 other cases we have decided that, in all the circumstances, it would not be sensible to make a charge. In most of those cases, covering letters have not yet been sent. I believe that that shows how careful the Home Secretary is to exercise the discretion and that he has already done so.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01320"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I add a protest, which is a common one in your Lordships' House, against any retrospective legislation. I ask the Minister to consider between now and Report stage not only whether the notifications should be followed up by exacting a penalty, but whether, in view of the discussions that have taken place both in another place and in your Lordships' House, it would not be just to say before this legislation reaches the Statute Book&#x2014;if it ever does&#x2014;that it will take effect as from the Royal Assent and certainly not from the date which is anticipated: namely, 4th March 1987?<lb/>
We do not like retrospective legislation. In spite of any announcements which may be made at the time, such an announcement has to be made in vague circumstances where one does not know how the legislation will eventually turn out. Again, I invite the noble Earl to consider this point between now and the next stage of the Bill. I assume that I have the right to say that we shall study what has been said in the meantime and we ask leave to withdraw this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01321"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: For the sake of the record, perhaps I may say merely that the Bill as it stands appears to me to be wholly appropriate. There is every justification in this case for the retroactive

effect since the carriers have been put on notice at all material times. I cannot understand the merit of giving carriers acting in contravention of Clause 1 a free ride for any period of time, however short.<lb/>
The matter is covered where appropriate by the exercise of the discretion of the Secretary of State, as we have heard. Therefore I would respectfully suggest that the Bill as drafted and the way in which the system has been operated are entirely satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>(6) No instrument shall be made under subsection (5) above unless a draft of it has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01325">The noble Lord said: The principle of this Bill has of course been accepted both by another place and by this Committee, but I think all noble Lords and most people in this country regard it as a regrettable necessity. It is a necessity according to the Secretary of State and government spokesmen, because of the exceptional circumstances which arose fairly recently and which necessitated some speedy legislation. I do not quarrel with that at all. It would not be right for me to do so at this stage at any rate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01326">I think most of us have expressed the hope that those circumstances will not by any means be permanent, that they will soon or in due course disappear and that therefore the provisions of this Bill will no longer be necessary. When that will be, none of us can tell, but again we all agree that we look forward to the day when we can return to our traditional role of having if not an open door at least a door whichis not firmly closed or as firmly closed as has been made necessary by this temporary situation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01327">For that reason, I suggest that rather than having this Bill in an absolutely permanent form which would have to be repealed eventually when times improve, it would be far better for it to run, as this amendment suggests, so that it shall cease to have effect on 4th March 1988, with full discretion to the Secretary of State:
<quote>"unless the Secretary of State by order made by statutory instrument extends the effect of this Act for a period which shall not exceed 12 months."</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01328">So it will always be open to the Secretary of State to come back to both Houses of Parliament to say, "The situation has not got any better; we still need the provisions of this Bill." Without any doubt, both Houses will listen to him and will accede to his request. But when the time comes, which we all hope will be soon, when this is no longer necessary the simplest thing in the world would be for the Secretary of State not to come back to the Chamber and to another place. The Bill would then automatically lapse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01329">I hope therefore that at least the principle of this amendment will meet with the approval of the noble Earl. We have not had much success with him so far, but now that we are reaching the end of the Committee stage I have hopes that in spite of his expression he

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01330"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: Unfortunately it is the very principle of the amendment which causes me to wish to oppose it, because this adopts the precedent from emergency legislation for ordinary legislation so as to treat this Bill, when it becomes an Act, as a temporary measure unless renewed. This pre-empts the traditional process by which any Act may be placed upon or removed from the statute book by the will of Parliament. I cannot see any justification for the departure from that basic principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01331"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: Is it not the case that there is some degree or there was thought to be some degree of emergency because several hundred people managed to reach these shores from Ethiopia and Sri Lanka between December and February?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01333"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: The amendment as drafted would limit the life of the Bill to a maximum of two years, the second of which would be subject to further parliamentary approval. I cannot accept that this would be right or sensible. The Bill is neither novel nor experimental. There is no point at all in leaving carrying companies and indeed passengers in a state of uncertainty about Parliament's intentions next year.<lb/>
The Bill is intended to form a permanent part of our immigration control, just like our carriers' existing liabilities for detention and removal costs. We are not unique in the world; there are other countries which have already got this legislation in place. At the end of last month my right honourable friend the Home Secretary had a very useful meeting in Europe when considerable interest was shown in what we were doing. It is likely that the same lines as ours will be followed if possible. So I see this very much as a longterm rather than a short-term measure.<lb/>
Secondly, the Bill raises no issues of fundamental personal liberties or rights which would justify its being subject to parliamentary scrutiny after 12 months. The Bill is simply designed to help ensure that the requirements of the immigration rules, which Parliament has approved, are met. It does so by deterring carriers from bringing to our shores people who do not meet these requirements. There is nothing to be gained by looking at the whole matter again in a year's time.<lb/>
I do not think it would be right, therefore, to put this Bill on a one-year basis, renewable for one further year only. I do not believe it contains anything that requires the continual parliamentary scrutiny and short life which this amendment proposes.</membercontribution></p>

That presupposes not only that there is an immediate spur but that international pressures change. They change obviously in various ways. This amendment asks merely that year by year the question of how international pressures make such an enactment necessary should come before Parliament and that Parliament would decide whether or not this should be renewed.<lb/>
Again, that is something which I should have hoped the Secretary of State would consider favourably, especially after the moving speech of my noble friend Lord Walston. Possibly we ought to hope that after reconsideration of the speech which the noble Lord, Lord Walston, made and the interventions which. have occurred since, he would have second thoughts. It is on that optimistic hope that I ask for leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

The Bill as drafted provided that one of the grounds on which a CHA may suspend or revoke the authorisation of a pilot was that there were too many pilots in the port. Amendment No. 4 limits that power to cases where the pilots are employed by the CHA; in other cases, including those where pilots are self-employed, the CHA will not be able to remove authorisations on these grounds, this amendment is intended to make self-employment a more attractive possibility for the pilots than it would otherwise be, since it will give them greater security that they will be able to continue working as pilots even if trade in the port falls away. Notwithstanding the amendment, I am satisfied that CHAs will have a number of ways of ensuring that costs are kept under control, principally through their power to set the original number of authorisations, to set pilotage charges, and through the terms of the contracts of agreements that will govern the provision of pilotage services by agents or self-employed pilots. They will also of course have the power to change the arrangements in the port from an agency arrangement to direct employment.<lb/>
Amendment No. 3 makes it clear that it is the termination of a contract, not merely its alteration, that provides grounds for suspension or revocation of a licence under Clause 3(5), I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

These amendments fulfil commitments which I gave on Third Reading. I agreed to consider a suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, that the provision in Clause 3(6) requiring a CHA to give a pilot notice in advance, if his authorisation was to be suspended on grounds of incompetence or misconduct, should be extended also to cover cases where a pilot no longer met the CHA's qualifications for a pilot. There is some affinity between these two types of case, and Amendment No. 5 extends the notice provision accordingly.<lb/>
I also accepted in principle an amendment from my noble friend Lord Swinfen, requiring a CHA to give a pilot a document which he could effectively use as a reference, if it had been found necessary to suspend or revoke his authorisation on grounds unconnected with his competence, conduct or qualifications. Amendment No. 6 fulfils that commitment. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

They make it clear that, where pilots have released a CHA from the obligation to offer employment, the CHA will have the full range of options to choose from, including self-employment, direct employment or agency arrangements which might involve either.

My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport accepted an amendment tabled by his honourable friend the Member for Crosby in Committee in another place. Amendment No. 11, together with the Government Amendment No. 12, makes it clear that the bodies representing the ports and pilots are each to appoint one member of the arbitration panel and that the member appointed by the Secretary of State will be its chairman. Amendment No. 10 is a technical amendment to make it clear that the chairman and/or members of the arbitration panel may be different in different cases of dispute.

<title>Parliamentary and Health Service Commissioners Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01444">6.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01445">Report received.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01446"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>After Clause 3, insert the following new clause</quote>
<quote>(<i>"Other investigations: clinical judgment</i>.
<ol>
<li>&#x2014;(1) The Health Service Commissioners may investigate any matters within the scope of their authority which in their opinion require investigation.</li>
<li>(2) The Health Service Commissioners are hereby empowered to investigate complaints relating to or arising out of the exercise of the clinical judgment of a medical practitioner.</li>
<li>(3) Paragraph 19(1) of Schedule 13 to the 1977 Act is hereby revoked.").</li>
</ol></quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01447">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I should like to restate my regret that I was unable to be present during the earlier stages of the passage of this Bill through your Lordships' House. This amendment deals with the extension of the powers of the Health Service Commissioner. As your Lordships will know at present the Health Service Commissioner has no power to investigate complaints against clinical judgments nor against the general practitioner or the family practitioner committees.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01448">In 1983, which is the latest year for which I have exact figures, 19, 800 written complaints were received by health authorities. It seems a very small number of complaints out of 64 million in-patients and 53 million out-patients, but there were 19, 800 written complaints
<col>300</col>
and of those about 1, 000 failed to be satisfied through the normal National Health Service internal complaint procedure. One thousand of these complaints were forwarded to the Health Service Commissioner. Out of those 1, 000 complaints, 67 per cent. had to be rejected because they fell outside his jurisdiction. The majority&#x2014;about 50 per cent. of the 1, 000 complaints&#x2014;fell outside his jurisdiction because they were concerned with clinical judgment and the rest&#x2014;about 17 per cent. of the 1, 000&#x2014;because they related to family doctors, dentists, pharmacists or FPCs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01449">The Royal Commission of 1979 recommended the extension of the powers of the Health Service Commissioner to deal with questions of clinical judgment backed up by professional advisers. As a result of the recommendation by the Royal Commission, the procedure now known as the second opionion was instituted. This consists of two consultants in the relevant specialty looking at the complaint against the clinical judgment of a medical practitioner. Some people have been satisfied through this extension of the right of appeal, but a large number of complainants, in my view probably the majority, do not feel that this procedure is impartial.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01450">If the complainant does not accept this investigation, his only recourse is to the courts to obtain a remedy. All of us know that to go to court is a very expensive exercise. Also the length of time taken before cases come to court is unacceptable in my view. I realise that the latest regulations about disclosure of medical evidence to the complainant will help to a certain extent, but the length of time is still unacceptable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01451">There are many reasons why most people would prefer to go to the Health Service Commissioner, if he were given the right to investigate. First, most of them have tremendous respect for the independence of the Health Service Commissioner and, secondly, he is responsible only through Parliament and therefore commands respect. It is also true that investigations that go to the Health Service Commissioner are dealt with much more quickly and the whole atmosphere is much less adversarial than a court of law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01452">The other point which I think people have failed to grasp is that in most of the cases investigated by the Health Service Commissioner the majority of people do not want financial recompense. They genuinely want to know the truth. Their main aim is mostly to prevent the same mistake happening again. There is no reason, if what they want is financial recompense, why they should not choose the courts, but if they choose the ombudsman any proceedings in the courts would be subject to absolute privilege. I think we might even go so far as to consider allowing the ombudsman the power to grant limited compensation, particularly where the quantum could be readily ascertained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01453">I believe that unless we move in this direction we are inevitably moving towards the American system with enormous increase in compensation granted in courts and its attendant impact on doctors who in their practices have to cover themselves by increasingly costly and in many cases unnecessary investigations; not only that, but the cost to the medical profession of
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0159"/>
<col>301</col>
adequate insurance is escalating in a quite frightening manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01454">The extension of these powers to the Health Service Commissioner I firmly believe would benefit not only the majority of aggrieved citizens who abhor the prospect of litigation but also the clinicians themselves. Indeed, it might go even further and satisfy the shades of John Milton, whose famous statement in his <i>Areopagitica</i> of 1644, is quoted by ombudsmen the world over:
<quote>"For this is not the liberty which we can hope, that no grievance ever should arise in the Commonwealth&#x2014;that let no man in this world expect; but when complaints are freely heard, deeply considered and speedily reformed, then is the utmost bond of civil liberty attained that wise men look for."</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01455">I hope that the noble Lord the Minister will look at the amendment with favour. If he cannot at this point agree to it, I hope that he will assure me and other Members of your Lordships' House who feel strongly on the point that further discussions will take place on the issue with the profession and with the Health Service Commissioner. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01456"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, has set out clearly the situation when complaints are made in the health service&#x2014;not in the family practitioner committee but in the rest of the health service. As the noble Baroness said, there is the avenue of the courts to which resort can be had by those who are complainants, the Health Service Commissioner being specifically prevented from investigating any action in respect of which the person aggrieved has or had a remedy by way of proceedings in any court of law.<lb/>
The noble Baroness raised the familiar complaint that the length of time in the courts is considerable. I do not think there is anything that I can say about that. All I would say is that obviously in the serious cases Parliament has thought it right that the courts should be the avenue of redress.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness fairly said, that is, however, by no means the end of the story. The commissioner can and indeed does investigate complaints relating to medical issues. The criterion is that, if action has been taken solely in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment, the commissioner cannot take action; and it is for the commissioner to decide whether he believes the action is solely in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment. Where there is a question of maladministration, the Health Service Commissioner can indeed step in and take action.<lb/>
I am not entirely sure that my statistics coincide with the noble Baroness's statistics. The statistics that I have show that the commissioner not only can but does investigate complaints relating to medical issues, and that the number of complaints which were rejected on the grounds of clinical judgment have decreased over the last three years from 222 in 1983&#x2013;84 to 150 in 1984&#x2013;85 to 131 last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01457"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I said that the latest figures I had were for 1983 and that out of 1, 000 complaints 453 were investigated and the rest were rejected.</membercontribution></p>
<col>302</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01458"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness but her statistics and mine still do not coincide&#x2014;hers are very much higher than mine. However, perhaps we can agree on the fact that the number of complaints which have been rejected because the Health Service Commissioner had found that they were solely in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment have decreased over the last three years. During the same period the number of medical grievances investigated by the commissioner has increased from 61 three years ago to 101 two years ago to 111 last year.<lb/>
There is a third leg to this argument and that concerns the area where the noble Baroness understandably said that many people do not want financial recompense. What they really want is to know that the truth has been told and that if something has gone wrong it will not happen again. The noble Baroness rightly said that as regards those particular cases a procedure had been set up called the second opinions procedure, which is based on professional review to deal with complaints concerning the clinical judgment of hospital doctors and dentists.<lb/>
I believe that the procedure was set up with the help of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in 1981 and it is also supported by the Joint Consultants Committee for Hospital Doctors and Dentists.<lb/>
I was concerned when the noble Baroness said that the problem with the procedure was that it was not altogether an independent investigation. I understand why she said that, because clearly those who are investigating are professionals in this field. But I say absolutely plainly to the House that regional medical officers, who are after all responsible for managing the second opinions procedure, conducted a review of how the system was working. They reported in 1985 that they had the co-operation of the medical profession in undertaking the work and that a useful service was being provided to complainants.<lb/>
The number of complaints dealt with under the second opinion procedure has increased. The number of complaints dealt with under the procedure has increased from 32 in 1981&#x2013;82, to 59 in 1983, to 69 in 1984 and to 76 in 1985. Therefore the situation is that the procedures for dealing with complaints concerning clinical judgment are comprehensive. There is the avenue of the courts and of the second opinions procedure. The Health Service Commissioner may also at his discretion decide that the situation is not one which derives solely from the exercise of clinical judgment and he can step in and exercise his powers. The number of such cases has been increasing.<lb/>
The procedures are supported by those concerned and the arrangements are monitored to ensure that the complainant's rights are safeguarded. Although I understand why the noble Baroness wished to move the amendment, it would have major significance for the procedures and any new arrangements would require extensive consultation to ensure that they could operate efficiently and be fully supported.<lb/>
In those circumstances I am afraid that I must resist the amendment that the noble Baroness has moved. I can only express the hope that having gone over the ground I have followed to a considerable extent what
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0160"/>
<col>303</col>
the noble Baroness has said but here and there I have added some new items of information so that she may feel more assured than she was before she moved the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01459"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the Minister for his reply, I wish to put right one matter as regards which he misunderstood me. I never said that I personally did not consider that the second opinions procedure was adequately independent. I said that the average complainant or the average citizen, particularly someone who stands in a certain awe of doctors, finds it difficult when dealing with the medical profession to accept that there is not a little ganging-up of the profession against him.<lb/>
I do not believe that it happens, but the fact is that such an opinion exists in this country. I am sorry that the Minister cannot go any further in meeting my request for further discussions with the professions, because I feel that in the long run the Health Service Commissioner will have to be given that power.<lb/>
However, in view of the lateness of my intervention in the discussions on the Bill and the lateness of the hour and the business that is in front of the House, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Swanage Yacht Haven Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01462">7.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01463"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
The promoters of this Private Bill have circulated to a large number of your Lordships a statement for the occasion of this Second Reading. It describes comprehensively the project and its recent history. I shall therefore concentrate on the principle features of the scheme and what appear to be the main points of concern raised by the petitioners. I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading this evening in the usual way so that the promoters and the petitioners can be heard by a Select Committee in accordance with the procedure for private legislation.<lb/>
Briefly, the scheme proposed is this. A yacht haven is to be created to accompany residential housing. The residential housing is not a subject of the Bill. It is already approved and the building work on it has begun. The haven would make use of the Victorian pier which had fallen into disrepair and was closed for safety reasons. The promoters have already carried out repairs and that has enabled the pier to be reopened for the berthing of vessels and for pedestrians.<lb/>
To form with the pier the new sheltered haven, a breakwater would be built. At present there are no sheltered moorings between Poole and Weymouth. That particular need would be met as the promoters have agreed to permit temporary mooring for boats requiring emergency shelter when unexpected and sudden storms occur.<lb/>
The new haven would provide moorings for about 250 yachts, together with space for visiting craft and
<col>304</col>
the Swanage lifeboat. That would increase the opportunities for the recreation of sailing. Space has also been offered for full-time fishing boats which are normally based at Swanage. Besides providing those and other facilities, the scheme would give support to the local tourist industry.<lb/>
As regards employment, between 50 and 100 additional jobs are foreseen. They will continue after the construction phase, during which about 300 people would be employed. I understand that the tourist organisations operating in the area are in favour of the project. The recent unemployment which has occurred in Swanage certainly shows that the extra jobs are needed.<lb/>
Swanage is an attractive town and a popular seaside resort for families, some of whom have visited it over the years. It is not surprising that there should be some apprehensions about whether its character might suffer from such a scheme. There are two petitions before your Lordships' House. One is from Purbeck District Council. It,
<quote>"supports in principle the construction of the works proposed"</quote>
but expresses certain reservations. Among these are possible effects on the coastline. To meet this concern, special hydrographic studies by experts have been commissioned and the resulting report was made available to the council at Easter. I understand that the other local authorities concerned also support the scheme in the Bill.<lb/>
The second petition from a number of local interests raises other points in addition, including possible adverse effects on sea fishermen and sea anglers. Clearly these matters must be fully examined.<lb/>
In response to comments that the limits of jurisdiction proposed extend more widely than is strictly necessary, the promoters have already agreed to reduce them and they propose to submit amendments to that effect to the Select Committee. These revised limits of jurisdiction amount to only about 5 per cent. of Swanage Bay; that is to say, the whole bay from Peverill Point to Ballard Point. I mention this to make it clear that there is no question of a large part of the bay being included.<lb/>
It is normal for works of this kind to be undertaken by private firms; and it is not unusual for the completed facilities then to be managed by private concerns. Several ports, docks and harbours in this country are operated by private companies. Examples which are appropriate to have in mind when considering this Bill are the Brighton Marina Act, the Eastbourne Harbour Act and the very recent Port of Fosdyke Act of 1987.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Raglan, has tabled an Instruction to the committee. I note that the matters set out are ones which would automatically be considered by the committee&#x2014;they should certainly be&#x2014;such as the character of Swanage, the possible effects on the environment and the other matters. For myself, I am entirely content with the wording in that Instruction.<lb/>
In my view the committee should examine these matters anyway without any need of this guidance. My only worry is a procedural one. Turning for advice to Erskine May, pages 1047&#x2013;8, I see on the latter page:
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0161"/>
<col>305</col>
<quote>"instructions which would direct the committee to have regard to matters which would already, either under the standing orders or because the clause in question is opposed, be carefully considered by it, have been refused by the House."</quote>
It is clear from both pages of Erskine May that the House has been careful in the past not to direct the committee or appear to prejudice its conclusions on the merits of the cases it is to hear.<lb/>
An example was on the Kent River Board Bill in 1962, when arguments against an Instruction of this kind were powerfully deployed and it was withdrawn by its mover. The matters to which attention was then to be drawn would have had to be considered by the committee in any event. The noble Lord, Lord Raglan, will no doubt decide what to do after he has spoken on the content of his Instruction and heard the debate. What is clear from Erskine May is that this is the kind of instruction which, while not out of order, should in no way affect the Committee's views on the Bill whether it is passed or withdrawn.<lb/>
I have full confidence that a Committee of the House will examine all the matters raised in the petitions and the proposals of the promoters thoroughly and fairly. I believe that the proposals in the Bill should go forward to that stage. I should not be moving this Motion if I did not consider them worthy of such consideration. Further, I learn that the promoters are in a position to propose modifications or to make special arrangements to accommodate several of the matters raised in the petitions; and the committee procedure provides the means of pursuing satisfactory settlements on these.<lb/>
In the debate in your Lordships' House a year ago, which I initiated, on the British tourist industry, speakers were encouraging initiatives and investment knowing that there is here a great potential for increasing employment in our country. When initiatives are taken it is disheartening for their enterprising and energetic originators if they cannot even get off the ground because they are denied access to the appropriate system where the pros and cons can be examined and the public interest taken into account. That is a cogent reason for sending the Bill to the Committee stage.<lb/>
I commend the view of Mr. Brian Johnston, the well-known broadcaster, who for nearly 30 years has had a house at Swanage. The town we are discussing this evening is down his way&#x0021; Writing in the journal <i>Heritage Outlook</i> in January about this project, his view was:
<quote>"I think if it is well done it will be rather a good idea."</quote>
The article supported further examination of the proposals. It also congratulated the promoters on the work already done to bring the Victorian pier to life again.<lb/>
I was known for my knowledge of the countryside and coastline and their wildlife, and therefore as what is called a conservationist, before I became a parliamentarian. In my experience, imaginative plans to provide new facilities can in suitable circumstances be designed and adapted to preserve the environment. I believe that this is a case of that kind. I commend the Bill to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01464">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Campbell of Croy</i>.)</p>
<col>306</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01465">7.27 p. m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01466"><member>Lord Raglan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, has, as one would expect of him, put the case for the Bill as well as it could be put. He is, I know, interested in the tourist industry and, as he said, he principally supports the Bill on that account. On that point, I am inclined to think that though its provisions may help one kind of holiday industry it will do so at the expense of another kind. I shall not bandy figures with him about employment prospects&#x2014;they, of course, will come out in the Committee&#x2014;but I am bound to say that I think his figures will be contended.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, I live a long way from Swanage. I became involved in this matter because a friend living in Swanage wrote to me for support in petitioning against the Bill. I have to say that I wrote back rather discouragingly to the effect that there were always objections to such schemes and that on the face of it this did not seem such a bad one to me. However, he persisted with me and so I went to Swanage to see for myself, and my visit quite changed my mind.<lb/>
There are numerous and, I think, very proper objections to these proposals but of course this evening I shall concentrate on only a few which I think will be enough to demonstrate to your Lordships the validity of the terms of the Instruction which I shall be asking your Lordships to enforce. I may say, in view of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, that I put down this Instruction with what I think is the best advice, so I hope your Lordships will accept that I did not take it off the top of my head. It was given to me under professional advice in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Under an Act of 1859 a quay was built for the transport of Purbeck stone. It was built on the waterfront of Swanage. The quay was later extended by a pier for the use of pleasure steamers and for other recreational activities. In both cases, there was provision made in the relevant Act for an area of jurisdiction, as it was called, to allow clear passage for navigating large boats. In purchasing the quay and the pier from their previous owners, the proposers of the Bill have succeeded in title to the area of jurisdiction. However, they intend to put those powers to a different use from that for which they were originally designed.<lb/>
The area of jurisdiction, altered considerably in shape and greatly enlarged, is to be used virtually as an exclusion zone for the benefit of vessels paying rent to the development company. The exclusion zone would cover almost all that area in front of Swanage which is presently fused for anchorage by private vessels. In combination with an encircling breakwater and wavescreen, the zone will force out or enable to be forced out nearly all the 60 or more fishing boat, pleasure boat and yacht anchorages for which there are no safe, suitable or convenient substitutes elsewhere in the bay. In the process, it will very considerably reduce their shore facilities.<lb/>
I have been told that eight of the 28 whole and part-time fishermen have been offered berths in the marina at a price, provided they do not get bigger boats. The others do not know where they will go. Therefore, the proposals would cause almost complete disruption and severe curtailment of established businesses and recreational interests.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0162"/>
<col>307</col>
I should explain that this is not some rundown dockland whose fortunes are to be revived, as may be the case in other places round the coast. These are lively interests and going concerns which would be displaced. They mean much to the people affected, nearly all of whom are local inhabitants. A large portion of the beach and shingle where fishermen now draw up their boats&#x2014;a picturesque area which is much favoured as a holiday attraction, particularly for children&#x2014;is to be concreted over and turned into a park for two or three hundred cars. I should have said that as a spectacle for tourists, for most people's money, cars for fishing boats will not be an attractive exchange.<lb/>
From the area of the car park, jutting out incongruously from the shore some 300 yards into the sea, almost 20 feet in height and blocking some of the best views of the bay, would be the breakwater. It is not known what effect the breakwater would have on the currents of the bay and therefore upon the disposition of the beach. The beach at Swanage is unusual in that much of its sand is scoured away during the winter and gets replaced in the spring. Therefore, the wellbeing of the beach, which is one of Swanage's splendid and popular natural advantages, depends upon not interfering with the currents that put it there. When this was pointed out to the developers, they put a clause in the Bill&#x2014;Clause 24&#x2014;under which the company would make good any damage caused by the effect of the breakwater on the currents. Yet the damage so caused might well be beyond the means of a small company such as this&#x2014;or even of a large company&#x2014;to repair.<lb/>
At a later stage and since the deposition of the Bill, the developers have at last commissioned a hydrographic survey, which, as I understand it, has just been finished. However, its conclusions must be tentative as they have been calculated to a mathematical model only. At Eastbourne, where a large marina is planned, it has been thought necessary to construct a working hydrographical model. I do not think that one can possibly do with anything less than that here; the possibilities of damage and the liability to indemnity are too large.<lb/>
A proper hydrographic survey is not the only thing which the developers have been prepared to go ahead without. I have here a coloured brochure advertising a number of residential houses to which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, referred. They are being built overlooking the proposed yacht haven. In the brochure, they are offered for sale on the basis that each will have a berth at the yacht haven&#x2014;and that before the Bill has even begun to be examined by Parliament. I think that to do such a thing is ill-considered; it is certainly misrepresentation. To my mind, it casts more serious doubt on the competence of the company. Under the Bill, it has sweeping powers to control and manage what goes on within the area of jurisdiction, including the marina. The area of jurisdiction now goes a mile or more out to sea.<lb/>
We need to remember that Swanage lies not on an open coast but in a natural bay. Its mooring area, which is in the only sheltered position in the bay, serves many interests, as I said earlier. The noble Lord,
<col>308</col>
Lord Campbell, has said that it is only a tiny proportion of the bay. But only a tiny proportion of the bay is suitable for mooring. The many interests include fishermen, boat hirers, sea anglers, divers, naturalists, holidaymakers and a host of yachtsmen who can at present moor permanently or who may wish only to call at Swanage. All those interests stand to be injuriously affected under the Bill, and surely it is not right that those interests, which are effectively public interests, should be subjugated to those of a private development company.<lb/>
If it is considered desirable or necessary to regulate the bay, I think that the proper course would be the establishment of a public harbour authority representative of all sections of the public who use the bay. That would ensure that its management is carried out in the public interest. As it is, the Bill will effectively be ousting all those legitimate local interests from what is really the only utilisable part of the bay; they will be left with no place and no say in how things are run.<lb/>
My last point concerns the general environment of the bay and the impact which such a development would have on it. Yacht havens, or marinas as they are usually known, have proved very popular with boat owners and have enabled many people to own a boat who otherwise would have had nowhere to put it. Altogether marinas have been a great help in popularising sailing as a pastime. When well situated they can be quite agreeable to look at&#x2014;more so than caravan sites, of which they are roughly the maritime equivalent. More sites for marinas should and will be found if the demand is there. Of course, in nearly every case a Bill will be needed, as Parliament has jurisdiction over tidal waters. Therefore, Parliament has a planning function which it can discharge in protecting the coastline&#x2014;which is fortunate, as planning authorities can either be too removed or too near the immediate site to perceive it in its wider setting.<lb/>
I take the view, which I am sure your Lordships share, that there are right and wrong places to put things. That sentiment applies to marinas. I believe that Swanage is very much the wrong place for a marina. Only a few miles round the corner to the north-east, at Poole, there are thousands of yachts with facilities for them; perhaps at Bournemouth, too. All across the Solent, at Lymington, Portsmouth and Southampton, there are many suitable places. However, south and west of Poole the coast acquires a different character. It is more peaceful and one might say it is less rackety. It is relatively undeveloped until one gets to Weymouth. I think it is worth trying to keep it like that as far as possible.<lb/>
Between Swanage and Poole there is Knowl beach in Studland Bay, which was given to the National Trust in 1982. The cliffs belonging to Knowl can be seen straight across the bay from Swanage. Round Peveril Point, just out of Swanage, the heritage coast runs west. Swanage town itself is a conservation area and, most of it anyway, matches its fortunate setting just east of the Purbeck Hills. It would be a shame to spoil it with something so out of character as this marina and the inevitable further development of the same kind which would be bound to take place if the marina is established. Unfortunately, foreshores cannot be made conservation areas; but if they could, this would certainly be one.

I hope I have said enough to convince your Lordships of my concern and that you will accept the terms of the Instruction on the Order Paper. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01467">Moved, That it be an Instruction to the Committee to whom the Bill is committed that they should have particular regard to the effect of the Bill on the environment and on the character of Swanage and its bay, and should consider whether it is in the public interest that, as proposed by the Bill, a far more extensive area of the bay than hitherto should be placed under the jurisdiction of a private company, and enclosed, for the purpose of commercial development.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Raglan</i>.)</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01469"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not for me to comment on the merits of the Bill but I express the hope that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading. I expect your Lordships are already bored with hearing me say once again that giving a Second Reading to a Private Bill does not necessarily imply that you approve of its purposes; but it does allow the Bill to be committed to a Select Committee, which I suggest is the appropriate place to make a full investigation of the merits of the Bill, the petitions and the Instruction.<lb/>
There are two petitions against the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, made clear. They are widely drawn and a number of objections are raised in them. These matters will be closely investigated by the Select Committee if your Lordships agree to the Second Reading this evening. I also suggest that it would be wise to accept the Instruction in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Raglan. Again, I have no comments on the merits of it but I believe that, precedurally, it is an appropriate Instruction.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, raised some matters that he had read in Erskine May saying, if I understood him, that instructions on matters which would in any case be considered by the committee should not be accepted by the House. Certainly that is generally true. However, the Select Committee is limited to considering matters raised in the petitions and I am not sure that in this case the matters raised in the Instruction are all raised in the petitions. However, that is a matter for the noble Lord, Lord Raglan.<lb/>
My advice is that the House should accept the Second Reading and the Instruction moved by the noble Lord. The Bill will then go to a Select Committee for thorough investigation and that committee will make a special report to the House which can be considered when the Bill returns on Third Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01470">7.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01471"><member>Lord Stewart of Fulham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, has advised the House to accept the Second Reading of the Bill and to accept the Instruction. I am grateful to the noble Lord for both pieces of advice, which I hope and trust the House will follow. In view of that, and the detailed account given by my noble friend Lord Raglan of the problems involved in the creation of this marina, I need not say very much.
<col>310</col>
All of us have a connection with Swanage in one sense. If one chooses to leave this building by way of St. Stephen's Hall one will see a large mural painting of a naval battle in Swanage Bay which took place some 1, 000 years ago. My connection with Swanage arises from having spent my summer holidays there year after year for a great many years. One is immediately aware of what an attractive place it is for family holidays because of the exceptional safeness of the bathing. There is a peculiarity of the tide which means it never goes out very far. Therefore the risk of any juvenile or imprudent bather being swept away by the tide is almost negligible.<lb/>
We do not know for certain whether the tide will continue to behave in that manner after the creation of the breakwater and the other works set out in the Bill. It is therefore prudent for the House to give the Committee this Instruction to consider the character of Swanage and the effect that these works might have if carried out. It appears we may have a conflict between the interests of those people who would gladly use a yacht haven and the many other people whose ways of enjoying Swanage may all be put in peril. Some people may find their methods of enjoyment imperilled by what could happen to the tides.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Raglan, drew attention to the plight of fishermen and the boatmen. The promoters may be able to assist some of them but it is clear from the fact that they have offered to assist only some of them that they do not feel they can meet the needs of all who now use this part of Swanage Bay, either as fishermen or as boatmen. If, as is a possibility, the construction of the works interferes with the breeding of a number of species of fish and shellfish, that will constitute another threat to the livelihood of a specific group of people in Swanage.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said that provision will be made for the Swanage lifeboat which lies along that shore. It will have to move to a different place from where it is now. It is not clear whether the lifeboat will have security of tenure once moved. Its position and the rent it may be asked to pay will be entirely at the discretion of the company which is to carry out this development. That is an example of what the Select Committee should very carefully study.<lb/>
It is true that the promoters have reduced the area they propose to bring under their jurisdiction. Although that area is small, set against the whole range of Swanage Bay, it comprises a large proportion of the south-west corner of the bay which is particularly protected and favoured by local boatmen, fishermen, anglers and others. Therefore there is a case for specifically underlining the important issues at stake and the amount of harm that may be done. We cannot say dogmatically that it will be done, but there is reason to fear it may be done. In view of that, it is right for the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, to move an Instruction of this kind and I earnestly hope that the House will support it.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0487P0I0164"/>
<col>311</col>
salient points. I should like to say a few words about the environmental aspect. Like the noble Lord, Lord Stewart, I took my family holidays when I was young in Swanage, staying at the Grosvenor Hotel which I believe has been pulled down to make way for this residential development. As I remember it, the Grosvenor Hotel was no great beauty. I humbly suggest however that although Swanage Bay is a conservation area, the fact that this development has been allowed to go ahead means that in my eyes it has already been partially spoilt.<lb/>
I should like to comment briefly on what the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, said about the marina. Much of the debate has concentrated on the south-west corner of the bay, which everyone, except perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, has said is protected. But noble Lords have failed to say that Swanage Bay is not protected from easterly gales.<lb/>
When such conditions exist boats have to be taken to safer moorings in Poole harbour. The placing of a marina on this site and the building of a substantial sea wall would, in effect, create a much safer environment, especially for the passing yachtsman. I speak as a yachtsman. I consider Swanage Bay an admirable site for a marina for yachtsmen proceeding westwards from the Solent. Many other marinas in the Solent and at Poole have been mentioned, but due to the great increase in the popularity of sailing those marinas are now overcrowded.<lb/>
I do not know how many of your Lordships have recently gone into Poole in a yacht and tried to find somewhere to stand for a night. It is not always easy. Swanage would be much better suited from the yachtsman's point of view. Poole or Weymouth involve a detour off one's course if one is headed beyond Portland to the West Country. The building of this yacht haven could only be a good thing from the yachtsman's point of view.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, mentioned the employment benefits that would accrue to Swanage. I agree with him. Unemployment is high in that area, particularly in the winter. When a marina is built, subsidiary interests connected with maintenance of boats during the winter invariably develop around it. This will be some help for employment.<lb/>
With regard to the eyesore of the sea wall, if my memory serves me correctly, the land around Swanage is fairly high. I do not think that many people's views would be adversely affected. The marina would not be in what I regard as the most attractive corner of the bay on the northern side.<lb/>
Much has been said about the tide. Being a relatively enclosed bay, the tide tends to sweep past it. There is not a large, lateral tidal movement around the bay, which is of course what makes it so safe for bathers, as the noble Lord, Lord Stewart, mentioned. The marina is not to be placed where the beach is. The beach is further around the bay to the west and north-west. I do not think that the marina would affect the beach in any way.<lb/>
The Royal Yachting Association supports the principle behind the building of the marina. But it, too, has expressed concern about the rather wide area of jurisdiction that the promoters originally wanted. I
<col>312</col>
understand that they have agreed to reduce that area and that it is no longer the problem that it was thought to be.<lb/>
The problem arose of what was to happen to the Swanage Sailing Club which has a small facility near the old pier. The promoters are to rehouse it in a building near the pier. It is to be given preferential facilities in the marina. It is also to have a new slipway built to the west of the proposed marina site. That slipway, or possibly another, would be for public use, to replace existing slipways which would be lost in the marina development area.<lb/>
There is still an area to the west of the pier forming the western arm of the marina where moorings could be put down. I believe that the promoters have said that they will not have jurisdiction over that area, so yachts would still be able to anchor for the night outside the marina.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, said that the promoters have already restored the pier which is now usable, having been derelict for a number of years. When we talk about the great use made of the pier by pleasure boats, it has to be put in context. Swanage pier was in its heyday about 70 or 80 years ago when a large number of paddle steamers plied up and down the coast. Today, a few smaller craft come round from Poole and Bournemouth.<lb/>
There is only one seagoing paddle steamer left in the world. It is called the "Waverley", and I am happy to say that it remains in this country. The promoters are delighted that she will use the pier later this year. We do not have pleasure craft traffic to anything like its former extent.<lb/>
The lifeboat was mentioned. I do not know any details. However, if the lifeboat has to be launched from land at present, it will probably be very much quicker to run down the pier and jump into a boat that is already afloat. I am sure that the promoters will look favourably upon the siting of a lifeboat facility at a berth in the marina.<lb/>
Finally, the promoters have so far said that they will meet most of the objections that have been raised. At the moment, those are only undertakings. It is for the Select Committee to sort out what is to happen about this matter.<lb/>
I welcome the proposal to build a marina in Swanage. It has been given fairly wide support locally, despite what we have heard this evening. It will be supported by the yachting fraternity. I hope that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord gave us a full, detailed and forceful line of argument. I know that he has visited the bay and has therefore seen it at first sight. That was quite a large undertaking because he lives a long way away. That shows me&#x2014;I live nearer&#x2014;that he has first-hand knowledge of the problems.<lb/>
I am not a resident of Swanage. I live on the Dorset coast, some 30 miles further west behind Chesil Beach.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0165"/>
<col>313</col>
From my boyhood, when I camped there at the age of 10 as a cub or scout&#x2014;I cannot remember which&#x2014;except for the war years, I have continued to know Swanage and its bay. It is a most beautiful and unique place. That was 60 years ago. I go back to Swanage more often now than I used to because I have a crowd of grandchildren who go to school there. The curious thing is that awfully little has changed. Swanage has survived in the most unusual way. It is a most extraordinary place that has survived the march of time to a remarkable degree.<lb/>
Swanage is a haven already. It may have to be a yacht haven&#x2014;I do not know; I shall go on to that&#x2014;but it is a haven of quietness for family leisure for all age groups from little children to teenagers. There is something for everyone along the seashore of Swanage Bay. It is unpretentious and it has enormous character.<lb/>
Noble Lords may well feel that yachts on the sea are as natural and unobjectionable as sand on the beach&#x2014;and I certainly agree&#x2014;but there is an enormous price to pay. We have to think very hard about this. That is why I think it right that this Bill should go to a Select Committee. A yacht haven&#x2014;or marina, as some call it&#x2014;involves close-quarter berthing at the highest possible degree of intensity. That is simply because the capital costs are so huge. If one goes to Swanage Bay and looks at what has to be done, the capital cost is so large that the haven must be occupied at a very high intensity. Closely packed in that way, there are unacceptable risks of damage with many hundreds of boats touching. They are not boats on moorings; they are closely packed together.<lb/>
These boats must therefore have very calm water. There is no question of the ordinary sea movement. There must be an enormous breakwater&#x2014;a sea wall. This is shown in the developer's plans, but at the present moment the developer is aiming to berth some 250 boats within this quite small area in the southwest corner. That is written on his plan. That number will never pay as a marina. It will have to be much bigger. The developer knows that perfectly well. I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, who said that there are already signs of local people being asked, "What will you sell for?" or warned, "If you are running a boat chandling business you had better get out because we shall run a better one". All this is going on. I know that this is so because I have been down there and talked to the people. This is the danger.<lb/>
The professionals&#x2014;an architect, a fisherman and the leader of the lifeboat team&#x2014;pointed out to me that the aim of 250 boats was pretty optimistic on the scale of the site which the developer is now envisaging. Therefore I believe&#x2014;and I think that noble Lords ought to watch this point&#x2014;that this developer is already thinking of a much extended area behind this great sea wall. It will go half across the bay. Like a great curtain it will cut off the present sea view from Swanage at sea level. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, spoke about the lovely view from the hills behind. Swanage Bay is landlocked by these high hills of lovely countryside. However, at sea level&#x2014;that is what the public are interested in&#x2014;on the beach or on the road which forms a promenade behind the beach the people will be looking into this great wall, 17&#x00BD; feet high above mean sea level. There is a six-feet rise and fall of tide in Swanage Bay on average.<lb/>
<col>314</col>
Your Lordships are now beginning to see a rather different picture. The whole view has gone. Today the Isle of Wight&#x2014;as it was the day that I was down there not a week ago&#x2014;was visible across the sea with the boats going to and from Southampton Harbour; everything is going on that one can think of. But that will all be cut off. It will be cut off because the developer&#x2014;in the opinion given me by the people who were showing me round&#x2014;will have to develop to about 800 to 1, 000 boats to keep the marina profitable, and with some repayment on the capital. I do not believe therefore that this will be an economic proposition at its present size. I believe that it is not realistic to look at this development on that scale.<lb/>
In the future, the enjoyment of leisure, exercise, sea bathing and all the fun of Swanage of the last 60 years, as I have known it, will go. Swanage will close in that respect. It will be a mass of masts, sails and boats, but it will change completely. That is what we have to face. The old place will disappear.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, mentioned the employment of labour. There will be employment, yes, but there will also be unemployment because all the people who run these boarding houses up the hills behind the town will go. We therefore get a completely different picture. In my opinion it is vandalism if it is allowed to proceed because of the powers that exist in this Bill. Unless those powers are restricted, this is what will happen.<lb/>
Surely the mass berthing of yachts should be confined to places that are already developing in that direction&#x2014;such as Poole Harbour&#x2014;or to places that have been overdeveloped in the past by heavy industry, such as shipbuilding. Either of those can provide underused facilities for a yacht haven or marina. These are the places where, in my opinion, the millions of pounds ought to be spent and not at Swanage. It would enable ugliness and decay to be cleared away. The seafarers would be accommodated, and there would be no loss to the landlubber.</membercontribution></p>

We are very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, for the way in which he introduced the Bill and the full explanation that he gave. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, for the Instruction because it gives us an opportunity to introduce some matters which have not been and may not be covered by the petitioners. I am glad to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, that we are not out of order in discussing the Instruction tonight and I hope that the Instruction will be accepted by your Lordships and will go forward if the Bill is given its Second Reading.<lb/>
It can only be helpful for the Committee in its deliberations to be made aware that Members of this House have views and that they ask for due weight to be given to the environmental aspects and to the rights and freedoms of the local community. To the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, I say that I suspect that
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0166"/>
<col>315</col>
yachtsmen are like motorists, and that as the motorist can never have enough car parks so the yachtsmen can probably never have enough havens. Although I can see the attractions from the point of view of the yachtsman, I hope that that will not be given as an overwhelming reason for having the marina because there are other havens available though they may be a little overcrowded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01478"><member>Lord Greenway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not want to stress that the facility would be just for yachtsmen, but I was trying to stress the benefit to the town of Swanage as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01479"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I shall come to that in a moment. It would seem from the debate so far today and from the views expressed by the petitioners that a number of questions can legitimately be put to the Committee. I shall give them not necessarily in order of priority, but in the order in which they occured to me as I went through the papers. First, should further progress on the project await the results of a hydrographic survey? The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, tells us that a report has now been submitted. But we hear from the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, that this is probably a desk job and not one that is based on all the evidence which one would need to carry out a development of this importance.<lb/>
It seems that a proper hydrographic survey is essential because of the possible effects on the beach, which have been mentioned, on the breeding grounds of the many kinds of fish on which the local fishermen depend for their livelihood, and, finally&#x2014;this is something which has not yet been mentioned&#x2014;on the efficiency of the very important sewage outfall. I understand that the district council is very worried that the tidal changes that could be brought about by the development could affect the sewage outfall. We have not heard, if that happens, whether the bill for it would go to the developers or to the district council.<lb/>
Secondly, what effect will the development have on the lifeboat station? This has been mentioned by my noble friend Lord Stewart of Fulham. If the station is to be relocated who will bear the cost? That is not clear either from the debate so far or from the Bill. What guarantees will be given against future costs? I give as an example the relocation of the lifeboat station at Poole which was carried out as part of the harbour development there and in later years the lifeboat station found it had to pay considerably increased rates. This was not considered at the time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01480"><member>Lord Raglan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Baroness. I wish to ask her whether she knows that the lifeboat station at Poole has just been asked for a rent of 10, 000 a year&#x2014;which is more than is paid for the rents for all the lifeboats right round the coast&#x2014;or it will have to move out because it is apparently using that much worth of space in the marina at Poole?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01481"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. I think that reinforces my point very well. That is somethng which must be cleared up by the Committee in its investigations.
<col>316</col>
Thirdly, is it acceptable that a very much used Heritage Coast footpath should be diverted away from the waters' edge, which it is to be, and taken behind a new car park? That surely cannot be acceptable in any terms or in any place, especially in a conservation area.<lb/>
The fourth question is in what will be a crowded haven as we have heard, what action can be taken to guarantee protecton against pollution by the use of anti-fouling paints on yachts and of human waste if these yachts are stored, as they will be, overnight?<lb/>
The fifth question is if the livelihoods of fishermen and pleasure boat operators are to be endangered by restricted access to the facilities which they now enjoy and have enjoyed for generations will there be sufficient compensating new employment as a result of the development? The noble Lord, Lord Wynford, indicated even higher possible loss of employment in the area than I had suspected. This makes my question even more pointed. I hope the Committee will look into the effect on employment in the community as a whole, the gains and the losses, to see whether that too will justify the development.<lb/>
I know that there will be jobs during the course of the development, but they are shortlived&#x2014;I should think two years at the most. The new employment which will be created&#x2014;there will be some directly in the haven itself&#x2014;will be small because I understand that the marina is not to include repair facilities for yachts. I think there is even a question mark over whether there will be wintering facilities for yachts, though I am open to question on that.<lb/>
My sixth question is what weight should be given to the diminished amenity for all those who now live in and visit this quiet harbour? We have heard a lot about it from the noble Lord, Lord Wynford. It is very difficult to put a price on amenity. It is very difficult to say how much it means to the people who live there and to the people who visit, but they certainly visit. Though the yacht haven is put forward as an asset in terms of increased tourism, I suspect that the loss from the spoiling of the harbour for the land-based visitors will more than outweigh the possible gain from seaborne tourism.<lb/>
Finally, the proposed powers in the Bill are very wide. I feel that if the Bill is passed in its present form there seem to be enormous powers for the new development company to change almost everything that they have asked for in the Bill. I could find no restrictions worth talking about on any aspect of the Bill as it stands. This is very worrying and the Committee should pay a great deal of attention to whether or not the powers should be restricted.<lb/>
These are the issues for the Committee. I am sure that in the way of sub-committees of this House the members will give every consideration to all aspects of the Bill. But our debate here tonight can only have been helpful because I feel that we may have added to the evidence which will be coming to the Committee.</membercontribution></p>

and Select Committees in the procedure for private legislation. On the Instruction and the procedure there, I propose that we should follow his advice. I have already indicated that I accept entirely the wording of the Instruction. My only concern was about procedure because it seemed to me that the paints in it were covered in the Petitions. As the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, says there is doubt on that, I readily accept that we should follow his advice.<lb/>
The matters which have been raised this evening should be looked into by the Select Committee. At this point in the debate I shall touch on the main points only where there is a possibility of misunderstanding. In his speech the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, covered a wide range of matters which made clear to your Lordships the anxieties that exist especially in the area. When he was speaking at the beginning about the area of jurisdiction it sounded as if he was referring to the original area rather than the revised and reduced one. I again draw attention to the fact that proposals have already been made to reduce the area from what is proposed by the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01484"><member>Lord Raglan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I understand it there was an original area of jurisdiction with the quay and the pier. Then when the Bill was first mooted there was an extremely large area of jurisdiction. Now the promoters have shrunk this area but it is still considerably larger than the original area of jurisdiction of 1859.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01485"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I simply wanted to be sure that the noble Lord was addressing his remarks to the recent revised area of jurisdiction.<lb/>
There are clearly differences of view on the possible effects in the area but one must bear in mind the offers that have already been made by the promoters and other agreements which can be reached in the Select Committee. I am talking about arrangements for moorings, and so on. These matters can be settled when the Select Committee is considering the Bill. It is certainly not possible to reconcile these here on the Floor of the House so I shall not pursue them now.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Raglan, mentioned the breakwater and the possible effects on the currents and therefore the beach. I remind the House that I said that a hydrographic survey had been carried out and its findings were made available to the Purbeck District Council which was concerned about that. I thought the noble Lord, Lord Raglan, was critical of the residential housing which has now been started. It sounded as though he was critical of the fact that it had been started at all. I must make it clear that that is not a subject of the Bill&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01486"><member>Lord Raglan</member><membercontribution>: No&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01487"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: I said this in my original statement and I must say it again because so far as I know nothing at all untoward has been done. The housing received the appropriate planning permission from the authorities concerned. The noble Lord also suggested that there should be some form of advisory group of local interests when the facilities have been completed and when the promoters are carrying out the management. They have also proposed in
<col>318</col>
paragraph 11 of their circulated statement that an advisory committee of local interests should be set up. I mention that because it accords with the suggestion that the noble Lord made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01488"><member>Lord Raglan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not want to keep interrupting the noble Lord, but he has several points wrong. I was not criticising the development of the houses. I was criticising the fact that they were being offered on the basis of having a berth in the marina. As for the latter point, that is not what I said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01489"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am informed that there is no question of the promoters having made any offer like that without making it absolutely clear that it is subject to Parliament approving it. That has been made absolutely clear.<lb/>
The main points raised by the noble Lords, Lord Raglan and Lord Stewart of Fulham, are ones which should be fully examined by the Select Committee. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, for raising additional points which were not covered in my opening speech, in particular the reference to the last paddle steamer, the "Waverley". I know it from the Clyde which had been its home.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, made some further points which she suggested should be considered by the Select Committee. I endorse entirely what she said, particularly one of her points about the possible effects of pollution. Your Lordships may not know that this is a matter about which I am particularly concerned. Only last week at an emergency meeting I was appointed to be chairman of the Advisory Committee on Pollution of the Sea in succession to the late John Silkin whose sudden and tragic death caused us a great deal of distress. I had been a chairman in the past and therefore I was asked to be an acting chairman and take over very quickly. This has been part of my life in the past and so I am certainly concerned about the environment as a whole. When I say that I was drafted, I admit that I did not get much choice because I was drafted by distinguished Members of both Houses and all parties.<lb/>
I am concerned as we all are with the environment and proposals in the Bill affecting the environment must be examined carefully but I feel that solutions will be found if the Bill goes, as I think we all agree it should, to a Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01490"><member>Lord Raglan</member><membercontribution>: I beg to move, That it be an Instruction to the Committee to whom the Bill is committed that they should have particular regard to the effect of the Bill on the environment and on the character of Swanage and its bay, and should consider whether it is in the public interest that, as proposed by the Bill, a far more extensive area of the bay than hitherto should be placed under the jurisdiction of a private company, and enclosed, for the purpose of commercial development.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time and referred to the Examiners; and it was ordered that it be an Instruction to the Committee to whom the Bill is committed that they should have particular regard to the effect of the Bill on the environment and on the character of Swanage and its bay, and should consider whether it is in the public interest that, as proposed by

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01495">House in Committee accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01496">[The VISCOUNT SIMON in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01497">Clause 1 [<i>Definition of "establishments"</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01498"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<quote>Page 1, line 18, leave out ("63A") and insert ("63B").</quote>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01499">The noble Baroness said: In speaking to Amendment No. 1, I hope it will be acceptable to the Committee if I speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. These six amendments are concerned with appeals against registration. They do not affect the main substance of the Bill but remedy two important omissions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01500">At Second Reading I explained that Clause 3 of the Bill extends the present limited powers of local authorities to attach conditions to the registration of the establishment to which the Bill applies. That is done by means of Clause 3(2), which replaces the relevant provision in the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01501">It has been drawn to my attention that this subsection is defective in two significant ways. First, while it allows for appeals against conditions imposed after registration it does not allow, as was the intention, for appeals against conditions forming part of the initial registration. Secondly, Clause 3(2) does not require local authorities when they intend to make or vary conditions for registration to notify the applicant of that intention or to give him or her an opportunity to make representations and be heard. Amendment No. 5 inserts a new clause after Clause 3 of the Bill. This new clause remedies the omissions I have just described and does so by reproducing procedures similar to those contained in Section 64 of the 1968 Act. The other amendments in this group are consequential. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01502"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: I should just like to record that the Government welcome the terms of these amendments and are grateful to my noble friend Lady Carnegy for them and for their effect, which corrects and improves the provisions on appeals in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01503">On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01504">Clause 1, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01505">Clause 2 [<i>Voluntary registration</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01506">On Question, Whether Clause 2 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
<col>320</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01507"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Could we have some information about Clause 2? I have been concerned about this voluntary registration. It says one queer thing. I considered putting down an amendment but thought better of it. In any case, we have another stage to come and I could put it down then if we are not satisfied. Why have we got this phrase:
<quote>"Any grant-aided school or independent school within the meaning of section 135(1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 (which defines terms used in that Act) which performs functions such as are described in section 61(1) above"&#x2014;</quote>
that is as amended, of course&#x2014;
<quote>"may, but shall not be required to".</quote>
Why do we need the words "shall not be required to"? If you say "may", then the option is there: they may or they may not. Why is it there for that purpose? It is rather strange when you start to read this and try to get to Section 61 of the original Act and then put this in. You get something like:
<quote>"The provisions of this Part of this Act shall apply to establishments to which this section applies subject to the following&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a) section 61(2) and (3) shall not apply;</li>
<li>(b) section 62(8) and (8A) shall not apply;</li>
<li>(c) section 65 shall not apply".</li>
</ol></quote>
Sections 61(2) and (3) actually mean that you do not need to register. Then, "section 65 shall not apply". That is the removal of the person in charge and in control. It is not easy to follow. I am relying upon the noble Baroness to give me an explanation as to why this is here, what it means, and why it is put in this way. It is difficult to follow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01508"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: The voluntary registration applies to establishments which are registered with the education authority, and because they have partly a social work function may want to apply for registration in order to ensure that they are acceptable to local authorities for placing people in those schools, and so on. The local authorities will wish to place young people there if they are registered, but it is not made compulsory because there is no need for it to be. If they do not want to be registered, they do not have to be. They are registered in any case as schools. That is my understanding of it. My noble friend on the Front Bench may have something further to say.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01509"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Surely they are registered not with the local authority as schools but with the Secretary of State, so that the powers in respect of inspection and so on do not rest with the education authorities but rest with the Secretary of State for the Scottish Office. Schools were the entire responsibility of the Secretary of State. For years and years since this Government came to power, and it may well be before that for all I know, they have been trying to get rid of them because the full cost fell on the Secretary of State's estimates. Certainly the local authorities had a responsibility in that they paid for every child who went there. Now that has been changed.<lb/>
I am just wondering whether the local authorities have the power of inspection in respect of the change, although it is fairly well laid down in the Act in respect of what had to be provided and what the Secretary of State demanded in respect of these establishments. I had the impression from Second Reading that the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0169"/>
<col>321</col>
Government were reasonably anxious that they should register. Now we have this specifically telling them that they may register, and underlining it, quite unnecessarily, with the words "but shall not be required to".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01510"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may be able to help the noble Lord. In the first place, there are the List D schools. The position with them is that the former List D schools, which as voluntary establishments are continuing to provide child care services from 1st April 1986, were encouraged to apply for registration under Part IV of the Act. As explained to your Lordships at Second Reading, this is very much in their own interests, and I understand that they have substantially done so.<lb/>
In regard to other grant-aided or independent schools there are only a comparatively small number of residential and grant-aided schools which offer substantial child care services as well as education, but in such cases the Scottish Office will draw attention to the new provisions when they come into force and point out to the establishments concerned the desirability of their applying for registration.<lb/>
It will be explained that it is in their own interests to apply for registration since they are dependent on children being referred from the relevant local authority departments. The fact that schools are providing services such as are provided in the 1968 Act may indeed make it appear that the schools should apply for registration under the 1986 Act, but I think the provision makes it clear that such registration is purely voluntary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01511"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: But what is the effect of subsection (4) on those affected by this clause and subsection?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01512"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: My understanding is that there will be no coercion whatsoever on the independent schools to register, but that they are expected to register as it is understood that it is very much in their interests to do so; and indeed substantially they have already done so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01513"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I think I should have asked the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, about this. Subsection (2) says:
<quote>"Where an application for registration of a grant-aided school or independent school is granted, the establishment shall be entered in the register kept for the purposes of section 61(2) above by the local authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State."</quote>
Then you go to subsection (4):
<quote>"The provisions of this Part of this Act shall apply to establishments to which this section applies subject to the following".</quote>
Here we have another reference to Section 61(2)&#x2014;let us forget what Section 61(3) says&#x2014;and it says, "shall not apply". What does Section 61(2) say? They do not need to register. Here we are talking about their being registered under subsection (2). I know that it is a bit complicated but we have got this more or less at the last minute. We have been rather preoccupied&#x2014;and I know that the same is true in respect of the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy&#x2014;with another matter. The other matter has been carried out so hastily that we do not even have the reprint of the Bill with which we are to deal on Monday. Here we
<col>322</col>
have a Bill which was probably drafted by the same people. It is as complex again and I cannot make head or tail or it. I hope somebody can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01514"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord confirm that he is referring to subsection (2) of Clause 2?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01515"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: No, I am not. I am referring first to subsection (2) of Clause 2, and I am linking that up with what is written in subsection (4)(a) of Clause 2.<lb/>
We start at the back. Subsection (4)(a) refers to Section 61 of the 1980 Act, I presume. It reads:
<quote>"The provisions of this Part of this Act shall apply to establishments to which this section applies subject to the following&#x2014;(a) section 61(2) and (3) shall not apply;".</quote>
However, in subsection (2) we are told:
<quote>"Where an application for registration of a grant-aided school or independent school is granted, the establishment shall be entered in the register kept for the purposes of section 61(2)".</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01516"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: The whole of Clause 2 permits the registration of these establishments under both the 1968 and 1980 Acts, as I said when I first rose, with registration under the 1968 Act being on a voluntary basis. Special provisions are included to disapply certain enforcement and other provisions of Part IV of the 1968 Act which will continue to apply to establishments which are required to be registered under the Act. There are those establishments which, because they have a part of their activity which they desire to register in order that they can become more acceptable to those who might place people in the establishment, will wish to register; but others will not. I think that that is what I said in the first instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01517"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I think that it is, but it still does not make sense when one sees what is written here. I hope that somebody will clarify my mind.<lb/>
The defined term is in the 1980 Act&#x2014;that is, Section 135(1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980&#x2014;and we do not need to worry about that because it is clear. We are dealing with independent and grant-aided schools and we know that certain schools that were under the full control of the Secretary of State are now grant-aided or independent. They will be independent. They were always governed and owned independently but they had a relationship to the Secretary of State and the local authority which was covered by the original Act. Of course Section 135 is the consolidation Act of 1980.<lb/>
I am concerned about the fact that the Bill provides that they may apply for registration under this part of the Act. It goes on to read:
<quote>"Where an application for registration of a grant-aided school or independent school is granted, the establishment shall be entered in the register kept for the purposes of section 61(2).".</quote>
Subsection (4)(a) reads:
<quote>"Section 61(2) and (3) shall not apply;".</quote>
That is the point I am making. Subsection (2) reads:
<quote>"the establishment shall be entered in the register kept for the purposes of section 61(2)".</quote>
Then we are told that Section 61(2) shall not apply.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0170"/>
<col>323</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01518"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: I think that the establishments about which we are talking provide care in addition to education to the same children, at the same time and in the same place. Therefore if one has compulsory registration in parallel in relation to those establishments it would not work. The suggestion is that there should be informal dual registration and that that would be a considerable improvement on the present situation. That is my understanding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01519"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I admit that I have not had the time to go carefully through all the various Acts. However, I looked at them quickly after I had eventually discovered the Acts in the Library. One of them had been missing for a long time. I do not know who was studying it. It may be that the noble Lord, Lord Ferrier, has been studying it. He indicates that he is not guilty. We must try to discover the identity of the person who has been anxious to obtain the Act and blind us all with science. Maybe it was the draftsmen who took it out but then thought they would do better without it.<lb/>
I eventually obtained the Act, but it still defeats me. Let us suppose that at the next stage I table an amendment leaving out subsection (4)(a). I hope that by that time someone will have a perfectly lucid explanation as to what will happen in that event. In the meantime, I shall rest my case and allow Clause 2 to stand part.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01539">The noble Baroness said: With the permission of the Committee, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 at the same time. When this Bill was introduced, the Government were in the process of consulting interested parties on proposals for changes in nursing home regulations. I understand that that exercise is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0171"/>
<col>325</col>
now complete and there is clear support among health boards for an extension of their charging powers. It therefore seems sensible to make appropriate changes by means of this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01540">Private hospitals and nursing homes in Scotland are regulated by the Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act 1938. That Act provides for the Secretary of State to set a fee which health boards may charge applicants for registrations under the Act. This amendment is intended to extend the power of the Secretary of State to enable fees to be set in respect not only of first registration but also for the annual continuation of registration, for applications to vary conditions and for the issue of a new certificate following a change in registration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01541">The effect of these amendments will be to place private hospitals and nursing homes in Scotland in a position as regards fees broadly compatible with that already prevailing in England and Wales and also with the proposals contained in this Bill for residential homes in Scotland. Health boards will be enabled, through the fees collected, to offset more effectively the costs of registering private hospitals and nursing homes and exercising continued supervision over such establishments. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01542"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I thought the noble Baroness said she was taking some other amendments with this one. I did not quite see how this fitted in with Clauses 5 and 6 in respect of nursing homes because I did not think that we were up to the point where we had even mentioned nursing homes. I do not see any reference to that, apart from subsection (2) of Clause 4, which we have not quite come to yet. I am quite willing, however, to take the point.<lb/>
We have been dealing up to now with children, because the social work Act is concerned with children. Here we are dealing with something different, and that is what surprises me. There was a reference in some of the many papers which I eventually received, but rather too late. It made fascinating reading for anyone with my knowledge of the Scottish Office, where a Bill like this is not unusual. In fact it is quite the thing to pass such a Bill at the last minute to a private Member and ask that Member to handle it, when it is the Scottish Office which has been handling it all the time. An unfortunate Minister is told at the last minute, "Oh, we've got this bit of legislation through unexpectedly: it's yours", especially when he is busy with something else. It rather amused me to see what was put out in respect of this.<lb/>
I was concerned here at the reference to private hospitals and to client groups. Am I right in thinking that the "client groups" in respect of nursing homes are not children but adults? That was my reading of it, in what time I had to spare for some of the papers which were belatedly sent to me.<lb/>
Perhaps I should say that nobody in Scotland has written about this Bill at all, nobody in local government, nobody concerned in the actual business. I do not know where it all came from. Certainly it started life and was mentioned and printed at about the end of February this year. It has made remarkable progress since then without a word being said about it,
<col>326</col>
so far as I can understand, in another place. So we really ought to be asking questions about it. That is the first point.<lb/>
The noble Baroness spoke about fees. I think we should be given some information about the likelihood of these fees because, under the Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act 1938, when anyone applied for registration they had to apply in writing and to send five shillings. That was the cost of the fee then, as I am perfectly sure the noble Baroness already knows, I think from Clause 1 of the 1938 Act. I remember we discussed this at home that year. It was the only thing we were concerned about in 1938, the fact that you could open a nursing home for five shillings, provided you met the conditions. I should like to know what the fees are now in that respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01543"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: I appreciate that it has been difficult for the noble Lord to spend time analysing the Bill in his usual careful way, although he has done a great deal of work on it. as one can tell from his comments.<lb/>
What has happened in so far as the amendments to which we are now speaking are concerned, as I think I said earlier, is that there was a consultation going on about changes in the arrangements for nursing homes at the time when the Bill first began its course in another place. That consultation came to a conclusion and this is a convenient opportunity to extend the changing provisions to a different sort of establishment&#x2014;namely, nursing homes.<lb/>
The Bill as it stands is about adults as well as children&#x2014;about old people's homes, as the noble Lord will remember. The Second Reading debate was not about children only: we were talking about homes for adults and old people as well. So it is not entirely unsuitable to do this. The consultation which the Government had has come to a conclusion now and there is support for the notion that additional fees should be charged for registering these nursing homes.<lb/>
The matter is a little complicated because this amendment makes provision for inserting a new clause into the Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act of 1938 and the clause enables health boards to charge fees annually for the continuation of registration in respect of applications for variation in certain registration conditions and for the issuing of new certificates following a change in any condition of registration of a private hospital or nursing home. The Secretary of State for Scotland will prescribe by regulation the level of fees to be charged and the time at which they fall due. So this is adding an extra dimension to the Bill and amending another Act.<lb/>
However, it seems not entirely inappropriate to do so. I did not mention this in the Second Reading debate, as I think I explained informally to the noble Lord, Lord Ross, because, when I received notification that this might be desirable, I myself had not had a chance to look into it and see if I was happy about it. Having done so, I am now moving these two amendments, which have this effect.<lb/>
As to the level of fees, I am not sure whether my noble friend can help us on that or on any other aspect about which I have not been able to enlighten the Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01544"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: Before the Minister replies, I wonder whether he can help me on the question of fees. I do not know whether they are large or small or <i>pro rata</i> with the five shillings charged, as my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock said, for nursing homes in 1938. I know that voluntary organisations very often operate at a deficit in supported accommodation operations. Will they be financially compensated for the new registration fees? Or, better still, will they be exempted from them? As many of them get their money from the local authority, it would seem ridiculous if they were compensated by the local authority and then handed the money over from another pocket. Perhaps that is something the Minister might find it difficult to answer tonight, but I know that some of the voluntary organisations are rather concerned about it. A lot would hinge on how much the fee was. If it was a big fee it could be quite a serious thing for a voluntary organisation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01546"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: As to the level of fees and the impact that fees are likely to have, I hope I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, that as currently proposed they are not too onerous: I think the level is &#x00A3;100. It is suggested that it should go up to &#x00A3;550 for the initial registration cost. The annual charge will be in the region of &#x00A3;15, which is estimated to be a weekly charge per person of about 28 pence, I think.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01547"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: Can the Minister help over the question of whether there will be any reimbursement? A fee of &#x00A3;550 for a voluntary organisation in Lanark, where there is a number of such organisations, would be difficult for them to raise. I doubt whether they would even raise the one year's fee in a flag day in Lanark. How else will they be compensated? Will they be compensated for that very large initial fee? I can understand that &#x00A3;15 later on is manageable but &#x00A3;500 is a very large sum for a relatively small voluntary organisation to meet. Perhaps the Minister would take time and write to me before the next stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01548"><member>The Earl of Dundee</member><membercontribution>: On that point, I should like to say a word to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, about the nature of the discretion that local authorities will have in regard to the fixing of fees. The arrangements are that local authorities will have discretion to charge according to their reasonable costs, in general terms, within the maxima prescribed by the Secretary of State. That of course will allow them to charge less than the maxima either generally or in relation to particular establishments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01549"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: This is subject to what is already laid down in, I think, Section 1 of the 1938 Act. Those who are going to apply for registration under the 1938 Act will need to comply with all the other regulations already there. I do not know whether the noble Earl is aware of this, but they have this control over the persons who are employed and the persons who run the establishments. There has to be either a qualified resident&#x2014;I stress "resident"&#x2014;medical practitioner or qualified nurse.
<col>328</col>
Does this mean&#x2014;remembering what we have already said about Section 61 and the changes we are making there&#x2014;that this is where the adults that were spoken about come in? It has been said that there probably will be adults in these nursing homes. If adults are going to be there, perhaps somebody can tell me how they are going to be covered by a piece of legislation that we have been dealing with up to now. Are these adults going to pay the collective charge or are they going to pay the personal community charge? We were told just the other night that in relation to other hospitals they were covered by that part of the Act dealing with Crown lands. These are not Crown lands, and I think a reference was made at one point that took us from non-Crown lands through to those premises which could come under I think Clause 11&#x2014;the collective community charge.<lb/>
How will these people fare? We are told that there are new developments and people will be taken in there. How are they going to be dealt with under the new Bill? It is important because many of these people could be coming from long-stay hospitals where they have not paid any community charge. But under the Bill, coming half-way out into the community, they are now liable for the community charge. They did not pay anything before in the way of rates&#x2014;in fact we were told just last night that people in long-stay hospitals and people in prison would be under the Secretary of State or a government department. But obviously these private nursing homes are not. What is going to happen there?<lb/>
The noble Baroness may say that she does not know. I do not know either. I usually only ask questions if I already know the answers, just to see whether Ministers know the answers or can get the information on time from the usual charge of the cavalry from here to another place and back again. It is always very interesting. From that point of view, I should like to know whether the adults who are in these nursing homes are going to pay the personal community charge, or is it going to be collective? Is it a good idea that at one time you are trying to get people out of long-stay hospitals into the community and then you penalise them when that is done? That is going to work against the whole principle of the new ideas that are being developed in respect of mental health, and of course it could be physical health as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01550"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord asks questions of enormous interest. But, frankly, this Bill is not about how nursing homes or other establishments are set up. The Bill relates to paying fees for registration and for varying registration. It has nothing to do with whether patients pay the community charge or whether there is a collective community charge to be paid. Personally, I should certainly not be in a position to answer that question. To do that I should have to look back at our discussions on the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Bill.<lb/>
We are now discussing nursing homes. This amendment concerns nursing homes; the previous amendments were concerned with other establishments. The nursing homes might be children's nursing homes or nursing homes for adults. My noble friend gave the type of level of registration fee or fee for altering registration. It is not a very large sum if
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0173"/>
<col>329</col>
divided between all the people who are residents in the nursing home. It is a very small sum and would probably be included as part of the cost per day that is charged to them for residence. I do not think that it has very much to do with the community charge in this context, although, of course, it has for individuals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01551"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: The noble Baroness may think that it will not be a very large amount. But, as I understand it, there will also be a continuing annual fee in respect of inspection and the like. That is something else. I am thinking about the people who own such establishments and what they have to do. If they come under Clause 11, then obviously it will be their task to collect the personal community charge. It may well be that the people with whom they are dealing are not exactly those who can easily fill up forms in respect of rebates and so on. That is something else that will be at the cost of the people concerned.<lb/>
Perhaps the noble Baroness would answer my first question. Is this where the adults that have been mentioned come in? They are mentioned in other papers that the Scottish Office sent to me about six days ago, although I have not been able to read them until today. This is where the adults and the community charge comes in.<lb/>
I do not expect an answer to this question but I am telling the noble Baroness of the problems that will arise in relation to those who register. If they do not need to register, they may decide not to register because of the complexities into which they will be running.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01552"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: The various parts of the Bill mention adults and the establishments in which they are involved. We were also discussing homes for adults in an earlier part of the Bill. This amendment concerns adults or children in nursing homes.<lb/>
As regards the amount that will be added by the cost of registration, if the fees are comparable to those in England&#x2014;the matter that causes the noble Lord so much concern is very similar to an arrangement that already exists in England&#x2014;where the annual fee was set at &#x00A3;15 per place, it would add a sum of 28p to weekly maintenance costs. The level that we are talking about is not enormously high.<lb/>
The adults are in the nursing homes that will be included by this amendment and also in other establishments that are covered by other parts of the Bill. I hope that this is now clear to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01553"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that explanation. I shall not oppose her amendment but I shall think about it in connection with the future progress of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>"After Abolition": Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01563">9.14 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01564"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what response they will make to the report <i>After Abolition</i> recently published by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01565">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, when your Lordships' House debated the 1984 Local Government Bill on the abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan county councils, great concern was expressed from all sides of the House about the impact that abolition would have on voluntary organisations. After all, much was at stake. By March 1986 over 3, 500 voluntary groups were receiving grants from the abolition authorities. Over &#x00A3;100 million was needed if all these groups were to continue without loss. This represented one-third of the total of local authorities' grant aid in England.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01566">In the debate powerful arguments were put forward by many speakers about the danger of the work of voluntary organisations not being maintained. As a result some important changes were made to the post-abolition arrangements. The Government's own funding contribution through transitional funding was quadrupled and the original ceilings envisaged for the collective funding of cross-borough or district projects by local authorities were removed. Following this, most of the 3, 500 groups affected by abolition managed to survive the first year of abolition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01567">Unfortunately the impact of abolition is not yet over. For that reason it seemed important to consider
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0174"/>
<col>331</col>
this evening the report entitled <i>After Abolition</i> which has been prepared by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations in conjunction with the London Voluntary Service Council. I am most grateful to noble Lords who have stayed rather late to consider this important report. It shows that, although people's worst fears were averted, the voluntary sector is still being damaged by abolition. The damage may not always have been dramatic, although in some cases it has been, but it is still occurring. I should like to give a few examples.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01568">The area which has been worst affected by abolition is undoubtedly Merseyside. The former county council provided over &#x00A3;5 million funding to 90 different voluntary organisations. Its support covered a wide range of groups concerned with social provision, employment, training, arts and recreation. Sixty-three of these projects have lost some or all of their funding. Overall funding has been reduced by &#x00A3;2.5 million. Ethnic minority projects, arts projects and unemployment centres have been the worst affected. Even those groups that received funding are now faced with an uncertain future. The new Liberal administration has decided to review all the projects approved last year for transitional funding, which means that these projects have been given grants only until the end of June. When one considers that June is next month, one can imagine the terrible chaos that this must have caused to these voluntary organisations, which are already working in difficult areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01569">London has also been affected overall. As many as 90 projects have lost funding. Most of these have been at local level. However, the position for cross-borough projects has also been made difficult. The confusion that beset the London boroughs grants scheme has created one of the great problems.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01570">As your Lordships probably realise, last year it took the boroughs three months to agree a budget. This year it was even worse. In late November 20 boroughs agreed a proposal for expenditure of &#x00A3;32 million, but ratification by two-thirds of the boroughs is required, which means the agreement of 22 boroughs; so in the end no agreement was reached until the middle of March. This came only after the Secretary of State indicated that he might set a limit of &#x00A3;28.5 million. Of course the chaos was pending as voluntary groups were waiting to hear whether they would get their grant and were faced with the prospect of having to lay off staff or close their doors on 1st April, which was the start of the new grant year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01571">Even now it is clear that the budget is very low. The director of the grants unit has reported that the scheme needs more than this just to refund current commitments, pay the costs of the unit and deal with contingencies. To allow any response at all to new groups and ideas, the committee has had to agree to make savings from its community, employment and arts divisions. As a result, 10 groups were refused renewal funding when they were considered on 8th April.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01572">London groups in receipt of transitional funding are also beginning to experience difficulties as their boroughs are taking over an increasing proportion of their grants. I shall give a few examples of that. In
<col>332</col>
Wandsworth, the council orginally took on a number of groups with transitional funding arrangements, but it now appears to be increasingly reluctant to take on full responsibility for those groups as transitional funding from the Department of the Environment tapers away. There have already been cuts in the funding of the three law centres.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01573">In Tower Hamlets, which is after all another borough which faces enormous problems, the voluntary sector has just been subjected to major cuts. Indeed 60 per cent. of the borough-wide groups have been refused grants in &#x00A3;1 million-worth of cuts. Much of the Tower Hamlets grants budget came through transitional arrangements, and the borough has now decided that it cannot afford to carry on at the same level.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01574">Even in Lambeth, where there is a full commitment to funding ex-GLC groups, there are some problems. The council does not have the staff to administer the funds effectively, so that payments made quarterly are usually late or unpredictable. Voluntary organisations are having to arrange overdrafts to continue staffing and rent payments and, in all the uncertainty, they find it impossible to plan their work ahead properly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01575">There is also considerable concern about the long term. There is concern about the growth and the development of the voluntary sector in the metropolitan areas and the GLC. Both the GLC and the metropolitan areas had a very good record for assisting new employment and training projects. They gave particular priority to black and ethnic minorities and women's groups. Many of those groups had previously found it most difficult to obtain support, despite the very great importance of their work. They were beginning to catch up, but that has now come to an end. So in London the largest category of new groups applying for funding from the London boroughs grant scheme came from black and ethnic minority projects.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01576">I must stress my next point, which I believe is the most important. Without growth and development, the pattern of voluntary sector activity will simply reflect previous years' work. Each year new needs emerge&#x2014;for example, to meet drug abuse, the spread of AIDS, the increase in homelessness and the growth in the number of elderly people. Those are the very areas which require new support and new aid. That is why the voluntary sector must be kept going. If it is not growing, it will not be able to respond to the new demands put on it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01577">Another important impact of abolition has been a virtual end to capital support for premises and equipment. That has taken two forms. First, none of the post-abolition arrangements make any provision for capital grants. Transitional funding is for revenue only and the collective funding schemes do not have their own capital allocations. As a result, groups have to rely on local authorities' existing capital allocations, which are already heavily over-subscribed, and cross-borough or district projects have no funding source to approach.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01578">Secondly, the present capital assets are in danger of being reduced because the residuary bodies are required to dispose of properties owned by the abolition authorities. Indeed in London over 120
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0175"/>
<col>333</col>
organisations in 50 premises are now under threat of being made homeless. Finally, as I have already said, another underlying effect of abolition has been the continued uncertainty which so many organisations have to face up to all the time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01579">So, from what I have said, it is clear that 14 months after abolition the difficulties being experienced by the voluntary groups could become greater. One reason is the increased burden which the post-abolition arrangements are placing upon local authorities as, year by year, central government reduce their contribution. The Department of the Environment's contribution to transitional funding has been reduced this year by &#x00A3;5 million. The Arts Council's funding has also been reduced by &#x00A3;1 million. And none of the Government's funding makes any allowance for inflation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01580">What this means overall is that local authorities are likely to have to increase their contribution to post-abolition funding by as much as 25 per cent. if the same level of voluntary sector activity is to be maintained. And that is before any allowance is made for possible changes in rate support grant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01581">I conclude by highlighting some of the recommendations that the report puts forward. I hope that the Minister will respond to some of them. First, the NCVO suggests that the Government adopt a much more flexible attitude towards the tapering of their contributions. It calls upon the Government to recognise the particular problems being faced by black and ethnic minority projects in obtaining funding and to increase the Commission for Racial Equality's post-abolition budget from &#x00A3;800, 000, as at present, to at least &#x00A3;2 million per annum. The suggestion is made that the Government accept that the collective funding schemes established under Section 48 of the 1985 Local Government Act are not working well in most areas and that a fresh approach is needed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01582">Fourthly, the Government should correct the anomaly whereby none of the post-abolition arrangements makes any provision for capital funding. Collective funding schemes should be provided with their own capital allocation, but not at the expense of local authorities' own allocation. Fifthly&#x2014;I believe that the Government have been thinking about this and that the Minister may have something to say&#x2014;the residuary bodies should be instructed not to dispose of premises occupied by voluntary groups. Instead, these premises should be transferred either to the ownership of the relevant local authorities or perhaps to trusts established under Section 49 of the 1985 Local Government Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01583">Sixthly, the Government should endow trusts in each of the metropolitan areas with part of the assets of the abolition authorities in accordance with Section 49 of the Act. The last recommendation that I should like to highlight is that the Government should accept the Widdicombe Committee's recommendation to double the Section 137 discretionary spending limit from 2p to 4p in the abolition areas. Abolition has effectively halved the amount of discretionary spending by local authorities in the abolition areas, and this is having a very serious impact on economic and voluntary sector projects which often can only be funded through the Section 137 powers.
<col>334</col>
As I said, I hope that the Minister will have something to say which is of positive value in response to the NCVO report. After all, its authors describe the situation in a very constructive manner. They do not suggest that the voluntary sector in these areas is moribund. But they point to the malaise that has gripped parts of it and put forward some very sensible suggestions as to how that malaise might be put right.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01584">9.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01585"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will be grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for asking this important Question this evening. I should like to support the general tenor of her remarks. The report by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, in conjunction with the London Voluntary Service Council, is very fair and balanced. There was widespread feeling among voluntary organisations that the Government's initial plans to replace the grants to voluntary organisations, given by the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils, were, in the words of the report, "inadequate and unworkable". There was great uncertainty and for a time many organisations were preoccupied with the question of survival to their own detriment and that of their clients. There was inevitably and rightly much lobbying by the supporters of voluntary organisations in this House and elsewhere.<lb/>
The result, as the noble Baroness has made clear, was that the Government contribution to transitional funding had been quadrupled and other improvements made. As she pointed out, &#x00A3;100 million had to be found and eventually most of that money was found. However, it was found from 10 separate sources instead of from one. Central government provided one-third of the amount through six sources: the Department of the Environment which contributed to transitional funding; the Arts Council; the British Film Institute; the Sports Council; the Commission for Racial Equality; and London Regional Transport. Local government provided two-thirds of the amount from four different sources: forward funding by the Greater London Council and the Metropolitan County Council; Section 48 schemes, where the boroughs in an area combined together to fund voluntary schemes across the area, such as the Richmond scheme, as I believe it is called, in London; the local authorities additional main programme, including a 25 per cent. contribution to transitional funding; and funding which came from a small number of local agencies.<lb/>
The outcome, as the noble Baroness has said, was not as bad as was originally feared. However, as she pointed out, a number of serious problems still exist. She mentioned the fact that there was no provision for capital expenditure and referred to the problems that were caused with regard to premises and to re-equipment. She also mentioned the fact that there is no adequate funding for new projects and that an unmet demand has built up. One can say that the voluntary services are at a standstill in these areas.<lb/>
The report refers to the establishment in London of a fund to be financed by the London Residuary Body selling the properties it inherited and using those funds
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0176"/>
<col>335</col>
to meet new demands by voluntary organisations. The report also refers to the possibility of a similar development in other areas. I should like to ask the Minister whether he can give, when he comes to reply, any indication of what is happening about that suggestion in the various areas, and whether the funds are being established and will be used for that purpose.<lb/>
There is also a lack of strategical approach in each area because of the variety of sources from which funding now comes. There is no one funding body for the whole area. Then there is the question of imbalance. The fact is that while some areas have done better than before, many others seem to have suffered very seriously. London did not do too badly in that regard. However, even there I understand that 93 voluntary groups have closed. The area, to which the noble Baroness referred, which seems to have come off worst, is Merseyside which seems to have lost 47 per cent. of funding and where 63 groups appear to have closed. I again ask the Minister whether he can refer to that matter in his reply. It seems to be a most unfortunate development in an area which is already suffering in other ways.<lb/>
There is considerable concern about the question of capital provision, about the question of pent-up demand for new development and about the absence of a strategical approach. In addition to that, local government is expected to contribute &#x00A3;10&#x00B7;7 million extra in the second year to offset the tapering arrangements under the Government grants and to cover pay awards and inflation. That is a 15 per cent. increase in the contribution made by local government and is being asked for at a time of considerable local authority financial stringency. That must give cause for concern.<lb/>
Then again, &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;6 million is also required if the forward funding out of the abolished authorities is to be continued. I ask the Minister where the Government propose that should come from; that is, the continuation, if the Government wish it to continue, of the forward funding which came in the first year from the abolished authorities.<lb/>
The noble Baroness referred to the 20 recommendations which had been made by the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in its report. She mentioned and outlined some of them. I will not attempt to summarise them at this point; but I conclude by expressing the hope that the Minister will be able to say that the Government will respond in a positive way to those recommendations and thus give the very important voluntary sector, which the Government claim to support, a welcome word of reassurance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01586"><member>Baroness Darcy (de Knayth)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for giving us this opportunity to look at how the voluntary organisations are faring after abolition, to consider the NCVO's recommendations and to hear the Government's response. The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Banks, have between them achieved a masterly portrayal of the overall view. I shall narrow things down very much and, in comparison, I feel rather as if I am looking through a keyhole.<lb/>
<col>336</col>
Last March, during the debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, on the voluntary organisations and abolition, I looked in some detail at a handful of organisations which were doing a worthwhile and necessary job for disabled people. At that time two had been refused funding, two were uncertain about obtaining funding and one risked being unable to carry out necessary expansion. All said they would try to carry on whatever happened, even if it meant providing only minimal services or cutting out various aspects of their work, because they believe totally in the job they are doing.<lb/>
Today I telephoned them to ascertain how they are doing&#x2014;indeed, whether they all exist&#x2014;and what their prospects are. The first was the Federation of London Dial-a-Rides, which was initially refused funding. Since the funding and running of the Dial-a-Ride service has been taken over by LRT&#x2014;a very satisfactory and welcome solution&#x2014;FOLDAR's role has become one of developing the service, looking after customers' needs and ensuring that they know about the service.<lb/>
I am happy to say that FOLDAR appealed and has survived, and is now called the London Dial-a-Ride Users Association. It had three months of uncertainty and disruption, but fortunately it kept all its dedicated staff. It received enough money to carry on but said that it was a very traumatic period. It has not yet received funding for this year and, again, it will not know until June whether it will receive funding.<lb/>
I also spoke to one of the Dial-a-Ride services. Last year all the Dial-a-Ride services received &#x00A3;5 million from LRT and this year it will be &#x00A3;6 million. While the old vehicles which need replacing are being replaced they cannot expand the service, although membership is increasing at as rapid a rate as ever. There are now about 45, 000 members of Dial-a-Ride but only 35, 000 trips are made every month, which looks like something under one trip per month for people who rely solely on this form of mobility. Noble Lords will agree that that is not much.<lb/>
Another organisation initially refused funding is CALL&#x2014;Cancer Aid and Listening Line&#x2014;which eventually received the amount it required. CALL is a telephone service offering support, information and advice to those who have had cancer. There is no similar service in the area, either statutory or voluntary. It also enables people to meet and discuss problems. At present it appears as though it may not be able to expand as much as had been hoped because this year's grant is just over half of that requested; though the organisation is hopeful that more will be forthcoming shortly. Over 15, 000 new cancer patients are diagnosed annually in the Manchester area so I hope CALL will be able to expand and provide much-needed support.<lb/>
One organisation which had not heard last March whether it is to be funded is the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People. It is an organisation run totally by disabled people to ensure that they have the necessary facilities and support to live independently and to have control over their own lives. The coalition received funding and happily has not lost any staff. But it cannot expand at all. There is no long-term funding. It is reviewed every year and so there is anxiety as to whether it will be in operation the following year.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0177"/>
<col>337</col>
Another organisation in the same position is Lambeth Accord. That project was started in response to the EC's wish to support schemes dealing with social and economic integration. It is supported financially by all statutory authorities concerned. When ESF funding comes to an end, the whole project could close. It is doing a useful job. For example, it provides assessment and training for disabled people. Unlike some other of the ESF-funded projects, it would be unable to become self-supporting. I hope that it will obtain sufficient funding to continue.<lb/>
Another scheme in danger last year of losing ESF funding was the Greenbank project which is based in Liverpool. It is a county-wide organisation which trains handicapped people along with some able-bodied people so that there is an element of integration, in workshops, teaching basic and higher skills. It obtained ESF funding for three years to open a consortium of six co-operatives from 1985 to 1988. Greenbank had to close its first three co-operatives, but reopened them when it received almost the full amount of grant requested from the public authorities, which was then of course matched by ESF funding.<lb/>
Because of that hiccup in continuity, and the eventual shortage in funding, Greenbank is a bit behind with opening up the next three co-operatives, but it feels that it should be able to achieve its target of being commercially viable in 1988 when ESF funding comes to an end. One compensating factor has been that Liverpool City Council and the district councils of Knowsley, Sefton and St. Helens have been supportive and have increased their links. For example, Knowsley
<col>338</col>
has asked Greenbank to do a feasibility study with a view to providing a service for its 16 to 25 year-olds in Knowsley's day centre, training them for work or providing them with work; for example, fitting hand controls to cars.<lb/>
That sounds inspiring and rosy. It is a tribute to the enthusiasm of those at Greenbank. But there were other aspects. Thirty-four youngsters were laid off when the three co-operatives were temporarily shut. Some did not return and some are not in employment. There is also the knock-on effect of uncertainty. The publicity about the co-operative closing resulted in some people gaining the impression that the workshops were also closing. To this day, some people still think that Greenbank is no more.<lb/>
I am delighted that all the organisations to which I talked have survived, but several of them said that they knew of other organisations, just as worth while, which have gone to the wall. I think that what I learnt from those organisations very much bears out what the NCVO's report says about most worthwhile projects surviving; but how real was the impact made by worry and uncertainty and how there is no scope for expansion and growth.<lb/>
I have mentioned only the lack of opportunity for existing organisations to expand. There is of course the whole question of the new organisations to be created to help solve new problems or new aspects of old problems. I look forward to hearing the Government's response. I hope that it will be positive, especially in relation to the NCVO's recommendations for a flexible attitude.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01588"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to congratulate my noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs on asking this Unstarred Question at what seems to be an apt time, because it is just over a year since the abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan councils. It is also just over a year since an excellent debate on the voluntary organisations initiated by my noble friend Lord Bottomley on 19th March last year, which has been mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy, and in which she spoke.<lb/>
There was then only a fortnight to go before the demise of the councils, when there was acute anxiety about what was to happen, and therefore, it seemed a good moment to take stock. Now is also a good moment for this House to give itself a pat on the back, as, without its efforts and the concessions and changes achieved by the House of Lords during the passing of the abolition Bill, voluntary bodies would have been in a bad way indeed. As it is&#x2014;and this has been said&#x2014;most of the 3, 500 voluntary groups have survived. Indeed some, in particular in the arts, have enjoyed increased funding, but 200 projects have lost some or all of their funding. The efforts have been very varied. Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire have done well; and Merseyside, as my noble friend said, has done very badly. This is very sad, as the noble Lord, Lord Banks, said, because we know that it is an area that has acute problems.<lb/>
What should be recognised is the uncertainty and worry that the voluntary groups had to go through before knowing what the position would be, and the loss of morale among workers that that brought about. That was very clear to me yesterday when I read through the debate of 19th March 1986. However, I do not wish to spend time on what happened last year except in so far as it can teach us about how matters can be improved for the future.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs covered the present situation very well in her speech. The recommendations that come in the very thorough and excellent report, <i>After Abolition</i>, produced by the NCVO in conjunction with the London Voluntary Service Council give very good guidance. We hope tonight that the Government will tell us what their response will be at least to some of the 20 recommendations. They have had four months to consider them.<lb/>
In the debate of 19th March the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, repeated the assurances of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, to the House the previous year that it was not the Government's intention to damage worthwhile voluntary activity through abolition. He said:
<quote>"I look forward to a flourishing voluntary sector in our cities for many years to come".&#x2014;[<i>0flicial Report</i>, 19/3/86; col. 975.]</quote>
We hope so too and, if the Minister can give us some reassurances this evening that they are willing to go along with most, if not all, the recommendations, that would be a great help and boost to morale for those very dedicated people who work in the voluntary sector.<lb/>
I do not wish to take up the time of the House in referring to all the recommendations, but I should like to pick out a few for comment. The collective funding
<col>340</col>
scheme for projects covering more than two boroughs or districts under Section 48 of the 1985 Act is not working well. The London boroughs grant scheme needs to be changed. It is difficult to get agreement to expenditure when one needs two-thirds of the boroughs concerned to be of one mind. Last year it took three months to agree a budget. This year it was not until the middle of March that a conclusion was reached. Think, my Lords, of the upset for staff when the start of the new financial year is only two weeks away and they do not know what will happen. I understand that some redundancy notices were issued. Eventually the Secretary of State used his power to fix the amount, pitching it just higher than what the Conservatives had voted for and quite a bit lower than that which Labour boroughs wanted. The system needs to be reviewed.<lb/>
Surely it would be much more sensible to let a straight majority of boroughs decide. There should be a date by which a budget must be agreed. If the present arrangement provides an unworkable system in which the Secretary of State always has to intervene, it rather negates the idea of local authorities relating to local need.<lb/>
The first recommendation deals with the transitional fund tapering. The request for this to be reviewed in the light of the unwillingness or inability of local authorities to produce their percentage of the expenditure seems very sensible, and I hope that the Government can agree to a local authority contribution being disregarded for grant penalty calculations. A sound case is made for not tapering the Arts Council grant and for increasing the Home Office's inadequate &#x00A3;800, 000 to &#x00A3;2 million in order to fund black and ethnic minority projects and to ensure that existing projects continue and new projects have a source of support.<lb/>
A general criticism of the present situation is that it is very difficult to get support for good new ideas. It is more a carry-on-if-possible situation. It is almost impossible to do any forward planning. That is neither healthy nor sensible. There seems to be no provision in any of the Government's calculations for inflation, pay awards and contingencies. The Government should review the difficulties arising from the cash-limited, inflexible funding programmes, and there should be updating to allow for inflation. That is in recommendation 6.<lb/>
Local authorities also have trouble in absorbing the time-expired schemes into main programmes, at the same time as having to contribute more to transitional funding and to arts projects. There should be a more flexible approach by the Government. If local authorities absorb these schemes, the expenditure should be disregarded from grant penalty calculations.<lb/>
The lack of capital funding which has been mentioned is to me another very important matter. It will become more important as the years go by, as existing equipment and premises need renewing or expanding and as new projects develop. One cannot assume that the successor authorities will fund voluntary sector capital projects out of their own allocations. We know how hard pressed they are already for housing and so on. The voluntary sector
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0179"/>
<col>341</col>
has already experienced a cutback. In 1985&#x2013;86 the GLC and the Mets spent approximately &#x00A3;20 million. In 1986&#x2013;87 the only significant example of capital funding was the Section 48 scheme in Greater Manchester, which has funded two large projects totalling &#x00A3;185, 000 and &#x00A3;100, 000 respectively.<lb/>
Projects serving more than one borough or district have no prospect of obtaining capital funding. Recommendation 11 suggests that successor authorities' capital allocations are increased to reflect the need to give grants to voluntary organisations and that Section 48 schemes are provided with their own capital allocation so that the anomaly as a result of which cross-borough and cross-district projects have no access to capital grants is ended.<lb/>
What capital assets there are are in danger of being sold, because the residuary bodies are required to dispose of properties owned by abolition authorities. Recommendation 12 proposes that the Secretary of State uses his discretion to extend the property transfer order to include premises occupied by voluntary organisations so that the local authorities can receive them at no cost. I hope that that recommendation can be agreed.<lb/>
I should like also to mention the charitable trust which was to be provided. The commitment was made by Lord Elton on 20th May 1985. There was to be an endowment off 10 million raised from the sale of GLC land and properties. I understand that the City Parochial Foundation is to administer the trust. Can the Minister tell us how soon the income from this trust is to be available and whether the Government really think that an endowment of &#x00A3; I 0 million is likely to be adequate? The NCVO recommends that a larger sum should be provided, as f 10 million, I understand, was intended to be the minimum level of endowment.<lb/>
The last recommendation I refer to is No. 17, which proposes that the Widdicombe Committee's recommendation to double to 4p the 2p limit under Section 137 should happen immediately in the abolition areas. We have made repeated efforts before, during and since abolition to persuade the Government that the doubling is a necessity. It would restore the financial <i>status quo</i> and enable local authorities to fund more voluntary organisations which cannot be dealt with under other legislation. As recently as two weeks ago at a meeting of the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance the Secretary of State said that he was still considering this. Has he by now come to a decision? I hope the Minister will tell us.<lb/>
There is a lack of overall strategy for the areas covered by the GLC and the Mets which those councils could give and did give in the past. The noble Lord, Lord Banks, referred to that. The intention was that county-wide or London-wide reviews of need would be carried out under Section 48(10) of the Act, but very little progress has been made. In London one section of the London Research Centre, currently based with the London Residuary Body, has been working on a review of need. Elsewhere no reviews appear to have been started. Therefore the fears of the voluntary sector that abolition would cause a strategic policy vacuum have unfortunately been confirmed. There is an urgent need, as the report says, for more
<col>342</col>
priority to be given to those Section 48(10) reviews and the resource implications stemming from them.<lb/>
There is still a great deal of concern about the present system. NCVO is hoping to set up a local government unit to handle local government voluntary sector interaction. This seems to me a good idea. What is the Government's reaction to this proposal, and would they be prepared to fund the NCVO for this purpose?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01589">9.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01590"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, has provided an opportunity to return once more to the subject of the abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan counties. I congratulate her on her perspicacity in picking up this report of the NCVO as indeed has every other speaker in this short debate.<lb/>
Abolition issues were much debated when the Bills giving effect to this policy were before the House. How different is the situation today from those heady days the like of which must have been seen but rarely in the long and distinguished history of your Lordships' House. The GLC and the metropolitan councils have been abolished. They ceased to exist on 1st April, 1986, a point of which the noble Baroness, Lady David, reminded us. The voluntary sector and everyone else must come to terms with that fact. The voluntary sector has had to learn to work with the institutions that are now in place. That they are doing just that is one of the messages that thankfully comes out of this survey conducted by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and by the London Services Council.<lb/>
In passing, I should say that I believe the reason that the worries of the voluntary bodies were worse than they need have been was that those worries were politically exaggerated. However, before responding directly to the report, we should consider the wider effects of abolition.<lb/>
The GLC and metropolitan county councils are already almost forgotten and their abolition has led and will continue to lead to real savings. Abolition has led to successes in five main categories. In manpower savings, more than 6, 000 posts were saved immediately on abolition. The Government predicted 7, 000 posts in the long run. I am confident that this will be achieved as the residuary bodies wind down their remaining activities. This equates to long-term annual savings of some &#x00A3;100 million. Even in the first year, abolition has saved ratepayers some &#x00A3;50 million after deducting one-off staff compensation payments.<lb/>
Secondly, vast amounts of ratepayers' money locked up by the abolished councils are now being released. In the first two years, the residuary bodies expect to distribute approximately &#x00A3;257 million in revenue balances, &#x00A3;173 million in capital receipts and &#x00A3;753 million in capital spending power. And there will be more to come as the residuary bodies sell off additional surplus land and property.<lb/>
Thirdly, it is clear, as the residuary bodies sort out their property portfolios, that the abolished councils were hoarders of property on a grand scale. The
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0180"/>
<col>343</col>
Government are encouraging the residuary bodies to sell as much of the surplus as they can. The residuary bodies currently estimate that by the end of 1987&#x2013;88 they will have generated some &#x00A3;300 million of capital receipts, mainly from the sale of surplus property. The proceeds of these sales will return to the ratepayers, and under-used property, by being released to the private sector, is being brought back into full economic use.<lb/>
Fourthly, functions have been devolved successfully. The chaos and disruption predicted by some has not materialised. The boroughs and districts have absorbed their new or enhanced functions with scarcely a ripple. This has led to an increase in accountability. And if&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01591"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord give way?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01592"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may finish the point, I can imagine that the noble Baroness is about to complain about my speech because I have not referred to the voluntary bodies once. If she will give me time to make my speech in the way that I intend to she will find that there is a direct relevance to everything I have said at the beginning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01593"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: Then it is going to be good news.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01594"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, patience&#x0021; This has led to an increase in accountability; and if successor authorities so choose, it can lead to leaner operation and avoidance of duplication.<lb/>
This takes me to the fifth area of success; namely, the effect on services. It is emphatically for successor authorities to grasp the opportunities presented by abolition for more efficient, cost-effective and relevant services. Some authorities have improved key services; others have chosen to emulate the waste and inefficiency which became the hallmark of the GLC in its twilight year. It is, at last, for truly local electors to decide what they want from their local council. They at least no longer face the prospect of being overruled by a remote and spendthrift county council. We must also remember that the voluntary sector as a whole has attracted very considerable support from the present Government. Several speakers tonight have recognised that.<lb/>
May I remind the House of the answer given in another place on 2nd March 1987 by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. She was asked about government support for the voluntary sector in 1985&#x2013;86. This is the latest year for which data is available. Grants and payments to the voluntary sector by government departments amounted to &#x00A3;268 million. This represents an increase of 208 per cent. since 1979 and an increase in real terms&#x2014;that is, after allowing for inflation. This is quite separate from the payments of &#x00A3;500 million that were made to voluntary organisations under various employment programmes run by the Manpower Services Commission. This is a record of which the Government can be proud and for which we should be given credit.
<col>344</col>
Now answering the noble Baroness's unpermitted question, it is only against the background of savings from abolition and the level of support for the voluntary sector that we can properly consider the NCVO report. I welcome that part of the report which provides a factual survey of the position of the voluntary sector, in the abolition areas in 1986&#x2013;87.<lb/>
Some noble Lords may recall that before and during the abolition exercise there were those who forecast the effective collapse of the voluntary sector in London and the metropolitan councils. I must disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, and I take succour from the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth). It simply has not happened. The report tells us that, in the event, direct and indirect government funding and local authority funding in 1986&#x2013;87 almost matched the funding in abolition areas in 1985&#x2013;86 and provided adequate support for the voluntary sector&#x2014;and this after a very considerable expansion of the voluntary sector, particularly in London, over the previous few years. In some areas arts funding, in fact, increased between 1985&#x2013;86 and 1986&#x2013;87.<lb/>
I take note of the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Banks, when he talked about the general problems of individual voluntary organisations. The funding of voluntary groups is a matter for borough and district councils or for Section 48 schemes. Local councils are in the best position to judge local needs and to decide on spending priorities in accordance with the fundamental principles of abolitions. As I have explained, the local authorities in question have had large amounts of money released to them, and it is up to them to decide how they use what I think I would describe as these windfall receipts.<lb/>
I am afraid that I can give less of a welcome to the recommendations for change made in the report. I shall explain why. My principal reason is that few of the recommendations are fully supported by argument or by evidence in the report itself. I readily accept &#x2014;and the noble Baronesses and the noble Lord have pointed to some&#x2014;that there have been individual hard cases. Much as I regret this, obviously I am not in a position to comment on any individual case for the simple reason that the decisions, as I pointed out, have to be made by the local authorities in whose areas the various voluntary bodies operate.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady David, rather centred on recommendation 11 which asks for an increase in successor authorities' capital allocations. I must say that this would have a direct effect on the government money&#x2014;and indeed the rates-raised money&#x2014;of local authorities in other parts of the country. In fact, the total allocation available to successor authorities has been larger than would otherwise have been the case because no part of the total was needed for the abolished councils.<lb/>
In addition, successor authorities have benefited from a substantial enhancement in their capital resources as residuary bodies distribute capital receipts left by the abolished councils. I have already given some figures for the residuary bodies receipts. To go even beyond this level of support would draw capital allocation from elsewhere in the country.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0181"/>
<col>345</col>
Other recommendations in the report are based on what appears to be a misunderstanding of the position. For example, in recommendation 10 we are enjoined to adjust the assessment of spending needs for the rate support grant settlement to take account of the additional responsibilities of successor authorities. We are reminded that my noble friend Lord Elton gave an assurance in this House that that would be done, and we have fulfilled that pledge. Or again we are asked in recommendation 7 for flexibility over time expired urban programme schemes. I am happy to say that this recommendation is out of date and we already try to offer that flexibility.<lb/>
As regards the urban programme, I make the point that it was never intended as a long-term means of finance for anything, and that from the beginning it is always agreed for a certain life. The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, will be reminded of discussions that we have had between ourselves on this matter in connection with law centres. I recall saying that in exceptional circumstances extra time is given to one or two of the law centres, and has in fact been given on occasion.<lb/>
We are asked several times to increase transitional aid and other central government support to take account of inflation. In some cases provision has already been made for inflation. In others, particularly transitional aid, the basis on which this support was offered was made clear when it was announced. There is no justification for changing the rules, not for reopening the issue of the allocation of transitional aid. It has always been intended as a stepping stone to the takeover by the local authorities concerned.<lb/>
Some recommendations have come forward before. The possibility is raised again of doubling the Section 137 limit for the London boroughs and the metropolitan district councils. My right honourable friend dealt with this very carefully last year. The position remains that he will make an announcement in due course.<lb/>
I am aware that problems have arisen as a result of the European Social Fund funding. As the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), will appreciate, these difficulties are coincidental with, and do not spring from, the abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan counties.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, complained about the amount of money in the Section 48 budgets and said that there was no room for new groups. The London voluntary sector has expanded over the past several years, and at the time of abolition no one from this side of the House pretended that all the organisations that were then funded by the GLC would necessarily continue. It was acknowledged that the local authorities concerned must form their own opinions and judgments of the worth of each and every one of those organisations. It must therefore continue to be open to the Richmond Grants Committee, if it so considers, to withdraw grants to allow space for new grants.<lb/>
The report asks my right honourable friend to make use of is powers under Section 49 of the Local Government Act 1985. The House will remember that under this section the Secretary of State may by order provide for the making of grants to eligible
<col>346</col>
charities out of money received from the sale of land by residuary bodies. Eligible charities are a body of persons or a trust established for charitable purposes only, being purposes which are wholly or primarily for the benefit of the area for which the residuary body is established.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Banks, has said, it was under this power earlier this year that an endowment of &#x00A3;10 million was provided to the trust for London, This money will provide a new long-term source of funding for the voluntary sector in London. In answer to another question from the noble Baroness, Lady David, I should say that I understand that the income from this fund will become available for distribution in about a year's time.<lb/>
The NCVO report contains recommendations that Section 49 should also be used outside London and that the &#x00A3;10 million should be increased. At this stage, all I can say is that my right honourable friend is considering these recommendations and will announce his conclusions in due course.<lb/>
One of the problems which has been alluded to tonight, I think by the noble Baroness, Lady EwartBiggs, is the disposal of premises occupied by voluntary organisations. The noble Baroness will know that the residuary bodies have the primary responsibility for deciding whether the properties vested in them should be transferred to local authorities because they are required in connection with inherited functions or whether they should be disposed of and the receipts redistributed to the ratepayers. My right honourable friend has no power to make an order transferring property to local authorities unless a proposal has first been made by a residuary body.<lb/>
In London of course it has proved necessary to consider the use of my tight honourable friend's power to limit the budgets for Section 48 schemes. The Secretary of State was concerned about the uncertainty that the voluntary sector in London was facing due to the reported failure of the London boroughs grant scheme to fix a budget. I do not know whether noble Lords are aware, but my right honourable friend announced yesterday that he did not propose to make an order in London. He said:
<quote>"As a result of representations made when I met the London Boroughs Grant Committee on 24th March and others received in response to consultations, I have decided not to proceed to make an order under Section 48 of the Local Government Act 1985 to set a ceiling of &#x00A3;28.5 million on the budget for the committee for 1987&#x2013;88.</quote>
<quote>The grant committee has now fixed a budget of the same amount. I wish to demonstrate support for the voluntary sector in London by proposing to exercise my powers. Having considered all representations received, I have decided that it is no longer necessary to proceed further.</quote>
<quote>I am pleased that my action has achieved its desired effect of establishing an agreed budget and of removing uncertainty over the funding of the voluntary groups."</quote>
The noble Baroness, Lady David, suggested that this was something ongoing which had happened for years. This is of course the first time&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01595"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01596"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the first time that an agreement has not been reached within the Richmond Committee; and to suggest that this will be
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0182"/>
<col>347</col>
an ongoing uncertainty is at this stage, if I may use the expression, a bit rich. The noble Lord, Lord Banks&#x2041;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01597"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the Minister will allow me, two-thirds of the boroughs have to agree. The same difficulty as there was this year is very likely to go on with the same uncertainty and doubt, until very near the beginning of the new financial year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01598"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, why should that be so when last year there was not? The noble Lord, Lord Banks, complained of patchiness, and I too recognised that there are particular problems for the voluntary sector in Liverpool. They are however caused not by abolition but by local factors, a point which I suspect he and his party appreciate full well in the current context. District councils have failed to act in a co-ordinated way to provide transitional funding. No scheme has been set up under Section 48 of the Local Government Act to provide support for the Merseyside-wide voluntary sector. We in central government help through the urban programme. Liverpool itself is a partnership area; Knowsley, the Wirral, Sefton and St. Helens are programme authorities; however, the voluntary sector would do well to make its case not to me but to the local authorities on Merseyside. We must see what comes out of today's election and whether a more sympathetic line is adopted there towards the voluntary sector.<lb/>
I know that I take my title from the Liverpool area, but I must confess that it is not an area which I know well. I certainly wish the voluntary sector well in the approaches that I have suggested they make.<lb/>
To sum up, the NCVO report is good in parts and provides a useful survey of the present position of this part of the voluntary sector. It shows that the voluntary sector is for the most part doing well, but the report's recommendations could be better formulated and in some cases, as I have explained, they are ill-founded. In seeking support, the voluntary sector in London and the metropolitan areas must look to the future and not to the past. That future lies first and foremost with the boroughs and districts, which are in a better position than the GLC and the MCCs ever were to judge the needs and priorities of their areas.<lb/>
Perhaps I may make one last point. Quite clearly I have not been able to do justice, in the length of time it has taken me to deliver this speech, to the report. The Government will be publishing a proper response in due course and will take account of the points raised in the House this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01601"><member>Lord Hylton</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01602">Why, in view of all the delays up to now, the case of the "Birmingham Six", which has been recommitted to the Court of Appeal, cannot be heard before 2nd November, 1987.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01603"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (the Earl of Caithness)</member>: Fixing a date for the hearing is a matter solely for the court. We are sure, however, that the court will have fixed the earliest practicable date, bearing in mind the further inquiries which are being undertaken by Devon and Cornwall Constabulary into the allegations made by Mr. Clarke, formerly of the West Midlands Police, and the necessary preparations by the parties concerned.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01614">Whether it is now permissible for a local authority in England to abolish the payment of rates on a half-yearly basis, and to insist on full payment on demand in May and, if this be so, whether there is any reason why the payment should not be made in full in October, as is the practice in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01615"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Lord Skelmersdale)</member>: In England and Wales payment of rates falls due, in full, seven days after they are demanded.

Separately, any ratepayer (domestic or business) may elect to pay rates by a minimum of 10 monthly instalments.

<title>Civil Defence Regulations: PPI</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01621"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the first Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether all the local authorities required to do so under the planned programme for implementation have submitted their plans under the Civil Defence Regulations 1983.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01622"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the PPI is a rolling three-year programme setting a series of monitoring targets for all the requirements of the 1983 regulations. The first target date in respect of plans is 1st October this year. All the initial PPI meetings with individual county authorities have been completed satisfactorily.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01623"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that unexpectedly encouraging reply. Is he aware that some local authorities, ignoring Chernobyl, persist in declaring themselves nuclear-free zones, are irresponsibly breaking the law and are failing to prepare the civil defence plans which they are required to prepare? What do the Government propose to do about such authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01624"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware that any of those so-called nuclear-free authorities are refusing to meet their statutory obligations. As I said, monitoring the planned programme for implementation will help to ensure that all local authorities fulfil their responsibilities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01625"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that a local authority which makes it clear that there is no such thing as civil defence against nuclear war is merely telling the truth?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01626"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if some of the policies of noble Lords opposite were followed, civil defence might be our only defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01627"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord say what part the civil defence co-ordinator has played in this programme? He may recall that the co-ordinator was appointed in 1981. At that time he was said to be preparing a review. What progress has been made? Has the co-ordinator been visiting the local authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01628"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a report on local authorities' preparedness was made available last July. A copy is in the Library of your Lordships' House. It makes it clear that despite encouraging progress in many areas a great deal remains to be done.</membercontribution></p>
<col>352</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01629"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the case that the co-ordinator was responsible? Is he still <i>in situ</i> and doing his work? Will the Minister say what backup, assistance and staff he has?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01630"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. I think that is another main Question. I shall look into the matter and reply to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01631"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not another Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01632"><member>Viscount Mersey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that there are 173 nuclear-free zones, including places such as Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford and Southampton? In view of the recent local election results, would it not be an extremely good plan to remind those authorities now of the duties which will be required of them this coming October?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01633"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, officials have now held meetings with all county-level authorities in England and Wales. They have discussed their work for the coming year. We have been encouraged by their constructive approach. We believe that we have laid a more solid foundation for rapid and consistent progress in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01634"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the light of these exchanges, can the noble Lord clear up some confusion about nuclear-free zones? Is it not true that a nuclear-free zone in the usually accepted sense of the phrase means an area in which there are no nuclear weapons stock-piled, stored or deployed? As that can scarcely be the business of local authorities, would it not be more accurate to say that they are zones free of protection against nuclear attack?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01635"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes. I thoroughly agree with the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01636"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the event of a nuclear weapon dropping in the middle of a large or small town in Great Britain, what are the instructions for civil defence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01637"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the plans are those now being implemented with the local authorities.</membercontribution></p>

volunteers. The planned programme for implemention suggests that initial priority should be given to the completion of detailed operational plans. But as the programme develops we shall be giving increasing attention to the role of volunteers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01641"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that much more realistic reply. Does he agree that those plans cannot be implemented without the help of a large number of volunteers, that some counties have hundreds of them and that other local authorities have none or too few? What steps will be taken to remind those local authorities which are failing to recruit and train volunteers, as they have a duty to do?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01642"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is a wide variation. One county had over 2,000 community-based volunteers and 20 counties had none. However, there was a total nationally of over 18,000 volunteers, and only three counties had no volunteer activity. Under the PP1 naturally we are progressing the volunteer question but, as I said, we are addressing other priorities first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01643"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that civil defence volunteers are chiefly to be found in rural areas and that there are hardly any in urban areas?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01644"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that that pattern has been established.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01645"><member>Viscount Mersey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether my noble friend is aware of the publication <i>Protection from Radiation</i> which is issued by the West Sussex County Council and which applies to urban as well as rural areas? Is he aware that many of us have volunteered and that we have been to Chichester on an assessment of residential buildings course for protection against radiation? It envisaged a truly horrendous scene, in our case a one megatonne bomb on Portsmouth and another on Gatwick. Can my noble friend tell us how many other county councils are as well prepared as West Sussex?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01646"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot of course this morning give exact figures on such matters, but I am pleased to hear about the preparations in West Sussex in which the noble Viscount has been involved.</membercontribution></p>

There is nothing confidential about the fact that the President of the United States is commander-in-chief of all American forces.

<title>Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01668">11.18 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01669"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Lord Lyell)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill now be read a second time. The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill that we have before us this morning is the first thorough revision of the emergency legislation since 1975. The 1978 Act was purely a consolidation measure. In bringing forward this legislation, the Government's aim is to ensure that the security forces have adequate powers to enable them to carry out their onerous and dangerous job of protecting the community in Northern Ireland from the threat of terrorism, while at the same time attempting to achieve the fairest possible system of justice in a situation where, sadly, terrorism prevents the operation of the normal system of justice which we should all like to see. In framing the legislation the Government were guided by the report of the late Sir George Baker on the operation of the 1978 Act.<lb/>
<col>356</col>
The Bill will strengthen the hands of the security forces by cracking down on paramilitary extortion rackets which masquerade as private security businesses; by creating new offences concerning proscribed organisations and the collection of information useful to terrorists; and by allowing longer periods of remand in scheduled cases. The Bill will extend the statutory rights of persons accused or suspected of terrorist crime by changing the law on bail, and on the admissibility of confession evidence, requiring reasonable grounds for suspicion before certain emergency powers can be exercised, and putting on a statutory basis the rights of terrorist suspects in police custody. Other provisions should help reduce delays in bringing scheduled cases to trial.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships will bear with me if I briefly set out the purpose of the various provisions in the Bill. Clause 1 reverses the onus of proof in bail applications involving scheduled offences so that it now rests on the prosecution rather than the defence. It also clarifies the position concerning the power of a magistrate to grant bail into military or police custody to members of the security forces charged with a scheduled offence.<lb/>
Clause 2 enables a magistrates' court to remand a person charged with a scheduled offence in custody for up to 28 days, thus reducing pressure on court resources and reducing demand for policemen to escort remand prisoners. Clause 3, which enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to set time limits on preliminary proceedings in scheduled cases, and Clause 4, which enables the Lord Chancellor to direct that a particular trial of a scheduled offence be held elsewhere than at Belfast, are both intended to help reduce delays in bringing such cases to trial.<lb/>
Clause 5 provides that a statement made by an accused shall be inadmissible if there is evidence that it was obtained by the use or the threat of violence. It also declares that the judge has a discretion to exclude statements in the interest of fairness to the accused or in the interests of justice.<lb/>
Clause 6 in effect abolishes the power of arrest under Section 11 of the 1978 Act. Your Lordships will be aware that this enabled a member of the RUC to arrest without warrant any person whom he suspected of being a terrorist, and to detain that person for up to 72 hours. Sir George Baker commented on the overlap which arose in Northern Ireland between this power and the UK-wide police arrest power conferred by Section 12 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984. He also commented on the confusion which this could generate.<lb/>
The Government's response has been to propose the repeal of the police arrest power in the 1978 Act, leaving the RUC to rely on Section 12 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act as the main emergency arrest power in Northern Ireland. Under that section the RUC may still arrest persons without warrant but they must have reasonable grounds to suspect&#x2014;that is an interesting rider&#x2014;that such persons have been involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorist acts, or are in breach of an exclusion order, or have committed an offence under the Act. Another difference is that the maximum length of time for which the RUC may on its own authority detain a person following an arrest under Section 12 of the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0187"/>
<col>357</col>
1984 Act is only 48 hours, though that period can be extended by the Secretary of State for a period or periods not exceeding five days. The power of a constable to enter and search premises for the purposes of making an arrest of a suspected terrorist&#x2014;which had featured in Section 11 of the 1978&#x2014;is, however, preserved by Clause 6.<lb/>
Clause 7 reflects developments in the technology available to terrorists by extending the powers of search and seizure under Section 15 of the 1978 Act to cover such things as scanning receivers as well as transmitters. Clause 8 confers on the Secretary of State a power to authorise the closure and continued closure of highways. As your Lordships will be aware, many border roads in Northern Ireland are closed under the authority of a general order made by the Stormont Minister for Home Affairs in 1970. In view of the political, economic and social consequences of road closures, the Government believe it right that all closures should have the specific authority of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
Clause 9 amends Section 21 of the 1978 Act by creating offences concerning meetings in support of proscribed organisations; such offences already exist in Great Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.<lb/>
Clause 10 amends Section 22 of the 1978 Act, which makes it an offence to collect information likely to be useful to terrorists about members of the security forces and the prison service, holders of a judicial office and officers of the courts. The clause extends this protection to former members of any of these categories. As originally drafted, the clause would also have included elected representatives, but it was amended in another place after two of the honourable Members most closely concerned unselfishly objected to being singled out for protection in this way.<lb/>
Clause 11 amends Section 25 of the 1978 Act to bring the offences concerning dress and behaviour indicating membership of or support for a proscribed organisation into line with the equivalent offence in Great Britain. Clause 12 improves the arrangements for compensation for damage caused by actions carried out under the Act.<lb/>
Clause 13 makes the 1978 temporary provisions Act renewable annually, rather than every six months, and provides for the whole Act to be repealed after five years. This reflects the Government's view that the emergency legislation should not remain in force longer than necessary.<lb/>
We then gravitate to Part II of the Bill, which puts on a statutory basis the rights of a person in police custody under the terrorism provisions to have someone informed of his location and to have access to a solicitor. It specifies the circumstances in which the exercise of these rights may be delayed. The provisions are broadly comparable to Sections 56 and 58 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 as they apply to terrorist suspects in England and Wales.<lb/>
Part III provides for a new regulatory scheme for the private security industry in Northern Ireland. This does not detract from the Government's general view that the security industry should be self-regulating, but in Northern Ireland there is a particular problem which requires legislation. Paramilitary organizations
<col>358</col>
are known to use some security firms as a front for extortion and intimidation. The Bill tackles this menace by making it an offence to provide or offer security services without a certificate from the Secretary of State.<lb/>
Many people have argued that the Bill does not go far enough towards dismantling the emergency legislation. In the view of the Government the continuing security situation remains sufficiently serious to justify exceptional measures. The events of the past few weeks have&#x2014;sadly and starkly&#x2014;supported this view. The emergency legislation which applies in Northern Ireland must strike a balance between protecting the individual rights of persons suspected or accused of involvement in terrorism and enabling the security forces and, let us not forget, the courts to deal effectively with terrorism, in the interests of protecting the whole community.<lb/>
It is a difficult balance to strike, but this Bill has provided an opportunity for Parliament to consider the emergency legislation and to adjust the balance slightly in a number of areas. The Government believe that the Bill as amended in another place strikes the right balance. We were encouraged by the constructive spirit in which the Bill was debated in the other place, and I look forward to equally interesting and useful debates during your Lordships' consideration of the Bill. With that, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01670">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01671">11.29 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01672"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should say at the outset that we welcome this important and long overdue Bill, although we are sad that there is a need for it. A Bill relating to the affairs of Northern Ireland makes a very rare appearance indeed in your Lordships' House. In the lifetime of the present Parliament this is the only Northern Ireland Bill to have come before it. That is not to say that there has been no legislation relating to Northern Ireland. In the past 12 months about a dozen Orders in Council made their contribution to the life of the Province, dealing with such important matters as education, local government, social need, mental health and public order; but Orders in Council, as has so often been observed in your Lordships' House, cannot be and have not been amended.<lb/>
It may strike some people as odd that this Bill, which has taken such a long time to reach this Chamber, may yet be denied a Committee stage in your Lordships' House. We on these Benches have no brief for violence in order to achieve political ends. In the present bleak circumstances in Northern Ireland we have no choice but to support the continuance of emergency provisions for the Province. Emergency legislation of some kind or another will be necessary so long as the problems posed by the paramilitary bodies cannot be defeated. Regrettably, the fact remains that hardly a week goes by without weighty evidence to show that the paramilitary forces have not as yet been defeated. Indeed, there is evidence that their campaign may currently be escalating.<lb/>
Parliament is always reminded, as it was reminded by the Minister this morning, that when it considers
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0188"/>
<col>359</col>
this kind of legislation it has throughout to try to strike a balance between the maintenance of civil liberties and the protection of the community from acts of violence. Most of us assent to the philosophy of the balance, at least in abstract terms, but there are one or two difficulties with this concept. First, how do we know whether we are achieving the correct balance in practice? Secondly, the concept itself implies the erosion of civil rights which in turn may be counterproductive because it undermines public confidence in the legal system. There is that difficulty about the concept of balance.<lb/>
Last November, in a notable speech to the Institute of Foreign Relations in Munich, Mr. Nicholas Scott, for whom we on these Benches have great respect, reflected publicly on the lessons the Government have learnt in the course of the sustained disorder in the Province. Mr. Scott said:
<quote>"I believe democracies have to be careful in seeking to defend their democracy by not adopting means which play into the hands of the terrorists, and therefore I think we should seek to derogate as little as possible from the normal standards of justice and government which we would normally apply".</quote>
It is therefore right that there should be an independent review of the emergency legislation periodically; indeed, possibly annually.<lb/>
Four years ago, the late Sir George Baker, on the initiative of the Government, considered carefully how the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 was working out on the assumption that temporary powers were necessary. Sir George completed his review and reported within a year. That was the last time there was a review of this legislation. His report contained 74 recommendations. I think it is generally agreed that he did not recommend any radical departure from the provisions of the 1978 Act. Some of the recommendations have been implemented by administrative action and a few have been embodied in Orders in Council. This Bill gives effect to a number of the other recommendations, while it also incorporates matters not referred to in the report.<lb/>
According to the information I have received from the office of the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, it seems that when this Bill becomes part of the law of Northern Ireland about 60 of the 74 recommendations will have been implemented. I think it would be helpful to those who are concerned with the impact of emergency legislation if a list of the Baker recommendations which have been accepted by the Government were to be placed in the Library of the House. I shall refer in my speech to the Baker report because it is an authoritative document based on careful and detailed consideration of the evidence, sometimes confidential evidence, which was made available to Sir George.<lb/>
We welcome Clause 1, which as the Minister has explained transfers from the defence to the prosecution the onus in bail applications of proving why bail should not be granted pending trial. However, the clause does not provide a presumption in favour of bail. We also welcome Clause 6, which repeals the police powers of arrest without warrant contained in Section 11 of the 1978 Act. But as the police will continue to have the power to arrest under
<col>360</col>
Section 12 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1984, can the Minister explain what is the real significance of the repeal of Section 11?<lb/>
We confess to some unease that the Bill does not repeal the powers of the Secretary of State contained in Section 12 of the 1978 Act to detain a person without trial. Perhaps I may read just a few sentences from paragraph 235 of the Baker report where he discussed the possible repeal of the detention powers. He said:
<quote>"The case for the repeal of Section 12 is pressed not only by the various bodies concerned with human rights, as is to be expected, but by many others, including those who have been involved in operating detention. A summary of their experience is that detention never worked and will never work; it is always counterproductive in the end".</quote>
Given this authoritative and unqualified view of Sir George Baker, do the Government have a convincing case for retaining this power?<lb/>
We approve Clause 5, which strengthens the guidance for excluding alleged admissions made by an accused in criminal proceedings for a scheduled offence. The clause adopts the substance of Sir George Baker's suggested draft wording. Henceforth a statement will not be admissible if the accused was subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment&#x2014;and here the clause follows the wording of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights&#x2014;or if he was subjected to violence or threat of violence in order to induce him to make a statement. It was strongly argued in another place that a statement should be admissible only if it was made voluntarily, which is the position in England and Wales. Will the Minister explain why the criteria for England and Wales are not being applied in Northern Ireland?<lb/>
Clause 12 of the Bill deals with the compensation payable to a person whose property is taken, destroyed or damaged by members of the security forces in the course of their duties. There appears to be some uncertainty about the principles which determine the payment of compensation and also about the claims procedures. Claims have to be submitted within 12 months of the date when the damage or destruction occurs, but it may be the case that the damage&#x2014;for example, damage to the foundations of a building or damage to underground drains&#x2014;could not be apparent within 12 months of the date of the act which caused the damage.<lb/>
Perhaps the Minister can tell us what percentage of claims have not been settled within 12 months of their submission to the department. I am told that there is a backlog of cases. If that is right, what is the cause of the delay? I think it is for consideration whether this criticism is justified and whether the principles and procedures of compensation could be clarified or modified, possibly along the lines of the relevant section of the Coal Mining (Subsidence) Act 1957 or the Latent Damage Act 1986.<lb/>
The Minister has explained that Part II of the Bill brings the law into line with the relevant provisions of Sections 56 and 58 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. This provides a right for a person who is detained under the emergency provisions to have a friend or relative told that he is being detained and where he is being detained. It goes on to provide a right of access to legal advice for the detained person.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0189"/>
<col>361</col>
These provisions were not referred to in the Baker report. But they are decent rights and we very much endorse them. We are particularly pleased that the Government accepted an opposition amendment in the other place that a detained person must be informed of these rights. We note however that the exercise of them can be delayed on many different grounds, and we are mindful that unjustified delay affects the quality of justice.<lb/>
We approve Part III of the Bill which seeks to choke off one important source of financial support for the paramilitary bodies. It must be the Government's hope that Clauses 17 to 23 will be effective in preventing such organisations from managing protection rackets under the cloak of security services. In practice, it may well be that the effectiveness of Part III of the Bill will depend on the willingness of people to give evidence, and possibly also on the definition of security services.<lb/>
Turning to Part IV of the Bill, I should like to say how much we welcome Clause 25 and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 1. The effect of these provisions is to substitute the words "has reasonable grounds to suspect" for the word "suspect" in the context of the powers of arrest and search specified in Schedule 1. But it is still not clear to me why these amendments should be described in the heading of the schedule as "minor amendments", or even as a rider. In each case we believe that the amendment is a helpful step forward.<lb/>
I wish now to mention three omissions from the Bill. We believe that an important omission is Sir George Baker's recommendation that a prisoner held in custody for over 12 months for a scheduled offence without having been committed for trial should automatically be granted bail without surety. I understand that about 12&#x00BD; per cent. of the prison population in Northern Ireland are persons awaiting trial, though not necessarily for the scheduled offences. The average period of remand in Northern Ireland for a scheduled offence is 15 months, but in some cases it has been more than two years or even three years. This is clearly unsatisfactory. Many people are greatly troubled about long detention as it can affect the individual and his family.<lb/>
We acknowledge that Clause 3, which was added at Report stage in another place, goes some way to meet the criticism. This is the clause which allows time limits to be set through regulations by the Secretary of State seeking to ensure that the system operates without undue delay. Again, it would be helpful if the Minister could explain to the House why the Government have rejected this clear recommendation by Sir George Baker. They have therefore failed to provide in the Bill a specified time limit to the period in custody.<lb/>
There is still much concern that the right to jury trial is not available for the scheduled offences. I accept however that there is a division of opinion on this issue. I, for my part, accept that it is unrealistic to restore jury trial for terrorist offences because of the problems of intimidation of the jurors. But this places on the Government a duty to keep the scheduled offences and the discretion of the Attorney-General to certify cases out of the schedule under constant review.
<col>362</col>
As I understand it, the scheduled offence is a concept essential to the emergency legislation because the purpose of the schedule was to impose non jury trial upon those offences thought to be commonly committed by members of paramilitary bodies.<lb/>
Many of those who have studied the evidence about those scheduled offences which have come to trial would like more cases to be channelled back into the normal jury system. This has been supported by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland. In general, Sir George Baker went along with the advice of the standing commission and recommended that the Attorney-General's discretion to certify cases out of the schedule should be extended.<lb/>
Among the offences Sir George recommended should be capable of being certified out, where there was no observable connection between the particular case and terrorism, were robbery and aggravated burglary. Again, we appreciate that the Government have gone a considerable way to accept the Baker recommendations in respect of increasing the discretion of the Attorney-General to schedule out. But they have not increased the discretion in respect of these two particular offences where it is known that there is no connection with paramilitary bodies.<lb/>
The significance of these two offences in this context is to be found in a study carried out by Mr. Desmond Webb who concluded that a substantial number of convictions under the Diplock procedures were related to robbery and aggravated burglary and had no connection with terrorism. It would appear to us that where there is no such connection, then the accused ought to have the benefit of jury trial, and that it ought to be possible for the Attorney-General to certify the offences out of the schedule.<lb/>
There is one other omission to which I want to refer. As I understand it, there is disappointment among many members of the Catholic community that advantage has not been taken of the new legislation to place some limitation on the right to stop and search the citizen at random. That is to be found, I believe, in Section 15 of the 1978 Act. There is a great deal of evidence which suggests that the power is being abused, and that it is being used too often to harass the citizen.<lb/>
If that is so, then the citizen has a genuine grievance which should be tackled. When this abuse of power was discussed at Report stage in another place, the Minister of State promised to consider what had been said in favour of placing some limit on the exercise of the power to stop and search at random, but the Government have not produced an amendment. Are we therefore to conclude that they do not consider that there is evidence of real grievance arising out of the exercise of this power?<lb/>
I have tried to cover some of the main grounds of this important Bill and I have indicated our concern over some omissions. In conclusion, we would emphasise the pretty obvious message that when the Bill becomes part of the law of Northern Ireland it will be of help to the security forces. But the Province will still be faced with the immense task of seeking a political solution to its problems. It must be an earnest hope that the political parties in Northern Ireland, which themselves reflect the divisions in Northern
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0190"/>
<col>363</col>
Ireland, will decide that at long last the time has come for them to concentrate on the common goal of restoring peace to their land and to their people, and to work together to that end.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01673">11.50 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01674"><member>Lord Hampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill. It is not an occasion to seek party political advantage, despite the circumstances in which we may find ourselves next week. I think that the British people can be proud, despite the abuse and criticism poured on them from some quarters in Northern Ireland, that an attempt is still being made in this Bill better to see that justice is clearly and impartially carried out.<lb/>
We regret that the Bill is necessary but we accept that at present it is. The Bill follows the careful survey of the position by Sir George Baker a little time back. As we are told, the Bill contains provisions which are intended to strengthen the authority's hand in the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland while extending the statutory protection given to the rights of persons suspected or accused of terrorism. I hold in contempt extremist leaders of both communities who, despite the agonies experienced. in the Province over the past 17 or 18 years, seem still not to have learnt the first thing about the value of co-operation, conciliation or compassion.<lb/>
The Bill had a harmonious Third Reading in the other place and we on these Benches support it. There are one or two points where we have criticisms to make and I shall raise these in a brief survey. We regret that Diplock courts are to continue to act under only one judge. For some time we have pressed for there to be three judges as is the case in the Republic. The 12th annual report of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights (page 59) argues the case fairly. There would not be a better quality of justice, for tribute is paid to the present judiciary, but it would be seen and seem to be fairer. We accept that this would be the best arrangement at present when the possibility of intimidation makes trial by jury unfortunately impossible. The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, has also touched on this point. We support the fact that a number of categories of cases are to be removed from the schedule lists.<lb/>
Another cause for concern, not mentioned but relevant to the Bill, is the talk of the reintroduction of internment. We should like our strong opposition to even a remote possibility to be placed on record. The experiences of the early 1970s should surely show that, while a number of known troublemakers may be picked up and taken into custody, it is at the price of arousing a great deal of from the supporting community at home.<lb/>
We are also concerned, as clearly are the Government, that the time that accused people are held in custody before being brought to trial is far too long, and in many cases it can lead to a feeling of unfair treatment. The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, mentioned that matter. We welcome the fact that at least some schedule cases will, by the terms of this Bill, be heard other than at Belfast Crown Court, thus reducing the pressure on court accommodation. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies,
<col>364</col>
mentioned, in his report Sir George Baker recommended that persons having been held in custody for 12 months without having been committed to trial should automatically be given bail. The Government do not seem prepared to accept that, and we regret it.<lb/>
Following Clause 1, we agree that the onus should be on the prosecution to show where bail should not be granted. We support Clause 2. It makes sense that a magistrate should be allowed to remand a person charged with a scheduled offence in custody for 28 days, and not have to have him brought forward every seven days, taking up time and causing inconvenience. Clause 5 deals with the admissibility of evidence. I am surprised that it is still necessary to say that it is inadmissible. I quote from the explanatory memorandum:
<quote>"if evidence is adduced that the accused was subjected to violence or the threat of violence".</quote>
But of course we support this clause.<lb/>
Clause 10 extends the categories of person about whom it is unlawful to collect information likely to be useful to terrorists. We note with interest that MPs and Peers were removed from the list as a result of the action of Members in another place. Clause 11 makes it an offence for a person in a public place to dress or to wear, carry or display any article in such a way as to arouse reasonable apprehension that he is a member of a proscribed organisation. But will it be possible to enforce this against the hooded thug? Turning to Clause 13, it makes sense that temporary provisions of the Act should need to be renewed annually, while the whole Act will be repealed after five years. We support this.<lb/>
Part II, Clauses 14 to 16, deals with the rights of persons detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Northern Ireland. We accept the need for some restriction on access to legal advice. Part III, Clauses 17 to 21, contains provisions requiring the certification of private security businesses in Northern Ireland. It seeks to make illegal protection rackets run by those who are members or close associates of paramilitary organisations. We certainly support this policy, but how far illegal intimidation can be reduced by this measure is very much open to doubt. It is at least a step in the right direction.<lb/>
With those brief comments, I repeat that in general we wish the Bill well. I take the opportunity also to repeat that we remain as convinced as ever that the way forward must be progress under the terms of the Anglo-Irish agreement. We hope that after a general election a more positive attitude will be taken by both communities in Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01676"><member>Lord Dunleath</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for kindly having invited some of us to meet him earlier this week to discuss the provisions of the Bill. I regret that unfortunately I could not be present but I am grateful for the comprehensive brief which his department was good enough to supply.<lb/>
In my view, and in the view of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the Bill is generally to be welcomed. However, I add the words "as far as it goes". Noble Lords have quite rightly pointed out that a balance must be achieved and preserved between civil rights on
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0191"/>
<col>365</col>
the one hand and the prevention of terrorism and maintenance of law and order on the other. I fully recognise that that is a difficult balance to achieve.<lb/>
I turn to look at a few of the provisions. Clause 1 appears to bring the law of Northern Ireland into line with the Bail Act 1976, which is effective in England and Wales. That is a perfectly sensible provision. Clause 3 is most important because it has been a grave injustice that on many occasions those who have been apprehended but not yet convicted have had to spend long periods of time on remand in custody awaiting trial. In some cases it has been up to two years. It is worth bearing in mind that two years spent on remand in custody is the equivalent of a four-year jail sentence with 50 per cent. remission. That is quite clearly unjust and I sincerely hope that the Bill before your Lordships' House today will have the effect of drastically reducing these incidents of delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01677"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to add something? I agree entirely with what he has said. However, there is a feature which arises not only in Northern Ireland but also in this country, although it occurs much more often in Northern Ireland. It is that the accused is happier to be where he is and deliberately delays his case coming to court. My feeling is that any arrangements made ought to make it clear that this kind of thing puts him out of court as regards appealing for an earlier trial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01678"><member>Lord Dunleath</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his intervention and I am very interested to hear what he says. In fact when I was elected representative I never received complaints from the family of a prisoner because his trial came forward too soon. It was always the other way round: "My father/brother/son has now been languishing in custody for 18 months and there is still no word of his trial coming up".<lb/>
As I say, I was interested to hear what the noble Lord said, but I think in this context there is truth in the saying, "Justice delayed is justice denied". It should be the right of all those who are awaiting trial to have justice meted out with the minimum of delay. So this is to be welcomed and is in accordance with Sir George Baker's recommendation. The Secretary of State's discretionary power to deal with extraordinary or unusual circumstances is also provident.<lb/>
I welcome Clause 2 because before now in your Lordships' House I have had occasion to voice my disquiet about the apparent liberty the paramilitaries have to thumb their noses at the security forces and at the law-abiding population&#x2014;indeed, they probably offend quite a lot of the mourners as well&#x2014;by turning up at funerals in paramilitary gear, firing shots over the coffins and so on. I sincerely hope that this clause will eliminate that in future, recognising what a very tricky job the police have in dealing with such sensitive situations.<lb/>
Part II seems to be based on the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. As such, I think it is consistent and makes sense. Part III is most welcome; indeed, it is long overdue. Reference has been made to the protection rackets that have been enabled to operate as
<col>366</col>
a result of so-called security services. I think also there have been worse things even than that, with so-called security men abusing their position of trust so as to get information about properties they are supposed to be guarding and then passing on that information, which is very useful to people who want to burgle the property.<lb/>
Having welcomed those clauses, I must ask whether the Bill goes far enough. Many suggestions have been made in the past to the effect that the Diplock courts ought to have three judges presiding rather than one. I was hoping that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, might have been down to speak before me, because I am sure he knows more about this than I do. One argument against having three judges is that it would put too much pressure on the judiciary, but the noble Lord may be able to throw some light on that argument. The noble Lord, Lord Hampton, urged that there should be three judges, and that would be our view as well.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, suggested that with certain offences of a less serious nature trial by jury might be resumed. This is something that we would welcome where possible. One recognises the difficulties and the risk of jurymen being intimidated. But a move towards normality of that sort and towards justice as we always used to know it in a democratic state would be welcomed if it could be brought about. I was interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, say that this would he in accordance with Sir George Baker's recommendation.<lb/>
However, having said that any movement towards normality is to be welcomed, I am sorry to have to add that just at the moment one has to concede that Northern Ireland has receded somewhat from normality in the last few months. One of the factors which would make a significant difference and which is not covered in this Bill would be the elimination of the right of silence. That again is the sort of thing that one does not like to have in a democracy, but unfortunately a substantial number of suspected persons who are taken in for interrogation when faced with questioning say absolutely nothing. And that is their right. They can sit there and have questions fired at them, and they can just look at the wall opposite, the floor or the ceiling and say nothing at all.<lb/>
This makes the job of the police very much more difficult. There might be an argument that in the same way as a suspected drunken driver is guilty of an offence if he declines to give a sample, the suspected terrorist would be guilty of an offence if he declined to answer questions. I know that this is something which is unpleasant and not entirely acceptable in a democratic state.<lb/>
On the matter of remission, so far as I understand it, if the prisoner keeps his nose clean he gets 50 per cent. remission automatically. This means that even prisoners who have been given what one would normally regard as heavy sentences get back into circulation again fairly soon. There was the example the other day of a gentleman who had bad luck. He had come out of prison after seven and a half years (serving, I think, half of a 15-year sentence) and within a couple of weeks he was once again trying to plant a bomb. Unfortunately for him, it went off in his hands
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0192"/>
<col>367</col>
so that he is no more. But the fact that after seven and a half years in prison he was able to get back into active service with the IRA so soon indicates that all is not what it ought to be. I wonder whether 50 per cent. remission is perhaps too freely given and whether there ought to be more strings and more conditions attached.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hampton, expressed his feeling of revulsion at the very thought of any type of internment being reintroduced. I should feel similar revulsion, but I must report to your Lordships that there is a school of thought that the present level of violence is just containable while things remain the way they are and the only way to reduce it is to round up the godfathers&#x2014;those who do not run the risks themselves or get their hands dirty but who plan and organise the acts of terrorism. Internment of any sort is something against which I argued in the early 1970s and I should be very hesitant to see it happen again now; but perhaps Her Majesty's Government should be aware, if they are not already, that there is a school of informed thought which feels strongly that such a measure should be considered.<lb/>
Whatever is done in this field will not be effective in the absence of full co-operation with the security forces in the Republic of Ireland. Looking at the tragic murder a short while ago of Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, one wonders whether that co-operation is all that it ought to be. How that car could have been left between the two frontier posts unattended, with a bomb inside, if the security forces on both sides of the border had been acting in full concert and had been fully alert, is difficult to understand.<lb/>
That leads me to ask what results we have yet seen from the Anglo-Irish Agreement, where cross-border agreement was one of the most significant results that were predicted. Northern Ireland still has on display its "Ulster says 'No"' banners. They are getting a bit bedraggled by now, which is perhaps symptomatic of the campaign itself. I did not say no at the tme when the agreement was debated in your Lordships' House in November 1985. I said, "Yes, but". I said "yes" to the objectives of the agreement, which we would dearly like to see realised. I said "but" to the question of whether it would work. Now, 18 months later, what do we have to show for it? Those who have said no from the start can throw in the faces of people like myself and my colleagues, who said that one should not just shout "no" but wait and see whether it worked, the question, "What can we see 18 months later? What results are there to show for it?". That is a difficult question for us to answer.<lb/>
I sincerely hope that Her Majesty's Government will find it possible to instil a little more confidence in the mind of the public by letting results be seen. I know that many of the things that take place have to happen behind closed doors for security reasons, but I believe that confidence would be reinforced if results from co-operation between the two police forces could be seen. After 18 months one would expect to see results from two forces which, so we are told, have been working closely together for the previous 14 years.<lb/>
I welcome the Bill but I wonder whether it goes far enough. Certainly it cannot do any harm but I doubt
<col>368</col>
whether we shall see any noticeable change in the security situation as a result of its provisions. Nonetheless I wish it well.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01680"><member>Lord Dunleath</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not hold the Garda responsible for the detonation.

I am not apportioning blame to one side compared with the other. I am merely saying that such incidents ought not to happen if the two police forces are closely in touch. In the army we should have called it a rear link between one command and the other so that each would know what the other was doing. That is what I am saying. I can assure the noble Lord that I was not blaming the Garda.</membercontribution></p>

I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, and his department, for the briefing on this Bill which they have given us. That was very helpful.<lb/>
I am sorry that so few noble Lords have put down their names to speak in the debate. It is true that the Government always table debates on Northern Ireland for Fridays or late at night but to some extent the small number of speakers reflects a degree of public indifference in England to the affairs of Northern Ireland, which is symbolised by the dust covers that we see on the television cameras. The Bill is not particularly controversial and I join with the noble Lords who have spoken in giving it a general welcome. I am especially glad that it is proposed to implement a large number of the recommendations in Sir George Baker's admirable report.<lb/>
As I understand it, one of the objectives of the Bill is to strengthen the authorities' hand in the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland while at the same time extending the statutory protection given to the rights of persons suspected or accused of terrorism. As the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, has said, and as the Minister told us, this is a difficult balance. However, it seems to me that the most essential right for anyone living in Northern Ireland is to be able to sit in his or her own drawing room or to walk down the street without fear of being shot. They are not enjoying that right at the moment. We need to concentrate on the first objective.<lb/>
Two days ago in another place the Secretary of State admitted that there had been "a serious deterioration" in security. Indeed, there has. I believe that this year the murder rate is running at 250 per cent. above the same period in 1986. I understand that the Government do not propose to amend this Bill in the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0193"/>
<col>369</col>
light of the present very serious situation. That surprises me a little, unless they plan other measures, in which case perhaps the Minister will inform us of them. If this Bill is lost I hope that in due course we can have a replacement that reflects the need to reverse the deterioration of which the Minister spoke.<lb/>
I want to say a few words about the general situation against which we have to consider the Bill and particularly about the emergency (if that is the right word) for which emergency provisions are needed. First, there is the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which I think it is fair to describe as the main plank in the Government's policy for fighting terrorism. When he introduced it to this House in November 1985 the noble Viscount the Leader of the House told us that the agreement:
<quote>"can contribute significantly to the aim, which we all share, of peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland".</quote>
He went on to say:
<quote>"it offers a real opportunity to make progress towards reconciliation between the two communities in Northern Ireland and to tackle cross-border terrorism in a determined way."</quote>
<quote>[<i>Official Report</i>, 26/11/85 cols. 798 and 801.]</quote>
On that occasion, I said that as I understand it
<quote>"the agreement&#x2026;seems to be based on a calculation &#x2026; that if representatives of the Government of the Republic can, through the Conference, put forward views and proposals on their own account or on behalf of the Catholic minority about the most important aspects of policy in Northern Ireland, then nationalists may withdraw support for Sinn Fein and the IRA, so that the terrorists lose their support and the level of terrorism is drastically reduced. &#x2026;If that really happens then obviously it will be an enormous gain&#x2026;But will there really be such a dramatic improvement? The prospects seem to me to be far from certain".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26/11/85; col. 842.]</quote>
My doubts then were not widely shared, but I think that now they are. I noticed two pieces in the press recently which your Lordships may also have seen. On 26th April, the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> said:
<quote>"After the murder of Lord Justice Gibson and Lady Gibson, the onus of proof is on those who believe that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has contributed to cross-border security.</quote>
<quote>We hope that the Government of the Republic and the Catholic community in the North will not merely express their outrage, but also demonstrate a new-found determination to apprehend the murderers. If not, it will be difficult to argue with Unionist outrage".</quote>
And in an important leader on the 28th April, the <i>Independent</i> said:
<quote>"There is no indication that the accord has reconciled many Nationalists. It has, however, done much to alienate Protestant opinion".</quote>
It went on to say that the argument was often made that in fact there were improvements in security taking place, and that too much publicity would jeopardise recent gains and make it difficult for the new Taoiseach to continue on the path of sweet reasonableness. On that issue they said:
<quote>"There comes a point at which such arguments have to be resisted and that point was surely reached this weekend. In order to restore morale and to engender some confidence the two Governments ought, as a matter of urgency, to give public indication of the ways in which co-operation in security matters has been stepped up. Moreover, it would be valuable for Mr. Haughey to give his unreserved public blessing to the higher profile military presence which will now be necessary on the border and elsewhere in Northern Ireland".</quote>
I hope that the Government will pay attention to those views and to similar views that have been put forward.<lb/>
<col>370</col>
As regards the emergency provisions and the measures actually taken to deal with the situation, in the first place, I welcome the steps announced by the Secretary of State two days ago in another place to strengthen the UDR, the RUC and to take measures which have been interpreted as a proposal to send in the SAS. I also welcome that part of the Secretary of State's speech in which he said:
<quote>"I make it absolutely clear that our determination is to pursue our efforts until such time as terrorism is destroyed."</quote>
However, can that firm and admirable statement be reconciled with what the Government actually do? In the subsequent debate a number of speakers, including the Unionist leader Mr. Molyneaux, talked about the restrictions on the actions of the army which they claimed meant that under the rules and with the yellow card the terrorist must always fire first and that if any of our soldiers shoots first he is liable to prosecution. Mr. Molyneaux quoted an officer in the British Army who said that many of the soldiers there felt like "tethered goats". That seems to me to be an appalling position in which to put our troops. What is the real position? If we are to destroy terrorism, as the Secretary of State says we must, the army must have some of those shackles removed because it cannot destroy terrorism with its hands tied behind its back.<lb/>
My slight doubts about the Government's will to win were increased by what I read about a case of which I have given the Minister notice which concerns a supply teacher in Northern Ireland called Kathleen Gleeson. That lady was widely reported to be a member of the IRA and to have used her position as a teacher to recruit pupils from her class into the IRA. She has had three convictions, two of them for assaulting the police. However, I noticed an article in <i>The Independent</i> the other day which reported that she had been reinstated. I wish to ask the Minister whether the Government consider that such a person is suitable to teach the children of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Indeed what is needed at this time is a firm signal, essentially from the Prime Minister, that enough is enough and that we intend to put a stop to terrorism. I shall give your Lordships a parallel. In Canada in 1970 there was an outbreak of serious terrorism by an organisation called the FLQ in Quebec. Your Lordships may remember that one of our trade commissioners was kidnapped and that a Quebec Minister was kidnapped and subsequently murdered. Many people in Canada thought at that time that the Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, being a progressive and very often described as a wet and a strong liberal, would do nothing but wring his hands and that the terrorism would continue. In fact, quite the contrary happened. Mr. Trudeau made it absolutely clear that under no circumstances was his government prepared to put up with the terrorism in Quebec. He brought into force the War Measures Act for the first time in peace-time in Canada. He sent in the tanks, arrested a large number of people and made it absolutely clear to every Canadian, to every member of the Canadian Forces, to everyone in Quebec and to the terrorists that the Government were going to stop the terrorism, and it did stop. That was 17 years ago and there has never been a cheep out of the terrorists since. It was stopped effectively because of the Government's will to stop it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0194"/>
<col>371</col>
Are we prepared to do likewise? If we are and if we make that determination I imagine that the army would require changes in the legal framework so that there can be no question of prosecuting our soldiers for shooting terrorists in the course of operations. Will we give the army those powers? That matter is far more important than merely increasing the numbers of troops. Will we place some such provisions in this Bill or in its replacement or in any alternative?<lb/>
There are other steps that we can take at the same time. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, said about the question of the right of silence. We should give consideration to removing that. A short time ago in your Lordships' House there was discussion about the prosecution's right to appeal against excessively lenient sentences in Great Britain, and a number of very distinguished noble Lords, including the Lord Chief Justice, argued that the prosecution should have that right. Whatever happens in Great Britain, it should certainly have that right in Northern Ireland where it is even more important.<lb/>
The question of detention, or selective detention, is very difficult. Clearly it resulted in damage when it was carried out in a wholesale way. It alienated the minority community, which was clearly a mistake. Nonetheless, we cannot allow the present situation to continue. It is certainly disturbing when we see that the courts in Belfast and Dublin sometimes appear to be competing as to which can release the most terrorists into the arms of their jubilant supporters. We should encourage the Government of the Republic to move in parallel with us in taking strong measures against terrorists.<lb/>
One other question in relation to the Bill, discussed in Committee in another place on 26th February, was that of the proscription of Sinn Fein. As your Lordships may know, it was proscribed between 1922 and 1974, and the IRA and the INLA remained proscribed. But Sinn Fein, of which the Baker Report quoted from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> as "the IRA in drag", is not proscribed. That is thoroughly discussed in the Baker Report. I hope that those of your Lordships who have not read it will look at chapter 9, pages 116 to 123, where there is a full and fair discussion of the question. Sir George Baker quoted a suggestion made to him by Professor Wilkinson, of the Department of Politics at Aberdeen University, whom he described as an international authority on terrorism. The suggestion was,
<quote>"that those political parties which refuse to renounce the use of violence should be disqualified by statute from fighting parliamentary or other elections".</quote>
Sir George added that,
<quote>"the proposal seemed well worthy of further thought."</quote>
We should pay attention to that because, at the moment, there is an anomalous situation in that Ministers, quite reasonably, will not meet members of Sinn Fein although it is not proscribed and is free to fight parliamentary and local elections.<lb/>
There is the linked question of terrorist publicity. Your Lordships may have heard "The World This Weekend" on the BBC last Sunday when the question of terrorism in Northern Ireland was discussed. There was a long interview with Mr. Danny Morrison who was treated just as if he was a political leader in the
<col>372</col>
United Kingdom. He described the aims and objectives of the IRA and the progress it had made. That is quite wrong. However, even more wrong was the article which some of your Lordships may have seen which appeared in the <i>Guardian</i> on Tuesday, 5th May. The article quoted,
<quote>"a senior figure who said he was speaking for the general headquarters staff".</quote>
He described the bomb which killed Lord Justice Gibson and his wife and explained that it contained,
<quote>"1,0001bs. of explosives, and not 5001bs. as estimated by the authorities. It was made of fertiliser base burned by cortex high explosive cable to give uniform combustion. The cable was set off by benzine primer".</quote>
There were all those details. The article went on to quote the spokesman as saying that,
<quote>"the IRA still needed rifles capable of piercing the chest and back armour protection worn by the security forces &#x2026; The IRA has inadequate guns to penetrate the armour so we have to get in close for head or stomach shots".</quote>
It is appalling that a paper with a great past like the <i>Guardian</i> should quote that sort of stuff, which is sickening to read, from a terrorist spokesman. It should be an offence to give publicity to the views of terrorist spokesmen in that way.<lb/>
To sum up, there ought to be a clear signal that the Government intend that this situation should stop. There should, I believe, be consequent discussion with the security forces. I believe that amendments would be required to legislation, either in this Bill or in an alternative. Clearly, action in the security field is the first priority. But political action is necessary, too.<lb/>
I think that the Anglo-Irish agreement gave the IRA grounds for thinking that we were giving in to their ultimate objective. We need to make it clear that we are not. To that end, we need to remove the political uncertainty hanging over Northern Ireland. I have already suggested in this House that we should treat the province much more like Wales or Scotland. We should make it clear that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and that it will remain so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01683"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I take up one point that he made? He said, if I understood him aright, that he was not sure that the Government had a real will to win. I think that that is an absolutely unjust reflection on the present policy, because the answer to the noble Lord's very understandable complaints about things going wrong the whole time&#x2014;that has been happening for 20 years in Northern Ireland&#x2014;is to be tougher and everything will come right.<lb/>
The curious fact is that the one thing that the terrorists, particularly the INLA, are working for above everything else is to produce a strong reaction. It is the only way that they can develop their case or get friends at all. So it is a good deal more difficult than the noble Lord suggested.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01685"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I should just say to the noble Lord, Lord Moran, that the great majority of the Catholic population of Northern Ireland never have supported the IRA and still do not. Having said that, I welcome this belated move to implement some of Sir George Baker's recommendations, and it is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0195"/>
<col>373</col>
particularly good that the measure comes to us in the form of a Bill and not of an unamendable order.<lb/>
I should like to welcome the onus now being put on the prosecution to show why bail should not be granted. I welcome also the time limits regarding preliminary proceedings for scheduled offences. But I ask the Minister when the regulations will be published and whether they will be available to us in draft form. Will the limits be comparable to those now existing in Scotland after which bail must be granted? Here we should also refer to recommendation No. 22 of Sir George Baker's report.<lb/>
I should like to welcome the limited attempts in this Bill to harmonise its provisions with those of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. Much more could be done here, because the overlap of emergency and prevention of terrorism provisions is undesirable in principle and unnecessarily complex in practice. The objective, I suggest, should be for Northern Ireland to have a single Act containing all emergency legislation.<lb/>
I should also like to welcome the word "reasonable", about which the late Sir A. P. Herbert could be so eloquent, which we find both in Clause 6 and in Schedule 1. This is a major step forward and will, I hope, eliminate the so-called "fishing trips" which have so often in the past been counter productive by antagonising the local community where they occurred, and especially the most law-abiding members of the local community.<lb/>
I should like to welcome Clause 11, though there is still a strong case for making the same organisations illegal in the whole of the United Kingdom, and indeed if possible in the Irish Republic as well. I welcome Clause 14, which protects the rights of people arrested, especially since in the nature of things some innocent people are bound to get arrested and some, whether they are innocent or guilty, will be under 18. When this happens, we know all too well that it causes very strong alarm to the parents and relations of those young people.<lb/>
The Bill is, however, remarkable for the things that it omits. For instance, as has already been mentioned, the power of executive detention is retained. This is contrary to Sir George Baker's recommendation No. 26. I can foresee that at some future point an opportunity might occur for arresting a significant number of the godfathers of terrorism, against whom there will probably be insufficient evidence to prosecute. But if this situation ever does arise, I should have thought they could be held under the powers of existing legislation until such time&#x2014;and it has to be a fairly short time, I agree&#x2014;as Parliament could pass a detention measure tailor-made for specified persons.<lb/>
I note that nothing is being done in the Bill to amend and clarify the law on the reasonable use of force by the security services as it applies to firearms. Nothing is being done to create a new offence lesser than murder or manslaughter covering the honest&#x2014;and by that I mean the non-malicious&#x2014;use of excessive force. This is a point on which again I differ from the noble Lord, Lord Moran.<lb/>
As to the "certifying" out of scheduled offences, nothing seems to be done to give the Attorney-General
<col>374</col>
greater flexibility so that he may "certify" out any offence for trial by jury which he thinks proper and fit. This is where we come again to Sir George Baker's recommendations Nos. 12 to 17. Can the Minister please say why it has been that some 30 to 40 per cent. of the applications for certificates were refused in each year from 1982 to 1986 inclusive? It seems that this escape route towards normality is not working quite as well as one might hope.<lb/>
Like the noble Lords, Lord Hampton and Lord Dunleath, I regret that the Bill offers nothing on the vexed question of the single judge without a jury in the Diplock courts. I suggest it is highly significant that the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights&#x2014;the Government's own appointed watchdog on this subject in Northern Ireland&#x2014;has recommended a three judge court. It did so by a majority of the order or 15 to 2. Here I should like to pay a very warm tribute to the members of this standing advisory commission. It has been in existence now for 12 years or so and has had to walk through the minefield in a very sensitive area, subject to claims and counterclaims, to propaganda and to agitation of every kind. It has discharged this onerous duty in a very admirable way, with the aid of a small permanent staff.<lb/>
I believe that there have been miscarriages of justice in a limited number of terrorist cases, both before a jury in England and before a single judge in Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, an improvement in the composition of the Crown Court in Northern Ireland is highly material to perceptions of justice in that jurisdiction.<lb/>
We have evidence from the special criminal court in Dublin that three judges sitting without a jury can work perfectly well as a court of first instance. I commend to your Lordships and to Her Majesty's Government the paper by Mr. John Jackson, who is a barrister and lecturer in law at Queen's University, Belfast. That paper is printed in full on page 63 onwards in the twelfth report of the standing advisory commission. The paper sets out how a three-judge court might function in practice and how the Bill could be amended to make that possible. Four different methods are listed on pages 73 to 75. I trust that the Government will soon give a considered reply to the standing advisory commission, since they have had the recommendation from that body since October of last year. Can the Minister say when that reply may be forthcoming?<lb/>
If the real objection to three-judge courts is simply a lack of judges, we should make use of retired judges, of resident magistrates and of barristers of more than 10 years' standing. I think that it is worthy of note that Mr. Brice Dickson of the Law Faculty of Queen's University has recorded his opinion that only three extra full-time judges would be needed, who could well be found from a pool of some 60 qualified and experienced banisters. If the Government do not accept the recommendations of the standing advisory commission, the least I feel they could and should do would be to appoint an independent inquiry into possible improvements to the present Diplock courts. I also agree with the commission that so long as we have two Acts on the statute book, both intended to counter terrorism in Northern Ireland, the Emergency Provisions Act should have an annual review by an
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0196"/>
<col>375</col>
independent person in the same way as the Prevention of Terrorism Act for the whole of the United Kingdom. I think that that was one of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies.<lb/>
There is urgent need for codes of practice and conduct for the Royal Ulster Constabulary similar to those which have been adopted for England and Wales under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. They set out clear guidelines for the police and a detailed statement of the rights of an individual and the safeguards available to detained persons. Perhaps I may ask the Minister when he replies to say when those codes will also be available for Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to welcome Clause 6, which concerns admissions and confessions. In doing so I also ask whether those new clauses cover violence or threats of violence to members of the immediate family of the accused. Such threats could be just as serious as direct threats to the accused person.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01687"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I first apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for having missed the first part of his speech. London is one gigantic building site at the moment and the average speed of traffic is down to about five miles an hour this morning.<lb/>
It is refreshing to see Northern Ireland legislation embodied in a Bill at last, rather than in a wholly unamendable and hence unsatisfactory order. It is good, too, that for once we are dealing with an Ulster matter at a marginally more convenient time than is usually allotted to us. By and large, the contents of the Bill are to be warmly welcomed, although I briefly wonder whether Clause 13, which provides for the eventual repeal of the 1978 Act, is not giving hostages to fortune. I also have some reservations about Part III, but do not intend to elaborate on those reservations until we come to the Committee stage. Having said that, yesterday's local government election results make it increasingly unlikely that the Committee stage will be reached. I should therefore like to make a few general observations.<lb/>
It was revealed in <i>The Times</i> six days ago that 244 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have been murdered since the onset of the troubles. I say "revealed" advisedly because nowadays Fleet Street tends to give minimal coverage to the murder of a policeman or policewoman in Northern Ireland or the murder of anyone else for that matter, unless they happen to be unusually important people. Fleet Street may protest that circulation figures are all that matters and that their readers simply are not interested. The more frivolous tabloids aside, I do not think that that is a good enough answer. If separatists in Brittany, Corsica or Martinique had killed several hundred soldiers, policemen and members of the CRS over the same period of time, together with many tens of thousands of civilians, whether metropolitan French or <i>les fran&#x00E7;ais d'outre-me</i>, I believe that coverage in the French press would be much more comprehensive and prominent.<lb/>
Perhaps I should say that ITN and, latterly the BBC news, after some of us had protested against the disproportionate coverage and attention the BBC gave to the hunger strikers, behave much better in this
<col>376</col>
respect. Let us give credit where credit is due. However, the playing down of the murder of hundreds of mostly innocent people matters. It matters because the public are said by the press to have a right to know: at the moment, they are not being given that right. More importantly, it creates a sense of alienation, in both directions. If murders in Belfast are given no greater prominence than similar murders in Bolivia or Bangladesh, then the English, the Welsh and, to a lesser extent because of their proximity, cultural and otherwise, the Scots public are subconsciously going increasingly to bracket what is part of the United Kingdom with those distant lands.<lb/>
Meanwhile, the sense of alienation on the other side of the water, as well as the sense of cynicism and resentment, will grow apace, and morale will plummet even further. There may be, indeed I am sure that there are, some who will secretly welcome such a trend. But I warn them that the consequences may not be those to which they secretly aspire.<lb/>
Returning to statistics, 244 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have been murdered since August 1969. That is the equivalent of 8,750 policemen and policewomen murdered in England, Scotland and Wales, pro rata to the population: an average of 500 murders per annum. If 500 police officers had been murdered on the mainland every year on average for 17&#x00BD; years, together with over 750 men of the Regular Army and the Territorial Army and over 2,000 wholly innocent civilians&#x2014;by that, I mean those totally unconnected with extremist organisations&#x2014;there would be no question of a one-column-inch report appearing regularly at the bottom of an inside page. On the contrary, the balloon would go up.<lb/>
It is not too far-fetched that hysteria would reign. The public, the press, back-bench politicians and indeed many front-bench politicians would be crying for the most extreme responses: the right of hot pursuit; the re-introduction of capital punishment; a state of emergency; internment, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath; a shoot-to-kill policy; and possibly Israeli-style raids upon terrorist bases across the border. I am not arguing that all or any of those policies are necessarily desirable. But the British mainland is an effective democracy, where strong public opinion counts very much. The Government in such circumstances would be forced to take strong measures, possibly even against their better judgment.<lb/>
As Northern Ireland is now, for various reasons which we need not go into at the moment, it is not an effective democracy. The Government are in a position virtually to ignore public opinion in the Province. The sole response to the latest wave of violence has been to recruit more RUC men, some of whom are to replace those who have been murdered, and to send a few more SAS men into the border areas.<lb/>
It may be that the ability virtually to disregard local public opinion is a blessing in disguise; that unencumbered by the burden of responding to public opinion, the Government are able to reach the wisest decisions; and that the Government's relatively "softly, softly" policy (in a world context) is the most effective one. I certainly hope so, but must admit that I am not at all confident.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01688">12.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01689"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are indebted to the Minister for the careful and sober way in which he has presented this measure to the House. As in all debates on Northern Ireland, the House is exceedingly well served by those who are well connected with Northern Ireland and who bring to our debates their experience and views to the benefit not only of the House but also of the people of Northern Ireland. I have listened to every contribution with deep respect. Those of us who do not live in Northern Ireland but who perhaps, once removed, take responsibilities in these matters are certainly indebted.<lb/>
Last September, with the full approval and help of the Minister, my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies and I visited Northern Ireland. That visit gave us an insight, but it was nothing like the insight of those noble Lords who live there, and who can tell us of the problems. My purpose in having as it were, a second bite of the cherry on behalf of the official Opposition, is in no way to repeat what has been said, because there is a general welcome for the Bill not only in your Lordships' House but also, as my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies mentioned, in another place.<lb/>
The Minister was fair enough to acknowledge that the Bill was improved in another place. He also understands that in Northern Ireland, perhaps more than in any other spheres of government activity, there is a desperate yearning on behalf of all opposition parties to see the Government succeed. In many instances the opposition parties make the Government's job more difficult. However, when we are looking at what the Government are doing as regards Northern Ireland&#x2014;namely, protecting innocent men and women, and bringing back to the province peace, security and stability, as well as progress&#x2014;then no sane-minded opposition would wish to thwart that will.<lb/>
Therefore, the Minister knows at the outset that we wish the Bill and its aspirations well. My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies said&#x2014;and this was echoed by almost every speaker&#x2014;that there is the satisfaction that we are dealing not with a series of orders or Motions but with something concrete and positive. By and large I echo the view of all noble Lords who have spoken that there is not very much with which one can disagree, but one expresses disappointment that some of the provisions that we would have wished to see in the Bill are not there.<lb/>
When one looks at the provisions of a Bill of this kind, by normal standards one may take the view that it is unreal and grotesque. I say that because the conditions with which the Government, the people of Northern Ireland and the people of the United Kingdom have to deal in Northern Ireland are grotesque and unreal. However, it is not a question of using desperate measures. I remind the Minister and the House of the wise words of his ministerial colleague Mr. Nicholas Scott, who said:
<quote>"I believe democracies have to be careful in seeking to defend their democracy by not adopting means which play into the hands of the terrorists, and therefore, I think we should seek to derogate as little as possible from the normal standards of justice and government which we would normally apply".</quote>
It is an indication of the dangers and difficulties in Northern Ireland that we have had to derogate to the
<col>378</col>
extent that we have in the Bill. No sensible democrat wants to impose upon a system of justice in Northern Ireland the kind of provisions contained in the Bill.<lb/>
I recognise that the Government have been seeking to maintain the balance&#x2014;a balance which is always very difficult to strike and even more so in Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, the Government are right almost to bend over backwards to ensure that the civil liberties of the individuals, and even the terrorists and the organisations that they support, are taken fully into account when putting legislation on the statute book.<lb/>
I wish to remind the Minister of the wise remarks of my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies. He said that what we want to see is support for the trend of channelling back into the normal jury system. The Government want normality but it is a question of pace.<lb/>
The terrible murder of a judge and his wife on the border and the subsequent events remind us that there is a dreadful price to be paid if we do not maintain a proper system of security. My noble friend was also wise not only in welcoming the many provisions in the Bill but also in reminding the Minister&#x2014;if indeed he needed reminding&#x2014;that substantially we are talking about security and justice. Moreover, the solution in Northern Ireland will be found only when politicians find a political solution that is acceptable to everyone.<lb/>
I was interested in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, when he raised the issue of treating silence in the face of interrogation as something akin to a driver who refuses to give specimens for tests. Although it is an interesting theory, it does not sound attractive to me because it is one of the frustrations and hurdles with which police and security forces of all nations have to contend. The alternative is to use methods of breaking the silence, but certainly we on this side of the House would have nothing to do with them.<lb/>
In conclusion, I remind the Minister of the points about which my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies said that we were uneasy. I am talking of matters that we would raise at Committee stage, which under normal circumstances one would envisage taking place within the next two or three weeks. However, these are not normal times because we are living in the period immediately before the calling of a general election. But I think that the record ought to show where our unease lies.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies expressed unease that the Bill does not repeal the powers of the Secretary of State contained in Section 12 of the 1978 Act to detain a person without trial. He also indicated that Clause 12 of the Bill deals with the compensation paid to a person whose property is taken, destroyed or damaged by members of the security forces in the course of their duty. My noble friend mentioned the uncertainty of the principles which determine the payment of compensation and also the claims procedure. Perhaps the Minister has those points in mind and will deal with them in his reply.<lb/>
My noble friend then drew to the attention of the House, as did other noble Lords, the concern in Northern Ireland that the right to jury trial is not available for a wide range of offences. Perhaps the Minister will also deal with that point. We accept that
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0198"/>
<col>379</col>
it is unrealistic to talk of the restoration of the normal jury trial system.<lb/>
My noble friend then raised another omission; namely, the disappointment among many members of the Catholic community that advantage has not been taken in this new legislation to place some limitation on the right to stop and search citizens at random.<lb/>
I want merely to repeat what my noble friend said. It is deeply regrettable that such legislation is required. However, we share the view of the Government and the Minister that it is required. We are pleased that the measures have been codified and brought up to date in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01690">1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01691"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Graham, has summed up our discussions on this Bill. All the remarks that have been made about the measures contained in this contentious legislation, which have been with us while the emergency has existed, have been extremely well balanced and thought out. They have given me and the Government food for thought. I hope that I shall be able to cover most, if not all, of the points that have been raised. I am grateful to your Lordships for giving me some indication of the points that may be raised and the markers that may be put down at later stages of the Bill.<lb/>
At the outset I wish to take 30 seconds of your Lordships' time to allude to one sad event among the many that have taken place in Northern Ireland during the security emergency. Last Sunday an especially sad event occurred with the death of the Dowager Duchess of Westminster, who, as your Lordships may be aware, was Her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant for the county of Fermanagh. It would be remiss of me personally, and on behalf of the Government, to allow that terribly sad event to pass unremarked in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
All of us who have been connected with service in Northern Ireland in government, or in any other way, have noted the marvellous contribution made by the late dowager Duchess for many years. She had just retired from the position of Lord Lieutenant, which she had held since 1979. To say that the dowager Duchess was loved by all sections of the Northern Ireland community would be an understatement. We mourn her passing.<lb/>
We have had an interesting and illuminating debate. I shall start by trying to reassure your Lordships that we too are pleased that we can include these measures in a Bill. Every speaker has drawn attention to that fact. We are grateful that it has been noticed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, asked whether I could place in the Library those of the Baker recommendations that had been dealt with and those which had not. I have put in my notes, "Library; why not?" I hope that I can do that. I shall place in the Library the information that we made available earlier this week. If I can, I shall try to fill in any gaps in the information about the Baker recommendations. I shall discuss the point with my advisers and then take action.<lb/>
<col>380</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, asked about a number of points. First, he asked about the repeal of the police arrest powers contained in Section 11 of the 1978 Act. That is covered by Clause 6 of the Bill. The significance of the repeal of the police arrest power contained in Section 11 of the 1978 Act is that it removes an overlap in the emergency arrest powers contained in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act and similar powers contained in the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. We consider that the system we have evolved in Clause 6 and the continuing powers under Section 12 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act provide all the grounds we believe to be necessary for arrests to be carried out in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, also mentioned Clause 5, which replaces Section 8 of the 1978 Act and deals with the admissibility of confession evidence. The provisions relating to the admissibility of confession evidence in England and Wales could not be applied to terrorist cases in Northern Ireland. All your Lordships, including the noble Lords, Lord Dunleath and Lord Fitt, are aware of the situation in Northern Ireland. We do not think that those provisions could safely be applied.<lb/>
There is a risk that the Northern Ireland courts would of necessity return to the pre-Diplock interpretation of the law, which resulted in the non-admissibility of virtually all statements made in police custody although there was no ill-treatment and the statement could only have been made by a person who was, to all intents and purposes, guilty. I ask noble Lords to accept that such provisions relating to the admissibility of evidence would not be practical and would not work.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked me about the Attorney-General's discretion to certify out. That power has not been extended to cover robbery or what I think the noble Lord called aggravated burglary. Those would be the only two scheduled offences in which a weapon is used. Certifying out has not been extended because of the difficulty in determining the accused person's motive. I believe that the noble Lord will accept that. There would also be a difficulty in reaching an objective decision about the appropriate method of trial.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Prys-Davies and Lord Graham, asked about the stop and search provisions. I hope that noble Lords will accept that stopping and searching has to be random if it is to be effective, first to deter, and, secondly, to prevent terrorist activity. We are alert to the difficulties caused by the possible abuse of those powers. We take the greatest care to try to reduce all abuses. Your Lordships will be aware that during the past two years we have tried to ensure that those unpleasant measures are carried out as politely and humanely as possible. I hope that I have your Lordships' support for these regrettable but necessary measures. I believe that they are welcomed by most people in Northern Ireland, because they help to protect the entire community.<lb/>
Your Lordships will of course be aware of the enormous haul of explosives, weighing well over one tonne, which was made last weekend. I am not aware of the full details, but that indicates to your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0199"/>
<col>381</col>
the circumstances which exist in Northern Ireland and that random searches of traffic and people are necessary. We shall continue to try to reduce any abuses.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, asked about compensation claims. They are covered by Clause 12. He asked how many compensation claims had not been settled within 12 months. I hope noble Lords will accept that the new compensation provisions in Clause 12 require notice of a claim which should be submitted within a maximum of 12 months. The noble Lord is seized of the point that the claims do not have to be settled within 12 months. I stress to him that most claims are settled within the period unless the claimant is dissatisfied with the settlement offered. Your Lordships will therefore see that there is a very fair mechanism with which these grievances can be redressed. Noble Lords will find the provision at pages 9, 10 and 11 of the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord raised the question of a field of grain for a farmer. That matter would arrive on my desk in the Northern Ireland Office; indeed, most matters of drainage seem to end up with me. The example given by the noble Lord would become evident within 12 months. Most farmers are swift to take precautionary action, which is all that is needed under the terms of Clause 12 of the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, referred to the police procedures with regard to persons such as the late Lord Justice Gibson and Lady Gibson or any person who might wish to cross the border in either direction at any time. I am able to stress to the noble Lord that the chief constable of the RUC is pursuing very urgently his inquiries into the circumstances of the murder of Lord Justice and Lady Gibson and the security procedures and advice provided for those such as the judiciary in Northern Ireland who are under constant threat from terrorism. The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, will know that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has already signed a vehicle control zone order making it illegal for vehicles to stop on that stretch of the A.1 immediately north of the border where vehicles are at particular risk from car bombs such as the one which murdered Lord Justice and Lady Gibson.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, also spoke about the elimination of the right to silence. I note very carefully what he said about the problems which are raised for the investigating and prosecuting authorities by the principle of the right of a suspect to remain silent during questioning. Your Lordships will understand that this is a very difficult area which the Government would hesitate to enter without considering very carefully the whole issue of civil rights of individuals.<lb/>
Perhaps I may draw the noble Lord's attention to the words of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in another place in the lengthy debate on security last Wednesday. My right honourable friend said:
<quote>"That is why we are continuing to consider ways in which the work of the security forces can be helped to bring terrorists before the courts. While maintaining fair treatment under the law, we will ensure that if terrorists are found guilty, they are subject to the full rigour of the law. I do not propose to comment any further on those
<col>382</col>
matters now. However, I hope that the House has listened carefully to what I have said and will be under no illusions about the seriousness with which I regard that aspect of the problem".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 6/5/87; cols, 741-2.]</quote>
I hope that the noble Lord will accept that my right honourable friend has taken these points on board, and in particular the point on the right to silence. However, we should not take a step to remove the right to silence with regard to the provisions today, and in particular when we look at Clause 5.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, also raised the question of the discretionary approach to 50 per cent. remission in sentences. I note what he said. I shall draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.<lb/>
I wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, for his very helpful comments. He raised two points to which I shall come later. One was the question of three- judge courts and the other was that of internment and detention. I have also noted the thoughts of the noble Lord on Clause 11 of the Bill. I share with him the hope that these measures can be enforced. We certainly believe that there is a strong probability that they can be enforced and offenders brought before the courts. We believe that the attempt to stamp out this menace will be successful.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Moran, was kind enough to give me notice of the case of the teacher, to which I shall come in a moment. He referred to the murder rate being 250 per cent. higher than in the same period in 1986. I stress that the Government share the concern of the noble Lord about the recent upsurge of terrorist murders in Northern Ireland but I hope he will agree that we do not want to play into the hands of the terrorists, and of those who support them, by adopting draconian measures which would undoubtedly be counter-productive in the Government's consistent policy over a number of years to isolate terrorists from the community which they falsely claim to represent.<lb/>
I note the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Moran. I hope that he can be classified as a friendly Member of your Lordships' House inside and out. I hope your Lordships will accept that we have to maintain the balance between justified and essential means to counter terrorism which we are using in Northern Ireland and other methods&#x2014;which we insist are necessary in a democracy&#x2014;that we have in Part I of the Bill. We want to maintain the balance between adequate powers for the security forces and protection for the basic rights of all citizens. It is still the fact that citizens are innocent until they are proved guilty, even with the situation in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Moran, also spoke of the powers of the security forces to take on terrorists. Under the law the security forces can use whatever force&#x2014;and that includes lethal force&#x2014;is reasonable in the circumstances. Those four words restrict the security forces in a way that I believe your Lordships will consider absolutely essential.<lb/>
It is rightly a matter for the courts to decide in particular cases whether the use of lethal force was justified. I stress to the noble Lord that there is no legal or regulatory requirement for the security forces to hold fire until the terrorists open fire. I hope that the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0200"/>
<col>383</col>
noble Lord will accept that statement; it is essential that it is clearly understood.<lb/>
I do not wish to go down the avenue of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in this debate this afternoon. Nevertheless, the Government believe that the agreement continues to offer sufficient reassurance to both sides of the community in Northern Ireland to enable them to engage in constructive political dialogues. The agreement, however, provides a very important framework for co-ordinating security force activity on both sides of the border. Members of the Government have made no secret of the fact that the agreement would not achieve results overnight. I do not accept that this upsurge in terrorist activity is necessarily connected with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. That may be the opinion of sundry people in Northern Ireland but we do not accept that as being the case.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was kind enough to warn me that he would have one or two complicated matters to raise. One of the points that he wished me to cover was the response of the Government to the letter from the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in October, recommending the introduction of three-judge courts to try scheduled offences. The Government took into account the views contained in the SACHR's letter before we arrived at our decision, which my honourable friend the Minister of State explained at an earlier stage of the Bill in another place. I hope he will accept that we took the point on board. That is as far as we can go today.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, raised the matter of compensation. I hope that he will find that the period of 12 months in Clause 12 is sufficient. I stress once again that the measures in Clause 12 are there merely so that the aggrieved person may give notice of his intention to make a claim.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hampton, and other noble Lords raised a question on detention and whether the word "internment" also was covered by detention. I shall cover them under one heading. I am sure the House will accept that the Government have a responsibility&#x2014;even more, we have a duty&#x2014;to ensure that the appropriate powers are available to protect the entire community in Northern Ireland from the effects of terrorism. We also have to take into account the possibility of deterioration which could not be foreseen in the security situation and in the ability of the courts to deal with terrorists. The Government have considered these two aspects very carefully. We concluded that it would not be right to repeal the provisions for detention at this stage. I stress that they have not been used since 1975. They have not been in force since 1980, but while they remain on the statute book they constitute a reserve power which could&#x2014;I stress that conditional&#x2014;be implemented at short notice in response to an emergency.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Hampton, raised the matter of three-judge courts. We have a proposal that three-judge courts should be established for the trial of scheduled offences in. Northern Ireland, but we see three substantial objections. The first is that the current Diplock procedures contain powerful safeguards which in our view sufficiently compensate
<col>384</col>
for the absence of a jury. I think your Lordships will know that in the detailed paper on the proposal the Standing Advisory Commission emphasised that there was no reason to believe that the current Diplock procedures had led to any unfairness. There is statistical evidence to show that the percentage of cases which go to the appeal court from a Diplock court&#x2014;every convicted person from a Diplock court has a right to appeal&#x2014;is the same as that for any other cases which go to appeal.<lb/>
Secondly, there would be substantial practical and procedural difficulties. Thirdly, as your Lordships are aware, the divided society in Northern Ireland places us in a situation where in practice three-judge courts would be most unlikely to promote public confidence in the administration of justice. For those three main reasons I am afraid we are not persuaded that it would be right to provide in this Bill for the establishment of three-judge courts for the trial of scheduled offences. But I stress that we look forward to the day when jury trial can be restored for all cases in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
A question on time limits was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, and by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. We have time limits in Clause 3. As noble Lords will see, Clause 3 provides for the grant of bail if what we call the custody time limit is exceeded. I cannot say when the regulations which will impose time limits will be drafted. Before introducing time limits we want to await the outcome of the experiment being carried out by the Home Office with actual time limits. These experiments began only on 1st April this year. We shall then be collecting more data from our own monitoring exercise, which has been running for less than a year. I hope we shall have something more to report then.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised a query about overlap and the problems of confusion with arrests for the emergency provisions Act and prevention of terrorism Act powers and whether these should be contained in a single Act for Northern Ireland. But in Clauses 6, 14 and 15 the Bill seeks to tie the two Acts together and to create what we hope will be a coherent package of anti-terrorist law for Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, also kindly warned me about his query on certifying out and the percentages of applications which were refused. The noble Lord was in correspondence with my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor on one of these aspects. In these cases my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General would have concluded, on the basis of detailed notes submitted to him by the Director of Public Prosecutions, that it would not be right to issue a certificate to enable the cases to be tried before a jury in the proportion of cases mentioned by the noble Lord. I stress to the noble Lord that this decision is one for the Attorney-General.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked whether the Government proposed to establish an independent inquiry into the procedures of the Diplock courts. The late Sir George Baker studied the whole issue with great care. He recommended that there should be no change. The Government have given detailed consideration to this matter and have concluded that the procedures we have are satisfactory. We think they
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0201"/>
<col>385</col>
are those which are likely to remain in the confidence of the public.<lb/>
I can help the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has announced that he is considering the appointment of an independent person of standing to review the operation of the emergency provisions Act each year. That is the position at the moment. If there is anything further on which I can help the noble Lord I hope that I shall be able to do so before too long.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked me about a code of practice and a code of conduct for the RUC. This is a matter for the chief constable. I understand that the matter is in an advanced stage of preparation, but I stress that the code will not bite on the exercise of emergency powers or on the exercise of power by the armed forces. My honourable friend the Minister of State announced on 8th April that the Government would be publishing and bringing into force a non-statutory code of practice for the exercise of emergency powers by the RUC and the armed forces.<lb/>
I am sorry that I have my notes out of order. I shall be winding up straight away. There was one last point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, about a teacher whom he mentioned. The Department of Education became aware in October 1986 that during the past two years this lady, Miss Gleeson, had had three criminal convictions&#x2014;impersonation at an election, assault on the police and obstruction of the police. The department informed this lady that it proposed to withdraw her recognition as a teacher on grounds of misconduct, subject to any representations which might be made by her. These representations were heard and in all the circumstances the department decided not to withdraw recognition. She was informed by letter on 10th April of this year and at the same time was given a stern warning as to her future conduct.<lb/>
I hesitate to say that I have covered all the points that have been raised during this debate on what is a short but complicated Bill. I hope that I have covered most points, but if there are any others we shall no doubt be able to pick them up at a later stage. I should like to thank all your Lordships for giving such close and detailed consideration to the Bill. It stresses that these are emergency provisions and, as your Lordships know, we are in an emergency situation in Northern Ireland. The Government are grateful for the consideration and tolerance with which it has been considered. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Stansted Airport Aircraft Movement<lb/>Limit Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01693">1.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01694"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft order laid before the House on 7th April be approved.<lb/>
The Government have always recognised the concern which residents of the Stansted area feel about
<col>386</col>
the development of Stansted airport. That is why we made it an explicit condition of planning permission for the expansion of Stansted that development should be phased so that local infrastructure can gradually absorb the increasing demand. Our commitment to phased development was confirmed in the 1985 White Paper when we promised to restrict development in the first instance to no more than about 7 to 8 million passengers per annum&#x2014;about half the 15 million passengers per year for which planning consent has been given&#x2014;by means of a limit on air transport movements. The 1985 White Paper promised also that decisions on ATM limits should be for Parliament, and we have kept that promise too, for Section 79 of the 1986 Act permits an ATM limit order to be made only with the approval of Parliament on the affirmative resolution procedure.<lb/>
Turning now to the detail of the order itself, the Government propose that there should be a limit of 78,000 air transport movements at Stansted to correspond to a passenger throughput of about 7 to 8 million passengers per year. The figure of 78,000 ATMs has been calculated on our most recent air passenger traffic forecasts and is generated by two factors: the relative proportion of different traffic types that we expect to be serving Stansted when passenger throughput nears 8 million passengers per annum; and the average aircraft passenger loading at that time. In suggesting a limit of 78,000 ATMs our calculations assume that all categories of traffic at Stansted will experience significant growth, such that, at 8 million passengers per annum, Stansted would have about 10 per cent. domestic passengers, roughly 37 per cent. short-haul charter passengers, about 19 per cent. short-haul scheduled passengers and the balance&#x2014;a little short of 35 per cent. of long-haul passengers.<lb/>
The second element of the calculation, the passenger loading, has been estimated by comparison with Gatwick. In the light of the similarities between Stansted now and Gatwick in its early years, one can reasonably make inferences about the passenger loadings that might operate at Stansted when it is handling 8 million passengers per annum and the passenger loadings at Gatwick when that airport had an identical passenger volume. An absolutely precise parallel cannot be drawn. Corrections have had to be made to take account of increased average aircraft capacities and to eliminate distortions resulting from the low passenger loadings on the Heathrow-Gatwick helicopter link operating then, each movement of which constituted an ATM.<lb/>
The Government have naturally considered the possibility of different traffic and passenger loading outturns and have tested the robustness of the proposed limit against varying assumptions. We considered two outlying scenarios in particular: rapid growth in short-haul scheduled services, the result of extensive liberalisation and deregulation; and rapid growth in the charter market, with short/medium-haul charter passengers forming a much larger proportion of the annual total. Neither scenario revealed a difference of more than I per cent. from the 78,000 figure.<lb/>
The draft order is in five articles. The first two define the limit itself and its period of operation. The remaining articles address those classes of aircraft
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0202"/>
<col>387</col>
movement not counting towards the proposed limit. During the passage of the Airports Act 1986 we described what an ATM limit would and would not cover. In particular, we explained that the limit would exclude diversion, positioning, air-taxi and general aviation movements; and, in accord with our White Paper undertaking to limit development in terms of passenger volume, the proposed limit bears on passenger air transport movements only.<lb/>
The measure to which the Government now seek your Lordships' approval is both apt and timely. It strikes a balance between the acknowledged need for additional airport capacity in the South-East and the local interests of those who live or work in the Stansted area. I commend it to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 7th April be approved. [<i>18th Report from the Joint Committee</i>]&#x2014;(<i>Lord Brabazon of Tara</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01695"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining the order and I recognise that the Government have adhered to their undertaking to have an ATM limit at Stansted. However, I question whether the proposed limit of 78,000 is a proper one to have put forward at this stage.<lb/>
As the Minister said, Article 3 details various exclusions&#x2014;the positioning of aircraft, air-taxi and general aviation movements and cargo only flights. I understand that in 1986 the number of cargo only movements amounted to something like 4,500. That would be 6 per cent. of the 78,000 ATM limit. I gather that the number of cargo flights has been increasing and could increase further. They fly over the area where I live on the edge of Epping Forest. Fortunately, they are sufficiently high so that they do not worry me greatly but they will worry people in the area of the airport itself.<lb/>
It has been estimated that the movements excluded by Article 3 could be as many as 10 per cent. in addition to the 78,000. When considering the Airports Bill it will be remembered that I urged that there should be consideration of environmental aspects. I do not withdraw anything I said on that matter. I welcome the attitude taken by the Government and repeated by the Minister in giving some assurance to residents living in the area.<lb/>
There are other factors which do not appear to have been taken into consideration. At present the number of movements at Stansted is about 16,000. The 78,000 will be five times the present limit. It would appear that the 78,000 ATM limit would be the maximum possible under the first phase of up to 8 million passengers per annum.<lb/>
This would give an average of a little over 100 passengers per flight. The maximum order does not appear to have any relation at all to traffic distribution policy, except within the South-East area, which we have debated on various occasions. In this respect I regret the failure to consult the North of England Regional Consortium or JACOLA (which, as noble Lords will know, is the Joint Airports Committee of Local Authorities), even though it has been stated by the Minister in the other place that some 31 bodies were consulted. I recognise that there is no statutory
<col>388</col>
requirement to consult the two bodies to which I have referred. Undoubtedly the CAA has been consulted, as has the airport operator affected, which is Stansted. I understand the operators of aircraft flying to and from Stansted have also been consulted.<lb/>
There is provision in Section 32 for any local authority or authorities which appear to the Secretary of State to be affected by operations of the airports also to be consulted and that has been interpreted as being those in the immediate area of Stansted. I suggest that this order for an ATM limit at Stansted goes far beyond the immediate area. It would seem that the regional airports must be affected by this order. That is why I referred to the fact that there should be some consideration given to traffic distribution policy.<lb/>
The Minister has given the estimated division of the various categories of flights. Obviously, domestic and short-haul charter flights will be of interest to regional airports. But, in particular, the estimated 35 per cent. of the maximum ATM of long-haul passengers will be of vital interest to them. If 35 per cent. is to be the figure reached for long-haul passengers, that means 2,750,000 more passengers on such flights going to and from Stansted.<lb/>
From where will they come? This must be of interest to the regional airports. That is why I regret that the two bodies to which I have referred, even though there is no statutory requirement to do so, have not been consulted by the Minister. It would have been wise if he had done so. Instead of fixing the maximum limit of 78,000, which, of course, can be breached as soon as circumstances allow, surely it might have been preferable to have phased in the ATM position at Stansted in relation to a traffic distribution policy nationwide, not merely for the South-East.<lb/>
I am naturally concerned that if the 8 million passenger throughput and the 78,000 ATM are reached&#x2014;I am not going into the question as to whether the present Administration will be looking after this; that is another matter&#x2014;there will be a tendency to proceed for parliamentary approval for increase the throughput to 15 million for which, as the Minister reminded us, there is planning permission. An even higher ATM would then be sought leading eventually to the possibility of 25 million for which the runway has the capacity.<lb/>
When we debated airports' policy we heard of the views expressed by a body which called itself the National Policy for Britain's Airports. I remarked at the time that it did not originate in the Essex area but from outside it. It is the same with nuclear policy; somebody else's backyard, never our own. I recently attended a seminar arranged by this body. I put the same point that all the bodies that were represented appeared to be well outside the Stansted area. There must be consideration given to these factors.<lb/>
I welcome the Government keeping to their pledge and taking into consideration environmental matters. To go right up to 78,000 at this stage, without consideration of a national traffic distribution policy and the consideration of regional airports, is a grave mistake.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01696">1.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01697"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, though for precisely opposite reasons, I am not at all happy about this order. I hope that my noble friend will not mind if I say that it is depressing to those of us who believe in the expansion of British civil aviation to find an order being produced which would inhibit the expansion of an airport into which a great deal of public money is being invested and which is undoubtedly necessary for the proper development of British civil aviation.<lb/>
Civil aviation is one of our success stories of recent years. It is one of the things that we do extremely well in this country. I need hardly say that to the bearer of a great name in the aviation world such as the Minister. It seems to me to be unhappy that we should he imposing an arbitrary limit on this expansion.<lb/>
I have no sympathy at all, I am afraid, with the complaint by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, that the Government did not consult organisations operating rival airports. It would be quite wrong to inhibit the development of a particular airport, in which the Government themselves are seeing that a considerable investment is made, with a view to driving operators away from an airport they want to use to others which, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, they did not want so much to use.<lb/>
It would be quite wrong because, as I understand it, the Government are imposing this limit not to interfere with the free choice of airport by the airlines but simply to seek to appease the excitements of local people who fear environmental disturbance if the airport develops.<lb/>
I hope that the Government are not going to be too tender in that direction. We went through all this over the development of Gatwick. Some of your Lordships may remember that I had the honour, as the then Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, of taking the decision to develop Gatwick. We had every sort of local environmental trouble.<lb/>
We faced it, and, as a result, Gatwick has now brought an enormous amount of wealth into West Sussex. It provides a great deal of first-class employment and has helped enormously in the development of that part of the world. A proper, full-throated development of Stansted can do the same in Essex. Therefore, personally, I regret a limit being imposed.<lb/>
Incidentally, if your Lordships look at the terms of the order, you will see that it is an example of a <i>non sequitur</i> of a kind so extraordinary that it is rarely seen anywhere outside the law courts. It first of all says that as the runway is not being fully used, we are going to impose a restriction on the amount of use given to it. That is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>.<lb/>
I hope that my noble friend will realise that if he had wished, in his efforts to appease local irritation over development of this airport, it would have been more logical to have said (if he could have done, but, of course, he could not) that it was because the runway was being so much used that it was necessary to impose a restriction. But to say that because it is so little used it is necessary to impose a restriction is wholly illogical. There is perhaps some objection to enacting illogicality in delegated legislation.<lb/>
<col>390</col>
On the more serious side, my noble friend did not say a word about what is highly relevant&#x2014;the fact that all expert forecasts of demand for airport facilities in the South-East predict a substantial shortage in capacity before the end of the century. Indeed, my noble friend may remember that some of us, a little time ago, were pressing the Government for information as to what they were doing about it.<lb/>
That, of course, meant that we felt&#x2014;as I certainly feel&#x2014;that given the time it takes to develop airports, it really is important for the Government to be getting ahead with further airport development now. All we are given here is an order which, if it has any effect at all, is an order to restrict development. Although, as the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has said, the figure selected&#x2014;it is an odd sort of figure, too&#x2014;for the limit of movements in the year is well above the current level, it must be something of a discouragement to those who are responsible for developing this airport, and for the operators who want to operate out of it, to know that the Government are putting an arbitrary limit on the number of movements that may take place.<lb/>
Generally speaking, it is government policy&#x2014;it is certainly the policy of this Government&#x2014;to encourage the maximum development and the maximum output of the various industries with which we are concerned. But, here, you are placing a barrier beyond which, legally, it would be impossible, while this order lasts for the airport to develop. Psychologically that is unfortunate. If I may be allowed to take the matter a little further, the whole story of Stansted is extraordinary.<lb/>
The development of Stansted as a major London airport was approved in 1964 by the Government of my noble friend Lord Home of the Hirsel. Since then there have been innumerable public inquiries which have done no good to anybody, except perhaps members of the Bar who have made a very good living from them. Here we are, 23 years later, nervously restricting the use of one runway at Stansted. If government civil aviation policy had been more consistent and sensible, Stansted would by now have developed to something at least of the scale of Gatwick. Perhaps, unlike Gatwick, it would have been allowed a second runway and would be serving a major part in the development of British civil aviation. I do not blame my noble friend for those delays because out of the 23 years involved he has hardly been responsible for 23 weeks.<lb/>
However, I am sorry to see him following the policy of playing down and trying to restrict the development of this airport. I should like to see the number of its movements rise and increase, and I should like to see the Government encouraging that. As the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has said, it is true that at the moment this particular figure will have no practical effect, although it has adverse psychological effects. I hope that the Government will watch this matter. If the number of movements comes anywhere near to it, as I hope it will before long, the order will have to be withdrawn and either be replaced by another at a much higher figure or, better still, be replaced by no order at all.<lb/>
I hope my noble friend will obtain this order. I hope he will not take it with the feeling that it is an order which arouses much enthusiasm among those of
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0204"/>
<col>391</col>
us&#x2014;and I hope that he will include himself&#x2014;who want to see British civil aviation continue to develop and make a major contribution to the well-being of the British economy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01698"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I doubt very much whether the honourable Member for Saffron Walden will hear those remarks from the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, with much enthusiasm.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01699"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to intervene? If the honourable Member for Saffron Walden understands economics, and if he studies the benefits which the development of Gatwick have brought to the constituencies of the Members in the area, he should welcome them. If he is a sensible man, I am sure that he will.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01700"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we can doubtless draw that matter to his attention at an appropriate moment during the next few weeks.<lb/>
I cannot follow the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, in his vision of the whole of the South-East of England covered with concrete and with aircraft coming in every minute of the day and night. I think that that sort of dark satanic mill approach to aircraft movements is not one that we on these Benches wish to follow.<lb/>
I should like to thank the Minister for introducing this order and to ask him to clarify two points that have already been dealt with to a degree by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill. Can the Minister give some figures for the number of aircraft which, in the Government's scenario, are likely to be involved in positioning flights? The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, also asked how many aircraft are likely to be involved in cargo flights. They are important numbers because very often cargo flights are noisier than passenger flights. The aircraft tend to be older and more heavily loaded. They are likely to cause some disturbance to those living in the area around the airport.<lb/>
There is certainly no great opposition to this order from these Benches. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, we believe it is a pity that the other regional airports were not at least asked for their views; not that the Government should necessarily fall in line with any such views. One of the matters which I have become a little fed up with is the northern airports in particular beating Stansted about the ears. As things stand, I do not think that they will suffer greatly from the increased movements at Stansted. However, the people around Stansted are entitled to consideration. I think that the Government have shown some consideration, even if the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, does not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01701"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the response of noble Lords to the introduction of this order; although there are mixed opinions from opposite sides of the House as to whether we are not going far enough (from my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter) or are going too far too quickly (from the noble Lord, Lord Underhill). I should like to think that we probably have it just about right. In any case, all that we are doing is fulfilling the undertakings that we gave during consideration of the White Paper and the Airports Bill.<lb/>
<col>392</col>
I endorse entirely what was said by my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter in connection with the success story of the history of civil aviation in this country. I am also grateful for the remarks that he made as regards my family connections in that.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, spoke of the possibility of consultation beyond the immediate area. The important point is that the ATM limit is a local measure, designed to enable local infrastructure to absorb the impact of the Stansted development. The consultation on the proposed limit reflects the local nature of the measure. The purpose of making the ATM limit subject to affirmative resolution is to provide for the most searching scrutiny by Parliament. That is what we have done today to some extent.<lb/>
As regards the effect of the Stansted development on regional airports, to which the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Tordoff, referred, we have no evidence to suggest that there will be an adverse effect on traffic at regional airports. The development is being timed to meet the forecast need for additional capacity to serve the London area airports. Some of the regional airports are at the moment enjoying pretty good traffic growth on their own account. I entirely agree with the remarks of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter: that one cannot force people to fly from places they do not want to go from. Indeed, the idea of using an ATM limit order to reallocate traffic, as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, we do not believe to be a good one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01702"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will forgive me, is it not the case that it is necessary to force aircraft to go to where they do not want to go? Everyone wants to go to Heathrow at the moment. I accept that passengers may want to go to Gatwick but, on the whole, airlines want to go to Heathrow. Some of them cannot go there and that is why they must go to Stansted. By putting limitations on developments at Heathrow, one is forcing people to go to Stansted. It is not a totally free market.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01703"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree that it is not a totally free market but that is because Heathrow is at the moment operating at virtually full capacity. That situation does not arise elsewhere. Traffic distribution is not the purpose of an ATM limit. The purpose is to control the rate of expansion at an airport. The Airports Act provides different powers for traffic distribution rules in Section 31. The rules which were made last year took account of the Government's intention for an ATM limit at Stansted.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, queried the capacity in the South-East of England at the present time. Both BAA plc and Stansted Airport support the order. Naturally the Government are keeping longterm capacity under review, as doubtless will BAA plc as the main provider of airport capacity in the South-East. The CAA will also keep a close watch on capacity issues in the light of its duties under Section 16(2) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982.<lb/>
Both the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Tordoff, asked about the volume of cargo flights. I can confirm that the current usage figures show that there were 4,337 all-cargo movements last year, but only 584&#x2014;or less than 14 per cent.&#x2014;were by jet aircraft.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0205"/>
<col>393</col>
The vast majority&#x2014;over 86 per cent.&#x2014;were by small propeller-driven aircraft, which are relatively quiet. Therefore, I hope that that will not add significantly to the noise nuisance at the airport.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, asked me about positioning flights. I am afraid I have not got an answer for him at the moment but if at all possible I will write to the noble Lord. I hope I have covered most of the points made by your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay (Offshore Employment) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01705">2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01706"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Lucas of Chilworth)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 5th May be approved. [<i>19th Report from the Joint Committee</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01707">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that these draft orders be approved. First, however, I regret to have to draw your Lordships' attention to a technical error in the printed copies of the schedules to both orders. The schedules define, by means of coordinates, the Norwegian part of the Frigg natural gas field and paragraphs 1(b) of both schedules refer to the parallel of latitude 50&#x00B0;50'00"N. The correct parallel of latitude is 59&#x00B0;50'00"N. I am given to understand that the earlier version embraces most of the South-East of England. The revised versions of both orders, containing a manuscript amendment, were laid before your Lordships' House on Tuesday 5th May, and I hope your Lordships will accept my apologies for this error.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01708">The orders have a simple but important purpose and one which I am sure all Members of your Lordships' House will appreciate and welcome. The orders will extend the coverage of the equality laws&#x2014;the Sex Discrimination, Equal Pay and Race Relations Acts&#x2014;to offshore employment on the United Kingdom continental shelf, except for those areas where the law of Northern Ireland applies. By offshore employment I mean, to quote the wording of the orders:
<quote>"Employment concerned with the exploration of the seabed or subsoil or the exploitation of their natural resources".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01709">The orders will therefore extend the legislation I have mentioned to employment connected with the oil and gas industries' offshore activities in the North Sea and elsewhere around the coast of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01710">The orders will also extend coverage of the three Acts to employees of British and British-based companies anywhere in the Frigg natural gas field. This field straddles the geographical boundary line between the United Kingdom and the Norwegian areas of the continental shelf&#x2014;one rig is, I understand, actually part in the UK and part in Norway. It was of course necessary to obtain the Norwegian Government's agreement for extension to the Frigg field, and this we have done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01711">The powers for extending the Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Act to offshore employment in the specified activities are to be found
<col>394</col>
in those Acts in Sections 10(5) and 8(5) respectively. Section 10(5) of the Sex Discrimination Act also provides similarly for the extension of the Equal Pay Act. Given the progress towards equality which has been made since these Acts were passed in the 1970s, the Government believe it is time to bring these powers into use.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01712">To take sex discrimination first, it is now generally accepted that women should have the right to the same employment opportunities as men. At the same time, traditional attitudes still persist in some areas and indeed are held by women as well as men. A 1984 study prepared for the Equal Opportunities Commission showed that women were only 0.1 per cent. of a normal shift in the offshore industry. It would be surprising if the exclusion from the legislation has not had something to do with this. My noble friend Lady Platt and the Equal Opportunities Commission, who have done so much to advance the cause of equality, are, I know, very concerned that the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act should be extended to cover offshore employment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01713">I am encouraged by the responses to the consultation the Government have undertaken in connection with these changes, which have confirmed our belief that employers in the offshore industry, like employers generally, are opposed to discrimination. Even so, I am sure that women's talents are still not being used to the full. This legislative protection will not only ensure that employers will have to change unjustifiable discriminatory practices, where these continue to exist, but will also give women greater encouragement and confidence to put themselves forward where job opportunities occur.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01714">As regards racial discrimination, there is already a very considerable mix of nationalities and racial groups among persons employed offshore. I cannot say because of this that discrimination never occurs. Where it does, the race relations order before us today will give individuals a right of redress. I know that this will be welcomed by the Commission for Racial Equality.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01715">I mentioned consultations. The Government have of course taken the views of both sides of industry&#x2014;the CBI, the TUC and the Scottish TUC&#x2014;before proposing these changes and I am delighted to report that all supported them in principle. The CBI was, however, concerned that there should be an adequate lead-in period for employers, and the TUC and the STUC were concerned that problems over provision of separate sleeping accommodation and other necessary facilities for women should not become an easy avenue of escape from the legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01716">Perhaps I may say a brief word about both these points, which were the only substantive ones arising from the consultation. Taking due account of the CBI's concern, the draft orders have a commencement date of 1st November 1987. This will give employers just under six months, including the all-important summer months, in which to make any structural alterations which may be necessary for their compliance with the Sex Discrimination Act. As your Lordships will appreciate, most structural work offshore is possible only in the summer months.</p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0206"/>
<col>395</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01717">The same commencement date is proposed for both orders in order to avoid confusion, although the considerations that I have just outlined are relevant only to extension of the sex discrimination legislation. The Government hope that employers will take full advantage of the lead-in period where alterations to accommodate women are necessary and practicable. However, Section 7(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act covers circumstances in which it would not be reasonable to require the provisions of separate sleeping accommodation and sanitary facilities so that both men and women can be employed. I appreciate that that lies at the heart of the concern that has been expressed by the TUC and the Scottish TUC. I have no doubt that the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, who is sitting opposite will express those views.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01718">Perhaps I should say against that background that when the legislation is extended to offshore employment, Section 7(2), as it does at present for onshore employment, will provide a defence for an employer who employs one sex only in circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to expect him or her to provide accommodation and facilities for both sexes. The point about Section 7(2) that I wish to emphasise this afternoon is that it does not provide employers with a blanket defence. If an employer's decision not to provide for both sexes were challenged, the facts of the matter would have to be considered by an industrial tribunal and it would be for the tribunal to decide whether in all the particular circumstances the employer's decision was reasonable. I should stress that I am confident that tribunals will ensure that the protection of employers in Section 7(2) is not abused. I understand that in the limited number of cases where tribunals have had to consider this matter they have always held it reasonable that employers should provide separate facilities. Because of this, the Equal Opportunities Commission commented in their document <i>Legislating For Change</i>? that they considered no amendment to Section 7(2) of that Act was necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01719">Of course, I shall be happy to respond to any questions that may arise from my opening remarks. I commend both draft orders to your Lordships. I believe that they represent a small but nevertheless significant further step towards equality, and that they will point up in a very particular way the importance and good business sense of choosing the best person for any job, regardless of sex or race. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01720">Moved, that the draft order laid before the House on 5th May be approved [<i>19th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01721">2.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01722"><member>Baroness Turner of Camden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that nobody in your Lordships' House can possibly wish to object to any move to enlarge the scope of the race relations and sex discrimination Acts, and on that basis we welcome these orders. Indeed, many people have said that this step should have been taken before now.<lb/>
As the Minister has said, the EOC has always pressed for sex discrimination legislation to be extended to offshore employment. However, I believe
<col>396</col>
that there is a problem. There is no doubt at all that the offshore oil industry is a male dominated industry. The Minister himself has referred to the excellent survey, <i>Women in the North Sea Oil Industry</i>, that was produced some time ago by the Equal Opportunities Commission. That survey underlined, as he has said, the fact that there were hardly any women working in this industry. However, there are now increasing numbers of women, particularly those qualifying as geologists, who see the offshore oil industry as a career opportunity. There is no doubt also that they are not getting these opportunities, and I wonder whether the order is sufficient to enable them to do so even now.<lb/>
The report of the Equal Opportunities Commission ends with the two conclusions that:
<quote>"there are well educated and highly motivated women wishing to work offshore who are denied the opportunity to do so simply because they are women&#x2014;and for <i>no other reason</i>"; and</quote>
<quote>"At a lower point in the occupation scale women are denied access to relatively well-paid work in offshore catering and from the opportunity to experience the work environment of the North Sea. They are denied this opportunity because they are women&#x2014;<i>andfor no other reason</i>."</quote>
However, the reason that is often advanced by employers for not employing women is that there are no proper facilities for them&#x2014;those are the points put forward by both the Scottish TUC and the TUC. They say that there are no toilet and washing facilities and so on, and that therefore the environment is not suitable for women. As the Minister has indicated, they are able to do so because of the existence of Section 7(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act.<lb/>
I believe that as the order now stands it will still permit the use of this defence by employers. For that reason I believe that the order does not go far enough since it will not in practice result in equal opportunities being extended to women and the provisions of the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts will not apply when it comes to it.<lb/>
I suggest that the Minister takes serious account of what has been said. I do not wish to oppose the order because, as I have already said, I should not wish to give the impression that we are in any way opposed to the extension of the cover of the Acts to offshore employment. Quite the reverse is true. We are concerned to ensure that the extension really is an extension and that the rights that seem to be available in the order really will apply when it comes to the practical application.<lb/>
I understand that the Norwegian industry, which has a relatively low female workforce&#x2014;about 12 to 13 per cent.&#x2014;provides appropriate facilities for both sexes as a matter of course. I do not see why our industry should not do so and why failure to do so should be used by employers under Section 7(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act as a reason for frustrating the intentions of the order. I very much fear that, unless some steps are taken to ensure it does not happen, that may well be the case. However, I do not wish, as I said earlier, to oppose either order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01723"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, for her acceptance of the order before us this afternoon. I shall just underline what I attempted to say in my opening remarks. In touching on the question of the number of women working in the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0207"/>
<col>397</col>
British sector of the North Sea, I regret it is a fact that there are no comprehensive statistics for the number of women employed offshore on the UK continental shelf on relevant activities. The only information that we have is that contained in the research prepared for the Equal Opportunities Commission in 1984. That research provided a best estimate that only about 0.1 per cent. of the workforce, or some 22,000 all told, were women. Therefore only about 25 were working offshore on a normal shift basis.<lb/>
I am aware that in the past women have perhaps been discouraged from applying for those jobs but I believe that the order will remove some of the obstacles. I am equally aware of the concern that the Trades Union Congress and indeed the ASTMS, of which the noble Baroness is the general secretary, expressed that employers might evade the new legislation and might see the suggestion that Section 7 should not apply to offshore employees.<lb/>
However, I must say that Section 7(2) defence will certainly not permit an employer to disregard the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act. All it does is to enable an employer to argue before an industrial tribune that the particular circumstances of the workplace and the employer's circumstances, including of course financial resource, are such that it would be unreasonable to require the provision of sleeping accommodation and sanitary facilities for both sexes.<lb/>
The employer who deliberately seeks to use that section to evade the legislation will run a grave risk of a decision against him, which could involve him in paying not only compensation but also costs.<lb/>
It would be an unwelcome, but perhaps more than that, an unnecessary departure to single out a particular industry for exclusion from the section. The noble Baroness referred to the Norwegian law and practice, but the Norwegian law does not contain a provision such as that in Section 7(2)(<i>c</i>). Again, I refer to the report prepared in 1984 for the Equal Opportunities Commission. The report pointed out that in Norway there are not quite the same&#x2014;how can I put it?&#x2014;cultural restraints on shared accommodation as there are in the United Kingdom. Despite that legislation in Norway. it is interesting to note that women working offshore remain concentrated in what some might have described as women's traditional occupations. Therefore I do not believe that even with that legislation or the absence of it in the United Kingdom, women have been denied opportunities nor will they be denied opportunities in the higher echelons.<lb/>
In conclusion, perhaps I may simply reiterate that while the numbers of employees affected may not be very great the orders represent a quite significant milestone in the progress towards full equality which I am quite sure your Lordships will accept.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Access to Personal Files Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01727">2.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01728"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
It is the proud boast of the Liberal Party, which is enshrined in the preamble to its constitution, that its aim is to create a society,
<quote>"which in all things sets freedom first."</quote>
Therefore noble Lords will not be surprised to see a Bill of this sort coming from the Alliance Benches dealing with what, I believe, is one of the most compelling elements of individual freedom; namely, freedom of information and particularly the freedom of individuals to have the right to know what has been recorded in documents about themselves and, furthermore, the right to correct any wrong or inaccurate information.<lb/>
But I hasten to say that this is not a party Bill. It was introduced as a Private Member's measure by my honourable friend the Member in another place for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Mr. Archy Kirkwood, who had the good fortune to come high in the ballot for Private Member's Motions. It does him great credit that he chose this subject. It also has had all-party support throughout the length and breadth of its discussions in another place. I have every hope that it will receive similar support in your Lordships' House today.<lb/>
It has also had a very considerable amount of support from organisations outside. I have here a list of people who were supporters of the original Bill, which includes organisations such as the Association of County Councils Policy Committee, the Association of Distict Councils, Scottish Local Health Councils, the British Association of Social Workers, the Child Poverty Action Group, the College of Health, the Howard League, and so on. So it has had very wide support in the country as well, and indeed by the time it got to Second Reading in another place more than 140 organisations had said that they supported the Bill.<lb/>
The principle which this Bill deals with is already enshrined in legislation where computer records are involved, and from November this year the Data Protection Act will, as noble Lords know, allow individuals to seek personal information held about them on computers. It has therefore been an anomaly that similar information held in ordinary files does not come within the terms of that Act. Indeed&#x2014;and your Lordships will remember that this was raised when the Data Protection Act was being discussed&#x2014;it provides something of a loophole through which people can get away from the terms of that Act. So for the first time this Bill which is before your Lordships today extends this right to cover manually held records.<lb/>
Unfortunately it only covers a few classes of records&#x2014;far fewer than the Bill when it was originally drafted covered. I shall come back to that in a few minutes. The main benefits of the Bill are that it
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0208"/>
<col>399</col>
enables people to keep themselves fully informed about steps that an authority is taking in relation to them. It provides the basis for a more equal relationship between the individual and the authority or professionals with whom he or she deals and it provides the opportunity to detect errors&#x2014;I believe that this is one of the most important aspects of the Bill&#x2014;which might otherwise be acted on by officials who have no direct knowledge of the person involved.<lb/>
One of the classic cases&#x2014;it is a question of medical records, which are not now covered in this Bill, but it is a good example of the sort of thing that can happen &#x2014;was that of Helen Mann, who is a 26 year-old chef. She was astonished to find that her GP accused her of being a heroin addict. She did not realise at first that he was serious and she became anxious when she found that errors had been passed to him in the medical notes of her former GP. It took her many months to discover that a drug addict had been impersonating her at her former GP's practice.<lb/>
Included in the notes were four references to drug addiction and another reference to a hepatitis episode at Charing Cross Hospital. Fortunately, she was able to show that at that time she had not been in the country. As a result, she was recently allowed access to the records. However, she expressed anger at the fact that it took 10 months and 17 letters before she was able to find out what was causing the problem. That is one occasion when errors were detected. There are many cases involving medical and other records where people do not know that errors have been put into files of which they know nothing.<lb/>
The other benefit is that the Bill is a safeguard against poorly thought out or unfair comments being recorded. If we were talking here about doctors or social workers putting their own private thoughts about someone into a private diary, I should not have much objection. But information may go down on files which, although they are confidential, may be passed on to other people in the discipline. Mistakes keep on coming up year after year. There is no way in which they can be corrected.<lb/>
Indeed, many local authorities, doctors and employers have voluntarily opened records. They have found that course to be beneficial, first, because it signifies that they have nothing to hide and that they are doing their best either to provide a service or to ensure that individuals are being fairly treated. But, secondly, that action dispels unjustified suspicion which arises when people do not get treatment, which is very important both in the social services and in the medical profession. People often assume that they are being unfairly treated when in fact delay is caused by a long waiting list or some such factor. Some authorities report that, although people often ask to see their records out of suspicion, they go away impressed by what they discover.<lb/>
Perhaps I may now deal with the scope of the Bill. As it stands, it covers local authority housing and social service records, although, as I said, earlier it covered a wider range. Although education records are not included on the face of the Bill, a practical agreement which accompanies the Bill includes an undertaking by the Government to make a comparable provision for access to education records under
<col>400</col>
powers which already exist. There are assurances, as noble Lords will know from the debates in another place, which reaffirm the Government's position.<lb/>
I shall give your Lordships a few examples of situations covering both housing records and social services records. The first is contained in a letter to my honourable friend Mr. Kirkwood. The person writing it says,
<quote>"I would like you to know that I have been trying to gain access to my files from the council for the last 15 years and have been told that it is not council policy to let me see them. I tried to see them and had an interview with the Housing Manager who said as far as he was concerned the accusations&#x2026; were factual but I have no right to find out what accusations were made&#x2026; I was served notice to quit my council house&#x2026; I was given no opportunity to defend myself&#x2026; I want to see the allegations made against me&#x2026; I am nearing 70 years old and want to live the rest of my life with an easy mind".</quote>
That seems to me to encapsulate the problem so far as housing records are concerned. There is another case which is going in front of the European Commission. Mr. Gaskin, who has spent the bulk of his life in the care of the Liverpool social services department claims that his traumatic experience in numerous foster homes and institutions has left him a psychological wreck and as such he argues that the Liverpool social services department was in breach of its obligation to provide him with the appropriate level of protection and care.<lb/>
That is a well known case which has been written up in a book published in 1983. It was followed by an interview with the BBC and a considerable number of discussion programmes on television. The fight is continuing and the case is currently before the European Commission. The case is raised under Articles 8 and 10. It alleges that he is unable to have access to his case file for the purpose of providing how badly he was treated. I make no judgment whatever on this matter because it is before the commission. I do not know the facts of the case but it seems that problems would have been averted if the person had been able to have access to his file.<lb/>
The Bill is a purely enabling Bill, and the right of access is dependent upon regulations which are to be made. Those regulations may also provide for authorities to correct records which contain inaccurate information; for appeals to be made against decisions to deny access or to refuse to correct records; for authorities to charge a fee up to a prescribed maximum for giving access; and for some exemptions from access. The question of exemptions is critical. All those who advocate the right of access accept that certain restrictions need to be imposed, particularly to protect the rights of third parties.<lb/>
Originally, the full Bill spelled out the exemptions in detail. They would have included the need to protect the privacy of third parties and the identities of members of the public or family speaking to an authority in confidence; the safety of third parties; the interests of a child, in cases where a parent sought access to the child's record; and the subject of the record in circumstances where immediate access could be harmful. The Bill proposed that in such circumstances access could be deferred for a period to allow the disclosure to take place after, rather than during, a period of acute disturbance.<lb/>
Although, precisely, the right solution may not have been found in each case, the exemptions as originally
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0209"/>
<col>401</col>
framed were narrowly defined in terms of the particular interest that each was intended to safeguard. It is now hoped that departments, when they come to issue their own regulations, will resist any temptation to define these exemptions in very broad terms which would allow authorities to withhold information merely because they felt that disclosure would cause embarrassment or because they would find it difficult to justify what had been written.<lb/>
As it now stands, the Bill is only a small part of what was originally proposed. We, and others in your Lordships' House, regret that the Bill now deals only with local authority records. The original proposal would have included records held by central government, as well as employment and medical records.<lb/>
As regards medical records, I know that a number of doctors agree with the need for this provision but I have received a letter from the British Medical Association which it has asked me to mention. The letter states:
<quote>"Although health records do not form part of this Bill, no doubt the issue of access to medical records will be raised.&#x2026; We would like those taking part in the debate to know that we are currently discussing this issue with the Home Office and the DHSS. Because the DHSS and doctors can see problems as well as advantages regarding patients having access to their medical records, we feel it would be helpful at this stage if these discussions were allowed to continue in advance of any legislation being considered".</quote>
Far be it from me to wish to put an end to discussions, but I hope that at the end of the day the difficulties are not allowed to outweigh the benefits and that in the very near future similar legislation can be enacted relating to medical records.<lb/>
There remains a considerable amount of support for the measure, watered down as it may be. One of the penalties of having a Private Member's measure going through the parliamentary system is that compromises have often to be made in order to get the measure on to the statute book. In view of that, I hope that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading today and that it may not be necessary to amend it. It is my hope that we may get the Bill through in time to reach the statute book before certain coming events cast their shadows too deeply across it.<lb/>
In Committee in the other place, the Minister of State, Home Office, Mr. David Waddington, gave a series of undertakings on behalf of his ministerial colleagues concerning the regulations upon which the Bill depends. One is grateful for those undertakings. They are crucial, because without them the promised regulations will not come into force and therefore no right of access will come into force.<lb/>
As I understand it, the undertakings are for social work and educational records in England and Wales and housing, social work and educational records in Scotland. The Government have said that regulations will be made, and that they will use their best endeavours to make them by the end of 1988. The regulations on educational records will be made under the powers in the Education Act 1980 and equivalent powers in Scottish legislation.<lb/>
The one notable exception from the list, short as it is, is housing records in England and Wales. So far, the Department of the Environment has not given a 100
<col>402</col>
per cent. commitment that it will definitely make regulations on housing records. I urge the Government to give that undertaking as firmly and as quickly as possible. Having given the Minister some indication that I should be raising that point, I hope that he can give us some further reassurance today.<lb/>
Nevertheless, Mr. Waddington said in Committee in another place that although the Department of the Environment cannot say with 100 per cent. certainty that it will make regulations, he could assure the Committee that the likelihood of it failing to do so was remote. That is "government speak", and occasionally we should like things a little firmer on what is after all not a Draconian measure.<lb/>
I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that although in a letter to Mr. Kirkwood from Mr. John Patten the Minister for Housing, Urban Affairs and Construction he continues to say that discussions are necessary with the various local authority associations, it is now more than two years since Sir George Young answered a parliamentary question in which he said:
<quote>"My Department has today written to local authority associations, to organisations representing tenants' interests, and to other interested bodies, to seek their views about how such information can be made more readily available. Public sector tenants sometimes believe that their landlords' files contain misleading personal information. In this area, and subject to proper safeguards, they ought to be able to check that mistakes are not being made. A copy of the consultation paper is in the Library."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 6/12/84; <i>c. 238</i>.]</quote>
The fact that consultations are continuing gives one some grounds for concern. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us further reassurance. I hope that I have said enough to explain what the Bill is about and the need for it. I ask your Lordships to support the principle and the detail of the Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01729">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Tordoff</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01730">2.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01731"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, for his able introduction of this Private Member's Bill into your Lordships' House. Of course we all believe that it is right that people should not have allegations, comments or information about them on files which is not true and which they have no way of countering.<lb/>
Inevitably, I talk about the social services.. As your Lordships are aware, social services have under their remit the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped under the Mental Health Acts, the chronically sick and disabled under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, children and families under the Childrens and Children and Young Persons Acts, care and services to the elderly under the Health Service and Public Health Acts, and of course families in trouble.<lb/>
Every social worker knows that so far as possible and so far as practicable it is right that every person with whom they deal&#x2014;most of them are the vulnerable in our society&#x2014;must be dealt with with integrity, dignity and complete honesty. Perhaps a little further consideration of the Bill may be necessary. I am not against the Bill but I feel that certain matters have not yet been covered. I speak in particular for the Association of Directors of Social Services.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0210"/>
<col>403</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, talked about exemptions and third parties. In the social services it is recognised more and more that no one department can give a service to the vulnerable. It needs to be a number of departments. Not only that but it needs very often to be people who are outside local government, and that is the voluntary sector. On the question of information which is given by a third party, if we do not have this co-operation between various departments and people outside the department, and if we do not have a safeguard for third parties giving information which they consider should be confidential, we may be doing a disservice to the very people whom we want to serve.<lb/>
Perhaps I may give one example. It may be known to somebody that a man has been accused of and proved guilty of offences against children. He applies for a job working with children. Yet the person who knows this fact feels unable to divulge it unless they know that the information will be confidential. This is particularly the situation with the police. I have the greatest admiration for the way the police safeguard the information that they have. But unless the police feel that the information that they give will be treated confidentially, then they may feel unable to give it. At the end of the day that will be a disservice to the very people whom we seek to serve.<lb/>
The noble Lord has talked about exemptions and the mechanism of appeal. In my experience there were examples of facts that one knew which were not in the real interests&#x2014;and I say that with deep feelings&#x2014;of the cases concerned. I could cite many examples, in particular where children were concerned. If parents want to know everything about a child, and those parents do not always have discretion in what they do or do not tell the child, they may easily tell him or her facts which are damaging.<lb/>
While in principle I support this Bill, I think that there is much that has to be discussed. The social services are completely dependent on the medical profession. I know that when one was taking a case to court and wanted to decide which home to put an old person in, one was absolutely dependent on the doctors and their reports, and rightly so. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has said, there are debates taking place currently. We all know that that is so because we have all had the same letter from the British Medical Association. I hope that in these debates the position will be discussed with regard to the social services and medical reports received from doctors. Do we keep the medical report separate from the social file, or do we put it on the file? If so, we are then breaking confidentiality with regard to the doctors. In the service of the vulnerable we must also have complete integrity concerning those we work with and how we use the information we are given. I do not believe that this has been completely thought through. The association of directors also feels that this has not been thought out properly and needs further discussion.<lb/>
There is one last question I wish to ask. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, may be able to correct me, because I may not have read all the Acts I should have read. I am not sure about age. As a children's officer and as a director of social services, I sometimes had children coming to me of 12, 13 or 14 years asking to
<col>404</col>
see their files. There is a school in the north, Aycliffe School, where when a case conference is held both the children and the parents are present. Very little is withheld. But in certain cases it would be very damaging to a child, particularly in adolescence, to see a file which stated exactly the kind of life that the parents, the mother, the father, or both, lived.<lb/>
I always used to try to tell every child going out of care at the age of 18 what their background was, but there are certain things which children and adolescents particularly cannot tolerate. It would be to their disadvantage to know the details and to see their files. Perhaps the noble Lord would tell me whether there is an age limit.<lb/>
I support the principles behind the Bill, but I believe that further discussion is required on a number of the points I have raised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01732">2.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01733"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has given us a very full and clear explanation of what the Bill is all about. He leaves me just to make a few comments about it. I welcome this Bill as a small but very worthwhile step towards giving people the right to know what information is held about them by public authorities. What gives me a personal attachment to it is that I introduced a debate on this subject on 6th November last year. I was therefore very gratified when the Access to Personal Files Bill was introduced as a Private Member's Bill in another place.<lb/>
I first reiterate the fundamental beliefs on which this Bill is based; namely, that the right to see personal files is an important way of increasing people's control over their own lives. It will enable them to learn more about what is happening to them and give them the opportunity to take a more active part in discussions with authorities and the professions about their own affairs. It is also a safeguard against the possibility that records will contain inaccurate information or even unfair or prejudiced comment.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has made a very good case proving this and has given some striking examples. I remember that after my Unstarred Question I received many letters giving me some heartbreaking examples of how things could have been very different if the people in question had been allowed to check up on their own records.<lb/>
While I welcome the Bill I also regret the fact that it is so limited in its scope. Were it not rather late on a Friday afternoon&#x2014;and a very beautiful sunny afternoon at that&#x2014;I should have been tempted to reminisce for a moment about the high hopes that so many of us had about promoting the cause of freedom of information in those early days when the Bill was first being dreamt up. However, as we all know, during the passage of the Bill in another place the Government made it clear that they would not accept a measure which included a right of access to medical or employment records or to government benefit records.<lb/>
As a result those records, though initially covered, have had to be dropped. The absence of those, particularly medical records, as has already been said by the noble Lord and by the noble Baroness, will disappoint
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0211"/>
<col>405</col>
many people. The level of support for the right of access to those has been striking. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, mentioned the leading consumer, voluntary and professional bodies which declared their support for a legal right of access to health records. I too received the encouraging letter from the British Medical Association. The very fact that it wrote to us shows its strong commitment to continue with discussions and pressure on the principle that people should be allowed to see their records.<lb/>
The Government have said that they want to encourage greater access on a non-statutory basis but I have no doubt that pressure for legislation will continue. I hope it will not be long before we have the opportunity to debate a more all-encompassing measure. Without wishing to make a party point from these Benches, I should like to point out that in recent days the Labour Party has put forward proposals for a patients' charter which would most certainly include giving patients a right of access to their medical records.<lb/>
I have one or two reservations about the Bill as it now stands which I should like to put forward. I do so not to seek to impede its passage. As the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, said, it certainly needs to put its skates on. I should like to record these few reservations as representing the disappointment that many of us feel. First, there are the exemptions from access. Naturally there must be some to protect the privacy and safety of third parties; and no doubt these will be laid down in the regulations which the various departments will introduce. I hope the exemptions will be limited to those that are strictly necessary. If departments are too free with let-out clauses it could undermine the purpose of the measure.<lb/>
For example, in 1985 the DHSS issued a consultation paper on access to computerised social work records which suggested that one category of exempt information should be social workers' provisional options. What is a provisional option? The department suggested that an opinion or an assessment would be regarded as provisional and therefore not accessible to the person concerned until after a decison based on it had been taken. Surely the purpose of opening up records should be to allow people to participate in decisions affecting them. That proposal would have the opposite effect by keeping the information from people until it was too late to influence a decision.<lb/>
My second concern relates to charges. The Bill envisages that local authorities could charge a fee for allowing someone to see his or her records. I have serious worries about this aspect. Anything other than the most nominal of fees will effectively deter people from applying for records. This is not an area where a deterrent is needed. I doubt whether people will seek access to their records for any kind of trivial or flippant reason. They will want to see their records because they are anxious about a problem and hope that they will throw some light on it. They should not be discouraged from doing so by the imposition of high fees. Indeed a recent survey revealed that some local authorties are charging people as much as &#x00A3;.15 a time to inspect files and background papers which they are now entitled to see under the Local Government
<col>406</col>
(Access to Information) Act 1985. This is quite wrong and I hope the maximum prescribed fee set by the regulations will be a low one and that in practice local authorities will decide not to levy any fee at all.<lb/>
Finally, there is the question of whether regulations in all the areas covered by the Bill will be made at all. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, brought up the example of the Department of the Environment, which has been unwilling to give a commitment to make regulations, as indeed have other departments. The Department of Education and Science has said that it will make regulations on education records. The Department of Health and Social Security has said that it will make regulations on social work records. If it can be done for social work records, which by their very nature are likely to contain information about sensitive matters and vulnerable individuals, it is hard to understand why the much more straightforward question of housing records should be causing the Department of the Environment so much difficulty. I am pleased to see that the Scottish Office has undertaken to make regulations on housing records in Scotland. So it is rather intriguing to know what particular English problems the department anticipates in housing records south of the Border.<lb/>
Despite a feeling of regret for what might have been, I hope that the Bill has a speedy passage on to the statute book. My reservations should not obscure the fact that the Bill is a worthwhile measure which will benefit many people. It will at least serve to enshrine the principle that people should have the right to know more about their own affairs, and perhaps it will prepare the way for many other freedom of information measures that I feel are strongly needed.<lb/>
On the way here today, a rather striking analogy hit me. I was driving along behind a small Mini with a rather appealing sticker in the back which said, "When I grow up I am going to be a Rolls- Royce". I hope that this rather small Bill might one day grow up to be a veritable Rolls-Royce of a Bill which represents true freedom of information for people who need it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01734">2.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01735"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, for explaining the history of this measure. The Bill, as first presented by its sponsors in the other place, embraced a much wider range of records, including those held by central government, local authorities and the private sector. It also contained some very complex and detailed provisions on the procedures to be followed in granting access to records. At that stage, the Government made it very clear that they were not opposed to the basic principle behind the Bill as to the benefits for an individual in obtaining access to records of personal information held about himself.<lb/>
The Goverment themselves endorsed that principle in the Data Protection Act 1984 which gives an individual a statutory right to receive a copy of any computer record held on him. We saw it as natural that computer records should have the first priority because of the ease with which they can be manipulated or disclosed to third parties, and also because of the importance to our businessmen that we should implement the European Convention on Data Protection. The right of access to computer records
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0212"/>
<col>407</col>
under the Data Protection Act is due to come into force in November this year.<lb/>
When faced with the inital version of this Bill, we came, with some reluctance, to the conclusion that now would not be an appropriate time to extend the right of access to a wide range of manual records because of the large bureaucratic and financial burden it would place on record holders, particularly at a time when they were preparing to shoulder the burdens imposed by the Data Protection Act. For that reason, we suggested that the Bill might be limited to a small number of areas in which developments were already planned and progress might be made within a reasonable timescale. After lengthy discussion and negotiation with the sponsors of the Bill, all of which were held in a friendly and constructive atmosphere, we managed to emerge with the solution that is before the House today.<lb/>
The present Bill provides for a regulation-making power imposing obligations on local authorities to provide access to records in the two fields of housing and social work. In addition, the Government have promised to make progress with new regulations providing access to education records, using the existing powers under the Education Act. In all three fields of housing, social work and education, we have given a specific undertaking to use our best endeavours to make these regulations by the end of next year.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has raised the question of the undertaking given in respect of housing records in England and Wales. It was made clear in the debates in another place that the undertaking on these records was slightly different from the unconditional guarantee given in respect of the other records to which this Bill will apply. Given that consultations have to be undertaken with representatives of the local authorities concerned, and these must be genuine, the Department of the Environment did not feel able to give a categorical assurance that the regulations will be made.<lb/>
It has been made very clear, however, that difficulty would arise only if the department were convinced, at the end of the consultation process, that there was no practicable way of making the regulations. The department regards the possibility of reaching that situation as remote. This may not fully satisfy the noble Lord, but I hope that it will go some of the way to reassuring him. I would also tell the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, that following consultation it is not now proposed that social workers' provisional judgments should be exempt from access.<lb/>
The Bill now before us therefore constitutes a significant step forward in the granting of access to personal records. We recognise, of course, that it does not go as far as the sponsors and some other supporters of the Bill might have wished, but I think it represents an honourable compromise between the views of both sides and that the sponsors can claim an important achievement in having taken this first statutory step in the field of access to manual records. I am therefore very happy to say that the Government are able to commend the present Bill to the House and that we hope it will achieve a speedy passage through its remaining stages.</membercontribution></p>
<col>408</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01736">3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01737"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister and to the two noble Baronesses who have spoken in this debate. I should like to answer two points that were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull. The matter is not entirely in the hands of the sponsors of the Bill because this must be achieved by regulation. Clearly the Government and Secretary of State, in making the regulations, will take into account the needs of the professionals as well as the needs of those whose files are kept. That balance must be right and we must be sure that it does not always come down on the side of the professional. It is not always in the interests of professionals that they should have complete confidentiality because very often they receive the wrong information. The right of the individual to see what is being said about him or her must be balanced so that it can be corrected. Even though it may be something damaging, if it is correct then it is perfectly right and proper that it should remain on the file. At least people then know why judgments are being made in respect of them.<lb/>
I accept that in certain cases it may be difficult for people to accept that sort of judgment. However, the regulations must provide for periods of time where proper counselling can take place. I am sure that those in the social services with whom the noble Baroness associates are well skilled in that matter. I know that they are extremely busy people and do not want to take on additional burdens, but at the end of the day their clients will be the better for it. So far as age is concerned, the same point will apply: it will depend on the regulations which are laid down. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her general support for the principles of the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, is to be thanked for her support and for paving the way for this Bill in the speeches she has previously made in this House. I agree with her reservations that the exemptions must be restricted to the minimum possible. When regulations are laid before your Lordships' House I think that it is incumbent upon us all to challenge them if they are too extensive. We do not want to provide room for coaches and horses to be driven through the regulations.<lb/>
As regards charges, I was horrified, as was the noble Baroness, to see the figures of recent charges made by local authorities for access granted under earlier Acts. I liked the reference made by the noble Baroness to the possibility of having a Rolls-Royce of a Bill later on. I hope that when that time comes we can all be shareholders.<lb/>
I thank the Minister for his acceptance of the Bill. We are still worried about the housing record and, as was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, it seems odd that Scotland is a different case from England. I do not think that the Minister has explained the difference between the problems in Scotland and England. Nevertheless, the assurances have been repeated. We are assured that the chance of anything going wrong is remote. I think that what we have asked for, and what we have received, is a feeling that the Government are determined to make these regulations sensible and make them work. After all, that is what is behind the Bill. I believe that in passing this Bill today, as I hope we will, we shall take another small step
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0213"/>

down the road to the freedom of information and the freedom of individuals. It is on that basis that I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01748"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01749">What steps they are taking to control nitrogen oxide emissions from power stations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01750"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Lord Skelmersdale)</member><membercontribution>: The Government have authorised plans by the Central Electricity Generating Board to begin a major 10-year action programme to install low nitrogen oxide (NOx) burners at the Board's 12 largest power stations, at an estimated capital cost of &#x00A3;170 million.<lb/>
Low-NOx burners technology will also be a requirement for all future fossil-fuel fired power stations, and discussions are taking place with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution to determine appropriate standards. The CEGB estimates that these measures will lead to a reduction in CEGB NOx emissions of nearly 30 per cent. on 1980 levels by the end of the century, despite rising electricity demand. The programme will result in a steady flow of work for boiler manufacturers.<lb/>
I am particularly glad to be able to announce this programme during the European Year of the Environment. It is a worthy contribution and, along with the measures announced last September to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions, shows again our determination to tackle the international problem of air pollution.<lb/>
I expect today's announcement to be widely welcomed as a trend-setting example to other countries when delegates meet early next week in Geneva to resume negotiations for an international agreement on NOx controls, and at the EC Council of Ministers meeting later this month.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NORTH-EAST NEW TOWNS: FUTURE</title>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01751"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01752">Whether they will make a statement about the future of the North-East New Towns.</p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0214"/>
<col>411</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01753"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: On 22nd December 1986 my honourable friend the Minister for Housing, Urban Affairs and Construction undertook consultations under Section 41 of the New Towns Act 1981, inviting comments on the proposals of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment to wind up the new town development corporations of Aycliffe and Peterlee and of Washington on 31st March 1988; to dispose of their remaining assets to the private sector; to give English Estates the opportunity to purchase any unsold industrial assets; and to transfer any remaining assets and liabilities to the Commission for the New Towns.<lb/>
We have considered carefully the various responses received; we are most grateful to all those who let us have their comments. Having taken these into account, my right honourable friend confirms his intention to wind up the two development corporations on 31st March 1988. The necessary order will be made later this year.<lb/>
We are grateful to the development corporations for the steps they have so far taken in encouraging tenants to purchase their properties and in marketing their assets to the private sector, through, for example, the appointment of agents. We look forward to seeing the results of the marketing exercise. In assessing these, we shall want to take into account not only the size of the offers made but also the interests of the region.<lb/>
Where assets are not purchased by the private sector, we continue to take the view that English Estates should have the opportunity to acquire industrial properties and that otherwise the remaining assets and liabilities should be transferred to the Commission for the New Towns.</membercontribution></p>

<title>VIETNAMESE REFUGEES IN HONG KONG</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01754"><member>Lord Renton</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01755">What further steps they are proposing to alleviate the problems caused by the continuing flow of Vietnamese refugees to Hong Kong.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01756"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: This Government have an excellent record of participation in international efforts to relieve the problems caused by the outflow of Vietnamese to Hong Kong and elsewhere in South-East Asia.<lb/>
Between 1979 and 1981 we accepted for settlement here, following the initial surge of departures from Vietnam, nearly 20,000 Indo-Chinese refugees, of whom over 12,000 were Vietnamese from Hong Kong. Subsequently we continued to accept Vietnamese but applied the normal immigration rules governing family reunion. In 1985, however, following a recommendation by the Home Affairs Committee's Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration, we agreed to accept around 500 Vietnamese (50 of whom were not from Hong Kong) whose family relationship with those already here did not meet the normal criteria. Following that agreement, some 1,200 further offers of individual resettlement from Hong Kong were made by other countries.<lb/>
<col>412</col>
We have now considered what further steps might be taken against a background of the need on the one hand to maintain tight immigration controls and, on the other, to do everything possible to help Hong Kong. We have concluded that we should take a further number of Vietnamese from Hong Kong both as a contribution to reducing the population in the camps in Hong Kong and to give a signal to other resettlement countries of our continuing commitment to Hong Kong. We have therefore decided to accept for settlement here 468 named individuals who have been identified as close relatives of those already here. They will be resettled at a rate of about 20 a month spread over almost two years to ensure that our reception facilities are not overstretched.<lb/>
We believe that, as in the past, other countries are likely to follow suit and offer a substantial number of further resettlement places for Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong. We shall be making every effort to persuade them to do so. We do not, however, consider that resettlement alone is a sufficient answer to Hong Kong's refugee problem. Concerted international action aimed at a durable solution to the problem is required and, to this end, we shall be seeking to put to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the main resettlement countries the case for a common approach. In doing so we shall stress our own continuing commitment to Hong Kong, of which the resettlement commitment announced today is clear evidence.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REMAND PRISONERS: ACCOMMODATION</title>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01757"><member>Lord Hylton</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01758">How many cells were vacant in dispersal prisons in England at the latest count and whether any of these could be used to relieve the pressure of remand prisoners on police station cells.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01759"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: The total certified normal accommodation (CNA) of the dispersal prisons in England is 2,820 and their population on Friday 1st May was 2,704, an apparent number of vacancies of 116. Over half these places are not available because of refurbishment. The remainder provide the operational flexibility which is essential within this part of the prison system. There is therefore no scope for keeping remand prisoners in dispersal prisons. There would in any case be objections on both policy and practice grounds in mixing remand prisoners with the inmates of dispersal prisons.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Juries: Disclosure of Information</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01765"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01766">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01767">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they intend to propose amendment of Section 5 of the Juries Act 1974.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01768"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01769"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that singularly informative, if somewhat lengthy, reply. Does he recall that this section among other measures provides that the defence in a criminal case is entitled not only to the names but also to the home addresses of those called on the jury list? In certain cases, such as the recent Chelsea trial, is one not exposing jurymen to unnecessary risk and to considerable danger if one makes their addresses available to those in touch with the defence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01770"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I understand it, the home address is not given in every case. However, in highly populated areas such as London where a home address might be useful, it is a long-standing tradition that to do so is of help to the defence so that it can if necessary challenge for cause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01771"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that under Section 5 it is not only the accused man who can inspect the jury panel and who therefore has the names, occupations and addresses of the jury? It is also the case that his friends, relatives or associates acting on his behalf have the right to inspect the panel and so find the names, addresses and occupations of the jurors. Is it not desirable that this provision should be amended? It facilitates the vicious practice of jury nobbling when the accused's associates are able to find the addresses and occupations of the jurors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01772"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble and learned Lord will know far better than me, the list is a long and comprehensive one. We have no evidence to suppose that jury nobbling comes about as a result of inspecting the list. I can tell the House that between November 1982 and 1984, only 34 requests were made by the defence to inspect a jury panel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01773"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the occupation of the jurors is not listed as required by the Act?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01774"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord is absolutely right. I apologise for not
<col>416</col>
answering that part of the other noble and learned Lord's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01775"><member>Lord Wigoder</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that in many parts of the country the addresses are also never provided?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01776"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, indeed. I made that clear, I hope, in my first supplementary reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01777"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a certain type of case where the defendant is alleged to have committed a particularly violent crime, does the Minister agree that if the names and addresses are known not only in court but perhaps, through a photocopy, to friends outside, the lives of some people who have served on the jury may be put in danger?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01778"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure my noble friend agrees that it is right that there should be a challenge for cause in jury trials. If there is to be a challenge for cause&#x2014;a long-standing tradition in this country&#x2014;it seems imperative that the list is provided to enable the defence to base its claims for cause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01779"><member>Lord Hutchinson of Lullington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister confirm that in the case referred to by the noble Lord who asked this Question the list of jurymen was requested with this approval of the prosecution because local newspapers had published a great deal of information which might have led to interference with the fairness of the trial? The purpose of looking at the jury panel was to make quite sure that no one on the jury lived in the area where the newspapers were circulated. Does the Minister agree that that was a perfectly proper use of the right of the prosecution and the defence to see the panel list of potential jurors and their addresses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01780"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of the specific case in such detail as the noble Lord. I believe therefore that it would be wrong for me to comment on it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01781"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend explain why he told your Lordships that the addresses were not given in certain cases when the statute provides that they should be?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01782"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is found necessary for an address to be given in some of the more populous areas such as London in order to identify the juror so that a challenge for cause can be made if necessary. It is not necessary in more rural areas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01783"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be better if all the details necessary for the course of justice were handed to the judge who could then give them to those entitled to have them? This would secure the safety of everyone concerned and prevent the troubles that could be involved in the present provision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01784"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, whether one acts through the judge or makes the details available to the defence, the defence still knows about them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Metropolitan Police: Complaints Procedure</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01785">2.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01786"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the first Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01787">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01788">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will ensure that senior officers of the Metropolitan Police respond promptly and personally to inquiries from the Police Complaints Authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01789"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, arrangements for the day-to-day handling of complaints matters within the Metropolitan Police are a matter for the commissioner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01790"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not regrettable that, at a time when it is so important to build up confidence in the Metropolitan Police, the independent Police Complaints Authority has been driven to stating publicly that, unlike what happens in other forces, senior Metropolitan Police officers do not reply promptly to letters sent to them personally by members of the authority? When a reply eventually arrives it usually comes from someone else in the organisation. Will the Minister ask his right honourable friend to call for a report from the commissioner in. say, six months' time to show that this criticism has been taken to heart and to make sure that there has been a real improvement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01791"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I assure the noble Lord that the criticism has already been taken to heart because. as I understand it, the deputy commissioner has met the chairman of the authority twice since the publication of that report. Of course my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is available to help if he is called upon to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01792"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the Police Complaints Authority recommended in its report that it would be in the interests of the force's reputation with the public whom it serves to review its administrative procedures in this field? Has any such review been made by the relevant Metropolitan Police authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01793"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that that was one of the topics discussed at the meetings to which I have just referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01794"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that what my noble and learned friend has just said is in the interests primarily of the public, but to a great extent also in the interests of the Metropolitan Police itself? Does the Minister agree that any improvement to allay public fear would enhance the good name of the Metropolitan Police?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01795"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we can all look at some of our procedures and find them wanting. The Metropolitan Police is no different in that respect, but I am sure that it will do everything it can to meet the concerns of the authority.</membercontribution></p>
<col>418</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01796"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. does the Minister agree that to a large extent his office is responsible for the good name of the police? Was he therefore interested enough to find out the result of the meetings between the Metropolitan Police authorities and the chairman of the Police Complaints Authority? Was an agreed procedure for the future arrived at as a result of those two meetings?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01797"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the last question which the noble Lord asked is that I honestly do not know because that is a matter for the police. However, I shall see whether I can find out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01798"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Police Complaints Authority must have been extremely moved to have made this complaint in public in the way it did. I know just a little about relations between the Home Secretary and the Commissioner of Police. I wonder whether I may have an answer to the question I asked about the possibility of calling for a report in six months' time to see what has happened.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01799"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall pass on the concerns of the noble Lord to my right honourable friend.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Medical Accidents: No-Fault Schemes</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01800">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01801"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the second Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01802">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01803">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are prepared to facilitate the introduction of an experimental no-fault scheme for medical accidents.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01804"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have at present no plans to introduce an experimental no-fault scheme to compensate those people who suffer from medical accidents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01805"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am much obliged for that Answer, which is clearer than some we occasionally have from the Front Bench opposite. Is the Minister aware that medical negligence claims have been increasing in number, that insurance premiums have been rocketing upwards and that some valuable resources are already being diverted to defensive medicine in case there should be a subsequent claim for negligence? If the Government are not prepared to fall in with the proposal which emanates from the BMA for a pilot no-fault scheme, what are they proposing to do? We are on a slippery slope and if nothing is done and we go drifting on, will not things get steadily worse?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01806"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the noble Lord's question concerning insurance costs for the medical profession, in the past year average annual medical insurance costs have increased by 70 per cent. to &#x00A3;576. These subscriptions are still low compared with other professional groups in the United Kingdom. For example, one insurance company has
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0218"/>
<col>419</col>
quoted the percentage costs of gross income for architects as 5.15 per cent., solicitors 2.4 per cent., surveyors 7 to 10 per cent. and for doctors 0.5 to 3.5 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01807"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would have been nice to have had an answer to my Question. However, if I am unlucky on that, may I ask whether the Government, as the Pearson Royal Commission recommended in 1978, have been keeping a close eye on the way that no-fault medical injury schemes are operating in the countries where they are in force, notably New Zealand, Sweden and more recently in Finland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01808"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are well aware of developments in both Sweden and New Zealand. I am sure the noble Lord is aware that the New Zealand scheme is not considered entirely satisfactory and is now the subject of three reviews in New Zealand; the Royal Commission on Social Policy, the Law Commission, and the Ministerial Committee of Inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01809"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that medical accident cases in this country are getting entirely out of hand, not only because of the enormous damages being awarded but also the time and expense of the legal and medical professions in dealing with them? Even if there were a no-fault compensation scheme, is it not appropriate, as their Lordships in their initial report in 1980 suggested, that there should be an inquiry on the proper principles on which damages should be assessed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01810"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his question. I entirely agree with him about rising costs. The <i>Observer</i> newspaper has suggested costs in this country of &#x00A3;46.5 million per annum if we introduce the Swedish scheme compared with total health authority payments last year of around &#x00A3;7.4 million.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01811"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in the United States of America legal awards are now astronomically high, literally running into tens of millions of pounds? I am told that the measure of insurance which a surgeon has to take out amounts to around a third of his fees, with the result that fees rise higher and higher and everybody suffers. Will my noble friend direct the attention of his right honourable friend the Secretary of State to the danger we are in and the need to find the means to check this, and ask him to consider very seriously the suggestions that have been made this afternoon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01812"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Nugent for again drawing our attention to the fact that in the United States in some cases on a percentage basis the costs are 10 times as high as they are in the United Kingdom. I shall certainly draw his remarks to the attention of the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01813"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord accept that there is great concern in the country about the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Allen? Although
<col>420</col>
there may not be the same kind of impetus for the solutions that he has suggested, there is certainly a great deal of concern. Perhaps I may suggest two areas in which the Minister might act in advance of the remedies suggested. There are other people&#x2014;the victims&#x2014;to be considered. At the moment it is very difficult for a victim of an accident in a hospital to obtain the notes on his case without the issue of a writ. This could be looked at in order to make it slightly easier for victims.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01814"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01815"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister accept that it is also very difficult for patients who are ill, who have lost their jobs and who are dependent on legal aid to conduct cases of negligence? Will he look into those aspects of the matter and try to persuade doctors that their job does not finish when the patient has the accident; that they ought to be prepared to co-operate with organisations such as Action for the Victims of Medical Accidents in order to assist patients?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01816"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note the suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Stallard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01817"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the awards in such cases in this country are made by judges and not by juries, and that the principles on which the judges act in medical matters are by now very well known indeed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01818"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord for bringing that matter to the attention of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01819"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that those who advise my noble friend and his right honourable friend on these matters will have a comparatively restful three weeks in the near future? Can they not look more closely at the merits of this case in answer to what must be admitted is one of the more clearly expressed Questions to come from the other side?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01820"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not had a chance to see the tape yet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01821"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I do not wish to pursue this matter now but perhaps I may tell the Minister that the difficulties are very well known. Will he not convey to his right honourable friend the need to do something? We have a perfectly good no-fault system for industrial injuries. Is it not possible to consider introducing some solution in this very important and difficult field?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01825"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships debated these matters on 17th December last year. The security service operates under a directive issued by the then Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, in 1952. The directive makes the Director-General personally responsible to the Home Secretary, and through him to the Prime Minister. Those principles have applied to all previous governments since 1952.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01826"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that reply. Is he not aware that during the past week or so there have been disturbing reports of efforts by the security service to discredit Mr. Edward Heath?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01827"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that it would be wrong for me to add anything to the Statement made by noble friend the Leader of the House last week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01828"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that the whole thing is becoming a farce? Would he care to tell me why the Government have taken out writs for contempt of court against three centre-view newspapers, the <i>Observer</i>, the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>Independent</i>, while Independent Television News gave a verbatim account from Mr. Wright's book on 27th April but is not being prosecuted? Counsel for the Attorney-General said that they could not possibly prosecute 30 or 40 institutions or people so they had to pick three. Is it justice to let some off and prosecute others?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01829"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord refers to proceedings that my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General has instituted. Those proceedings are <i>sub judice</i> and though the noble Lord can comment on them, I cannot.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01830"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl recollect that in the debate on security matters and the overseeing of them the suggestion was made that the Security Commission, possibly strengthened by the appointment of a judge at first instance, might indeed take on the supervision of the security service and in its wisdom report to Parliament? Has that suggestion been looked into and, if not, will it be?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01831"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that, following the debate last year, I discussed the debate and the point which he has just raised with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01832"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: With what result, my Lords?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01833"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honourable friend was very interested and sought to consider the matter further.</membercontribution></p>
<col>422</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01834"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that, if we had some kind of independent body which was instructed to bear in mind how valuable the security service is and that it should not be endangered, but which could nevertheless examine its structure, management and staff counselling, this would be in the interests of the security service itself? It might possibly avert some of the appalling stories that the British public have been reading over the past few weeks. It is no good the Minister telling me that he is quite satisfied that there is nothing to be alarmed about; he must tell us what kind of examination took place that made the Government confident that there is nothing to worry about.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01835"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have already said to the noble Lord, I shall not comment further on matters that were discussed when my noble friend the Leader of the House made a Statement last week. I remind the noble Lord of two points because I cannot remember whether he took part in the debate last year. If we elaborate the handling of security matters, two obvious dangers may arise. The first is that by unduly widening the information generally available we prejudice the secrecy necessary for effective security service operations; secondly, by creating a new structure we blur the responsibility and detract from essential accountability to Parliament as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01836"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the circumstances which led to the Leader of the House repeating the Answer to a Private Notice Question in the other place have shown that matters have developed and that public opinion is very disturbed indeed about the condition of the security service? Is it not the case that all of us want to see the security service well-maintained and kept in a high state of morale, which is far from being the case at the moment? Will the Minister therefore reconsider whether his somewhat dismissive answer is appropriate in today's circumstances?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01837"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the director-general reported to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. She was convinced by what the director-general said and accepted that advice. The leader of the noble Lord's party, Dr. David Owen, accepted the director-general's advice in these circumstances. Surely the best thing that we can do is not to aggravate these rumours but to let the security service get on with doing the job that it does so very well and for which we are grateful.</membercontribution></p>

<col>424</col>
of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Bill, has consented to place her prerogative and interest so far as they are affected by the Bill at the disposal of Parliament for the purposes of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01850"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord Glenarthur)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a third time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01851">Moved, That the Bill be now read a third time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Glenarthur)</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01852">On Question, Bill read a third time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01853">Clause 1 <i>[Abolition of Domestic Rates]:</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01854"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 1, line 7, after ("1989") insert ("or such other year as the Secretary of State may determine").</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, it was not with surprise that we heard the announcement from the noble Lord the Chief Whip today, but it was with some disappointment, certainly to Scots, when he further announced that today's business would go on unchanged. It probably shows the importance that the Government place on this measure and the low regard that I have for it. But here we are, almost on the last lap, and I beg to move the first amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01855">The first amendment deals with the date from which domestic rates will be abolished. It is laid down in the Bill at the moment that it will be 1989. It was not always 1989, it started out as late as 1990. There was at one time a transitional period of three years. The Government changed their mind in another place and at Report stage they wiped out the transitional period.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01856">My suggestion is in Clause 1:
<quote>"Page 1, line 7, after ("1989") insert ("or such other year as the Secretary of State may determine")".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01857">This cannot be called a wrecking amendment because it is entirely within the power of the Secretary of State to change that by maybe a year, maybe two years, or maybe three years. The reason why I so move is to be fair to the Secretary of State. I do not know who the Secretary of State is going to be in a short time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01858"><member>A noble Lord</member><membercontribution>: You&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01859"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Well, my Lords, all sorts of things can happen, but that is most unlikely. However, there may be a change of Government; there may not be a change of Government. If there is a change of Government there will be a change of Secretary of State. Very difficult things can happen.<lb/>
An important event is going to take place in Scotland next Saturday at the meeting of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Lord High Commissioner usually invites on the first night certain people, including the Secretary of State. I remember on one occasion when we were in a difficult position as to who would be the Secretary of State. Would it be Mr. Bruce Milian or the shadow Secretary of State, Mr. Teddy Taylor? We decided we would invite them both. Then we discovered that we were wrong because Mr. Teddy Taylor was defeated in the election and suddenly there appeared on the scene a Mr. George Younger.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0221"/>
<col>425</col>
It is the same with this Bill. Is it fair to tie a Secretary of State to this particular date, and then he discovers that, for the best reasons, it is not desirable to introduce this abolition on 1st April 1989? We who have been following this Bill, all know the administrative difficulties that there will be. It may well be that the authorities will not be ready for it on 1st April 1989. You are not dealing with property, you are dealing with people. People move about, and it may be difficult to get a complete register and to make all the calculations that have to be made in respect of the poll tax when it is introduced. It is supposed to start from that particular date, and it might be impossible.<lb/>
Therefore, my suggestion is that we give to the Secretary of State, whoever he is, the opportunity of changing that date and having a more practical date. A lot could be said about it, but I think it is a desirable amendment. It does not wreck the Bill or change the powers that the Government seem to wish to put in the hands of the Secretary of State. It gives him that flexibility that might be desirable in the event of what might take place fairly soon. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01860"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not expect my noble friend to accept this amendment. It would introduce a large element of uncertainty to a matter in respect of which we should be giving the clearest indication of the intentions of Parliament. In order to prepare for the end of the present system and the introduction of a new one, people will have a good deal to do. They should know precisely the moment when their arrangements must reach a climax; in other words, when the Bill is to come into force and the changes made.<lb/>
The only argument put forward by the noble Lord in favour of his amendment&#x2014;it is a twofold argument&#x2014;is first, that the present Government may be returned but that there may be another Secretary of State. I presume that this was a government decision and that if there were another Secretary of State&#x2014;and I am not hoping for that&#x2014;it would be most improbable that he could get away with postponement of the Bill. I am sure that he would not try to do so. If he were appointed on the understanding that he could introduce a postponement, I should have thought that his appointment would be very much in doubt. Therefore I suggest that that part of the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, has fallen.<lb/>
I should be entering too much into the arena of political controversy if I dealt with the other argument; namely, that there might be a change of government. We must all make a certain confident assumption that what is proposed in the Bill is likely to take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01861"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has fallen short of his normal logic. This amendment is the most helpful to the Government that the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, has ever proposed. There is no shadow of doubt that this is an appalling Bill. Even the Prime Minister has taken to calling it a "poll tax". That must on her part represent a certain retreat from the glorious community charge which we have been assured is a splendid thing; which the people of Scotland are
<col>426</col>
awaiting with bated breath, especially in Perth on Friday.<lb/>
The fact that the majority of people in Scotland are totally against this Bill, as is everyone with experience of local government in Scotland, makes this an extraordinarily sensible amendment to be included. After all, the Government are confident. They know their own minds. In their view, this is a marvellous Bill. What harm could possibly be done by allowing the Secretary of State, that monument of wisdom in all cases, to delay the measure? Certainly the register will provide appalling difficulties, and many other questions will arise. This is a most sensible amendment. It is quite extraordinary that, even in what we in Scotland call the "mou" of an election, the Minister will not consider accepting it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01862"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the amendment may be intended to be helpful to the Government. But in this respect surely the Government need no help at all. As a matter of policy, it is decided that with effect from 1st April 1989&#x2014;there it is, as clear as a bell&#x2014;domestic rates should be abolished. What on earth is the object, when one's government have decided on policy, of introducing a form of spurious uncertainty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01863">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01864"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is an extraordinary lack of logic in this amendment, which is most unusual for the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock. He argues that if there were to be a change of government, that new government would wish to defer the operation of the Bill. We have been told day after day that the Bill, in the view of the noble Lord, is utterly wrong. One must assume that if there were to be a government of his party, they would hastily introduce legislation, not deferring the Bill but cancelling it altogether and replacing it with something else.<lb/>
I should like to think of the reaction of the Scottish voter to the idea of continuing the enormous increase in rates which is occurring in Scotland at the moment. But that would be straying from the immediate issue. It is utterly illogical, if one is against the Bill root and branch as the noble Lord has made clear, to suggest that under a changed government all that needs to be done is to defer it for a year or so. There is no logic in that.<lb/>
On the other hand, my noble friend Lord Renton is absolutely right. If officials are working to a timetable, they generally deliver the goods according to the timetable. However, if they are given the slightest reason to believe that they can gain more time by pointing out to their masters that an issue is difficult and complicated, and that the result would be better if they waited, then they will take more time. There is a Parkinson's law in that all such operations take as much time as officials can obtain. I hope that, with his usual courtesy and brevity, my noble friend will say no to the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01865"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not speculate as to whether there will be a change of government or a change of Secretary of State. The noble Lord, Lord Ross, and noble Lords on these
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0222"/>
<col>427</col>
Benches have given a fair indication of how they would behave if power were in their hands.<lb/>
I believe that the proposal in the amendment has some merit. Since we have been discussing the Bill in this House a number of organisations have carried out detailed research on how it will be applied and on the complications that will arise in attempting to administer its provisions. I have before me <i>Paying for Local Government, The Community Charge.</i> It is a report to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Consumer Council. It is not their report; they are opposed to the Bill. It is an independent assessment of the complications of applying the provisions of the Bill. It will not be easy. There will be difficulty over collection. Those who commissioned the report found that the collection of debt, the maintenance of a register, and the mobility of young people will make it extremely difficult to administer a poll tax of this kind. Consequently, it might be to the advantage of the Secretary of State, whoever he may be and whatever party he may represent, to have this escape provision.<lb/>
I should like to say to noble Lords who have spoken in this regard that not only is CoSLA concerned but so are the professionals, the people being asked to adminster the Bill. Local authority officials, who are quite independent and objective, point out that they are extremely nervous about the operation of the Bill and their ability to set it up. Under these circumstances, I believe that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, should commend itself to the Minister because it provides an escape clause. Otherwise, we shall face immense difficulties in putting the Bill in to operation within the timetable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01866"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I recall that when your Lordships considered a similar proposition at Report stage, the House took a clear decision that it did not wish to see the Bill amended in the way suggested. To that extent I am a little surprised to see the amendment tabled. I must tell your Lordships quite firmly that in the period since the matter was last debated, the Government have not changed their minds. We remain firmly of the view that there is no need to give the Secretary of State the power to change the year of abolition of domestic rates from that which is already specifically provided for in the Bill. We also consider that there would be real disadvantage in accepting the measure of flexibility over the timing, which the noble Lords, Lord Ross and Lord Mackie, are offering to the Government with so much apparent enthusiasm.<lb/>
Let me deal first with this latter point&#x2014;the practical disadvantages of the approach implied by these amendments. There would be no disagreement that the reforms embodied in the Bill are radical. Nor would there be any dispute that the reforms will have a significant effect on local authorities, who will be responsible for administering the new system, and also on the adult community in Scotland who will become liable to pay the new community charge. Nor is it possible to deny the need for both local authorities and individuals to plan ahead for the introduction of the new system.<lb/>
But against that background it seems to me entirely sensible that the Bill should provide for a specific and definite starting date for bringing the new system into
<col>428</col>
operation. Otherwise there would be real risk of confusion and uncertainty. If these amendments were made, Parliament would in effect be saying "The abolition of domestic rates in Scotland, and the introduction of the community charge, will take place on 1st April 1989 or on 1st April in whatever year the Secretary of State so decides"&#x2014;and that could be one, two, three or indeed however many years later the Secretary of State thought fit. I cannot believe that that is a sensible basis on which to proceed. It seems to me of the utmost importance for all concerned that it should be made absolutely clear on the face of the Bill when the new system will come into operation. Otherwise, planning is at risk of being thrown completely into disarray, as my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter said. Like my noble friend Lord Renton, I am firmly of the view that the best course is to set a realistic target date, and then commit ourselves to it so that everyone knows where they are.<lb/>
This brings me to my second argument against the amendments, which is that they are unnecessary. In the Government's view, the date of 1st April 1989 for the abolition of domestic rates in Scotland and the introduction of the community charges is quite realistic. There is simply no need for the element of flexibility which the amendments seek to introduce. We have never tried to conceal the fact that the timetable envisaged in the Bill as it stands will require a considerable effort on the part of all concerned between now and 1989.<lb/>
But I must emphasise to your Lordships that at no point has it been suggested that the timetable simply cannot be met. I recall that at Report stage it was the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, who affirmed on 28th April that CoSLA would be able to achieve what was required of them. He said at col. 1383 of the <i>Official Report:</i>
<quote>"Of course, CoSLA will be able to achieve this. Local government officials are much maligned, but I have found them to be very efficient and hard working people. They will do almost anything that is given to them".</quote>
I am happy to put on the record the fact that I entirely share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, as to the high calibre of officials in local authorities. Given continued co-operation and a common desire to see the new system work, there is no reason to suppose that the target date of 1st April 1989 is in any way unrealistic or impracticable.<lb/>
We have now debated the timetable envisaged in the Bill on a number of occasions. I acknowledge that the matter is one of considerable importance and of great principle for the noble Lords, Lord Ross of Marnock and Lord Mackie of Benshie, but I maintain that these amendments are both undesirable and unnecessary. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that explanation and will feel able to withdraw his amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01867"><member>Lord Galpern</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise only because of the remark made by the noble Lord as to what the decision was when the amendment was discussed at Report stage. Since then we have had the declaration of a general election and four very valuable weeks will have to be set aside from considering all the implications&#x2014;and there are many of them&#x2014;regarding this Bill which the general election will create, because all the activities will now be directed towards running the election. Has the noble Lord given any thought to
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0223"/>
<col>429</col>
that delay of at least a month in respect of the work that has to be done?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01868"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, arising out of the Minister's reply to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, can he inform the House whether in view of, as I understand it, the continuing flow of information, reports and suggestions about the administrative difficulties in bringing the provisions of this Bill into operation, the Government have kept the situation under continuing review during the progress of the Bill, having regard to the very serious reservations which have been expressed not only from this side of the House but from many independent sources?<lb/>
For example, in the report to CoSLA&#x2014;a report which came from a research group in Aberdeen University&#x2014;it is stated at page 4:
<quote>"Secondly, there is serious concern among officials about the time available to set up the relevant administrative systems by the start date of 1st April 1989."</quote>
They go on to say that of course officials will attempt to comply with their duties,
<quote>"but the resultant system may be seriously defective. There is particular concern about the compilation of an accurate register, the basis of establishing liability to make a payment."</quote>
I appreciate all that the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, has said about the logic of the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, in this situation. I am myself a little surprised that he should wish to give any assistance at all to a government responsible for this appalling Bill. But there it is. We are a revising Chamber and what I am asking the Minister, in view of the way in which he dealt with the matter, is: have the Government given serious and necessarily profound consideration since the start of the Bill to all these suggestions that the administrative difficulties may be overwhelming? If they have not done so, have they simply, having decided that this will be the target date, set themselves stubbornly to resist a careful reflection on the whole situation, which is perhaps more serious than they came to appreciate?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01869"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, perhaps I may simply say to the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, that of course I recognise that since the amendment was tabled there has been the announcement of a general election; but that does not mean for one minute that it will be impossible to hold the kinds of consultations which are necessary to bring everything into effect under the timetable set out in the Bill: they will not be prevented from going ahead. Officials continue and the work of government continues up to the point of the general election. I regret that it has not been possible so far for CoSLA and others to carry on or resume the kinds of consultations with the department on matters affecting the implementation of the Bill which we should have liked them to do. I had rather hoped that CoSLA would decide to come forward and discuss this matter. I was disappointed by the reports that they are not prepared to do so. However, I remain entirely confident&#x2014;and I think this answers the point put by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, as well&#x2014;that once the Bill has been enacted, CoSLA and all the other bodies which will need to play a part to ensure that the timetable can be met will come to
<col>430</col>
realise (as we certainly do) the importance of consultation between the department and the local authority interests over the whole realm of implementation.<lb/>
So I really do not believe that the concerns which have been set out by the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, are valid. I very much hope that we can start talking to all those concerned who have got to implement the measures contained in the Bill over the timetable as set out, and that should be as soon and as fully as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01870">3.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01871"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am interested to hear of the confidence of the Minister of State. He will remember that there was to be a transition period of three years because, it was said, this proposal could not possibly be implemented overnight and it had to be worked in gently.<lb/>
The Minister in another place, Mr. Ancram, said at Committee stage:
<quote>"We chose these dates which are challenged by the amendment"&#x2014;</quote>
believe it or not, that is the amendment that is now in the Bill
<quote>"because we believe that this is the earliest time at which we can get a workable system off the ground. As a responsible party in a responsible government we believe that we should not introduce legislation on a timescale that would not allow us to have the proper mechanisms in place".</quote>
I am concerned, and I do not want to see a practical system of collecting rates that is cost-effective (to quote the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy) replaced by one that the Government themselves in the 1983 White Paper warned was untried, costly and unfair. I am concerned about the practicability of carrying through this measure. It is a matter of common sense to put in the proposal in this amendment which will allow the Secretary of State to have more time if he sees that things are going wrong.<lb/>
There will be trouble with this Bill. Its suddenness will create much turbulence. The unemployed, young people and old people who at the moment pay no rates will now be liable and a couple may suddenly discover that they are liable to pay out &#x00A3;600. The Government think that there will not be any turbulence and that all will be well. However, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Galpern, is a good one: who will be the person responsible for the register? According to the Bill, it will be the electoral registration officer. The local authorities will have to meet and appoint assistants to this person. Right now his office will have dropped everything and be doing registration work in respect of the general election. The registration officer also has to deal with valuation for non-domestic rates as well.<lb/>
There are 78 items in this Bill which are unclear. For instance, what is domestic property or what are sole and main residences? These are questions that must be decided by the courts. Regulations will have to be drawn up by the Scottish Office in respect of any number of matters. They occur on page after page.<lb/>
The Government were not confident in December but today suddenly they are confident that this

<col>431</col>
measure will be on the statute book by Monday&#x2014;probably by the end of this week. That is one thing of which I am perfectly sure. In a letter regarding rebates, the Prime Minister wrote that she could not tell us anything more than we know now about the rebate system and who will or will not be included. There are very many matters to be settled. It is surely common sense and wisdom to approve this simple amendment which gives power to the Secretary of State (of whichever party) to take an extra year if he considers that things are going wrong.<lb/>
I am sorry that the Government see the matter in the way that they do. I think we should test the feeling of the House as to whether this power should be given to the Secretary of State to draw back from chaos and take more time in respect of administration.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01875">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01876">3.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01877">[<i>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01878">Clause 3 [<i>Non-domestic rates]:</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01879"><member>Lord Gray</member> moved Amendment No. 4:
<quote>Page 2, line 17, leave out ("determine") and insert (", in respect of the financial year 1989&#x2013;90 and each subsequent financial year, determine, before such date as may be prescribed in relation to each of those years,").</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 4 standing in my name, and with the leave of the House I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 5. The two are directly linked and they interact.</p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0225"/>
<col>433</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01880">At Report stage I queried the drafting of subsection (1) of Clause 3. I suggested that the wording was open to misinterpretation&#x2014;the misinterpretation that a rate determined for 1989&#x2013;90 was to be the rate levied not only in that financial year but also in subsequent years. That was patently not the intention. My noble friend Lord Glenarthur said in reply that he doubted that such misinterpretation lay in the words. While I accept that the position is made clear later in Clause 3, I think it is worth removing the slight dubiety in the trigger clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01881">More importantly, the two amendments taken together will deal with an omission which further study of subsection (1), prompted by my inquiry, has disclosed. As now drafted, the subsection makes no provision for the Secretary of State to prescribe a date by which the non-domestic rate is to be determined in each year. Under the present rating system such provision is made in Section 108 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, but that section will be repealed by Schedule 6 of the Bill which we are considering.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01882">The setting of a non-domestic rate each year must precede the determination of the community charge. Therefore it is surely desirable that we should make specific provision for the Secretary of State to set a timetable. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, taken together, will do just that. While I regret that as a consequence of these amendments subsection (1) will become more wordy and unwieldy, which is not something that normally appeals to me, I commend the proposed change to the House. I beg to move Amendment No. 4.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01883"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very happy to accept these amendments in the name of my noble friend. They make useful improvements to subsection (1) of Clause 3.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01884">On Question, amendment agreed to. Lord Gray moved Amendment No. 5:
<quote>Page 2, line 17, leave out (", in respect of the financial year 1989&#x2013;90 and each subsequent financial year,").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01885">On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01886"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 6:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01887">Page 6, line 39, leave out ("Community charges, to be known respectively as") and insert ("poll taxes, hereinafter called respectively").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01888">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I want to get a little element of truth into the Bill. When this was first mooted it was called a poll tax. Then the Government decided that that was not good enough, that we should have some more mellifluous term, one that seemed more respectable and new; so they decided to call it a community charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01889">The words "poll tax" appeared in government White Papers, various of which have been produced, particularly those in 1981 and 1983. That was when the Government were dismissing the tax as unfair and costly. There were many terms of abuse hurled at the words "poll tax" when the Government were turning it down. They said that the rating system was sound basically and that all it needed was a little change here and there.</p>
<col>434</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01890">Ministers told us that from the Dispatch Box, and Back-Benchers told us that, but then they suddenly decided&#x2014;not over a problem of rates but over a problem of valuation, after the revaluation in Scotland which took effect from 1985&#x2014;that something had to be done. As the then Secretary of State said at the time, "Something has to be done. We don't know what, but to do nothing is to court political disaster in Scotland". We never had a White Paper on the subject&#x2014;only a Green Paper&#x2014;and hurriedly they decided to legislate. But this was not to be called a poll tax; it was to be called a community charge, which sounds nice and respectable. They then discovered that there had to be three community charges&#x2014;a personal one, a standard one and a collective one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01891">The noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, has insisted with a straight face that it could not be called a poll tax. He said that it is a community charge. Then just last Wednesday, in answering a question in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister referred to the poll tax. If she wants it to be called a poll tax, who are we to argue with her and who are noble Lords on the other side to argue with her? They would not do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01892">I have taken it upon myself to say that that moment of candid truth from the Prime Minister should be enshrined in legislation. Why wrap it up in decorative paper, calling it a community charge and all the rest of it? Let us call it what everybody knows it is&#x2014;a poll tax. For legislative purposes, if the Government want to have their kindly words, we shall leave them in there, too. However, it is a poll tax and it is the purpose of the amendment to call it that. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01893"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, again we return to a fairly familiar theme. The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, has made clear that his fundamental objection to the community charge is that it is a flat-rate tax to be imposed on all adult residents in a local authority area. As I said in Committee, I am happy to accept that as a matter of terminology the community charge is a poll tax in that sense, and indeed to defend its fairness as such. So my right honourable frriend the Prime Minister was quite right in that.<lb/>
The reason we prefer the term community charge to poll tax was well demonstrated at Committee stage when the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, argued that the community charge is a poll tax in the sense that it is a tax on the right to vote, and that it will discourage people from registering themselves on the electoral roll. We do not accept that contention. The term "poll tax" is therefore plainly ambiguous and its use would only cause confusion in the minds of the public where there should be none.<lb/>
Even if it is true that the community charge is a poll tax in the sense of being a flat-rate charge, then it is true only in a qualified sense. It is of course simply not the case that all adults are to be required to pay the full charge irrespective of their circumstances. There will be rebates for those who because of their low incomes would have difficulty in meeting their full community charge liability. Your Lordships have also agreed that students should be liable for only 20 per cent. of the community charge. It is not true that the community charge is to be imposed rigidly and without exception.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0226"/>
<col>435</col>
However, the fact that the community charge is basically a flat-rate tax is not in dispute, and it is highly unlikely that despite the extensive media exposure given to the Government's proposals the people of Scotland would somehow remain in a state of ignorance of that essential fact. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, at an earlier stage expressed the fear in debating this matter that we had reached the stage where, there being no agreement between this side of the House and another, we were simply exchanging unsupported assertions. There are good reasons for using the term community charge; but I fully agree with the view that this question of terminology is not one of the most crucial issues, although I recognise that it has a certain significance for the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, as indeed it obviously has for the Alliance as well.<lb/>
We have thought this matter through carefully. That is why, to avoid the ambiguity that would occur if we were to use the term which the noble Lord suggests, it would be much better to stick with the term community charge. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01894"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not agree that his real objection to the term poll tax is that it would be very unpopular at the polls?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01895"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, agree that this could perhaps be a bit of a tease? If "poll tax" is substituted for "community charge", we shall have:
<quote>"three poll taxes, hereinafter called respectively personal community charge, the standard community charge and the collective community charge."</quote>
Then in Clause 26 there appears,
<quote>" 'community charge' means a community charge imposed under section 7 of this Act".</quote>
Is the noble Lord's amendment really constructive or necessary in any ordinary drafting sense?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01896"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is desirable from the point of view of truth and just to keep the Government right at it. I have with me their rates paper by the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office, as well as the Scottish one. In paragraph 2.9 they do not even mention the community charge. It reads:
<quote>"A poll tax is a flat rate levy on all individuals liable to pay &#x2026; the tax would be hard to enforce. If the electoral register were used as the basis for liability it could be seen as a tax on the right to vote."</quote>
It would not be seen as a tax on the right to vote, but it would have an effect. The White Paper goes on:
<quote>"A new register would therefore probably be needed. But this would make the tax expensive to run and complicated, particularly if it incorporated a rebate scheme."</quote>
There the Government&#x2014;not the wicked Opposition&#x2014;are condemning it and then referring thereafter to a kind of rebate scheme. There would have to be one.<lb/>
It goes on:
<quote>"Without a rebate scheme a poll tax would bear harshly on people with low incomes."</quote>
Of course it will bear harshly on people with low incomes now that the rebates are limited to 80 per cent. and the poorest of the poor have to pay 20 per
<col>436</col>
cent. of this poll tax. When you have no money at all 20 per cent. is a lot. It probably amounts to &#x00A3;60 or, in the case of an old-age pensioner couple, &#x00A3;120. There are many old-age pensioner couples who tend to live in the older houses among the poor. They will not be able to get a full rebate and will be paying &#x00A3;10 a month. The Government were right at that stage when they said that the rating system was basically sound and,
<quote>"The Government agree &#x2026; that this option should be rejected."</quote>
That was the conclusion to which they came in August 1983. If it is a poll tax, then it is a poll tax. It is a poll tax and let us call it what it is.<lb/>
Of course it will be unpopular. I noticed a letter in, I think, the <i>Independent</i> today referring to a poll tax in Scotland in the year 1690, to pay the wages of the forces that had not been kept up-to-date. But even with that poll tax there was a graduated element and it was reduced for the poor. There was another poll tax in Scotland in the year 1300 and its unpopularity was such that it had to be withdrawn. The same thing applied in England and it led to revolution. It is a poll tax. Everyone pays the same and the liability is the same for everyone.<lb/>
We do not yet know what kind of rebate there will be. That is something else that has to be worked out. I hope it will be worked out before 1988 when the new income support comes into operation over the whole country. That will then be changed again in 1989 in respect of Scotland. But a poll tax it will be, and unpopular it will be.<lb/>
It will be popular with the people whom the Prime Minister is to address in Perth. But those are not the ordinary people in Scotland. The Government's standing in Scotland is not 48 or 49 per cent.; it is about 20 per cent. It was suggested by one MP that the Government will have four MPs in Scotland out of 72, instead of the 22 that they have. Poll tax it is and poll tax it should be, there. I shall not insist on the amendment. I am just hoping to irk a few consciences. That is what the people proposing this measure in Scotland are voting for. It does not apply to England and probably never will because of the dangers and difficulties that would arise if it was tried out on urban populations. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01897">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01898">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01899">Clause 8 [<i>Liability for personal community charge</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01900"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 7:
<quote>Page 8, line 6, leave out from ("from") to ("severe") in line 7.</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment as printed on the Marshalled List contains the word "seven" in line 7. The amendment should read: "severe" in line 7. It is a printer's error.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01901">The Government have come some way towards meeting many suggestions made in the House at earlier stages of the Bill. This was particularly so during the second day on Report as regards the importance of people with a severe mental handicap being given consideration under the Bill. However, the feeling is that the Government did not go quite far enough. It appears from a strict reading of the wording of the amendment that its provisions could apply only
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0227"/>
<col>437</col>
to the congenitally mentally handicapped. The Minister will see that the actual wording of the amendment on Report was:
<quote>" 'persons who are severely mentally handicapped' has the following meaning, that is to say, persons suffering from a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes severe impairment of intelligence".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01902">The implication is that the handicap must be one that the sufferer is born with and that there should be no&#x2014;or very slight&#x2014;possibility of an improvement. Any improvement should not be sufficient to allow the person to develop intelligence to a large extent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01903">Many noble Lords on all sides of the House argued that the definition was rather tight. The Minister may be able to say that there is no ambiguity implied in the words:
<quote>"a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01904">But that does not include the possibility of physical accident which could lead to the same result as a congenital mental handicap. There is also the possibility of a chemical accident which could have the same result. I am thinking in terms of the inhalation of gas. It is quite common for someone working with town gas, or nowadays North Sea gas, to find that, as a result of a restriction in the flow of oxygen to the brain, he is left with a permanent impairment. That could also happen as the result of an accident while under anaesthetic. It is not beyond possibility; it has happened before. By omitting words from the amendment we wish to make it much clearer that the condition of severe mental impairment is what is important and not how that condition arose.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01905">The Minister has a power to prescribe in regulations the definition of mental impairment. However, I have been advised that if the words that I and my noble friend Lord Morton of Shuna wish to be left out were included on the face of the Bill, they could restrict the Minister's freedom in that prescribing. I should like an explanation of that from the Minister. We are trying to be helpful. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01906"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we all share with the noble Lord a desire to ensure that the mentally handicapped are given the more favourable treatment included in the Bill on Report as a result of the Government amendment. However, looking at the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, I wonder whether he has appreciated that it would narrow the group of people who could be helped under the terms of the Bill. The group of people is stated in general terms as those with:
<quote>"a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind".</quote>
The amendment goes on to give an example. It states:
<quote>"which includes severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning".</quote>
If the noble Lord's amendment were accepted, we would be left only with the example of the more difficult cases and we would not cover those cases which fell short of "severe impairment".<lb/>
I have had a great deal of experience of working in MENCAP. I find some difficulty with the noble Lord's amendment. I hope that I have not misconceived the position, but I fear that he may have done so.<lb/>
I know that the matter of definitions is not easy because the last mental health Act changed what the
<col>438</col>
earlier one of 1959 stated. One can never be absolutely certain, without reference to all of them, that one has the definitions right. However, my understanding is that if the amendment were accepted, fewer people would benefit from the Government's amendments moved on Report, and that would be a pity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01907"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having taken up this point in Committee on behalf of what I called the mentally handicapped&#x2014;unlike my noble friend Lord Renton, I do not have expertise or knowledge in these matters&#x2014;I was merely contending for what appeared to be a broad, fair principle on behalf of people who could not be said to be within a principle of accountability in the Bill. However, realising that there might be problems about definition (because there always are) I kept it simple and wide.<lb/>
I may be wrong but I think, with respect, that my noble friend Lord Renton is entirely right. The Government have taken the widest possible definition in the clause as it stands. Although it was not the intention of the movers of the amendment to narrow that definition, it could have that effect. I support what my noble friend Lord Renton has said about that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01908"><member>Lord Henderson of Brompton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall speak briefly on this matter. During the earlier stages of the Bill, I was concerned with the special provisions for the mentally handicapped and also for the physically handicapped, both in this clause and in Clause 24.<lb/>
I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, for not having been present when he started to move the amendment. I sympathise however with some of the remarks that he made towards the end of his speech. What we have heard so far indicates how very difficult it is to draw the correct definition which in effect exempts those who are so mentally handicapped that they are unaccountable in so far as they cannot understand the processes of local government.<lb/>
I deplore&#x2014;though applauding the Government's intention to help both the mentally and the physically handicapped&#x2014;the differentiation drawn in the Bill between the mentally and the physically handicapped. I consider that it is invidious both for the mentally handicapped and for those who assess them, that they have to submit to this test. Every test that has been included or has been proposed is defective in one way or another. The only thing that I really welcome is that the test may be altered by other tests in substitution as may be prescribed. To that extent, I am happier than if the test stood without prospect of being altered in the light of further consideration.<lb/>
However, it is late to suggest an amendment. I should simply like to ask that the Government will consider not operating subsection (8) of Clause 8 if this proves too difficult a test to administer or if they find it to be invidious in practice. Instead of excluding the severely mentally handicapped, they should be treated in the same way as the Government have promised to treat the severely physically disabled under Clause 24: by means of rebate. If the Government would consider that course, using that mechanism which they have promised will be available for the severely physically disabled and extending it to include the severely
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0228"/>
<col>439</col>
mentally disabled, and not use subsection (8) of Clause 8, then I and a number of other people should be grateful. The invidious distinction between the physically and the mentally handicapped would thereby be diminished or indeed excluded from the Bill. I think that by now some people find that rather offensive, for more than one reason.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01909"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to deal briefly with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton.

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01913"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, has said and indeed to my noble friend Lord Campbell and the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton. The amendment would make it very much more difficult to establish who would fall within the definition. It would in fact extend the definition of the severely mentally handicapped in a quite unacceptable and most unsuitable way.<lb/>
I listened with care to what my noble friend Lord Renton suggested when he said that it might narrow the definition or the class of those who might be included within the definition. I do not think that my noble friend is right, unless I misunderstood him. If the reference to:
<quote>"arrested or incomplete development of mind"</quote>
is taken out, the definition must be widened to cover more rather than fewer of the congenital conditions which are covered by that phrase. I shall certainly look at the point which the noble Lord has made, although I believe that, as my noble friend recognises if it did in any sense narrow the definition, that would be doing a disservice to people in that particular situation.<lb/>
I think that I should remind the House that the intention of the exemption of the severely mentally handicapped was to remove from liability for the personal community charge a group of people who could not be argued to have any perception of the local authority accountability which would be ensured in the Bill. That essentially is the answer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Henderson. I appreciate the view which he has expressed. However, that is why there is a distinct difference between rebate for some categories, such as the severely disabled, and exemption of the severely mentally handicapped, to which this particular subsection refers.<lb/>
That is all I can say on that point, other than that the latter part of subsection (8) refers to the point of prescribing other meanings, if that should be necessary. I think that the definition is well&#x2014;
<col>440</col>
understood and can readily be operated. It can therefore be expected to be capable of satisfactory application in relation to the group of people whom we are concerned to exempt. I think that the proposed amendment is less precise. It is unlikely to be operated consistently throughout Scotland and it would therefore result in inequity and confusion.<lb/>
4.15 p.m.<lb/>
The amendment would extend the definition to include all persons suffering from severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning. It would thus include people whose minds had developed normally but who had subsequently become mentally impaired due to some medical condition which they had contracted later in life. The definition suggested in the amendment would cover the large numbers of people who suffer from dementia&#x2014;not only the elderly but also many people who suffer from various kinds and degrees of pre-senile dementia. It is a characteristic of those very distressing conditions that episodes during which the patient is severely affected are interspersed with episodes of relatively complete lucidity. It would therefore be difficult to make a considered judgment of individual cases against the definition proposed by the amendment.<lb/>
The definition could also, in certain cases, blur the distinction between the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill. As I said at the Report stage, it is not our intention that the mentally ill should be exempt from the personal community charge. I should point out that many of the worst cases who would be caught by the proposed definition, but not by the definition now in the Bill, will already be resident in hospitals, nursing homes or residential care homes. By virtue of their residence, they will in any case be exempt from the personal community charge.<lb/>
We do not consider it to be either possible or desirable to extend the definition now included in Clause 8(5) to attempt to exempt from the personal community charge liability all those living in the community who suffer from those perhaps temporary conditions. For the reason which I have explained, I can give no commitment to go wider than the definition now contained in the Bill. I should point out, as I think I did earlier, and as the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, has said, that if at some future date the Government wish to extend the definition in the way suggested, the mechanism is already there through the power to set out in regulations an alternative definition. From that point of view, the amendment is, strictly speaking, unnecessary.<lb/>
I take note of the remarks which have been made. I think that anyone who has had any dealing, as have many of your Lordships, with this particularly difficult area of the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and those who are mentally ill but who have remissions, will realise the very difficult points that arise when we come to a strict definition. I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will not find it necessary to press the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01914"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend have a look at the numbering of the subsections? That seems to have gone very much astray. The subsection to which the amendment is proposed
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0229"/>
<col>441</col>
appears in the Bill as subsection (8). I think that it should be subsection (9) and that the opening words of subsection (7)(b) should undoubtedly be in subsection (8)(b). It is difficult enough to follow this part of the Bill at any tme, but if the numbering is haywire, as I think is the case, it becomes impossible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01915"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I very much agree with my noble friend. Both those matters are printing errors.

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01916"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so, the amendments were worked off the Bill as it was amended at Committee stage and not on Report.</membercontribution></p>

However, to return to my amendment, it appears from the remarks made by a number of noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Renton and Lord Henderson of Brompton, that there is undoubtedly an ambiguity concerning the meaning of the phrase which my amendment is endeavouring to exclude from the Bill. The Minister appeared to favour my attitude to the amendment more than that of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, because he suggested that my amendment would widen the definition too much; whereas the noble Lord, Lord Renton, felt that it would make the definition far too narrow. I should be interested to know who will be advising the Minister on any prescribed legislation which he, or any future Minister, will be putting forward. Will there be any provision as to who will make the definitions?<lb/>
As regards impairment to intelligence, it is possible as a result of a physical accident, or a gassing accident (of which I have considerable secondhand knowledge) for a person to be left in the same condition as someone who is born with a congenital defect. Can the Minister tell the House whether someone who has had an accident or been born with such a defect will be entitled to consideration under the clause in the same way? I hope that the Minister will look at the matter again.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01919"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister suggested that my amendment would widen the definition too much, and the noble Lord, Lord Renton, believed it would narrow it&#x2014;unless I have the minuses and pluses the wrong way round. However, I feel that the answer given was not as satisfactory as it could have been, particularly when we all want to try to make this part of the Bill workable, understandable and as helpful as possible to people who are in a very difficult situation. The Minister may wish to speak again before I finish my remarks completely.</membercontribution></p>
<col>442</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01920"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, and while recognising that this is an area which concerns your Lordships, I shall not go into the matter of whether or not the proposed amendment will widen or narrow the definition. I accept that there could be an interpretation that, on the one hand, it narrows the definition, and, on the other hand, it most definitely widens it. There can be no doubt about that. No one wants to see people who may come within the provisions of the Bill in the way that my noble friend Lord Renton suggested when we are dealing with mentally handicapped people not being able to be fitted in.<lb/>
However, the noble Lord raised one matter which it may be helpful for me to address; namely, the question of medical input when assessing whether or not somebody has the required degree of mental handicap to allow them to be exempt in this way. The noble Lord, Lord Morton of Shuna, suggested that the simplest approach would be to require that the person should have to have produced for them a medical certificate, which the registration officer would accept as evidence that they met the criteria for exemption.<lb/>
As I have explained, there is no ready-made certificate for the severely mentally handicapped, but of course the overwhelming majority of them will have been subject to various forms of assessment at various times in their lives and in most cases the nature of their condition will be well known to their general practitioner as well as to doctors providing more specialised care. There should therefore, in practice, be no difficulty about the provision by a suitable doctor of a simple certificate to the effect that the individual in question meets the criteria. The steps in the process will be simple and straightforward. Where a responsible person has indicated on a canvass form or in response to other inquiries made by the registration officer that someone resident at the address in question is severely mentally handicapped, the registration officer will follow up the matter by asking the responsible person for a certificate by an appropriate doctor and its return to the registration officer.<lb/>
We will in due course be consulting the professional bodies involved in this process, and in the light of those consultations will prepare guidance for registration officers on the handling of these cases. I am confident that the procedure I have explained, which I think is broadly similar to that which the noble Lord, Lord Morton, had in mind, will ensure that all or virtually all cases of exemption on the grounds of severe mental handicap are handled swiftly and with the minimum of fuss.<lb/>
On consideration, we therefore see no reason to make detailed provisions for the handling of appeals as I suggested on 30th April. Nor do we think that it is necessary to provide that the registration officer should have power to require a medical assessment to be made of an appellant. Such an element of compulsion appears unnecessary when it is surely to the appellant's interest to provide medical evidence, in the form of a certificate or otherwise, to support the appeal. I think that the arrangements which I have outlined respond positively to the suggestions made at the last stage by the noble Lord, Lord Morton of Shuna, in a practical and commonsense approach to taking decisions in this

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01923">Clause 10 [<i>Liability for and calculation of standard community charge</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01924"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 8:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01925">Page 9, line 16, leave out ("being neither smaller than 1 nor greater than 2").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01926">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment refers to the standard community charge applying to second homes. With this amendment we take Amendment No. 9 because at the moment that amendment concerns the multiplier which is to be neither less than one nor greater than two; namely, between one and two. This will be unfair as regards equity, bearing in mind the nature of second homes. Amendment No. 9 states:
<quote>"and the multiplier may vary with the premises according to size, condition and facilities available with occupancy."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01927">Figures have been quoted in respect of this matter and in respect of certain extremes where the rates paid are over &#x00A3;3,000. Such a figure will now be reduced at the maximum to somewhere in the region of &#x00A3;400, or probably less. The same principle applies in relation to a person who has a small cottage, perhaps in Argyllshire, in the Newton Stewart area, or in the Borders. The rates on that property may be almost nominal at the present time. They will have to pay exactly the same. There is no fairness in that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01928">I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Sanderson, who was surprised to discover that the size of the house did not matter, but that the same principle in relation to the poll tax on individuals will apply to premises. Remember that this point does not concern individuals; it concerns premises. The important matter is the premises, not the individual or the number of individuals. The house can be used by 20 people as guests having a holiday, at one time or at various times.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01929">The noble Lord expressed surprise that it should be so, and so do I. In fact, it would be far better to leave this within rating. It would be more sensible and much more fair. I suggest that we leave the actual multiplier in the first instance to the local authority and that the determination should be based on the quality of the house, the size of the house and factors in relation to what value one can get out of the house, perhaps renting it for a year or two. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01930">4.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01931"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have discussed the standard charge at some length at previous stages and
<col>444</col>
there is little more that I can say about it. The standard charge is not a property tax and I am wholly opposed to the proposition that it should be made one by virtue of these amendments, because that is surely what they would do.<lb/>
In case I have failed in two attempts to communicate the purpose of the standard charge, let me repeat that it is intended to recognise the fact that, with the abolition of domestic rates, the owners of second homes or other domestic property which does not have a registered resident, would have a substantial windfall. The intention of the standard charge is therefore broadly to replace the income which local authorities would othewise lose. The proposal originally contained in the Green Paper was that the standard charge should be set at two units of the personal community charge, but on consideration the Government decided that local authorities should have discretion to set the multiplier in the range from one to two units, allowing a measure of local flexibility.<lb/>
The standard charge is a contribution towards the cost of the local services enjoyed by the owner of the property in question or by those whom he permits to reside there. Some of these will undoubtedly be what might be described as property-based services, such as the fire service, but others will not. When a second home owner is in residence there, he uses local services such as roads, street lighting, cleansing or sewerage, and has access to the local library and the protection of the local police, for example&#x2014;all of which are services which are not related to his property, be it large or small. Clearly, the contribution he makes towards such services is not a property tax. Nor is there any justification for varying that contribution according to the size or value of the property, as is the clear intention of these amendments.<lb/>
The prospects introduced by the amendments will dismay many second home owners. Even the discredited domestic rating system is preferable to what is proposed&#x2014;indeed, the noble Lord suggested so himself&#x2014;for at least valuation is currently in the hands of a neutral, independent official, the assessor. The amendments would effectively give <i>carte blanche</i> to local authorities to decide the amount of local taxation which each individual owner of a second home in their area should pay, based on very ill-defined concepts.<lb/>
I have to say I find these amendments quite unacceptable, as I found them, in principle, unacceptable in the past. With that further explanation I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01932"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he deal with the specific point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, about the equity of this? A very expensive and highly rated house on which appropriate rates are paid now comes down to a fairly standard charge which will be imposed also on someone who lives in a very modest house which is a second home.<lb/>
With all due respect to the services being used in the second home, I am quite sure that the noble Lord, Lord Goold, will tell the Minister about Arran. While he will be rightly paying his community charge to the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0231"/>
<col>445</col>
community for his main residence in Newton Burn, he will not be using the services of his second home. When he moves to the second home for the week-end, he will not be using the services at Newton Burn. He has already made his commitment to the community charge and that strikes me as being anomalous and unfair, particularly to the people who enjoy the prospect of going briefly for a breath of fresh air every now and again to a modest home. Therefore, can the Minister deal with the major equity aspect which the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, introduced?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01933"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, when the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, puts forward this amendment and connects it with the question of size or value, we head straight towards the question of property and, hence, to property tax. It is a feature of suggestions made by some Members of the Opposition that we ought to retain some sort of tax based on the capital value. Although it has not been discussed at length in your Lordship's House, certain papers I have seen suggest that this is how the Opposition would prefer to see local rates being replaced. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, suggests that there is a difficulty with equity here. I am not quite sure how he would justify the fact that rates hills at present have little connection with services that are actually used and whether he suggests there is any equity in that.<lb/>
I believe that the Bill sets out the fairest and the correct way to proceed. We have allowed for a measure of local flexibility in changing the range from one to two units. If the intention lying behind the amendment is to try to come up with some sort of concept of a property tax, that would be much better tackled directly rather than in a way that is far from direct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01934"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe&#x2014;I hope he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;said that when you are in your second home, your holiday house, you are not using the local authority services at your principal place of residence. I query that because, after all, when you are on holiday your principal home can be burgled and the police may have to be called. It can catch fire and the fire brigade may have to attend. A neighbour may come in to feed the cat and to clean, using water. There are a whole lot of things. You are still using the local authority services when you are away from home.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01935"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, I take that point and I entirely agree with the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. It is seldom that premises are not requiring local government services, but I suggest that a small caravan site is less in need of services compared with a mansion. Here we have, whether the Government like it or not, a property tax. The Bill says:
<quote>"The standard community charge shall be payable in respect of premises".</quote>
That is property; so it is a property tax. It is a break away from everyone paying the same thing. It is a matter of the standard itself which is obscure, because it is only standard to a levying area or to a region. It varies from region to region. Arran will probably be
<col>446</col>
much more expensive. It is a favourite holiday place of mine, too. That will be subject to Strathclyde's demands, and that will probably be over &#x00A3;300 by 1989. Of course, it is the premises and not husband and wife paying twice. It does not matter whether it is a chalet or whether it is a castle; they will be paying the same. It cannot be varied within the area. It can be varied between the areas and is limited to between one and two personal community charge rates. There is no justification for it.<lb/>
The measure means that the smaller places will pay more and the bigger places less. I am perfectly sure that many noble Lords who have holiday or second homes in Scotland are on to something good here. That applies to the wealthy within Scotland in respect of the community charges. Fairness does not enter into it. It is a property tax, the form of which bears no relation to the ability to pay or the desirability to pay more because of the nature of the premises. Such considerations do not enter into it.<lb/>
I shall not press this to a vote. However, I hope that the Governmemt appreciate the powers that they still have. I do not know to whom this measure will apply because there will be exceptions. But it will not apply,
<quote>"to such class of classes of those premises as may be prescribed".</quote>
The premises themselves have to be prescribed. I may be wrong and the Government may have a magic formula and prescription that will sort this out. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sanderson, that there ought to be variations between the types of premises, and that many should be paying far more than the maximum of two personal community charges. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01946">Clause 11 [<i>Liability for and calculation of collective community charge</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01947"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 11:
<quote>Leave out Clause 11.</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 11 deals with the collective community charge. In this clause where the Government cannot have the names and addresses of people living in a certain type of premises and where they cannot charge them the personal community charge directly, they leave it to the owner of those premises to assess how many people there are likely to be in any one day or week. They then apply so many personal community charges to him and the owner has to pay that number&#x2014;it may be ten.<lb/>
The difficulty arises for the person who owns the premises. In the case of, say, the Salvation Army hostel in Glasgow, how does the person in charge know from day to day how many people will come in? If people are there only for two or three days&#x2014;as was the Government's suggestion&#x2014;how will they get the money if a man disappears after two days? How will they obtain the money from him? It is a very difficult problem.<lb/>
If one considers applying this measure in England to the waifs and strays one sees around London, it will be almost impossible. The council for the single homeless and other people has been concerned about the impossibility of this being worked out fairly. Remember, my Lords, that if anyone does not pay the personal community charge it means that others have to do so because the cost of the personal community charge is calculated to meet a certain rate burden. If there is a fall in the number of those who pay the charge it means that a smaller number of people will meet the same burden. In other words, it would increase. This will be one of the difficulties that will arise with this Bill from year to year.<lb/>
It is suggested that there will be evasion of 10 per cent. or even 15 per cent. The figures quoted recently on the community charge in Glasgow, the Borders or the Highlands may be quite wrong. The more evasion there is or the greater the failure of the registrar to get everyone on to the register the more it will mean that the community charge will be higher than was ever expected; and I think that this will happen. That is why there should have been a transitional period where the Government could get the mechanism absolutely right.<lb/>
I quote what Michael Ancram said on 29th January this year:
<quote>"In the light of consultation on the Green Paper, we have accepted that the scope of the collective community charge should be strictly limited &#x2026; The Secretary of State will make it clear that there must be a strong presumption in favour of individual registration and that premises should be subject to the Collective Community Charge only when it is clear that individual registration is not practicable.".</quote>
Since this Bill began I have been trying to find out to whom all these factors will apply. I find it very difficult to tell anyone with certainty that they will have to pay
<col>448</col>
personal community charge, or that it will be a collective or standard charge. I was at an old people's home run by the Church of Scotland on Saturday. There are 35 people there. The Church has 41 such homes. The average age of the residents is about 85. These people are not ill but need care and attention. Will they be subject to the exceptions about which we were told? All I had heard so far until today, when someone mentioned nursing homes, was about longterm hospital patients. These residents are not patients. Do they have to pay a collective charge or a personal community charge? It is easy to know who they are, that they are residents, and how long they will be there. Or will they be exceptions?<lb/>
The worst feature is the collective community charge. The onus then is not upon the individual but on the owner or the manager of the premises to collect the personal community charge from the individuals. It has to be paid when people are there for only a short time, and it is then up to the person who may or may not have collected the money to pay it over to the levying authority, and then to pursue the person. By then he may be in England or Aberdeen.<lb/>
What people owe is calculated per night in a case such as that. It is hardly worth pursuing for that sum of money, but from the point of view of the owner time and time again he is very much out of pocket, even if everyone pays up. He has to give a receipt, but the collecting will be onerous. The Government would be far better to forget this clause. It should be up to the registrar and the levying authority to collect the personal community charge and not leave it to somebody else.<lb/>
I spotted something in this clause which does not make a great deal of sense. There are so many mistakes in the Bill that I hope somebody will look it over and put them right. There is a reference in Clause 11 at line 19 to,
<quote>"premises which are not subject to non-domestic rates and &#x2026; are designated by the registration officer under subsection (2A) below".</quote>
For the life of me I cannot find a subsection (2A) in Clause 11. It is yet another mistake. We had one last time which was to be put right, but this is not good enough.<lb/>
I know the Government want to get this Bill through before the election, but it should not be to the detriment of the legislators who are trying to understand what they are doing. This Bill was not printed on Friday. I am sure noble Lords did not see it until they came in today. I have not had time to go over the clauses other than those that have been mentioned in amendments. It really is not good enough.<lb/>
Those are the reasons I feel it would be far better to forget all about this collective community charge. It will be unfair on most of the people who will have to collect it. Some of the voluntary organisations who run homes are terribly worried about this and the amount of work it will mean. They will become unpaid tax collectors. If they are to meet their own liabilities they will have to pursue people when they move from one place to another.<lb/>
Some of the debts may be so slight that it will not be profitable to pursue them at law. If they wait until the people return, all sorts of problems will arise such as "I paid somebody" and there is no question of proof. The
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0233"/>
<col>449</col>
whole thing is a terrible muddle and will lead to tremendous difficulties. The Government would be far better to leave out the clause and to make that home subject to non-domestic charges; in other words, allow them to pay rates on a commercial basis. That would not be bursting the whole thing, but it makes sense. 1 beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01948"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, drew attention to line 19 on page 10 where it states "subsection (2A)". I think it should read "(3)(a)" and that it is a misprint.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01949"><member>Lord Gray</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that as I was probably responsible for the problem which has arisen with the drafting in having caused the Government to make amendments to this part of Clause 11, perhaps I should join the list and suggest that "(2A)" should read "(3)".<lb/>
However&#x2014;this will not be looked on as so helpful by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur&#x2014;there is a genuine area of concern here with regard to the responsibility and the duty to charge in circumstances where there can be considerable fluctuation of occupancy for seasonal or other reasons. One can only hope that the registration officer will have such discretion as will enable him to be able to reach a reasonable agreement with the proprietor of any premises affected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01950"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it surprises me that we could seriously be discussing the omission of this clause at Third Reading. As I understand the rules of the House, on Third Reading they are that we may consider amendments which arise out of government undertakings given at an earlier stage and we may consider drafting amendments. But if this clause, which has been in the Bill since the beginning (or something like it has) were now simply to be left out, a great part of the purpose of the Bill would go to the other place unfulfilled. I do not know what the other place would say about that. It would be a most extraordinary position.<lb/>
If the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, merely wanted to draw attention to the wrong or obscure numbering in line 19 on page 10 he is fully entitled to do so. But at this late stage, for us to attempt to omit this vital part of the Bill is to me unthinkable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01951"><member>Lord Kirkhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Renton, I do not consider the possible deletion of this clause at this late stage as being unthinkable. Indeed, I support the amendment and I consider that were it carried it would achieve a considerable improvement, though I agree it would be at the cost of the deletion of one of the thrusts of the Bill.<lb/>
I consider that the clause raises enormous problems. These points were made before at Committee stage, but I think they are capable of repetition now. For example, voluntary organisations offering accommodation in the short-stay hostel type of accommodation will have a greatly increased administrative burden in having to keep extensive and precise records, as they obviously must in the circumstances. Many such organisations rely on a particular relationship developing between their officers and the residents,
<col>450</col>
especially when the residents are young people. Clearly these officers are concerned that the responsibility which will be placed upon them to collect the collective contribution will adversely affect these very important social relationships which they attempt to develop.<lb/>
There is particular concern about those on low incomes who may wish to apply for a rebate on their contributions. In my view the procedures will be so complex, and delays in calculation of any rebate due so lengthy, that the availability of a rebate on the collective charge contribution will become an empty promise for residents of premises designated for the collective charge.<lb/>
In a recent consultation document issued by the DHSS entitled <i>Help with Board and Lodging Charges for People on Low Incomes</i>, the department quoted from a survey by the Social Security Policy Inspectorate of boarder claimants of supplementary benefits. This survey found that over half the sample lived in various types of boarding-houses and a twelfth in a variety of hostels.<lb/>
The same study showed that most of these claimants were relatively stable in their accommodation; less than 10 per cent. had moved more than four times in the past three years and most had either been at the same address for more than three years or had moved only once or twice in that time. Bearing in mind these comments and others like them, can it really be said that the numbers of people involved in any way justifies the creation of these complex procedures? In my view they do not and the amendment deserves the wholehearted support of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01953"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would surely be unthinkable. I have listened with great care to everything the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, has said, but he himself concedes that this raises serious problems. One can only make one's speech at this stage; one cannot debate, one cannot examine, one cannot discuss. Indeed I rose a moment ago to disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, in his approach that it was offensive and invidious to put the mentally handicapped in a category different from the physically handicapped. These are matters one would wish to discuss if it is necessary to discuss them. At this stage of the Bill, having listened to what has been said, it surely would not be appropriate without further examination of these matters to delete a clause of the Bill which is part and parcel of its essential machinery. It would be unthinkable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01954"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I respectfully concur with what my noble friend Lord Renton said as to the oddity of an amendment to delete the clause appearing at this stage of the proceedings. As to the substance of the noble Lord's main onslaught on the clause, I say nothing, because I am quite certain that it is not necessary to say anything. I am certain that everything that needs to be said on the broad aspect will be more than capably said by my noble friend the Minister when he comes to reply.<lb/>
However, on the ancillary point of the noble Lord opposite about drafting, there is a case to answer. His
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0234"/>
<col>451</col>
intervention will have served some useful purpose if it leads to an improvement in the drafting and a clarification of what in Sherlock Holmes's idiom would be called the Strange Case of Line 19, the reference to a subsection (2A) in a subsection (2a), with the added difficulty that (2A) purports to come below (2)(a). It does not, and your Lordships well know the importance that parliamentary draftsmen and subsequently judicial interpreters of statutes pay to the question of capital letters in this context. I am not wholly inexperienced in another capacity in seeking to interpret and elucidate the oddities of statutory language. If the Minister is able to identify&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01955"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I can help my noble friend and save us from getting into a laborious argument on this point. It is in fact a simple printing error, as other noble Lords may have realised. I apologise that there are one or two printing errors. This arose largely from the problem of computer typesetting this print of the Bill. It is simply a printing error. It should refer to subsection (3) and not subsection (2A) and I shall ensure that when the Bill is reprinted the error is corrected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01956"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, should it refer to (3) <i>simpliciter</i>, (3A), (3)(a), or what?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01957"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, (3) <i>simpliciter.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01958"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to my noble friend for that answer. It is good of him to confess error and I am sure that the House is ready to forgive and proceed with the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01959"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lords, Lord Ross of Marnock and Lord Kirkhill, referred to the question of those in nursing homes. I made it quite clear at col. 1654 of the <i>Official Report</i> that nursing homes and residential care homes will be left in rating, with their residents thereby exempt from the personal community charge. This was discussed at Report stage and there is no question of the collective community charge arising for them. I explained how this will be achieved. It will be achieved by the use of the various powers of prescription in Part I of the Bill to ensure that these homes are not treated as domestic subjects or part residential subjects and therefore remain in rating. I hope that that removes the concerns on that point in the minds of the noble Lords, Lord Ross and Lord Kirkhill.<lb/>
The amendment would remove from the Bill all the provisions applying for the collective community charge to certain premises on the grounds that their residents are too mobile to allow for individual registration for the personal community charge. Over the past weeks we have had a fair amount of criticism of the alleged complexity and difficulty of these provisions. I cannot deny that Clause 11 is long or that its operation may in some cases be complex.<lb/>
The next point I should make is that the clause addresses a problem which presents intrinsic and intractable difficulties. The personal community charge system will cope and will cope well with the vast majority of the population who have a settled mode of existence and who therefore can be registered
<col>452</col>
for the personal community charge. The system, with its division of duties and responsibilities between responsible persons at each address and individual residents, strikes the right balance and will be able to operate efficiently. We have recognised from the time of the Green Paper onwards that there would be a problem of fitting into the community charge system the minority of people who do not have a settled mode of life and who move frequently from one address to another, so frequently that it would not be reasonable to expect registration officers to record every change of their address or for local authorities to collect the personal community charge from them.<lb/>
The collective community charge provides a mechanism for integrating people in this category into the community charge system. I make no apology for saying once again that we hope it will have to be used only in a small number of cases. For that small number, however, it represents the only practicable means of allowing individuals to discharge their community charge responsibilities. No one has seriously challenged the proposition that some special arrangement will have to be made for that small minority of people. The arrangements for determining the collective community charge and for recovering collective community charge contributions from the residents in the premises to which it applies allow an appropriate degree of flexibility in the system while ensuring, first, that residents in premises in respect of whom the collective community charge is payable have no greater and no less a liability for community charge payment than people who are individually registered to the personal community charge; and, secondly, that landlords of collective community charge premises do not find themselves either making an unreasonable profit from their position or suffering an unreasonable loss. The key to this provision is the calculation and periodic recalculation of the collective community charge multiplier.<lb/>
I have listened with great interest to the views of your Lordships on these points at all stages of our discussions and we shall shortly be formulating proposals for consultation with those who will have responsibility for running the system and who will be affected by it on the factors to be taken into account by the registration officer when he determines the collective community charge multiplier. I accept that this is a point of crucial importance and we shall consider it with great care and take full account of all the views expressed both in your Lordships' House and on subsequent consultation with interested bodies.<lb/>
So far as seasonal variations are concerned, and the point which concerns my noble friend Lord Gray, I accept that the occupancy level of collective community charge premises may vary from time to time in the way that he suggests. We cannot expect the registration officer to keep up with every change, which is why changes need be made no more frequently than at three-monthly intervals. That is in clause 15(1)(b). But we are satisfied that looked at over a period of perhaps a year the multiplier will average out satisfactorily and thereby avoid unfairness on either side.<lb/>
I think that this is a fair and reasonable way to approach what we all accept to be a potentially difficult part of the community charge system as a
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0235"/>
<col>453</col>
whole, and therefore I could not agree to this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01960"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lord, it is a pity about that, because every organisation that has written to us about this has been opposed to it from the point of view of the complexity of organisation and the fairness of it. I was glad that at least the noble Lord said that this would not apply to nursing homes or residential homes. I hope that he is right, because this has to be determined not by the Government but by the registration officers.<lb/>
Registration officers in different parts of the country may have different ideas about this. There is nothing to ensure that the Government will be able to see to that. You cannot blame them if they take different points of view when you cannot find Ministers agreeing with one another in this respect. I quoted what Mr. Michael Ancram, who was in charge of the Bill in the other place, had to say about it&#x2014;that it would be strictly limited in its scope. He said:
<quote>"The Secretary of State will make it clear that there must a strong presumption in favour of the individual registration and that premises should be subject to Collective Community Charge only when it is clear that individual registration is not practicable."</quote>
Mr. Ian Lang, on the other hand, said&#x2014;and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is listening
<quote>"There may be occasions where it may be sensible to provide for certain cases of certain types of property being classed as liable to the collective community charge; for example, property of an institutional nature such as that housing the mentally handicapped."&#x2014;</quote>
That is entirely contrary to what the Minister said here. But neither will decide. It has to be prescribed, and who is going to make the decisions? It will be the registration officer. This is what I complained about all along in this Bill. Things look all right, and then the Government say, "They will be prescribed". We cannot say yes or no to people who ask us questions because we do not know as it is not in the Bill.<lb/>
Ministers are known to make mistakes as well as printers, but the printers' mistakes are much more readily and easily put right. We are left with Bills as they are. It is suggested that we cannot have this clause out. If it applies to only a very few people it can be left out. As a matter of fact, it has to be left in in the first instance because by prescription certain things are left out of rating and some things are put in, so they will not be missed out altogether. Power of exemption is there in respect of people and in respect of premises. In view of the difficulties that there have been about this clause I suggest that we take it out, and I cannot withdraw this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01961"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I ask whether it has occurred to him that if the clause is left out a number of consequential amendments to the Bill which are not before us would be necessary?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01962"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Lord was in the House&#x2014;yes, he was there&#x2014;when we dealt with Lords amendments to the reorganisation of local government in Scotland. The Government found it possible to put in a considerable number of other amendments particularly in relation
<col>454</col>
to the time when we left out Strathclyde in this House. There were plenty of consequential amendments to that. The Government put Strathclyde back in in another place with amendments to Lords amendments in such a way that they covered the consequences as well.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-01968">Clause 22 [<i>Reduction of community charges</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01969"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 12:
<quote>Page 20, line 12, at end insert ("for the purpose of making provision as to the reduction of community charges where the Secretary of State is satisfied, in accordance with that Schedule, that the total estimated expenses mentioned in section 9(2) of this Act of a local authority are excessive and unreasonable, and for related purposes").</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am sure that the Minister will remember the discussion that took place in connection with this clause. It came from all parts of the House. It was on the basis of not commenting on the merits or otherwise of the powers given within the Bill to whichever government are in power&#x2014;but that such an important power should at least be explained on the face of the Bill. My noble friend Lord Morton of Shuna suggests that Amendment No. 12, as appears on the Marshalled List, will fulfil the purpose that was generally agreed in most parts of the House. That was
<col>456</col>
that there should be something on the face of the Bill outlining the powers available. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01970"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House is indebted to the noble Lord opposite for tabling this amendment in the short period that has elapsed since our discussion at the previous stage. If I may be allowed to say so without impertinence, given the time factor, he and his noble friend have done a very good job of drafting. It does not go so far as some of us who criticised the original clause would wish. It certainly does not meet the full requirements of an important clause of this kind in that proposed major elements in changes to the law should be set out in the clause and not in the schedule. However, as an emergency job, as a rush job for patching, it seems to make considerable progress. Your Lordships are indebted to the noble Lord and I hope that my noble friend will be prepared to accept the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01971"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say straight away that I am more than happy to accept the amendment. Its wording has been the subject of many ideas and counter-ideas. I believe that the wording goes a long way towards reflecting the concern expressed from all quarters of your Lordships' House. That is not only from the noble Lords, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove and Lord Morton of Shuna, but also my noble friends Lord Boyd-Carpenter, Lord Selkirk and Lord Renton. I take their concern most seriously.<lb/>
I think that the amendment places on the face of the Bill the principle of the purpose of Schedule 3. Perhaps it does not go quite so far as my noble friends would have wished. However, it achieves the essential purpose without the need for further complicated amendments to Schedule 3. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, for his remarks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01972"><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, 1 first raised this matter at the Committee stage. We are grateful to my noble friend for agreeing to the amendment. It is precisely the kind of thing that this House must do. There is a gross error in drafting. I say "gross error" because it is in the Bill that principles are laid down, and the details which are sometimes laid down by the administration are included in the schedules. In this case it was omitted completely and I think that that was a case of bad drafting. I believe that my noble friend has saved the face of the Scottish Office to a very high degree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01973"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to thank the Minister for correcting something which, as an ordinary lawyer, I considered to be very unsatisfactory. I hope that my noble friend will take this on board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01974"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that when my noble friend Lord Morton of Shuna reads <i>Hansard</i> he will blush at all the compliments that have been paid to him today. I think a very important point has been made, particularly as regards the statement made by the noble Earl, Lord Selkirk, when he said that it would save the face of the Scottish Office from embarrassment. If nothing else, it is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0237"/>
<col>457</col>
perhaps a lesson for future draftsmen. I am pleased that the Minister has accepted the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01975">On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01976">Clause 24 [<i>Rebates from rates and community charges</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01977"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member> moved Amendment No. 13:
<quote>Page 20, line 34, leave out from ("subsidy") to end of line 35 and insert ("equal to the aggregate sum granted by way of rebate under this section and such sums as will compensate each local authority in respect of the difference between the percentage of community charge payable by full time students under section 8(5) and 100 per cent. of such community charge.").</quote>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, I return to a point that has been raised many times, and I make no apology. We have never been given a satisfactory answer to the question: who pays the difference between the students' contribution and the total community charge? In recent sittings of the Committee the Minister dealt with the change in the method of payment by students, and I believe that the House was to some extent slightly perplexed by that. Instead of students being given 100 per cent. nominal grant of the average for students in Scotland, and then paying back 20 per cent., we now have the reverse situation, in that they will be charged the percentage that was due from the community charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01978">However, this still did not explain what happened in respect of the local authority within whose area the students were studying. There are considerable problems here. There are large numbers of students in Glasgow and Strathclyde. On the other hand Strathclyde has a fairly large population. It could be argued that the effect would not be as great as it would be in St. Andrews where there are perhaps fewer students but of course Fife has a much smaller population.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01979">Without repayment by the Government in respect of this figure, there will be strain on local authorities. There are two objections. One is that students will be an additional charge on the local community, particularly in areas with a very obvious student population. I am thinking, for instance, of the West End of Glasgow. This will have a considerable effect on the additional community charge to be levied on local people. Resentment might be developed on the part of local people because of too many students in the area. Sometimes students are not very popular. I know from the area that I represented for a long time that students could have bouts of unpopularity. If, added to that, local people believed they were very directly paying an additional sum in order to compensate for the students' reduced community charge, the problems could be made much greater. The suggestion is made in the amendment that for full-time students there should be a repayment to local authorities, making up whatever the students themselves pay, so that local authorities receive 100 per cent. in total between the two elements for students within their communities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01980">We have raised this before, as I say, and have tried to find out exactly what the Government's intentions are. Up to now we have not been successful. I think this is an important amendment, and I beg to move.</p>
<col>458</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01981">5.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01982"><member>Lord Kirkhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the Minister will be able to accept my noble friend's amendment, if only because the Minister will recall that I raised this point with him at the Report stage. Although I think it is fair to say that he made a response to the points I then raised, he might now agree&#x2014;perhaps he might not but I hope that he will&#x2014;that at the very best his remarks could be construed as having been somewhat ambiguous. The Minister now has the opportunity to be much more specific.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01983"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure how this arises. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, puts this forward as a probing amendment to ascertain the intentions of the Government. It is now suggested that the Government should accept it. The position of students has been dealt with by taking a median line between exemption and rebate in Clause 8, by a government amendment which was accepted. It is not understood quite why, having listened to noble Lords, this amendment should be necessary other than perhaps to seek some further explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01984"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this amendment touches on two quite different issues. The first is the terms of the reimbursement arrangements between the Secretary of State and local authorities in respect of the costs of the community charge rebate scheme. I should remind your Lordships that the present housing benefit scheme is to be revised with effect from 1988/89 and that the terms of the reimbursement arrangements for that scheme between the Secretary of State and the local authorities are currently under discussion. The outcome of these discussions will obviously have a considerable influence on the arrangements to apply in 1989/90 when the community charge rebate scheme will be in place. The point is that the community charge rebate scheme will not be created in a vacuum, but will follow on from the housing benefit scheme which is currently being revised, as I have said. There is therefore no reason for providing a different statutory basis for the reimbursement arrangements to apply to the community charge rebate scheme, as would be provided for by this amendment.<lb/>
Secondly, however, the amendment raises the question of reimbursement by the Secretary of State for the fact that local authorities' community charge income will be less than it would otherwise have been because of the proposal that students should only pay a prescribed percentage of the personal community charge. In that sense, the limitation on the liability of students resembles the various rating reliefs which are at present taken into account in the distribution of rate support grant. Under the proposed future arrangements for revenue support grant it will be possible similarly to take account of the effect of the concession for students which your Lordships agreed to at Report stage.<lb/>
It appeared to me that the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, was suggesting that on the Government's original proposal, students would have received 100 per cent. average reimbursement through grant. That was never the case. The proposal was 80 per cent. of the average. The amendment made at Report stage
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0238"/>
<col>459</col>
leaves students paying the net amount of 20 per cent., which represents no change on average although it avoids the element of rough justice in the original proposal. Therefore I think that my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway is quite right to make that point as well, but the mechanism will have to be the subject of consultation in due course with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.<lb/>
I believe that what I have said has made it plain yet again what is proposed in this clause so far as it relates to reimbursement, and so on. I hope the noble Lord is more content and also that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, accepts what I have said. In the light of these further explanations, I hope the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01985"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, for one, am extremely grateful to my noble friend for reiterating that explanation. I found it rather difficult to follow on the last occasion and I still was not absolutely clear after reading his explanation in <i>Hansard.</i>
There has been some anxiety in the area where I live&#x2014;there are a large number of students in Dundee, too&#x2014;that the local authority might be disadvantaged because of the rebate for students. It is now clear, as I understand it, that the rebate for students is dealt with in the same way as other rebates; and the local authority (by a mechanism which has yet to be worked out) will be reimbursed for that which they do not receive from the students. I am sure that it will be a very great comfort to local authorities to be absolutely clear about that, and I am very grateful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01986"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, suggested that in some way I had wanted this amendment to be a probing one: yet, on the other hand, I wanted to have it accepted. From the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, there was obviously a great deal of doubt as to what the actual intentions of the Government were, and therefore an explanation was required. If the explanation was not satisfactory, the purpose of the amendment was to try and safeguard the local authority at the end of the day so that it would not be in a worse position than it is now.<lb/>
The two things are perfectly logical. I am not totally convinced that the Minister's answer is entirely satisfactory from the local authority point of view because he said that discussions are still going on&#x2014;I assume that they will last for some time&#x2014;between the local authorities and the Government on the question of the revenue support grant.<lb/>
In view of the Statement made today by the Minister, we can only hope that it is the Government's intention&#x2014;as indeed it is the intention of the amendment&#x2014;that the local authorities will be no worse off because of the number of students in their areas and that they will not be discouraged from having students. In fact we generally consider that to be a benefit. There will therefore be no discouragement to local authorities about having students in their areas because of this Bill. In view of the Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01987">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<col>460</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01988"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 14:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01989">Page 20, line 35, at end insert&#x2014;
<quote>("() In calculating rebate entitlement in respect of personal community charge there shall be no discrimination to the detriment of young persons between the ages of 18 and 24 years.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01990">The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now deal with the question of rebates, which we have not discussed before although I have mentioned it, particularly during the last day of the Rtport stage. This amendment concerns the position of youngsters between the ages of 18 and 24 who are unemployed after the community charges are introduced. They are subject to the new income allowance and housing benefit. They are still liable for rates in England, although non-householders in England pay nothing for rates. There will therefore be no liability in respect of reductions of their income from their point of view.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01991">However, in Scotland the difference in the amounts paid by those between the ages of 18 and 24 and those aged 25 and over amounts to over &#x00A3;5. It is indeed 7 per cent. of their disposable income.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01992">There is no justification for a rebate scheme to operate in that particular way in respect of people who are paying exactly the same community charge. There is no doubt that they will be dealt with detrimentally. With the introduction of the community charge for Scotland the scales must be equalised in respect of the benefit after 1989.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01993">This measure will apply to the young unemployed who may be young householders and even be married. If they are bearing the same burden they should receive the same relief, but as things stand at the moment they will not do so. We do not know how the final scheme will operate. That is another matter about which we are left in the dark. That information will not be produced until much later, probably nearer 1988. We can work on it then and on the position in relation to young people when the community charge is levied on them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01994">It is applicable only in Scotland. The difference between Scotland and England means that English youngsters will be in a more advantageous position because the community charge comprises a fixed sum and they will not be paying it in England. So this will be to the disadvantage of the people in Scotland. That is one point. The other point its that we must eliminate the unfair discrimination against the 18 to 24 year-olds who are carrying exactly the same burden as older people. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01995">5.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01996"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I think I have said on previous occasions, the arrangements for rebating the community charge will be based on the rate rebate arrangements in the new housing benefit scheme to be introduced in April 1988. One of the features of that scheme is that for the first time the assessment of entitlement to housing benefit will be aligned with the assessment of entitlement to income support. The principle of alignment has been supported by all parties.<lb/>
The effect of this amendment will be to undermine that principle. For that reason I hope that the noble Lord will not press it. The justification for different
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0239"/>
<col>461</col>
treatment for those aged 18 to 24 who do not have families is that such a distinction provides a reasonable measure of the lower financial commitment which people in that position have in comparison with people in other groups. If that sounds a sweeping statement, well and good, but of those on income support some 82 per cent. of people aged between 18 and 24 are either non-householders or, if householders, have families and will in any case be subject to the higher personal allowance. On the other hand, some 90 per cent. of income support recipients over the age of 25 are householders.<lb/>
The age differential that we propose is a reasonable measure to the variation in living expenses incurred by the groups involved. I think that the statistics that I have just given make the case very plainly. Like it or not, resources are finite. The more that is spent on community charge rebates, the more others who are liable for the personal community charge will have to pay. In our view this differentiated treatment of younger single people is justified on the grounds that single people in the older age groups are more likely to he householders and generally to have higher living expenses. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01997"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this matter concerns young persons between the ages of 18 and 24, who, if unemployed, will surely fall within that vulnerable group of persons who do not have the ability to pay. They will therefore come within the assurance given by my noble friend during the Report stage. Of course, if they are employed and they have a full ability to pay, they will not be vulnerable and will not fall within that group.<lb/>
If that is right, surely the flexibility afforded by the assurance of my noble friend on the last occasion is a sufficient and adequate safeguard, and this amendment in its present form:
<quote>"&#x2026; young persons between the ages of 18 and 14 years"</quote>
without further definition or further consideration as to which young persons it applies is far to rigid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01998"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am surprised that the Minister justifies the differential. He talks about the varying burdens of household expenses and so on but we are not discussing a varying burden; we are considering the community charge, which is exactly the same for the young non-earner as it is for the young earner. It places the unemployed in the same situation as the employed. They pay the same sum of &#x00A3;300.<lb/>
The personal allowance after which the level of income support is calculated in respect of single claimants aged 18 to 24 years is &#x00A3;26. The single claimant aged 25 and over receives &#x00A3;30.60. There is a difference of &#x00A3;4-60. How can that be justified in relation not to expenses of a household and such but in relation to two people, both of whom may be unemployed&#x2014;indeed, they have to be unemployed to be on the income supplement level&#x2014;so that one of them receives greater support than the other? It cannot be justified simply by saying that one person is over 18 and under 25 and that as soon as that person reaches
<col>462</col>
the age of 25 he will receive a little more. It is not fair and it is not right. They eat the same; they buy in the same shops; and the Government say they must pay the same in community charge. The younger ones will get less money in the end, based upon the scheme as we know it at present. The differentiation in age, which the Government justified, means that they are being badly treated compared with persons who may be just a year older in respect of something for which they both pay the same. This cannot be justified.<lb/>
I thought that we might have heard from the Government that the scheme was not yet fully drawn up and that we shall only know later whether this will apply with respect to community charge. You can justify it in relation to everything else that is in the personal allowance range but not in respect of something for which they both pay the same. That means that other people will seek to evade payment. They will leave home and go to England where they do not need to pay it at all. Could we have assurance that the Government will look at this between now and the time of drawing up the regulations with respect to income support?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-01999"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I do not think I can go any further. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway referred to the assurance that I gave about vulnerable groups. When I referred to this last time I said that I could not go into the detail because in any case it would not apply until the matter was finalised in the autumn. I hear what the noble Lord has said but I stand precisely by my answer to him when I spoke the first time. To go any further than that now would be wrong.<lb/>
It appears that we shall return to the subject on the next amendment, which precisely addresses the point of the most vulnerable groups. I can speak again then, but I have nothing further to say in relation to this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02000"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister will remember that he tried to justify the differentiation. That is what worries me. He justified the differentiation in treatment between the 18 to 24-year-olds and those over 24 although they are both paying the same. There should be no differentiation there. If that is the Minister's last word, I beg leave to have the House decide the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02004">Resolved in the negative and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02005">6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02006"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member> moved Amendment No. 15:
<quote>Page 20, line 35, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() The maximum rebate in respect of the most vulnerable groups in the community shall be 100 per cent.</quote>
<quote>() The term "vulnerable groups" shall be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations following discussion with persons or associations (including COSLA&#x2014;) whom he considers knowledgeable about the needs of those groups.").</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02007">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is prompted by the fact that a statement was made by the Minister of State about vulnerable groups and looking after them. I thought it would be desirable that the maximum rebates for the most vulnerable groups should go beyond 80 per cent., and be up to 100 per cent. Helpful as ever, I thought I had better define "vulnerable groups". This does not refer to anything that might happen on 1 1 th June, as to which group will be vulnerable and which will not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02008">I am referring to much more serious matters of people trying to get a living in one way or another when there are special difficulties, such as handicaps, whether mental or physical, unemployment or lowly-paid employment, those with children and maybe young or old people. But I leave the Secretary of State to define "vulnerable groups" in regulations after he has had discussions with persons knowledgeable about their needs, who will probably be called upon to collect from these vulnerable groups, about whom they know quite a lot because of the work they do.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02009">So the explanation of this amendment is simple and clear. I leave it to the Minister of State to take us a little further than he did when he mentioned vulnerable groups and looking after them. The rebate surely cannot be just 80 per cent. and ought possibly to be even as high as 100 per cent. I beg to move.</p>

<col>465</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, said in col. 55 of <i>Hansard</i> for the Report stage on 5th May, in response to an amendment spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and myself, that in setting the levels of income support the position of the most vulnerable groups in our society would be taken into account. If I am not very much mistaken, he has repeated that assurance several times already this afternoon. I accept the noble Lord's assurance.<lb/>
When the levels of income support for the year 1989&#x2013;90 come to be set by affirmative instrument, as I understand they will be, I shall scrutinise them very carefully to make sure that that has indeed been done, as I have no doubt will others of your Lordships. If I am not satisfied as to the ability of persons on low income support to pay their community charge&#x2014;that part of it which is not rebated&#x2014;without genuine hardship, I shall vote against the regulations as no doubt will many others of your Lordships, and that is the way that I think we should proceed. For those reasons I most certainly cannot support an amendment which is, as I say, in spirit the same as one which was defeated at Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02014"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted that I gave way to the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and I am sorry that I did not give way earlier. I did not see her rise, and perhaps she will accept my apology. I should have wished to say everything that she said, and it was said very much better.<lb/>
It now really comes down to this very short point. My noble friend the Minister has given an undertaking about vulnerable groups and those unable to pay. As your Lordships know, before he gave that undertaking I was contending for 100 per cent. rebate. But when I heard the undertaking I accepted it. I understood that my noble friend the Minister was then not in a position&#x2014;he was totally frank with the House; I have read <i>Hansard</i> carefully, too&#x2014;to go further than he did then. But for my part I accept his assurance and I would not be able to support this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02015"><member>Lord Kirkhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at an earlier stage of the Bill the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, remarked&#x2014;I paraphrase his words&#x2014;that Clause 24 was the very heart of the Bill. He certainly used a phrase of that type. I wholeheartedly concur with that view. Of course the noble Lord has subsequently explained to us that he accepted the Minister's assurances as they relate to regulations about vulnerable groups. I really think that the Government have shown a marked lack of compassion and humanity at the very point of true social concern. They should be condemned for this and for weasel words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02016"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Ross, has said, his amendment is intended to probe the effect of the statement I made on 5th May during Report stage, when at col. 55 of <i>Hansard</i> I said that the Government recognise that our proposals for a minimum contribution towards local taxation mean that many people will be for the first time making a contribution towards their rates. I gave the assurance that in setting income support levels&#x2014;as my noble
<col>466</col>
friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has suggested&#x2014;we shall take into account the impact of this on the most vulnerable groups.<lb/>
Let me make clear at the outset that the Government remain committed to the essential philosophy of having a minimum contribution. Quite simply, far too many people make no contribution at all towards the cost of the local services that they enjoy and this leads to the question of accountability, or lack of it, which we have addressed on many occasions. As the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, suggested, it really is premature to press for a detailed definition of what vulnerable groups will ultimately be.<lb/>
The setting of income support levels, which is what my assurances referred to, will not take place until the autumn and careful consideration will be required to enable us to decide those for whom this extra protection is appropriate. It is not the kind of thing that can be decided in the course of a day or two. Our decisions will be a feature of the regulations to be made under Part II of the Social Security Act 1986 in respect of income support. The first such regulations&#x2014;those to be brought forward this year&#x2014;will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.<lb/>
We have discussed the whole question of rebates on a number of occasions. The explanations I have given of the Government's original intentions, as set out in the detailed press handout which has been made available to your Lordships either personally or in the Library, coupled with the subsequent assurances and explanations that I have given, indicate the fundamental fairness of the Government's approach.<lb/>
For the reasons that I have given, I believe that the amendment cannot be accepted. I hope that in the light of the explanation that I have given as to why it will take longer to assess precisely who will be encompassed within the "vulnerable groups", the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02017"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish that we had been advanced by that explanation but, as I understood it, the Minister said that there would be no 100 per cent. rebate. He held by the fact that everyone should make a contribution. That means that the poorest of the poor namely, the "vulnerable groups" will make a contribution.<lb/>
The Minister cannot tell me that the poorest of the poor are not vulnerable. They are very vulnerable indeed to any additional expenses put upon them. I wish to make it clear that I, too, shall be scrutinising the regulations. If they do not go beyond the 80 per cent. rebate that has already been mentioned, the Minister will be in trouble.<lb/>
Let us not forget that when we debated the then Social Security Bill in this House on 23rd June 1986, the House voted to accept an amendment which was designed to safeguard 100 per cent. rebates. At the present time there are about 56,000 old-age pensioners in Glasgow who receive 100 per cent. rebates on rent and rates. That 100 per cent. will disappear in 1988. The position of those pensioners will be even worse in 1989 as regards the liability of husband and wife for the personal community charge. Surely to goodness, if the words of the Minister in
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0242"/>
<col>467</col>
respect of "vulnerable groups" mean anything, they should mean an advance from the 80 per cent. rebate.<lb/>
The Minister's words have been used and noted. I accept his word for the moment, but he may not be here in a month's time. He may have moved to pastures new, having gained promotion as a result of thrilling the House with his eloquence and carrying the Bill through, especially this particular part which has caused him a lot of trouble. There have been one or two important interventions in which noble Lords have suggested that he should reconsider the matter.<lb/>
We accept the Minister's word, but the proof of the pudding will come when the regulations are introduced. I hope that a few other noble Lords, apart from the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, will say that they cannot support the regulations if the Minister has not kept his word in respect of the "vulnerable groups".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02018"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene to state that the regulations to which I referred are the regulations which set the levels of income support under the Social Security Act 1986.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02019"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is correct. I am glad that we have had it reconfirmed because the regulations will apply to the community charge in Scotland. They should be different to those in England because the burden is Scottish, not English. However, in view of what has been said and as I realise that the Minister appreciated the importance of what he said about rebates for the "vulnerable groups" in connection with the community charge, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02020">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am almost embarrassed to drag the House away from debate on a point of principle in order to draw attention to another drafting amendment. In response to cross-party pressure, the two separate interpretation clauses which were in the Bill when we first saw it were merged on Report. At the same time Her Majesty's Government moved a number of amendments to tidy up generally the various definitions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02024">The group of amendments then moved by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur included several which concerned the definition of the word "rate". The particular piece of tidying-up which I now recommend was missed at that time. The words that the amendment features are now superfluous. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02028"><member>Lord Grimond</member> moved Amendment No. 17:
<quote>Page 43, line 14, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("11A. Notwithstanding the repeal of section 44 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 any regional council or islands council which has at any time before 1st April 1987 pursuant to that section defrayed any part of the expenditure referred to in that section out of the regional rate or the general rate (as the case may be) with the approval of the Secretary of State as provided in that section to an amount exceeding one-third of that said expenditure may make a contribution to that expenditure out of the general fund as if that section had not been repealed and it had authorised the defraying of such expenditure out of the community charges and non-domestic rates due to that council.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02029">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment returns to a point which I raised on Report, namely that should the Bill go through as at present drafted certain farmers and indeed other enterprises in Orkney&#x2014;I am thinking of the Milk Marketing Board&#x2014;will be faced with an extremely heavy increase in rates if the calculations of the local authority are correct. I am glad to see that the Minister nods his head and agrees.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02030">I am grateful to the two noble Lords who showed some sympathy with the amendment on Report. However, I am in some difficulty because the Minister said that he doubted whether the local authorities' calculations were correct but that he would have further discussions with them. I understand that his officials have had those discussions, but I must confess that it is only this afternoon that I have heard anything about them. I have not heard very much except that I understand that no agreement was reached. I hope that the Minister will tell us more about that position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02031">The amendment before us today is a modified repetition of the amendment put down on Report. But it contains two important points. First, there is no intention to destroy the aim that water users should pay more. The amendment is simply to ensure that the payment should not be so abrupt and so steep in the case of farmers who have meters and of certain other water users.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02032">My second point, which I wish to make strongly, is that the amendment lays down that the local authority&#x2014;which is the water authority&#x2014;will be allowed to assist meter users up to a limited amount from the general rate fund subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. That seems wholly reasonable. The Government need have no fear that their Bill is being seriously damaged because the local authority can assist meter users only with the authority of the Secretary of State and up to a limited amount. That seems a reasonable proposition, bearing in mind that we are now at the last stages of the Bill. Subject to what the Minister has to say, I understand that his officials and the local government officials are still at loggerheads as to the exact effect of the Bill. If the Bill goes through as it is, there is no hope, as I understand it, of any latitude being allowed to the local authority. It will have to carry out the provisions of the Bill and inflict the serious increases upon farmers and other users which, at this time, must be highly undesirable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02033">If the Bill is amended&#x2014;if not exactly as I suggest, then along those lines&#x2014;the ultimate decision rests with the Secretary of State. If it should prove, after further conversations, that the local authority is mistaken in its interpretation of the Bill, the provision
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0243"/>
<col>469</col>
will never come into effect. The Secretary of State will be able to veto any attempt to pay out of the general rate grant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02034">I should be grateful if the Minister would address his mind carefully to this matter. We are at the last gasp of the Bill and if it goes through as it is and if the local authority is right in its calculations, there may well be serious injury inflicted on a limited number of people whom I am sure the Government do not mean to harm. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02035"><member>Lord Sanderson of Bowden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too spoke about this particular amendment at an earlier stage of the Bill. I was concerned about the figures which the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, produced at that time. I believe he said that there would be an increase of 270 per cent. for farmers in the islands in Orkney. I did not feel that my noble friend the Minister actually gave us much in the way of figures to justify the stand of his officials on this matter. I am a bit distressed to hear that they and the local authority in Orkney are still at loggerheads. If they are at loggerheads, I feel that the people on the ground probably know the scene rather well and I should like to hear some justification for why it is unecessary that an amendment of this sort should be presented at this stage. It is a matter which could affect the livelihoods of farmers in Orkney. I should like further assurances from the Minister before we let this amendment go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02036"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, who has moved this amendment. In earlier discussions on this Bill we considered vulnerable groups. I am not pretending that the farmers of Orkney are in the same category as the vulnerable groups to which the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, has referred. But there is an obvious anomaly which is being created by the Bill. If I read the figures right, 60 per cent. of the water on Orkney is metered and under this Bill the local authority is bound to apportion the charges for water between the various users of water, which will mean a rise of some 270 per cent. for certain users of water on Orkney.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Grimond, said that one farmer had estimated that his water bill would be increased by &#x00A3;1,400 per annum. Considering the state of agriculture in general on the island as well as on the mainland, it appears to me to be creating a vast anomaly. There ought to be some adjustment or consideration of a special situation. The Minister said, in replying to the discussion at Report stage, that the matter would be looked at. I hope that he will be able to tell us that some progress has been made in the discussions concerning special categories.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02037"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, would perpetuate the provisions of Section 44 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 in certain circumstances. This amendment is very similar, although not identical, to one which we considered at Report stage. It presents the same difficulties. Section 44 allows a regional or islands council to meet from the regional general rate up to one third of expenditure on water services not
<col>470</col>
otherwise met by metered or special charges. The proportion of expenditure met in this way may be greater than one third, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. The effect of these provisions is that the true cost of the water services is hidden from consumers. Only that part of the cost met by the domestic water rate is separately identified on rates demand notices.<lb/>
The amendment would allow any council to continue to meet part of the costs of water services from general funds if they have, at some time since 1975, met more than the normal one third of water expenditure under Section 44. That would apply to five councils, although only the Orkney Islands Council does so at present.<lb/>
We have discussed this matter before and I must make it clear again that the Bill does not in any way increase the overall cost of water services in Orkney or, for that matter, in any other authority. Nor does it affect the level of support through the grant arrangements. What the Bill does propose is a clear and fair system for determining water costs and for apportioning those costs among the various classes of consumer. The Bill also brings the full cost of the service into the open by requiring publication of charges and the basis upon which they have been determined.<lb/>
Before I come to the particular point which was raised about consultations, perhaps I may say that the amendment would defeat these aims which are intended to safeguard the interests of all consumers. Anything which might be done to benefit one class of consumer would only be done at the expense of others.<lb/>
When we discussed this amendment earlier, I said that I and my department had insufficient information on which to base an assessment of the position for Orkney. My noble friend Lord Sanderson asked for certain figures. I do not have those figures in front of me. The figures which were produced by the Orkney Islands Council we have had to disagree as they may be an exaggeration of the case about which they are concerned. I offered further discussion which I felt sure would help to resolve to a large extent the difficulties to which the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, has pointed. The noble Lord withdrew his amendment on that basis.<lb/>
My offer of discussions was intended to mean that there would be detailed and studied consideration between the council and my department. There has not been sufficient time for such consultation since I made that offer. But the chief executive of the council has been in touch with my officials. In the course of three lengthy telephone conversations last week, helpful views and information were exchanged. I do not claim that the difficulties have been overcome. Rather, these informal discussions strengthen my belief that detailed and considered consultations are required and that the difficulties can be resolved to a substantial degree.<lb/>
There are other important points which I should again like to emphasise. First, it is our intention to ensure that the cost of water services is apportioned even-handedly and is made known to all consumers. Secondly, the provisions of the Bill will not raise the overall costs of water services in any way or, as I said earlier, affect the grant arrangements. Finally, while I
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0244"/>
<col>471</col>
understand the concern which lies behind the amendment, it cuts across important principles of the Bill and cannot sit alongside the other provisions of Schedule 5.<lb/>
I hope that with the additional reassurance that, telephone conversations apart, we have to sit down and discuss this in a properly organised and detailed way so that the consultations can be taken further forward, the noble Lord will feel further reassured.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02038"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. Candidly, I do not see a great deal of point in dividing the House at this stage on this type of matter. However, I should be grateful if he would give me a bit more assurance than he has done. I understand that he does not dispute the figures. He has not given any alternative figures to those produced by the local authority and indeed by the Milk Marketing Board, which has also produced figures showing that its rates will be greatly increased. I am grateful to him for saying that he is confident that the matter can be resolved. However, I should be grateful if he could explain what he means by that. Once the Bill becomes an Act there can be no further amendment, and no discretion, as I understand it, will then be left to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
My amendment seeks to write in some discretion which the Secretary of State can exercise. However, when the Minister says that he is confident the matter can be resolved, I am not quite certain what he means. Does he mean that he is confident the local authorities can be shown that their figures are wrong; or, has he in mind some other way of compensating them, and the people who will face a very serious increase, if in the end it is proved that the local authorities' figures are right? At this stage, I know that we cannot have a great many speeches, but I should be grateful if the Minister could give the House more information about what he means by "resolved", and whether or not he has any doubt about the local authorities' figures. If so, what figures does he think are the true ones?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02039">6.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02040"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I said that I believe the difficulties can be resolved to a substantial degree. The fact is that there are some figures which have been produced by Orkney Islands Council which we believe are not necessarily correct. We are in discussion with the Orkney Islands Council and we need to have a proper meeting with them to establish precisely where we stand and explain to them why we think that the figures they have produced are incorrect.<lb/>
It is difficult for me to know what else I can say. Until such discussions have taken place neither my officials nor indeed the officials of the Orkney Islands Council will be able to reach a meeting of minds. However, I believe that what I said earlier holds good. Clearly there is a concern which we acknowledge, and that is why we have agreed to meet them in order to try to resolve the matter. I am quite certain it will be possible to provide the reassurance which the Orkney Islands Council clearly need, so that the difficulties can be resolved to the substantial degree which I believe is
<col>472</col>
possible. Until those meetings have taken place, it is impossible for me to say more.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02041"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find myself in the same difficulty as the Minister. I do not know what to say until these meetings have taken place. Of course by that time the Bill will be an Act. I find the situation very unsatisfactory and I am severely alarmed. However, if there is a procedure in this House as in the other place which allows the amendment to be negatived I will save your Lordships the trouble of traipsing through the Lobbies. I do not feel inclined to withdraw the amendment totally because I believe that it could lead to very serious personal hardships, and certain hardships on local industry and farmers which would be serious for the whole community. I therefore move the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02042">On Question, amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02043"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill do now pass.<lb/>
We have almost reached the end of a lengthy and intensive piece of work on the Bill. We have debated its provisions for about 60 hours. I think that on all sides of the House your Lordships can take considerable credit for the care with which the Bill has been analysed and the depth in which its underlying policy and intentions have been probed.<lb/>
We have not of course achieved a meeting of minds between all sides of the House on every aspect. However, I believe that we have found some quite substantial areas upon which we can agree. First, no one would dispute that the Bill which we are sending back to another place has undergone some important improvements in drafting and layout. Changes have been urged upon me from all sides of the House. I have made it my business to accept such changes where possible.<lb/>
I am sure noble Lords will agree that I must make particular mention of the contribution to our deliberations which has been made by my noble friend Lord Gray. The care with which he has analysed the drafting of the Bill and the clarity with which he has presented his proposals for improvement have been marvellous. I am most grateful to him, as indeed I am to my noble friends Lord Selkirk, Lord Boyd-Carpenter and Lord Renton, to say nothing of noble Lords opposite for their comments on Clause 22 and the schedule with which we have just been dealing.<lb/>
Secondly, we are sending back a Bill which will work better. For example, we have provided greater flexibility in the arrangements for billing and collection of the community charge in response to amendments moved by my noble friend Lady Carnegy. We have simplified the arrangements in Clause 18 for calculating the interest due on backdated periods as a result of amendments proposed by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde. We have given local authorities flexibility in deciding the length of the period of grace under the standard community charge. We have also provided additional appeal procedures as regards the designation of responsible persons. These are only a few of the examples of the many technical changes, improvements and clarifications that we have made.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0245"/>
<col>473</col>
Our discussions have also led to some more substantial changes. We have greatly improved the position of students, meeting in particular the concern expressed on all sides of the House concerning the position of overseas students, as raised by the noble Earl, Lord Perth, and the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. We have provided exemption for the severely mentally handicapped, about whom considerable concern was expressed even today.<lb/>
I should also remind your Lordships that I was able to indicate further concessions in the shape of our intention to provide exemption for those living in residential care accommodation, through the mechanism of leaving such premises in rating. I have given important assurances that account will be taken of the liability to meet the minimum contribution of 20 per cent. of rates, and in due course community charge, when we set income support levels for the most vulnerable groups in society.<lb/>
These are all important changes which, as I have said, represent major improvements to the Bill. As a result we can be confident that the Bill will achieve its objectives even more effectively. When the Bill came to us it contained the essential mechanisms to achieve the Government's overall objective of abolishing once and for all the discredited system of domestic rates, and replacing it with a new system which would provide vastly greater accountability between local authorities and their electorates. The changes we have made will facilitate this process. The Bill will be easier to understand and simpler to administer and there will be added protection for certain groups with claim to special treatment.<lb/>
Our discussions have also thrown into sharp relief the alternatives which have been canvassed by both the party opposite and the Alliance. I see no point in running over those once more. Suffice to say that while I have not felt able to agree with either of the main alternative suggestions or variations of them, both the noble Lords, Lord Ross of Marnock and Lord Mackie of Benshie (whom I am sorry to see is not in his place) have stuck to their guns in a powerful and good-humoured way. Indeed, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House for the constructive and good-humoured way in which it has been tackled.<lb/>
With my grateful thanks to all concerned in your Lordships' House and to those behind the scenes who have done much., and also to my noble friend Lord Dundee for his energetic support, I commend the Bill to the House. The Bill represents the only practicable package which anyone has on offer to deliver the radical changes which are needed in the financing of local government in Scotland. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02045"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, now that we are at the end of the very long road we have travelled since Second Reading, this is an appropriate time to say a few words to the Minister and to the House generally. Although I knew the Minister would he armed with statistics, I had not realised that we had debated for fully 60 hours. Also, it did not sound to
<col>474</col>
me, from the long catalogue the Minister gave us, that he had made so many concessions.<lb/>
All joking aside, I still cannot say that the Bill is anything other than a harsh Bill which was, I am sure, uncharacteristic of the natural attitudes of the Minister. We have all learnt a great deal from the Bill. We have learnt of the thankless task of the parliamentary draftsman, who could have done with a great deal more time to improve the Bill. The Minister said that the Bill was improved when it came to this House. However, one feels that with another six stages it would go on being improved&#x2014;not that noble Lords would wish to start at the beginning again.<lb/>
The information which the Minister had from the Box was timely and usually, at least from his point of view, satisfactory. Throughout this marathon of a Bill the Minister has been extremely good-tempered and has tried to be helpful. I believe he tried to be helpful within what could only be called an ideological straitjacket. I think that the Bill took the time it did not just because of the verbosity of the Scots but because of the analytical nature of the Scottish character. The analysis given to the Bill from all sides of the House will scare the daylights out of the English should a similar prospect ever be raised in England, and they are never likely to have the scheme there. The opposition will be very long and very strong. However, I think we have all learned a great deal about each other and we have, I hope, learned a great deal about local government and the work which is done there. I congratulate everyone on the genuine work that was put in during the course of the passage of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02046"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one or two intriguing features have emerged from the discussions which your Lordships have had over the past eight or nine days on this measure. One feature which strikes me&#x2014;I hope I am right in saying this and that I do no injustice&#x2014;is that in this House we have been more effective in achieving changes in the detailed provisions of the Bill than was the other place. I found that very intriguing, bearing in mind that this is an establishment which was once described by a little-known Labour Member of the other place as a somewhat quaint and archaic, ancient establishment. It was described by a rather better-known Liberal Member of Parliament and Minister as Mr. Balfour's poodle. Therefore I think we are advancing.<lb/>
I do not know why the Minister screws up his face at me. I thought he was encouraging us to be good humoured in the exchanges and in fact he said it twice. I confess that I find it extremely difficult to be good humoured about this Bill. It is a very bad Bill, it is a rather pathetic Bill and very largely an irrelevant one.<lb/>
The Government have been extremely lucky. I do not want to pursue these points because it would be ill-humoured, would it not? The Second Reading was on Budget day and, of course, no one took much notice. The media did not speak to the Bill about Scotland's rating system to any great extent when they had the Budget to think about. Here we are, having just completed the Third Reading, when we might have made significant attacks upon the principle of this, as I see it, wretched measure; but now I gather that there are other matters&#x2014;I have not heard it myself on the radio or read it in the press&#x2014;which will
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0246"/>
<col>475</col>
strike most people as having more significance than the abolition of the Scottish rating system; at least, that is what the Bill calls it&#x2014;the abolition of the Scottish rating system.<lb/>
I am certain of this: the Bill will be much discussed during the coming election campaign, certainly in Scotland. I imagine, from what I have heard, as awareness of its details become more and more known, that it will be widely discussed in England, too. I do not think the discussions will bring much encouragement to the Government because, as I say, I think it is a pathetic and irrelevant measure. It is pathetic not least because of the attempt to disguise this iniquitous poll tax under a respectable name. It is quite pathetic. The Minister can shake his head but we started out talking about this and we shall be talking about it a great deal in the constituencies throughout the country. It is pathetic, but pathetic above all in that it will contribute little to the solution of the many problems of local government finance.<lb/>
Having said that, it would be ungenerous not to express respect and admiration of the Minister's advocacy. Some people, of course, are cynical about the art of advocacy and describe it as the art of misleading people without actually telling lies. Subject to that, we were all immensely impressed by the ability with which he struggled, often in the face of much adversity, in presenting to your Lordships' House a Bill the passing of which we on these Benches very greatly regret. However, in accordance with constitutional tradition, we shall not vote against the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02048"><member>Lady Saltoun of Abernethy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I pay a very warm tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, for his unfailing patience and good humour in sometimes very difficult circumstances throughout the 10 lengthy Sittings we have had on this Bill. The Bill has been pushed through this House with haste, with one Sitting day between the Committee stage and the Report stage and only three Sitting days between Report stage and Third Reading. The Bill as amended on Report was not available until, I believe I am right in saying, this morning. This has made it very difficult for some of us to get our amendments drafted in time to give the Minister and his office adequate time to consider them.<lb/>
In spite of that he has managed to produce Government amendments to meet the very grave concerns of some Members of your Lordships' House. It is a pity that the very lengthy Committee stage in another place&#x2014;over 100 hours&#x2014;was not curtailed further to give us a chance to get our teeth into this Bill a little sooner and so to be able to consider it with less haste. Nevertheless, I think we have improved it greatly, as we do so many Bills. In fact, I am tolerably happy with it. All the same I think there may be teething troubles when the Bill is implemented and comes into force in 1989. I shall not be surprised if, in the future, we find ourselves debating the abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) (Amendment) Bill. However, that is as may be. If we do have such a Bill it will not be for the first time.<lb/>
<col>476</col>
I should like to say a word to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock. I enormously admire his tenacity. Having listened to most of his arguments several times they now have such familiarity that I could repeat them almost without the help of notes. I felt that I had heard one of his arguments somewhere before. He said that people came and people went but houses stayed put forever. Suddenly I remembered where I had heard it. It was Tennyson's lovely poem, <i>The Brook</i>, in which the delightful refrain is,
<quote>"Men may come and men may go, but I go on forever".</quote>
I am most grateful to the noble Lord for reminding me of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02049"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join in the tribute which the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, has paid to my noble friend Lord Glenarthur and I would add that he has shown great stamina and skill, because this is a very difficult Bill both in form and in substance. If ever an illustration were needed of the difficulty of legislation in itself in matters which appear to cover just the ordinary things of life, this Bill is a good example. As to the form of it, all I would say is that it is perhaps regrettable that we had to put into it so much which is largely of administrative direction. If we could leave those matters to Ministers to deal with instead of involving Parliament in the primary legislation, the legislation would be clearer and easier to follow.<lb/>
On the substance of the Bill, I should like to acknowledge what the Government have done to help the severely mentally handicapped. Where to draw the line is a difficult decision. Those of us who work with and for the mentally handicapped are anxious that they should lead as normal lives as possible. Many of them are in employment and would therefore wish to be treated like other working people. However, I think that the Government may have got this right Time will show.<lb/>
The other point of substance that I wish to make is on students. As I said at the Committee stage, I have grave doubts as to whether the enforceability of the provisions with regard to students will work. I am very glad that the Government have decided that students should pay only 20 per cent. of the charges. We shall have to watch the situation very carefully in order to see whether the difficulty of collection and enforcement is so great as to make it feasible to raise as little as 20 per cent. of the charge. In the long run we may find that it would be better to have a different arrangement.<lb/>
I say no more at present. I certainly hope that the Bill will work in practice. The Government have shown great courage in having introduced it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02050"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having sat through this Bill, perhaps I may briefly thank the Minister for the ready and positive response on the four issues with which I was concerned. They were the extension of the scope of Clause 8(7) to include the mentally handicapped; the question of the vulnerable groups which lack ability to pay under Clause 24, on which we had my noble friend's assurance; the special position of the students to which reference has just been made; and, lastly, the amendment to Clause 22 which includes the principles governing the schedules.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0247"/>
<col>477</col>
As this Bill passes, no trite acknowledgement would suffice to thank the Minister not only for his industry and stamina but for his remarkable sense of patience and good humour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02051"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should also like to add my thanks to the Minister. I spent 29 years of my life in local government. I know how difficult these matters are to alter. The Minister has led a real revolution in local government on the abolition of rates. It is the Government's policy, but it is very difficult. I consider that he has put forward a wonderful case and has been extremely patient.<lb/>
We in this House have done a great deal more than they did in the other place. We have discussed every detail. When they introduce the guillotine in the other place a lot of matters are never discussed. We must thank the Minister for the way in which he has handled the Bill. I hope that, although it is a very revolutionary measure, it will be a great success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02052"><member>Lord Gray</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having been so generously mentioned by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur, perhaps I should say a few words. I should like to associate myself with some of the remarks that have been made about the difficulties that will have to be faced in coping with the administrative tasks set by this Bill, as were mentioned by my noble friend Lord Renton. I am grateful for the concessions and the understanding that we have received from the Government, especially on rebates, to which my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway referred.<lb/>
The Government have grasped the nettle whose sting has long been feared and avoided. The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, has not infrequently reminded us of the history of the years that led to this Bill. It does not need me to remind him that this was perhaps presaged 280 years ago in Article 9 of the Act of Union.<lb/>
Having said that, I have probably detained your Lordships long enough. However, I should like to comment on drafting. I have several times criticised it. It is only fair to acknowledge that it is easier to pick holes in fabric than to create it. On some occasions, although not all, the draftsman of this Bill has deserved some sympathy. While the Bill was in the Commons a chunk which dealt with the transitional phase was removed. I readily acknowledge the care and attention which the points that I have raised have received from the Scottish Office team. I hope that the most significant errors in the Bill have been spotted by noble Lords. Although one may grudge the time spent on drafting amendments, when people wish to talk about points of principle it has to be remembered that if the drafting is wrong the principle may well be lost.<lb/>
Finally, I wish to compliment my noble friends on the Front Bench and in particular my noble friend Lord Glenarthur, on their remarkable stamina and to thank them for the courteous and helpful way in which they have dealt with the sometimes perhaps tiresome points that I have raised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02053"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to associate myself with all that has been said in
<col>478</col>
complimenting the Minister on his handling of this difficult and tiresome Bill. At the same time I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, and to Members of the Labour Party Front Bench in this House, how much the House is indebted to them for their contributions to the discussions that have taken place. Their experience in government&#x2014;and in local government in the case of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael&#x2014;has been extremely helpful to all of us in making this to a limited extent a more acceptable Bill.<lb/>
I must confess that when the announcement of the general election was made I hurried to listen to the television upstairs in the faint hope that this may be one of the Bills that would suffer as a result of the declaration of the election on 11th June. I regret to say that so far as I can gather&#x2014;and I am not anticipating a Statement that will be made later&#x2014;the news reader on television tonight indicated that this miserable Bill would survive the events of the next three weeks.<lb/>
Noble Lords have been looking back on their experience of local government. As a city councillor in Glasgow 50 years ago, the first thing that I did was to move a motion for the abolition of the local rating system. I never thought that that would be accomplished in my lifetime in this House. I deeply regret that it has been accomplished and replaced by a measure that is equally iniquitous. It is a divisive Bill. It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It is a "yuppie's charter". It provides that people in the South-East in large, valuable properties will pay the same as a man and women in a single end property in the city of Glasgow. That is a totally unacceptable principle. I hope that we shall hear a good deal more about that in the weeks ahead.<lb/>
The Bill is unfair, difficult to administer, expensive, centralised and divisive. On top of that, the people of Scotland do not want it; and it is being imposed on them. That will create its own tensions in relations between Scotland and the Westminster Government. We have made these speeches to no effect during the passage of the Bill. According to the conventions of the House, I shall not oppose it, but the Minister must not underestimate the depth of feeling in Scotland against this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02054">7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02055"><member>Lord Sanderson of Bowden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to say how grateful the House must be to the Minister for the way he has conducted this very difficult legislation through the House. His patience and competence are an example to all of us. If I may say so, as somebody who has not been in your Lordships' House for very long, I too now know what the phrase "vintage Ross" means. We are indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Ross, for pointing out in such an astringent way the difficulties of the Bill. When I go home, having listened to him, I begin to think "Am I right?" Then I looked back to 1981 and saw with some relief that he was as critical of the Bill for the sale of Scottish council houses as he has been over this measure, and my spirits then began to rise again.<lb/>
I should also like to say that the humour of the noble Lord, Lord Morton, was much appreciated by me, even though he wept crocodile tears over this Bill from beginning to end.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0248"/>
<col>479</col>
There is just one thing I should like to say about the Bill which relates to the business community. I know, as does the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, that the business community always likes a whole loaf, not half a loaf. The indications given to me by the business community in Scotland are that we are moving in the right direction. However, there is one area which the Government must not forget; that is, that harmonisation by the assessors in Scotland and the valuers in England of the law relating to the business rate must be tackled because if it is not we are certainly not doing what the electorate want us to do for the business community and industry north of the Border will certainly suffer.<lb/>
I have a feeling that when the Bill that affects England and Wales is presented we shall perhaps lose sight of this very important area for Scotland. Because of the exigencies of the timetable, we must not forget that we have to consider harmonisation north and south of the Border; otherwise we shall have let down the business community in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02056"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too must briefly pay tribute to my noble friends on the Front Bench, especially my noble friend Lord Glenarthur who has been extremely patient and able in his handling of a most complicated and lengthy procedure. It is the duty of oppositions to oppose, and those of us who are comparative newcomers to this House have watched opposition of a high quality being undertaken. I am not sure that we have had many new ideas from the other side, but we have had very good, very strong opposition which has been interesting to watch and beneficial to the Bill.<lb/>
The most important aspect about the Bill in my view is the effect it is likely to have on the public understanding of local government in Scotland. Having been a councillor for some years I very much regretted how many people did not really pay attention to what we were doing, did not advise us constructively about what we should be doing and very often opted out altogether from commenting either at meetings or at the ballot box on what we were doing. For many years I have longed for something to happen which would make it possible for people to play a greater part. Now with almost everybody contributing something&#x2014;albeit those least able to do so having account taken of what they have to pay through the benefit system&#x2014;I believe that there will be an eye kept more interestedly and more assiduously by far more people. I believe that will make it much more fun to be a councillor as well as much more enjoyable to take part in political debate in local government.<lb/>
I add to what my noble friend Lord Sanderson said about the acute need for the business rate to be dealt with. There is not only an acute need for domestic rates to be dealt with&#x2014;and we are all agreed about that&#x2014;but there is also a great need for enhanced interest by the public, and that, once the system comes into action and settles down, will take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02057"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are getting a bit nearer the end of that road. We leave a problem for the other House with the considerable number of amendments that we have made. I should have liked to list all those that were of great advantage. Some of
<col>480</col>
them are important, but on the whole the Bill is virtually the same as it was when it was sent to us such a short time ago.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, that it has been a terribly rushed job. The fact that we had such a short time between Second Reading and Committee, a shorter time between Committee and Report and an even shorter time between Report and Third Reading placed a very considerable strain on Members, not all of whom were taking a full part in the House. In fact, I heard more Scots speakers on Third Reading than I heard in any other part of the proceedings. I do not blame them for that because they were under orders that the Bill was more important than their speeches and that we had to get this through before the election. There was never a question of a May election because this Bill had to get through.<lb/>
The importance of the Bill has been lost by some people. I have heard people making great analyses of the election results last week in England and Wales. They came to certain conclusions about what majority the Government would have if the results were carried forward. However, there were no elections in Scotland. We already know that the Conservatives have only 22 out of 72 seats in Scotland. By the time you translated that majority for the other parties into what was given by these analysts, much of the majority had disappeared.<lb/>
The reason for the Bill was the hysteria that followed revaluation in Scotland. But the Government have not dealt with revaluation in it. The noble Lord, Lord Sanderson, is quite right. He hopes they will run the right way, but there is nothing here about commercial interests apart from the fact that after 1989 the increase will be limited to the retail price index. That may be high enough, but the anomalies that people spoke about on the commercial side in Scotland are still there and will remain there until such time as we have a Bill that deals with what the Government promised to do in this Session of Parliament&#x2014;to harmonise the systems of valuation in Scotland and England. That was the only pledge that was given&#x2014;not this Bill.<lb/>
The one aspect that was derided in every White Paper was a poll tax. Now we have one. No wonder the noble Lord has had a hard time. I do not know how thirled he was to the idea but I know that quite a number of noble Lords on that side of the House would not have had a poll tax on anything but would have preferred to be given a free choice. But poll tax it is; so after 1989 everyone over the age of 18 in Scotland, young or old, employed or unemployed, man or woman, every single one, dustman or Duke, simple and gentle, will have a poll tax. It will be the same for every person no matter what his station and stance is. His liability will be the same.<lb/>
We do not know about rebates. We cannot be told as it is not there. We were told in November that the Bill is the basic framework for the new community charge system.
<quote>"Before the community charge system is actually set up a great deal more work will need to be done. Regulations will have to be made completing the detail of the system"&#x2014;</quote>
we shall not know about it&#x2014;
<quote>"and dealing with the issues of the scheme of rebates to be introduced. They will be brought forward after discussions with
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0249"/>
<col>481</col>
local authorities &#x2026; six to nine months after enactment. Local authorities should then have rather more than a year to set up the new system".</quote>
That is discounting the fact that for the next six weeks nothing will be done because the people in charge are in charge of drawing up registration, sending out ballot papers, postal voting papers and the rest of it for the election.<lb/>
The Bill itself is monstrously unfair, and no one can say otherwise. The whole of history says that about a poll tax, the crudest and most primitive form of tax that could be devised. No wonder it is complicated. I read in the <i>Guardian</i> of 28th November 1986:
<quote>"I can't help being relieved that Scotland is to be the legislative pacemaker. The scheme will be much more complex and expensive to administer. Those who so much dislike the level of their current rates may find that a change could mean worse".</quote>
Those are the words of Mr. Timothy Raison, an English Tory MP.<lb/>
Sir George Young said:
<quote>"It may well make sense in Scotland where the party's vote hovers around 20 per cent. and where the new system will bring quick relief to the faithful. I am not so sure that politics in England are so clear cut".</quote>
This is why I have said time and again that I doubt whether this will ever be introduced into England, and that we in Scotland will be left high and dry with this embittering system. It will become the subject of politics. It will not last, like the rating system, for 150 years. We have to do something about the rates, but not this. That is what the Government themselves said until 1985. It is what the Tory Reform Group says today. It is certainly not fair and it is certainly not compassionate, and when you ignore the whole question of ability to pay you run into trouble.<lb/>
The Government may be satisfied for the moment. They may tell the faithful that the measure is on the statute book. But 80 per cent. of the people of Scotland do not want it and only 20 per cent. of the people of Scotland support the Tory Party. This will not save their necks in Scotland. It will be hanging around their necks.<lb/>
The noble Lord did a good job and I congratulate him on that. He never lost his temper although he must have been sorely tempted at times. He is more likely to lose his place than lose his temper, judging by the help he occasionally received from the Scottish Office. But the cavalry was there and it came. The noble Lord did a first-class job. I am sorry that it was on such a terrible Bill. Anyone who has anything to do with the making and passing of this Bill will rue it. The Scottish people will not forget.</membercontribution></p>

Several of your Lordships will be pleased to see this change in the Bill. During your Lordships' consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report I was urged by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, to accept an amendment to the Bill which would have removed completely the fire authority's discretion to grant an exemption without inspecting the premises for that purpose. I was not willing to accept the amendment as its effect would have been to require the fire authority to inspect in every case even though in some instances it might be fully acquainted with the premises as a result of an earlier inspection.<lb/>
The amendment introduced by the Government in another place in response to the strongly expressed concern of the Opposition limits the discretion of the fire authority to grant exemption without a further inspection to cases where it has already inspected the premises within the previous 12 months. This amendment will allow flexibility in the use of fire service resources and within reasonable limits. In practice, I expect that fire authorities will exercise their discretionary power to grant exemption without further inspection responsibly and in the light of their professional judgment.

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02071"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 2.<lb/>
This amendment was introduced by the Government on Report in another place in fulfilment of a commitment to consider a similar amendment tabled by the Opposition in Committee. The effect of the amendment is to extend the interim duty for an applicant for a fire certificate provided by Clause 8 of the Bill. That duty already requires the applicant to ensure that such means of escape with which the premises are provided can be safely and effectively used and that employees receive instruction or training in what to do in case of fire. This amendment provides that in addition any means for fighting fire with which the premises are provided must be maintained in efficient working order.<lb/>
In keeping with the requirement for the means of escape, the applicant is not required to make further provision pending disposal of the application. That is because it is not possible to make detailed specification of the equipment which would be needed in many premises without an inspection by a fire authority. Such an inspection takes place prior to the issue of a notice of steps to be taken.<lb/>
It would not be in the interests of reducing the time between application and certification if the fire authority was required to carry out some sort of interim inspection, having regard only to the means for fighting fire. Nevertheless, it is intended that the application form for a fire certificate will be revised to enable the fire authority to identify cases where the means for fighting fire might be seriously deficient. The fire authority would be able to give priority to such premises in deciding the order for dealing with applications. I commend the amendment to your Lordships.<lb/>

The Government remain of the view that the threshold of 500, recommended by Mr. Justice Popplewell, is the right one. It represents an attempt, in Mr. Justice Popplewell's words, "to balance the expense of inspection against a reasonable degree of safety." It is also fair to say that stands which hold less than 500 spectators are likely to be small so that the spectators who are under cover will be in close reach of an exit. Nevertheless, the Government were persuaded in another place that a power to lower the threshold by order would enable the Secretary of State to respond quickly were there ever to be concern about the safety of smaller stands.

<title>COMMONS AMENDMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02086"><b>5</b> Before Clause 45, insert the following new clause:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02087" align="center"><i>'Entertainment licences: removal of certain exemptions.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02088">The following premises, namely&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a) the Theatre Royal Haymarket, and</li>
<li>(b) the Royal Albert Hall,</li>
</ol>
shall cease to be exempt from the requirement for a public entertainment licence under paragraph 1 of Schedule 12 to the London Government Act 1963.'</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02089"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 5. In moving this amendment, I shall, with the leave of the House, speak to Amendments Nos. 5A, 6 and 6A. During consideration of this Bill in another place the Government's attention was drawn to an anomaly in respect of the Royal Albert Hall. Clause 42 of the Bill introduces new licensing requirements for indoor sports premises in London. The Royal Albert Hall is not to be exempted from licensing under Clause 42 and it will be subject to licensing controls for all indoor sports entertainments there to which the public are invited as spectators.<lb/>
Because of the exemption for the Albert Hall in the 1963 Act licensing code for music and dancing entertainments, however, the result is that a tennis tournament or boxing match at the hall will be subject to licensing requirements whereas the last night of the Proms, or any concert, will not. We accepted that this was not a situation we could justsify. The public expect premises of this kind to satisfy standards&#x2014;as I am sure the noble and learned Lord does as well&#x2014;on a musical occasion as much as on a sporting occasion. The Government agreed an amendment accordingly to correct the anomaly.<lb/>
The Royal Albert Hall is not the only premises exempt from the music and dancing licensing controls in the 1963 Act. The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the Royal Covent Garden Opera House, and the Theatre Royal, Haymarket are similarly excepted. With the best intentions in mind, the Government considered whether these exceptions should continue. In the case of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and Covent Garden, letters patent dating back to the 17th century effectively prevent the application of the entertainment licensing requirements and it would not have been practicable within the time constraints on this Bill, or within the consent signified by the Queen, to remove their exemption. No such constraints applied to the Theatre Royal, Haymarket and hence the Government included in their amendment the removal of its exempted status together with that of the Albert Hall.<lb/>
However, it appears that we may be in danger of creating a hybrid Bill. The Albert Hall stands in a class of its own. By singling out the Theatre Royal,
<col>486</col>
Haymarket, however and treating it differently from the other two theatres, we are now advised that the Bill is <i>prima facie</i> hybrid and that reference to the Examiners is likely to be required to determine whether the procedure relating to private business should apply to the Bill. Such a reference would place the entire Bill in jeopardy because of timing.<lb/>
Although the amendments were welcomed by the Opposition in another place, the sensible course is to remove, by the amendments in my name, the reference to the Theatre Royal in the Haymarket. If your Lordships agree to these, the Government will then be asking in effect only that your Lordships' House agree to an amendment in another place which removes the exempted status of the Albert Hall from the requirements contained in Schedule 12 to the London Government Act 1963.<lb/>
I can only offer my sincere apologies for this and for causing inconvenience to your Lordships in having to make these amendments. The amendments were carried in another place with the best will in the world to try to rectify an anomaly, and I am sorry that such a danger as a hybrid Bill has occurred at this late stage.<lb/>
I should add that so far as concerns the provisions of this Bill, the new licensing controls on indoor sports premises will apply to the Albert Hall and these theatres as they will apply to all other premises. The amendments in question relate to music and dancing and other entertainments of a like kind covered by the London Government Act 1963, and the Government will consider how best to remove the anomalies on a future occasion. In the meantime, the London Fire and Civil Defence Authority have assured us that the standard of fire precautions in these premises is satisfactory. I commend Amendment No. 5 to your Lordships.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02090"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is one example, if the Minister will forgive me for saying so of bad legislation as a result of too much rush. One really wonders whether questions of safety ought to be imperilled merely because a government are anxious to get legislation through in time to satisfy a general election date.<lb/>
It is not just a question of safety, it is equally a question of fairness. Whatever may have been discussed in the other place, I was not satisfied that it was right, again because of the need of expedition of legislation, that the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, was going to be put in a position different from the Royal Opera House and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, purely because of certain ancient statutes, exemptions and regulations dating back a few centuries, which would have made a certain procedure necessary in order to catch those two theatres. That is not operable now that we are trying to expedite this legislation.<lb/>
I acknowledge the courteous way in which the Minister addressed the House on this subject and apologised. I say this with great deference, but really when we hustle things through presumably we miss the advice that ought to be given, after proper consideration, that questions of a hybrid Bill arise.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0252"/>
<col>487</col>
This is not very satisfactory. There is no point in my asking the House to vote against the noble Earl's amendment.<lb/>
The noble Earl says that he understands from the fire authorities that things are all right at Drury Lane and at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, from a fire point of view, but I most certainly ask him from this Dispatch Box on behalf of the Benches I represent to do more than that. It is to ask the fire authorities, because of this exemption that they are granted, to see that all these places are very carefully watched indeed. I believe that we owe that to the public, and I hope that the Minister will concede this.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Financial Services Act 1986 (Delegation) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02104">7.37 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02105"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Lucas of Chilworth)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 27th April be approved. [<i>19th Report from the Joint Committee.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02106">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft order before the House tonight represents the single most important step towards implementation of the Financial Services Act, upon which we spent so many hours last year. Your Lordships will recognise that the same draft order was debated only a few days ago in another place: I hope therefore that I may be forgiven if some of my remarks have a familiar and possibly repetitive ring.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02107">The Financial Services Act embodies our belief that in order to achieve effective regulation of the financial services sector it is necessary to combine two elements. The first is strong statutory backing for the regulatory system. The Act will make it a criminal offence to carry on investment business without authorisation. It will also impose strict rules on the way in which authorised persons carry on investment business and will provide legal sanctions&#x2014;including civil suits, injunctions, restitution orders and withdrawal of authorisation&#x2014;if those rules are broken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02108">The second element is practitioner-based administration of these statutory powers. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, may have something to say about this matter. As always, I shall listen with interest if he so decides. However, the Government believe that, if they are given the right powers, practitioner-based bodies have the best prospects of effectively regulating investment businesses and protecting the interests of investors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02109">Accordingly, the Act has, from its introduction, provided for the majority of powers it confers on the Secretary of State to be transferred to a designated agency whose governing body would include both practitioners in the financial services sector and non-practitioners who have the knowledge and expertise to ensure that investors' interests are being properly looked after.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02110">The Act lays down a number of criteria which must appear to the Secretary of State to be satisfied before powers can be transferred to a designated agency. The agency must be able and willing to exercise the powers which are to be transferred. It must have a balanced governing body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State and the Governor of the Bank of England. It must have satisfactory monitoring, enforcement and decision-makng arrangements. It must have effective arrangements for the investigation of complaints, which must provide in appropriate cases for the investigation to be carried out independently. It must be able and willing to promote high standards in the conduct of investment business and to co-operate with other financial regulators.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02111">The Act also recognises the special position of the Securities and Investments Board. This was established for the purpose of applying to have
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0253"/>
<col>489</col>
functions under the Act transferred to it. So long as the board satisfies the conditions in the Act, it must be the first body to which powers are transferred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02112">Turning specifically to the draft order, Articles 1 and 2 are concerned with citation, commencement and interpretation. Articles 3 to 8 transfer to SIB nearly all of the powers which are capable of being transferred. Schedule 2 specifies the powers which will be exercisable by the Secretary of State concurrently with the designated agency, while Schedule 3 specifies the offences with respect to which the power to prosecute is transferred to the agency. I shall return in a moment to the limited range of powers which are not transferred. But those which are transferred represent a considerable range of powers which will establish SIB as the keystone in the new regulatory framework. SIB will have the ultimate responsibility for establishing the standards which firms will have to meet in order to be regarded as fit and proper to carry on investment business. This will result both from SIB's power to grant direct authorisation to businesses and from its function of recognising self-regulating organisations and professional bodies, membership of which will confer authorisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02113">SIB will also draw up the rules and regulations which will set the standards of behaviour for investment businesses. In some cases this will be because SIB's own rules are directly applicable. In other cases, the rules of recognised self-regulating organisations and professional bodies will apply: but those rules will have to afford protection to investors at least equivalent to that afforded by SIB's rule book. Finally, SIB will be responsible for enforcement, having at its disposal a wide range of investigation powers and sanctions, including the power to initiate prosecutions for some offences.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02114">Article 3 of the draft order, in conjuction with Schedule 1, provides that there are a certain number of transferable powers not covered by this order. The most significant are the powers in Chapter VIII of the Act relating to collective investment schemes. These represent a largely self-contained area which can be dealt with independently of the recognition of SROs and RPBs and the authorisation of businesses which must begin as soon as possible if the basic framework of the Act is to be introduced at an early date.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02115">Schedule 1 also reserves to the Secretary of State miscellaneous other powers. These are: various powers related to international questions; the power to make indeminity rules where SIB have decided to rely instead on a widely drawn compensation scheme; certain powers relating to persons who are not authorised; and the function of revoking recognition of an SRO on certain grounds related to insurance, since my Department remains primarily responsible for the regulation of insurance companies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02116">The preamble to the draft order concerns the requirements which must be satisfied before powers are transferred. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has satisfied himself, as required by the Act, that SIB meets the criteria to which I have already referred. He has also satisfied himself that the rules and regulations which he proposes to make afford an adequate level of protection for investors
<col>490</col>
and, where appropriate, comply with the principles set out in Schedule 8 to the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02117">My right honourable friend is also required to satisfy himself as to the acceptability of the rules in competition terms. On 10th February we received the SIB's formal request for transfer of powers, together with its proposed rules and regulations entitled <i>Regulation of Investment Business</i> and a document entitled <i>SIB's Approach to its Regulatory Responsibilities.</i> Copies of both have been made available in the Printed Paper Office. We subsequently received reports on these documents from the Director General of Fair Trading and further amendments proposed by the SIB, on which the director general has also reported. Copies of all these documents have been placed in the Library. We have also received a large number of comments both from representative bodies and individual practitioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02118">Having considered all the material submitted, we have concluded that the SIB and the rules it proposes to make fulfil the conditions and requirements laid down in the Act for a transfer of the powers referred to in the draft orders.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02119">Your Lordships will recognise that the SIB's rule book covers a large range of topics. I propose to refer specifically to the two issues which provoked considerably more comments than any others both in the director general's report and in the comments made by interested parties. These were essentially related to the costs to small independent insurance intermediaries of complying with the new requirements and the issue which came to be known as "polarisation".</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02120">It would be pointless to pretend that improvements in investor protection can be achieved without cost and without placing some new requirements on firms. To mention just two of the characteristics of the new system, regular monitoring arrangements and an adequate compensation scheme are bound to cost money. Having said that, I should also say that we think some of the estimates of compliance costs which have been canvassed have been considerably overestimated. Some estimates, for example, have assumed elaborate new compliance procedures whereas, in fact, many of the SIB requirements reflect current "best practice" and will require little, if any, change in practice in reputable businesses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02121">Furthermore, the SIB has made considerable efforts to keep costs at an acceptable level. Indeed, in March amendments to the rule book were proposed which were designed to reduce the costs of compliance for small investment businesses which do not handle clients' money. Having considered all the evidence, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State is satisfied, as required under the Act, that the SIB's proposals will not significantly restrict, distort or prevent competition on this account.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02122">The polarisation debate has in some ways been the other side of the coin, in the sense that many of those most worried about the costs which they believed the SIB's rules implied were equally strong in their support of the polarisation rules. Most noble Lords will be aware that polarisation is the requirement that all those who sell life assurance and unit trusts should act either as fully independent intermediaries or as
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0254"/>
<col>491</col>
company representatives, selling only the product of a single company or group. The SIB has argued, and we accept the argument, that this is an important safeguard for investors. Some have argued that it will have an anti-competitive effect. We take the contrary view. Summarising, I would say that polarisation will clarify the status of investment advisers and will therefore promote transparency in the market. It will therefore enhance rather than restrict competition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02123">The Director General of Fair Trading did not find the polarisation rules, on their own, anti-competitive: indeed, he, like us, considered them in isolation to be pro-competitive. But he was concerned about the implications of polarisation when combined with the costs of compliance for small intermediaries. This concern arose from the director general's assessment that the number of independent intermediaries would be significantly reduced; that the rules would lead to a reduction in independent advice from banks and building societies; and that the overall result was therefore likely to be an increase in the influence of company representatives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02124">We have considered the director general's arguments most carefully but we cannot accept his conclusions. First, as I have said, we do not believe that the costs of compliance will be as high as some have suggested. Moreover, polarisation will ensure that the independence of genuinely independent advisers is perceived as a real advantage. So we believe that there will continue to be a very substantial body of independent intermediaries, and that the polarisation rules will work to their advantage. Secondly, we believe that the banks and building societies will be able to adjust to the new regime without radical change, and that the availability of independent advice from these sources will not be significantly reduced. For these reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the rules will not have a significantly anti-competitive effect. Before I leave the order, I should say that Articles 9&#x2013;11 make various necessary and supplementary provisions as provided for in Section 118(2) of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02125">In seeking approval for this draft order, we are therefore recommending transfer of powers to the SIB on the basis of the rules it has submitted, as modified by amendments it has proposed during the course of our consideration. That is the outline of the major of the three orders that I wish to put before your Lordships this evening. I would be quite happy to respond to any point or question noble Lords may wish to put. Meanwhile, I beg to move approval of the draft order before the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02126">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 27th April be approved. [<i>19th Report from the Joint Committee</i>.]&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02127">7.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02128"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for presenting the delegation order in the way that he has, and with his customary clarity. The House will also wish to congratulate the Securities and Investments Board for producing a set of rules of extreme complexity and great detail in the time that has been available to it.<lb/>
<col>492</col>
We, on this side of the House, welcome the order in general. We believe in the principle of statutory control of financial services. We believe also that the Financial Services Act, although defective in a number of respects, goes quite a long way towards achieving this type of control.<lb/>
Having said that, there are some comments I should like to make and some questions I wish to ask the noble Lord in respect of the order, the accompanying SIB rules and the document which the SIB has produced, entitled <i>The SIB's Approach to its Regulatory Responsibilities.</i> which will be regarded, I think, as a plain man's guide.<lb/>
The point about the order which I wish to make first is that we are doubtful whether the Secretary of State has the powers under the Act to make an order along the lines of Article 9 of the order. Article 9 refers to the keeping of a register and, as I am sure the Minister will recognise, it is of extreme importance because on this register there will be not only bodies of a corporate nature but persons who for one reason or another may have been disqualified from engaging in investment business. The Act is quite clear on the subject. It says quite simply that the Secretary of State is required to keep a register under Section 102(1) (<i>e</i>) of those for whom a disqualification notice is in force. On the other hand, the order states that:
<quote>"Section 102 of the Act shall have effect as if it did not require the designated agency to keep a register containing an entry in respect of &#x2026; in respect of whom a direction &#x2026; is in force, but required it instead to keep a register &#x2026; in respect of each body or person who appears to it to be a body or person of the kind described above".</quote>
In other words, in our view the function of keeping a register will be changed by the order from the function of keeping a register of a matter of fact to keeping a register of what is a matter of belief.<lb/>
The Minister and I have had correspondence on this subject. As he said, he has indicated that the Government believe that Section 118 of the Act justifies Article 9 of the order. For my part I have consulted not only noble friends who have greater legal experience than I but also noble and learned Lords both on these Benches and on the Cross-Benches who believe that this is a change of function. In the view of my noble friends and that of my noble and learned friends and other noble and learned Lords, Section 118(2) does not allow the Secretary of State to change function.<lb/>
It is of extreme importance of course because if it becomes a matter of belief that the Securities and Investments Board keeps a register of those for whom it appears to it to be such that a notice might be or has been or appears to have been issued, given that Lloyds is an exempted person under the Act&#x2014;a decision against which we on this side fought and which we still regret&#x2014;and given that paragraph 6 Schedule 1 of the order excludes Lloyds, there could easily be a situation in which the Secretary of State decides to issue such a disqualification notice against somebody employed in Lloyds or who might have been employed in Lloyds or might have been able to do investment business in Lloyds, without informing the SIB. The SIB has to guess whether such a notice has been given or whether it appears to it to have been given. The same is true of other exempted persons under the Act such as the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0255"/>
<col>493</col>
banks, which are listed institutions under the Act. It is therefore not a minor matter.<lb/>
I have to put on record that it seems to us that the Secretary of State does not have the <i>vires</i> to promulgate Article 9 of the order. Incidentally, we also believe that the Secretary of State has limited <i>vires</i> to promulgate Article 10 of the order, but that is a relatively unimportant question and we do not challenge that.<lb/>
I am doing no more than putting the Minister and the Government on notice that we have certain considered views and opinions on this matter. We shall not challenge the order and divide the House against it because we wish this order to go forward, but we believe that this is a subject that has received the intense legal advice, if I may put it that way, that Article 9 of the order contravenes the <i>vires</i> of the Secretary of State under the Act.<lb/>
Turning to the order itself, we welcome it. Clearly it is the follow-up to the passage of the Act and it would he absurd, having supported the general thrust of the Bill as it went through your Lordships' House, if we now said that we did not support the order. Clearly we want this order to go through. Nevertheless a number of questions arise other than on the point about <i>vires</i> that I have just made which I should like to put to the Minister.<lb/>
The first question refers to the recognition of self-regulating organisations which will be transferred, if this Motion is approved, to the Securities and Investments Board, which will have the job of deciding whether or not an SRO is capable of fulfilling its functions. I ask the Minister: what happens if the SIB decides that, having made an application, a particular SRO does not fulfil the statutory regulations, rules or position under the Act and that people who would otherwise normally conduct investment buisinesses recognised by that SRO are left somewhat hanging in the air? What is the position then? Does the Securities and Investments Board form its own organisation? Does it intervene? What are the actual and practical steps that need to be taken?<lb/>
Secondly, as regards self-regulating organisations, when we discussed the Bill in your Lordships' House and after it became an Act, it was my understanding that it was obligatory for SROs to have effective arrangements for the investigation of complaints from members of the public against itself or its members. At page 39 of the <i>SIB's Approach To Its Regulatory Responsibilities</i> I read:
<quote>"SIB will need to be satisfied that an SRO has effective arrangements for the investigation of complaints".</quote>
Does that mean that there is an element of judgment involved for the SIB or that the SIB is simply saying that the SROs must have it and that is the end of the story? The way in which that paragraph reads, mentioning the need for satisfaction, implies a certain judgment.<lb/>
My last question about self-regulatory organisations is: am I right in my understanding that the rules for application for authorisation under an SRO are as stringent as the rules set out in the very heavy tome produced by the SIB for direct authorisation from the
<col>494</col>
SIB? I believe I am right in my understanding but I very much hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy me on that point.<lb/>
I turn now to the rules themselves. I confess to the Minister that I am unclear about the status of practice notes in the SIB rules. I understand practice notes in the context of the takeover code. It has been quite an established mechanism for interpreting a non-statutory code to issue practice notes stating: "This is a non-statutory code and we interpret it in this way but of course if you interpret it in some different manner you are not offending against any statute". Nevertheless, in this case the SIB rules are statute&#x2014;the law of the land&#x2014;so when practice notes come in the SIB rules they take on a slightly different characteristic. For example, the practice note on page 2.7 of the rule book says:
<quote>"No form is prescribed for the accounting records of a firm which a firm is required to keep under rule 5. The Board offers in the Appendices to these rules guidance as to how a firm's records might be maintained. This is guidance only and a firm should not follow this guidance if to do so would prevent the firm from complying with the requirements of rule 5.".</quote>
So the practice note is saying, "Don't bother about what we are putting in the appendix if by bothering about what we put in the appendix you don't have to follow rule 5". It seems a rather curious sort of practice note.<lb/>
Turning now to the conduct of business rules, because I do not wish to detain your Lordships for very long, are we really satisfied that they are comprehensible? Are they understandable to the man in the street or the person who has to operate them in whatever professional capacity he may find himself? At page 3.25 there is a paragraph in the rules on "Excessive charging, 'churning' and 'twisting'." The paragraph goes on:
<quote>"(1) A firm shall not charge unfairly or unreasonably for the services it provides.</quote>
<quote>"(2) a firm shall not effect transactions with or for a customer for whom the firm exercises discretion as to how the customer's funds are invested with unnecessary frequency or in excessive size and a firm shall not make recommendations to any customer which are likely to lead to transactions being effected by the firm or an associate of the firm with or for him with unnecessary frequency or in excessive size".</quote>
Are these concepts really comprehensible to the man in the street?<lb/>
The worry becomes slightly more intense if we turn to the unsolicited calls section of the SIB rules. Having read through these rules, I hope in some detail, I find it very difficult to see how anybody can understand whether they are in receipt of an unsolicited call or not. Do these rules cover direct mail approach? Is that an unsolicited call? We do not know. Section 56 of the Financial Services Act specifies what an unsolicited call is in the primary legislation, but it is a slightly confused expression. Section 56(8) reads:
<quote>"In this section 'unsolicited call' means a personal visit or oral communication made without express invitation".</quote>
Does this cover people who may come back and want to change the subject? An insurance salesman who wishes to sell a life insurance policy may come back and say, "Well, now I have decided you would be better off doing something else, engaging in some other form of investment business". Is that covered by the SIB rules, other than persons who actually visit the office, which I understood was covered by the SIB
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0256"/>
<col>495</col>
rules? How are we to persuade the public at large that they understand what their rights are?<lb/>
There is a practice not on clients' money at page 6.17 of the SIB rules. I am very doubtful whether this practice note means anything:
<quote>"The Board offers in the Appendix to these regulations guidance as to how a firm's accounting records might be maintained in order to achieve the necessary segregation of clients' settlement money. This is guidance only and does not form part of the regulations".</quote>
If it does not form part of the regulations, how is the client's settlement money to be properly segregated unless the SIB gives proper guidance on the subject?<lb/>
I have picked on a few elements of detail in the rules. I hope the noble Lord will forgive me if I have gone into some detail because I think they are important rules, and the order itself is important. I would simply conclude by saying that it is perfectly clear that these rules can change. According to the Act the rules can be changed quite simply by the Securities and Investments Board informing the Secretary of State that it has decided to change the rules. As far as I can see, under the Act the Secretary of State has to do no more than say, "There is no reason for me to intervene unless the Securities and Investments Board or other designated agency contravenes its own rules under the Act". We have to see how these initial rules&#x2014;because that is what I take them to be&#x2014;work out in practice, and Parliament will not be advised, as we have been advised at the moment, what rules the SIB are actually implementing. The Secretary of State will be informed.<lb/>
It would have been much easier and we should have avoided all these complications&#x2014;we should have avoided the complications of the exemption of Lloyd's members and all this process of trying to find out the status of rules issued by a board which, after all, is still a company limited by guarantee&#x2014;if the Government had quite simply accepted our point that this should be a statutory body, a statutory commission under the law.<lb/>
Having said that, I repeat that we welcome this order. We very much hope that it will fulfil the function that it sets out to fulfil. We believe it is extremely complicated in detail, and we very much hope that as we go forward we shall have amendments. We would very much like Parliament, who after all set the legislation and set the order in place, to be consulted from time to time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02130"><member>Lord Tryon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I start by apologising to the Minister for not having been in my place when he stood up. I think I was not more than 30 seconds behind him, and I hope that I did not miss anything vital. I see the Minister shaking his head.<lb/>
I shall not particularly surprise the Minister or other noble Lords who have followed the rather tortuous progress of the Financial Services Bill if I do not give a warm welcome to this order or to the draft rules proposed by the SIB. I have never been against the principle of regulation in this area, although at various stages I think the Minister accused me of being slightly grudging in my approval. However, at the beginning I sensed an element of overkill, although during the course of the Bill some of the doubts which I had were
<col>496</col>
removed. Throughout the process I was very anxious to see a relatively simple system of regulation with certain principles clearly laid down, followed by thorough supervision and fierce enforcement.<lb/>
I have been worried throughout the process that, in an attempt to weed out the few bad apples and practices, we should make whole parts of the City unworkable with over-complicated rules&#x2014;unworkable, that is, for the vast majority in the City who are decent, honest people. Those of us who urged caution were not greatly helped by various events last year. There were one or two disgraceful incidents. I must stress, however, that, in my view, these were isolated cases and I believe that already, in the City, there is a strong, deep determination that there should not be any repetition of some of these events. One senses this in conversations with people all the time.<lb/>
That said, we now have the great rule book from the SIB but, as I anticipated in my remarks during the later stages of the Bill, it is highly legalistic and very cumbersome. No doubt the Minister will tell me that these are very complex matters that require complex rules, and that the SIB&#x2014;as I quite appreciate&#x2014;has to set a standard and an example to the SROs who are still going about their rule-making activities. But it seems to me to go into such minutiae as to be confusing. I had various examples that I was going to produce, but the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, has done that for me. He produced three or four examples of extremely tortuous parts of the rule book.<lb/>
One important point I should like to make&#x2014;the Minister touched on it in his opening remarks&#x2014;is that of timing. The noble Lord gave the impression that this process must be completed with all haste. Those were not his words, and I paraphrase. But I had the impression that he felt that this should now be pushed on with very quickly. I would urge the Government, having got this far, not to press too tight a timetable upon the SIB or anybody else. With the passing of this order, everyone can claim that Parliament has done its stuff on the Financial Services Act, but I cannot see the whole scheme up and running before some time like next January.<lb/>
A lot of work remains to be done. There are still some rules to come from the SIB, including, for example, important ones on collective investment schemes which appear to be missing from the order as I read it. I believe there are also significant discussions going on, and in some cases disagreements, involving the DTI, the Bank of England, the SIB, the various SROs and potential members of SROs on quite a number of important matters.<lb/>
These are such matters as the segregation of capital, the scope of SROs, where their various activities overlap, the rules of the SROs themselves and a whole mass of matters dealing with complaints and compensation. There is still quite a lot of work to be done and if the whole machinery has to be got right&#x2014;and clearly it has&#x2014;no one should be made to rush this final fence. Having got this far, there must still be some remaining points to be got right. Perhaps the Minister can give me some reassurance on the final timing and his thoughts on the matter.<lb/>
I wish to make one last detailed point as a marker for the future. It is a point which did not, I think, arise
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0257"/>
<col>497</col>
during the various stages of the Bill but which is now becoming clearer from the rules. It concerns the independent intermediaries. It is a title which suggests expertise covering the full range of financial products, but this is something that most of them will not be competent to provide. I should have liked to see investors warned of the limitation of the scope of intermediaries' individual skills in this field. The commercial reality is that the advice of many of these financial intermediaries will be heavily commission-driven.<lb/>
To give an example, unit trusts will tend to be recommended instead of investment trusts, due to the far larger commissions paid. Without going into commercial and investment trusts, which I have done once or twice before, declaring my interest as a director of several of them, I have run unit trusts and I believe investment trusts to be superior. But will investors be given the choice? I very much doubt that they will, and I think that at some stage we ought to think about some form of wealth warning on literature put out by the so-called independent intermediaries stating that they are capable of advising only on certain forms of investment, not on all forms, and that investors will not have certain forms of investment brought to their attention.<lb/>
Finally, despite being critical of these rules, it would be churlish of me not to pay tribute to the tremendously hard work that has gone into them at the DTI and at the SIB. I can only conclude by lamenting the necessity of it all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02131">8.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02132"><member>Lord Bruce-Gardyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend for the clarity of his explanation of the order, although I am bound to admit that to some extent I share the anxieties which the noble Lord, Lord Tryon, has expressed about the dangers of overkill, and the anxieties which both the noble Lord and the noble Lord, Lord Williams, expressed about the complexity of a number of aspects of the order.<lb/>
I am afraid that I want to return to the weary old subject of polarisation. As before, I must start by declaring my interest as a director of the TSB which is very much a material party to this argument. My noble friend explained very fairly and summarised the reasons why the Director General of Fair Trading had concluded that the polarisation provisions amounted to a substantial derogation from the principles of competition policy and the reasons which led the Government to reject his criticisms of this aspect of the rule book.<lb/>
I am bound to say I do not know that my noble friend had all that much choice in the matter, since Sir Kenneth Berrill in his wisdom, had made it absolutely clear that unless the rule book in this particular, perhaps more than any other particular, was carried through as he recommended, he would feel that his position and that of his board was no longer tenable. Particularly in view of the limitations of the Government's ability to amend the terms of the rule hook in advance of the passage of this order, I can quite understand that their freedom of manoeuvre was very restricted.<lb/>
<col>498</col>
However, I have to say that there has been a substantial further complication since the Director General of Fair Trading expressed his opinion, to which my noble friend referred. I say in parenthesis that the refutation by my noble friend of Sir Gordon Borrie's criticisms rested essentially on the rebuttal of Sir Gordon Borrie's warning that the complexities and the costs of regulation would lead rapidly to a vast diminution in the number of independent intermediaries applying for business. My noble friend argued that that would not be the case. However, I must ask him: should Sir Gordon Borrie's anxieties on this score be borne out, what remedial action could the Government envisage?<lb/>
If indeed Sir Gordon Borrie's anxieties on that count turned out to be borne out in the event, would it be possible for the Government to reconsider the polarisation rules in the light of that experience? However, the more substantial point I am concerned about is the fact that, as my noble friend will be aware, the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers has taken counsel's opinion and has been advised by counsel that in the light of the report by the Director General of Fair Trading there must be a considerable possibility, if not probability, that the rules regarding polarisation could be deemed to be in conflict with the rules of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.<lb/>
That is a serious proposition because it means that those who are affected by the polarisation rules&#x2014;here I refer to branches of the clearing banks and to building societies' branches&#x2014;face or could face a Catch 22 situation after we have approved the order. If they make their practices conform to the SIB's rulebook in respect of polarisation&#x2014;in other words, if they decide, as some will (the TSB, for example) that they wish to go down what I call the in-house route, and others, perhaps the bank of which my noble friend Lord Boardman is chairman, decide that they wish to follow the alternative route of acting as independent intermediaries no longer selling in-house products&#x2014;they will find themselves, according to counsel's opinion, liable to be arraigned before the European Court.<lb/>
If, on the other hand, they desist from observing the polarisation rule, they may be safe before the European Commission and the European Court but they would presumably be liable to be arraigned by the SIB. That is an impossible situation and one which leaves the clearing banks and the building societies in a complete quandary.<lb/>
Of course the matter has been raised with the Department of Trade and Industry. The department wrote to the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers on 16th April to assure it that the SIB had ensured,
<quote>"that the Commission is aware of its proposals and timetable."</quote>
However, awareness is one thing: agreement is something quite different. The department concluded its letter by stating:
<quote>"When the Secretary of State is considering the implementation date of Section 3 of the Act, we recognise that he will need to pay careful attention to the position under EEC competition law, including any uncertainty which might then remain."</quote>
Unfortunately that does not carry us very far. The position remains that the clearing banks have received counsel's opinion that if they conform to the require
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0258"/>
<col>499</col>
ments of the rulebook in the area of polarisation it is very likely that they could be challenged before the court. That is counsel's opinion. Counsel may be wrong, but that is the opinion they have received. Obviously if they hold their hands and refuse to go along with the polarisation requirements of the rulebook they could presumably be in trouble with the SIB. They must know where they stand. As I see it, this is the last opportunity that we have to learn from the Government where that is.<lb/>
I hope that my noble friend will be able to give us a clearer explanation of precisely where the clearing banks and building societies in particular stand in relation to polarisation in the light of the obligations which they face under Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.<lb/>
Suggestions have been offered to the Department of Trade and Industry. It has been suggested that the full activation of the obligations should be delayed until it is ascertained whether or not the Commission is prepared to make a derogation or to say that Article 5 will not apply in those circumstances.<lb/>
However, we need to know how the Government will handle that. I must appeal to my noble friend tonight to give us a clear answer on that because otherwise the position of those affected by the polarisation regulations is wellnigh impossible and will remain so.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Financial Services Act 1986 (Delegation) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02139">8.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02140">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02141"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps we can now return to our discussion on the delegation order. I should like to begin by apologising to the House for the fact that my name did not appear on the list of speakers. However, it is not normal to have a list of speakers for an order and I was unaware that one was being compiled.<lb/>
I should like to join in the thanks which have been given to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, for his explanation of the order. Certainly the passing of the delegation order will inaugurate a new era. I am sure that all of us in this House agree on the importance of investor protection. Once the new regime is in force, anyone approaching an independent financial intermediary should at least have the assurance that he is a genuinely independent intermediary and the confidence that he is financially sound. The problem has been to achieve that without inflicting on intermediaries and on providers of investment products a regime that is expensive, parasitical and bureaucratic. It remains to be seen whether or not the Government have been successful in that.<lb/>
I must declare an interest in that I am a registered insurance broker and a director of a firm of registered insurance brokers specialising in life assurance and pensions. When we debated these issues before, I expressed fears in particular about the expense and the administrative burden likely to be placed on smaller intermediaries dealing in life assurance and pensions, and about the possibility that many of them might be forced out of business. As we have heard earlier in this debate, Sir Gordon Borrie, the Director General of Fair Trading, had similar fears. He feared that the number of independent intermediaries might be reduced to between 6,000 and 7,000. It is not entirely clear exactly how many such intermediaries there are in operation at the moment. However, research would suggest that the figure is about 20,000. If the numbers were reduced from 20,000 to between 6,000 and 7,000, that would be a severe reduction indeed.<lb/>
As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, there have been some relaxations of the rules since those earlier prognostications. We have learnt, for example, that there will be lower fees for those who do not actually handle clients' money. As I say, there have been other relaxations and it is now estimated that some 12,000 intermediaries will in fact remain independent. That is certainly a better outcome and it will leave a reasonable network of such intermediaries throughout the country. However, I believe that there is still cause for concern about the impact of expense. I hope that those who take the independent route will not be impelled to indulge in unnecessary and time-consuming paperwork.<lb/>
<col>502</col>
A letter which recently appeared in <i>Money Marketing</i> of 23rd April, from a Mr. H. N. Piper in Oxfordshire, is relevant in that connection. He said:
<quote>"In the SIB guide to compliance obligations it states that 'Customer agreements are not needed where the services to the customer relate only to advice on life policies or unit trusts' ".</quote>
Mr. Piper continues:
<quote>"The SIB statement was pointed out to the compliance officer of Fimbra".</quote>
I should perhaps say that FIMBRA is the relevant SRO. Mr Piper continues:
<quote>"I have today received a letter from him saying that if I do not produce customer agreements he will refer me to the Fimbra complaints committee".</quote>
Mr. Piper then comments:
<quote>"What is the use of SIB claiming that the cost of compliance is minimal, when the SRO in question takes no notice of the SIB guide and imposes harsher conditions?"</quote>
Mr. Piper concludes:
<quote>"This whole bureaucratic nonsense would be a great laugh if it were not for the fact that our livelihoods are being played with by people who never appear to have understood our business and now do not appear to understand their own".</quote>
I have read that letter because I believe that the reaction is typical of the reaction of many intermediaries who are not opposed to the principle of regulation to the regime which is being imposed upon them. I am certain that there must be very careful monitoring by Parliament to check the costs of the SIB and the SROs, to check any empire-building tendencies in the SIB and the SROs and to check the growth of bureaucracy and of bureaucratic practice in the SIB and the SROs.<lb/>
I should like to say something which may appear to be at odds with what I have already said about expense. I regret that the SIB is not imposing an obligation on those who apply to be authorised to have professional indemnity assurance. It is possible that in the light of that, FIMBRA, which is the SRO dealing with insurance intermediaries, will give up its condition that those applying should have professional indemnity assurance.<lb/>
The Insurance Brokers Registration Council, on the other hand, does have such a condition and the minimum sum assured is &#x00A3;250,000. It is true that under the new regime there is to be a compensation scheme where the maximum payment is &#x00A3;48,000. However, that is only made where the intermediary is already insolvent. It does not deal with the position of claims against intermediaries which are still trading.<lb/>
I realise that the absence of such a condition reduces the costs. But I would rather that intermediaries paid for professional indemnity assurance and paid less for the upkeep of SIB, FIMBRA and all the rest. It seems to me that the Insurance Brokers Registration Council is in a very unsatisfactory position. As one of those who helped to secure the passage through this House of the Bill which eventually led to the establishment of the council, I regret that. It is purely voluntary to be registered under the Insurance Brokers Registration Council and many intermediaries in the life assurance and pension world will be wondering whether, with authorisation, there is any point in remaining registered under the council. I cannot understand why the Government did not make the condition of registration under the council such that the conditions
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0260"/>
<col>503</col>
would qualify an applicant for membership of FIMBRA. Why should registered brokers specialising in life assurance and pensions have to register twice, comply with two different sets of criteria and pay two lots of fees if they wish to retain the title of registered broker? That situation seems crazy to me.<lb/>
Turning to the question of polarisation, last time we discussed the matter I said that I supported the principle that all intermediaries should have to choose between being independent or being company representatives. I expressed the view that if that principle were to be applied, it should be applied across the board to banks and building societies as well. I am glad that the SIB proposals have been upheld by the Secretary of State.<lb/>
I understand that building societies are pressing to act as providers of their own personal pensions, at the same time as acting as independent intermediaries selling life assurance. That would seem to be a breach of the principle of polarisation and I should welcome a comment from the Minister on that particular matter.<lb/>
The application of polarisation across the board is one application of the principle of level playing fields. That principle arises in another matter; namely, that building society accounts are outside the scope of the Financial Services Act. Life offices must show the effect of inflation when they illustrate policy benefits. Building societies are not similarly restricted and can mount national advertising campaigns without mentioning the impact of inflation on their depositors' savings. I believe that that distinction is not right and again I would welcome comment from the Minister.<lb/>
The principle of level playing fields may also be said to apply to the next and final point I should like to make concerning the disclosure of commissions. If an intermediary is being paid according to the recognised LAUTRO scale (LAUTRO being the SRO which deals with life offices), that intermediary need only indicate that this is the position. He does not need to specify the actual amount he is being paid unless the client asks exactly what it is and then he must reveal the amount. That seems fair to me, but I am not clear about the position as regards company representatives and tied agents of one company. Are they to be similarly treated? If not, why not?<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like to make four points. First, it is right to seek to protect the investor. Secondly, the principles of polarisation and level playing fields are very important in this connection. Thirdly, the professional indemnity assurance may well be of more value in protecting the investor than many of the rules in the complicated rule book of the SIB. Fourthly, there is a need to ensure that the new structure works without unnecessary expense, without bureaucratic growth and without burdensome administration.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02143"><member>Viscount Colville of Culross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask my noble friend a question which does not concern polarisation. I have to declare an interest. I am a director of a company which quite soon hopes to apply to the SIB for recognition in respect of quite a large area of investment business. To that end we have
<col>504</col>
been working very hard in preparing rules, which I am afraid will be very complex. We appreciate that such rules have to be equivalent to the rules which the SIB has laid before the Secretary of State and which are at the moment built into the preamble to the order.<lb/>
In the course of preparing these rules, in consultation as far as possible with likely members of the SRO, certain practicalities have arisen, and in one case a point of law. It will be very difficult to comply exactly with the SIB rules as they now stand. I entirely understand that the Government had to place a limit upon the extent to which amendments could be made to the SIB rules as they were published in February. However, there have been some amendments. The Government and the department had to go firm upon some set of rules in order to decide whether they would designate the SIB at all. We have now reached that stage.<lb/>
There then comes the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and I seek specific comment from my noble friend upon the matter. As the next weeks go by there will have to be negotiation with the SIB concerning some of the finer points in the rules. I am not talking about anything at root and branch level; I am talking about matters of practicality. Will my noble friend confirm, first, that these rules as they now stand or as they ever will stand, are not part of the statutory instrument&#x2014;that is, that they are not statutory? Therefore, it will be possible for the SIB to negotiate to the extent it thinks fit with the various bodies that wish to be SROs in order that there may be a practical equivalent on terms that can be achieved. If the SIB thinks fit, amendments to the rules will be able to be made fairly soon in order that a timetable may be achieved whereby the whole of this apparatus can come into effect fairly quickly&#x2014;and here I am sorry to disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Tryon&#x2014;otherwise there will be great uncertainty. If my noble friend is able to assist on this matter, I think that he will greatly relieve some of those who are working very hard in the world of SROs at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02144">8.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02145"><member>Lord Boardman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not intended to take part in this debate and had not put my name down. However, I shall be brief. I declare an interest as chairman of one of the clearing banks and chairman of the Committee of London Scottish Bankers.<lb/>
I should like to make three points. The first concerns the complexity of the rules and indeed of the Act itself. In that I have some sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. At an earlier stage when the Bill was going through this House I suggested that it would be more expedient to deal with the whole of the problem by means of a one-clause Bill and that every transaction must be fair, be seen to be fair, and should stop there. We have something which is very much more complicated than that.<lb/>
My second point is to endorse what was said by my noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne as regards the problem of polarisation and the apparent conflict with Article 85 of the Treaty. This is a matter of very considerable concern to the financial institutions, clearing banks and the like. As my noble friend says, it appears that we are faced either with breaching
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0261"/>
<col>505</col>
Article 85 or of ceasing to trade. I am sure that the Minister is aware of this situation and that he will be able to give some assurance that nothing will be done to force us to take a decision to cease to trade, or to alter the whole of our procedure until we have the exemption, clearance, or whatever is necessary under Article 85. I hope that the noble Lord will then allow adequate time to make such alterations as are necessary.<lb/>
Thirdly, I should like to speak in support of the noble Lord, Lord Tryon, concerning the question of time. I noticed in the debate in the other place that, in persuading that House that the matter should go through quickly and be implemented quickly, the Minister said that he must be careful to be aware that the best can be the enemy of the good. I agree that to seek perfection is perhaps undesirable when it means waiting an unnecessarily long time. However, it would be a great mistake if these regulatory rules were brought into force before more preparatory work has been done than has been the case so far. It would be a great mistake if it went off at half-cock. I hope that my noble friend will be able to say something as regards the question of that timing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02146">8.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02147"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate and to those noble Lords who thanked me for the clear explanation I gave. However, obviously I was not quite clear enough as there remain a great number of points to which I should address myself because, as the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, said, this is an important matter. We debated it at great length when we were dealing with what is now the Act. I do not believe, notwithstanding any events that my noble friend the Chief Whip has today announced, that we should just discard it as being rather immaterial against rather more weighty matters. Therefore, if your Lordships will allow me to take a little longer than is usual, it might be of benefit. 1 apologise in advance for that.<lb/>
Let me turn immediately to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, with regard to the <i>vires</i> within the Act. I am well aware of the noble Lord's reservations about Article 9. I thought I made clear that the Government are satisfied that it has the <i>vires</i> to make the order in these terms. The need for such provision arises because there will be certain functions of recognition and disqualification which will be reserved to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
In practice there will be close co-operation between the Secretary of State and SIB and I reject utterly the noble Lord's implication that the Secretary of State would seek to withold from SIB information about any order that he made. But in consequence of other provisions of the order Article 9 is formally necessary and in the Government's view falls squarely within the terms of Section 118(2).</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02148"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord and I hope not to intervene further. Before he leaves the <i>vires</i> point, will he very kindly accept that there is a difference of opinion? I am not speaking from my own knowledge or from my
<col>506</col>
own opinion but from advice that I have received from noble Lords who are legal experts and noble and learned Lords. I should like to put it on the record that it is not merely a frivolous point. It is a serious point we are making on the record that we do not believe the Secretary of State has <i>vires</i> for this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02149"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know the noble Lord, Lord Williams, does not accuse me of being frivolous. I certainly do not think his point is a frivolous one at all because I recognise from what he has told me in our discussions and from his letter to me that there is a difference of opinion which embraces noble and learned Lords and others. I have given very careful consideration to all that has been put to me, and written to me, in these past few days; but I remain of the belief that the Secretary of State does have <i>vires</i> in this respect.<lb/>
The noble Lord then asked me about the recognition of SROs and what happens if an SRO is not okay&#x2014;if I may use the expression. The SIB will then have the responsibility of meeting the requirements. It is for SIB to decide whether to recognise the SRO. Anyone who is not a member of a recognised SRO on the date on which Section 3 comes into effect&#x2014;I shall turn to the timetable in a short while&#x2014;will have to be directly authorised if he is to carry on an investment business.<lb/>
As for the other criteria for recognition, it is for SIB to decide whether an SRO's arrangements for the investigation of complaints are satisfactory. It will also be for SIB to decide whether an SRO's criteria for admission to membership provide an acceptable test of fitness and properness. I would expect here SIB to insist that an SRO had tests equally as stringent as SIB's own.<lb/>
The noble Lord spoke briefly about the practice notes and he gave some examples. The practice notes are not of course part of the rules, and I think he accepts that. They constitute, however, guidance as to the ways in which SIB will interpret the rules and would expect them to operate in particular cases. I draw the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, to Rule 103 of the conduct of business rules which makes clear the status of practice notes.<lb/>
Perhaps a little more important, and which I feel is important in the public's understanding, is the point he put to me with regard to unsolicited calls. An unsolicited call, as we see it, is a personal visit or an oral communication made without express invitation. It means the same in the rules as in the Act. It does not include an unsolicited letter, but other rules cover the content of written commitments.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about a call made in consequence of an earlier call but a different matter being expressed. I suggest that the answer is that that would be unsolicited if the person called upon has not specifically requested it. The noble Lord also asked about clients' money and the SIB guidance on handling. I am not totally sure that I am absolutely clear on what might lay behind this. If the noble Lord was concerned about the status and effect of the opening passage of the appendix to SIB's client money rules, I can only tell him that that passage does not constitute part of the rules but is a guidance as to the action which firms might take in order to comply with
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0262"/>
<col>507</col>
the rules. Perhaps I may on this occasion study what the noble Lord said and write to him.<lb/>
Finally, the noble Lord and, I believe, a number of other noble Lords asked about the ability to change SIB's rules, and particularly the ability of the Secretary of State to do so. In this connection he, the Secretary of State, will be able to intervene only in restricted circumstances. I outlined some of them&#x2014;for example, on international or competition grounds. In addition, if SIB were to fall short of its obligations to provide sufficient levels of investor protection the Secretary of State could withdraw functions from SIB and either exercise them himself or transfer them to another body. Any order withdrawing or transferring functions would be subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
I turn now to the noble Lord, Lord Tryon, whose participations in our debates have been, so far as I am concerned, of varying quality and excitement. I understand his particular interest. He made a point about the rules being too complex and difficult to understand. The rules have been developed by a body which includes many experienced practitioners and in consultation with the practitioners who ultimately will have to comply with them. I do not share the view that they are unreadable or unworkable. It is misleading to think that apparently more simple rules would be preferable. Breach of an SIB rule can lay practitioners open to civil actions and disciplinary procedures which could affect their ability to carry on business. Therefore, it is understandable that many practitioners have pressed for the rules to be precise about what is and is not covered.<lb/>
The noble Lord spoke about disagreement between a number of bodies. He said that much work had to be done. However, I would not describe them as disagreements. Perhaps interpretations have to be more readily understood. Certainly there is much to be done before the system can be brought fully into operation. Equally it is important that investors should be properly protected as soon as possible. Our objective is to implement the new system as soon as it is practicable so to do.<lb/>
The key provision will be when Section 3&#x2014;the provisions which make it a criminal offence to carry on investment business without authorisation&#x2014;comes into force. There have to be applications for authorisation from existing firms and so on. However, I think that this process will proceed as quickly as possible. Perhaps I may say to my noble friend Lord Boardman that we are looking for an introduction of the central provisions towards the end of this year.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tryon, also spoke to me about investment trust companies. I think that it would be more sensible if I wrote to him on how we see this relationship. This evening the issue has perhaps a rather narrower context. If I may do that I shall be very pleased to do so.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne was kind enough to tell me that he was going to raise the question of polarisation and the thoughts of the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers on this matter, as did my noble friend Lord Boardman. Perhaps I can answer both my noble friends together. The committee has put to my department concerns
<col>508</col>
which it has about the uncertainties for the rules of SROs to be created by the competition provisions of the Treaty of Rome.<lb/>
I recognise the weight of the advice that the committee has received. Having said that, both my noble friends and the House will recognise that my department replied on 16th April to the original concerns of the committee that were put to us in a letter of 13th April. My department gave an assurance that the Secretary of State would take into account all relevant factors in deciding when, as well as whether, to take each successive step on the implementation of the Act. The factors are very likely to include the wish to bring the whole system of investor protection into operation as soon as possible, the need to ensure that the businesses involved have sufficient time to comply with the requirement of the system, and the implications of the EC competition law. When the Secretary of State is considering the implementation date of Section 3 of the Act we recognise that he will have need to pay careful attention to the position under EC competition law, including any uncertainty which might then remain.<lb/>
Late last Friday, 8th May, my department received a further letter from the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers seeking a further interpretation or extension of the assurance that the department had given on 16th April. It is now Monday. That letter is now being studied. I hope that a reply will be sent quite shortly. Both my noble friends will recognise that matters of this kind require careful study and I would certainly wish to be sure that the latest suggestion from the committee is properly considered.<lb/>
More generally we have kept the European Commission fully in touch with the developments of the Government's policy over the last two years or so since the introduction of the White Paper on financial services was published. We have been in touch with them at the highest level during our consideration of SIB's rules and have received no indication of concern from them about the impact of those rules on competition in the Community market. We shall seek to respond to the latest letter as quickly as we can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02150"><member>Lord Boardman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way and for what he has said. I accept, and I am sure my noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne accepts, that the Government are looking at this very important point. We should not expect to have a full reply to those matters which have so recently been raised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02151"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Boardman. I shall certainly see that that reply is communicated directly to all those noble Lords who have an interest in this matter and, as convention has it, also to place it in the Library.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn to two of the major points that the noble Lord, Lord Banks, made with regard to independent intermediaries. We have very carefully considered the position of these intermediaries. Many of the representations that we received were on this point. I know that the Director General of Fair Trading fears that the rules will lead to a decline in their number. However, we believe that, taken as a whole, the new regulatory system will not be as disadvantageous as feared.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0263"/>
<col>509</col>
We believe that the system will offer independent intermediaries opportunities that will allow them to continue to play a major role in the market for insurance services. There are a number of reasons for this. SIB made considerable efforts to ensure the costs of the new system were no greater than were necessary for investor protection. In particular, in response to concerns, SIB reduced these, relaxed reporting requirements, and substituted a solvency requirement for minimum capital requirements for those firms which do not hold clients' money.<lb/>
The burden of the requirements which remain may very well have also been overestimated. A number simply reflect existing best practice, to which I referred in my opening remarks. For example, many intermediaries already take steps to know their customers, as the expression is, while much of the information required will be provided by the companies themselves.<lb/>
The noble Lord raised the question of the &#x00A3;48,000 protection to investors. I think I ought to speak briefly on that and the question of professional indemnity. It is hardly in the interests of investors as a whole for there to be unrealistically generous pay-outs to investors on a first come, first served basis, only then to see other investors go uncompensated when the money runs out or to have large numbers of firms crippled by excessive levies. The Act requires that the compensation arrangements must make the best provision which can reasonably be made. Bearing in mind the absence of detailed experience in running a compensation scheme across the whole financial services sector, I believe that this requirement has been met. Clearly if experience shows that there is scope for improvement, there is sufficient flexibility for the SIB to amend the scheme. We debated this at some length during the passage of the Bill and I do not think I can add anything further about compensation.<lb/>
So far as the indemnity is concerned I appreciate that professional indemnity may be regarded to some extent as an alternative. I am not persuaded that adding compulsory professional indemnity cover to the compensation scheme as now proposed would add significantly to the protection of investors. I am sure there will continue to be advantages for firms taking out professional indemnity cover. It is after all only prudent for any businessman to insure against such eventualities if he wishes to avoid being forced into liquidation by an uncovered claim, but I do not see what would be gained for investors which would justify making such cover compulsory.<lb/>
Lastly, my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross asked me whether there was scope for further amendment of the rules in discussion with the SROs. I appreciate that there has to be negotiation of the finer points. The rules, as my noble friend knows, are not part of the statutory system. SIB can indeed negotiate or amend the rules. When the powers have been transferred it will be open to SIB to amend its rules, so long as they continue to fulfil the conditions in the Act. Those rules will then have statutory effect, but I confirm that they do not form part of the order.<lb/>
I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, for his opening remarks when he said&#x2014;and confirmed
<col>510</col>
what he had said during the passage of the Bill&#x2014;that he wanted a Bill of this kind. He might have liked it to have been clothed somewhat differently. I understand that. However, we have arrived at this stage and I believe that this short debate has confirmed that it would be right to transfer the powers to SIB. We have a body here which contains numbers of eminent and able people committed to securing adequate protection for investors. I believe that it has&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02152"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord finishes this point I wonder whether he will kindly clarify one matter about which I am still doubtful. As I understand it, the regulations made by SIB, if the delegation order goes ahead, derive from the powers conferred on the Secretary of State and are therefore part of the statute law of the land. Am I right or am I wrong on that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02153"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, they are part of the statute in so far as the Secretary of State has the power within the Act to alter those rules if, in the event, those rules fail to satisfy the conditions of the Act. The point that the noble Lord particularly wants to underline is that the rules have the force of law in the way I have described but are not in themselves statutory instruments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02154"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister, even at this late hour, would make the position clear to the House. Regulations are made under the powers given to the Secretary of State in the Act. The Secretary of State delegates that right, as I understand it, to what I prefer to call SIB. If that is so, and regulations are made under powers given under an Act, are they or are they not statutory?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02155"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords.<lb/>
The peroration that I was going to make would fall upon rather deaf ears after 24 minutes and at a quarter past nine in the evening. Perhaps I may finish by echoing what a number of noble Lords have said with regard to SIB and its staff, who have put in a good deal of work in setting up this framework. I am sure that once the powers are transferred the SIB will apply itself with equal vigour to the tasks which will have been delegated to it by Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Financial Services (Transfer of Functions<lb/>Relating to Friendly Societies) Order 1987</title>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02158"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Financial Services (Transfer of Functions Relating to Friendly Societies) Order 1987 be approved. At the same time, perhaps I may speak to the Financial Services (Transfer of Functions Relating to Friendly Societies) Order (Northern Ireland) 1987.<lb/>
Both orders concern friendly societies. They transfer to the Securities and Investments Board certain powers of the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Registrar of Friendly Societies for Northern Ireland under Schedule 11 to the Act. These powers provide for the regulation of the investment business of friendly societies and are broadly analogous to the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0264"/>
<col>511</col>
powers of the Secretary of State under the Act which are transferred to the SIB in the delegation order which we have just discussed.<lb/>
The Secretary of State and registrars are satisfied that the conditions and requirements set out in Schedule 11 for a transfer of powers to the SIB are met. The issues raised by these conditions and requirements are the same as we have just debated in the delegation order. I commend these two further orders to your Lordships.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02159"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his explanation of the orders. I would make only three small points, which were made by the friendly societies to the Director General of Fair Trading when he was studying these orders. First, there is a problem with the cost of meeting some of the SIB requirements which may be disproportionately heavy for small societies. Secondly, there are societies with membership limited to particular trades and professions whose voluntary representatives may face particular problems in meeting the standards of advice required. Thirdly, there are commercial societies with a limited product range the sale of whose products would be limited by the reduction in the number of independent intermediaries. I put those points on the record for the noble Lord because they were made to the Director General of Fair Trading; otherwise, we have no problem with the order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Police (Northern Ireland) Order 1986</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02165">9.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02166"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Lord Lyell)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 16th December 1986 be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02167">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the order is to introduce new procedures for dealing with complaints against the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
<col>512</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02168">The Government recognise the need to establish a system by which legitimate complaints against the police may be effectively investigated, both to command the confidence of the police and to provide substantial reassurance to the public. The order contains all the elements of the system currently operating in England and Wales, but with some important additional features designed to take account of the particular sensitivities of policing in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02169">As with England and Wales, the responsibilty for carrying out investigations will remain with the police, whose training and expertise best fit them for that task. The Government remain convinced that it would be neither practicable nor advisable to place this responsibility in the hands of an independent investigative body. The police have a duty to investigate crime of whatever nature, and we see no reason to remove from the police the duty to investigate offences which may involve breaches of the criminal law simply because they might happen to be committed by police officers. Your Lordships will note that the order covers only these complaints relating to the conduct of police officers. The police authority can already use its powers under the Police Act to call for a report from the chief constable where complaints are raised against the general operational policy of the RUC.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02170">The principal feature of the order is contained in Article 3. This establishes an Independent Commission for Police Complaints for Northern Ireland to replace the present Police Complaints Board. The independent public body will be charged with ensuring that the investigation of complaints is carried out in a thorough and impartial manner. It will be required to supervise the investigation of all complaints involving death or serious injury, and in addition will have the power to supervise at its discretion the formal investigation of any other complaint.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02171">Unlike the position in England and Wales, all complaints requiring formal investigation will be sent to the commission at the outset, so it will be immediately aware of the nature of the complaint and will be in a timely position to exercise its obligatory or discretionary powers of supervision. Indeed, it will also receive copies of all minor complaints which have been dealt with informally, and will take over the Police Complaints Board's function in relation to disciplinary matters arising from complaints. If your Lordships glance at Article 20 you will see that this will bring all members of the RUC within the scope of the complaints and disciplinary procedures, including the full-time and part-time RUC Reserve. The commission will therefore have a complete picture of the entire complaints process.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02172">In line with the procedures adopted here both the chief constable and the police authority have been given powers under Article 8(1) to refer a non-complaint matter to the commission, which can then decide whether it is a case in which it should take an interest. In addition, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the police authority are given reserve powers under Article 8(2) formally to require the commission to supervise the investigation in cases where there has been no formal complaint but it
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0265"/>
<col>513</col>
appears that a policeman may have committed a criminal or disciplinary offence and in the public interest the commission's involvement is warranted. These procedures taken together will ensure that investigations into police conduct are open to independent scrutiny by the commission.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02173">Under Article 9(5)(a) the commission will be able to approve or veto the choice of the investigating officer in any case which it supervises, and can supervise the investigation throughout its course. It will wish to know how the investigating officer intends to conduct the investigation and what has been achieved at each stage; and it will also be able to order a change of direction or a more thorough examination of points already considered. At the end of the process the commission will state to the complainant whether or not the investigation has been carried out to its satisfaction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02174">I shall, with your Lordships' leave, just go through the relevant points and also some of the new procedures outlined in the order. I think that your Lordships would wish that I should do this. First of all, complaints about the conduct of police officers may be made directly to the commission through a citizens advice bureau or indeed by a third party on behalf of the complainant. The chief constable, on receipt of the complaint, must then take steps under Article 4(1) to obtain and preserve evidence in relation to it before seeking to resolve it either through informal means or by instituting a formal investigation. The Police Authority for Northern Ireland will do likewise in respect of all cases where a complaint has been made against a senior officer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02175">If the complaint can be dealt with informally the chief constable will send a copy of the complaint and relevant papers to the commission after it has been resolved. But if it requires formal investigation the chief constable, under Article 5(5), must appoint an investigating officer and refer the complaint to the commission so that it&#x2014;that is, the commission&#x2014;can exercise its obligatory or indeed its discretionary powers to supervise. In cases supervised by the commission, the investigating officer will submit his report to the commission, which will then issue a statement under Article 9(8) indicating whether or not the conduct of the investigation was satisfactory and, if appropriate, specifying any respects in which it was dissatisfied with the investigation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02176">Its supervisory role will end when the statement has been issued. However, the police authority, in respect of senior officers, and the chief constable, in respect of all other officers, then have a duty to examine the report and refer it to the DPP if it indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed. But where the chief constable is satisfied, in a case relating to an officer other than a senior officer, that the criminal offence is only of a minor nature, then it need not be referred to the DPP.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02177">Subsequent disciplinary matters in respect of senior officers will remain the responsibility of the police authority although the commission's approval must be sought before a senior officer can be suspended from duty. But the commission, like the Police Complaints Board before it, will have specific functions with regard to discipline for other ranks.</p>
<col>514</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02178">When the chief constable has considered the disciplinary aspects of any complaints investigation, he must notify the commission if he intends to proceed with disciplinary charges or, if not, give his reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02179">The commission may, in its turn, either approve the chief constable's decision to discipline any officer or, under Article 13, it may recommend or direct that disciplinary charges be brought in cases where the chief constable has decided not to do so. These charges will be heard by a disciplinary tribunal comprising the chief constable as chairman, in most cases, and two members of the commission not previously involved with the case. In cases where the commission disagrees with the chief constable's decision not to refer to the DPP allegations that an officer has committed a criminal offence, it can direct the chief constable to submit the case to the DPP.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02180">Finally, the commission will be required to report annually on its work to the Secretary of State and to make a report to him at least once every three years on the working of the complaints arrangements. These reports will be laid before Parliament and published.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02181">The order will also bring into effect a number of measures which will protect the rights of individual RUC officers in the complaints procedure. Under Article 21, police representative bodies, which includes the Police Federation, are given the specific right of representation in disciplinary and appeal proceedings. Article 22 provides that where an officer has been convicted or possibly acquitted of a criminal offence, he will not be charged with a disciplinary offence which is in substance the same as that of which he had been convicted or indeed acquitted. That is a legal point known as "double jeopardy". I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, will appreciate that. I am advised that this is the double jeopardy article under this procedure. Article 23 provides that the Secretary of State may issue guidance to the chief constable concerning the discharge of his functions under the order and a failure to adhere to that guidance shall be admissible in an appeal regarding the officer's guilt or punishment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02182">The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland already has the power to amend or modify disciplinary regulations under the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. The regulations will be amended to provide that punishment by dismissal, requirement to resign, or reduction in rank will not be imposed upon an officer of the rank of chief superintendent or below unless he had been afforded the opportunity to be legally represented at the disciplinary hearing. And in any other case, an officer may be represented by any other member of a UK police force. Regulations will also provide for arrangements governing the composition, scope and functions of appeal tribunals and will make discriminatory behaviour on the grounds of religious belief, political opinion, or racial origin a specific disciplinary offence. The final wording of the specific offence will be given careful consideration when the revision of the regulations is undertaken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02183">It is the Government's view that the complaints and discipline procedures outlined in this order will have a significant impact upon the relationship between the police and the public in Northern Ireland. The commission will, I believe, come to be regarded by
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0266"/>
<col>515</col>
both the public and the police as a fair and impartial body and its statements on the investigation of complaints will carry authority throughout the community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02184">The RUC already carry out their duties with commendable spirit and dedication in difficult and often dangerous circumstances. Despite their resolute commitment towards impartially upholding the rule of law in very difficult circumstances, officers have been subjected to intimidation and hostility from misguided elements within the community who constantly attempt to undermine the credibility of the force. I am sure your Lordships will join me in recognising and, above all, commending, the impartial and dedicated manner in which the RUC continue to carry out their often very dangerous duties in the Province.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02185">However, in those circumstances where there is legitimate cause for complaint about police conduct, it is vital that complaints are thoroughly investigated. Where the public can be confident that complaints are so investigated, suspicion towards the police is likely to be replaced by encouragement and support, which in turn will assist the police in the maintenance of law and order. The measures contained in this order will ensure that complaints are thoroughly investigated, while also increasing safeguards for individual officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02186">My Lords, with that explanation, I commend this order to your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02187">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 16th December 1986 be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02188">9.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02189"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the order which is before the House is an important one for Northern Ireland but it is a complicated order. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for explaining its complicated provisions, and I am sure it will pay us to read and reread his speech.<lb/>
I should like to acknowledge from these Benches our appreciation of the considerable contribution made by the members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The Minister is right when he emphasises that they often operate in difficult and dangerous circumstances. We are reminded by the 1986 annual report of the chief constable that in that year 12 members of the force died as a result of activities on the part of paramilitary organisations, and we would take this opportunity to pay tribute to their bravery and to the bravery of their colleagues and families.<lb/>
The police are human, and because they are human they make mistakes from time to time. And if they make mistakes it is right that they should answer for them and that the mistakes should be put right promptly. In every sphere of life we are moving to a situation where the professionals in medicine, law and the social services are answerable outside the strict limits of the law of negligence for their professional conduct. We are moving to the situation where complaints against the conduct of the professionals must be adequately examined and not stifled.<lb/>
The chief constable in his 1986 annual report devoted a small section to the complaints which had been recorded and investigated in the course of the
<col>516</col>
year. The fault is no doubt mine; but I must confess that I found it difficult, on reading the section, to form an assessment of the effectiveness of the current complaints procedure in Northern Ireland. Sometimes in the section the reference is to "a case" and elsewhere it is to "a complaint". It is clear that "a case" can include one or more complaints made at the same time, or in relation to the same incident, by one or more persons. It is therefore very difficult to form a clear assessment of the position.<lb/>
The chief constable tells us in the report that of the 2,785 cases of complaint received in 1986, investigation was completed on 785 of them. How does that compare with the experience on the mainland? The investigation of a substantial number of complaints&#x2014;I should find it difficult to put a figure on it&#x2014;was not completed because the complainant withdrew the complaint or indicated that he did not wish to pursue it. How does that compare with the British experience? Can the Minister offer us an assurance that the examination of complaints was not stifled for any reason?<lb/>
Both the Baker report which dominated the debate in your Lordships' House last Friday and the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights in Northern Ireland have called for a new complaints machinery. As I understand it this order has been introduced partly in response to that demand. However, it would have been helpful if the department had identified the main weaknesses or inadequacies in the recent procedures so that we do not merely have to assume that this order properly addresses itself to the inadequacies.<lb/>
I suggest that it should be a principle of the complaints procedure against the police in the United Kingdom that it should be of universal application throughout the four countries in order to ensure that complaints are treated in similar fashion in whatever part of the United Kingdom from which they emanate. If that is a sound principle, then should the Government propose a departure from the procedure in any part of the United Kingdom, the onus of justifying the departure rests with them.<lb/>
Considering that Northern Ireland has a profound tradition of its own in many spheres of life, I should not be surprised if the Northern Ireland Office seeks to take an independent line on some aspects of the disciplinary procedure. Indeed, we are sometimes critical of the department for following too slavishly the lead given by the relevant Whitehall department. The House will recall that that was the basis of our criticism of the important Industrial Relations Order which is before the other place tonight.<lb/>
As the Minister has explained, this complicated order establishes an independent commission for police complaints for Northern Ireland and introduces new procedures for dealing with complaints made against members of the RUC. As the Minister has said, it is broadly in line with the procedures that will apply in England and Wales but it differs in two or three major respects. I propose to say a few words about two of the main differences, which are among a number of matters to which our attention has been drawn by the Police Federation for Northern Ireland.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0267"/>
<col>517</col>
One of the major differences is that the order allows a complaint to be made by a third party on behalf of a member of the public without his or her written consent. The Police Federation complains bitterly about this difference. In our view, <i>prima facie</i> at least there is a great deal of force in their objection. To give written consent indicates that a complaint has a degree of seriousness or permanence which justifies it being taken up by a third party. One never rushes into committing oneself' in writing. Therefore, the giving of written consent would indicate that the aggrieved party has taken a conscious decision that a third party should pursue his complaint. Can the Minister explain satisfactorily to the House why the Government consider it necessary to give this right to a third party in Northern Ireland?<lb/>
Will the Minister also say whether the complaint will still be investigated even if the aggrieved party informs the police that he or she no longer wishes to have it investigated? Finally on this issue, will the Minister confirm whether or not a police officer will be suspended from duty automatically when there is a complaint against his conduct? If he is suspended automatically, that would reinforce our unease about this departure from the England and Wales principle.<lb/>
I shall now pass to another difference which the Secretary of State proposes to embody in the new disciplinary regulations. As I understand it, it is proposed to establish a new disciplinary offence based on discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. This has caused a great deal of offence to the Police Federation. But I must say to the Police Federation that I can see the department's side of the question on this particular issue. By virtue of the distinct characteristics of Northern Ireland&#x2014;namely, the existence within the community of a minority group and a majority group based on the consciousness of religious and political differences&#x2014;there is always the potential threat of a citizen being discriminated against, treated less favourably, on religious or political grounds. Therefore it should be possible for there to be found a disciplinary offence on the grounds of such discrimination. We suggest that the existence of such an offence should not necessarily cause offence to the Police Federation.<lb/>
There are also a few public anxieties about some aspects of the order to which I want to refer briefly. The public are concerned that the investigation by the new body should be seen to be impartial and be impartial. There are reservations on this point because the independent commission will not itself undertake the investigation of a complaint but will rely on the investigation being carried out by the police, although supervised by the commission. It is feared that this could significantly weaken the role of the commission. I have listened very carefully to the Minister. He has sought to explain how the commission will supervise the investigtion. Time will tell whether those powers will prove effective.<lb/>
There is also some anxiety that the powers given to the chief constable by Section 13 of the Police Act 1972 to refer a complaint to an independent tribunal is now being repealed. Therefore we have to ask
<col>518</col>
ourselves whether the new powers contained in this order will compensate for the loss of the power in Section 13. I am partly satisfied by the point made by the department that henceforth there should only be one source of authority for the independent investigation of complaints against the police in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Finally, can the Minister tell us what steps will be taken to educate the public in simple language about this new complaints machinery and procedure, the procedure not being all that easy to understand? How is it proposed to draw their attention to the new procedure? How will the department explain how a complaint is to be made, and to whom a complaint is to be made?<lb/>
I have assumed, as I mentioned, that publicity in clear, unambiguous and uncomplicated language will be given to the new order and its procedures. One would have thought that a prime place to exhibit notice of the new procedures in uncomplicated language would be at the grass roots in the police station itself. It would be helpful if the Minister could give some indication of how the department proposes to give publicity to the terms of the new order. We welcome the order. It recognises the need by the public for complaints about the police to be adequately and promptly investigated. We hope that the order will satisfy that public need.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02190">9.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02191"><member>Lord Hampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord the Minister for introducing the order. Before going any further, I should also like to pay tribute from these Benches to the men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Events over the last weekend have emphasised dramatically, if any emphasis was needed, that all members of the RUC, in however peaceful a neighbourhood they live, are at times in danger of their lives. I should like to put on record our very great admiration of the courage and dedication to duty that they so regularly display.<lb/>
There have been widely varying reactions to this order. On the one hand, it has been held by some honourable Members in the other place to be a kick in the teeth for the ordinary men and women of the Northern Ireland police service. We are told that they deeply resent it. On the other hand, the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights based in Belfast says:
<quote>"One of the main aims of the new scheme must be to reassure the public that there exists a fair, impartial and effective system for the investigation of complaints against the police."</quote>
That, I think, we all agree. But the statement goes on:
<quote>"Given the dangerous and difficult circumstances in which the police operate, it is vital to encourage the total support of the public. The system envisaged by this Order does not, in the Commission's view, go far enough to maximise that support."</quote>
I repeat that it does not,
<quote>"go far enough to maximise that support."</quote>
The Minister of State in the other place, Mr. Nicholas Scott, introducing the order, said:
<quote>"The Government remain convinced that the best way to deal with complaints against the police is through a procedure that can command support from the public and in which the police can have confidence."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 6/5/87; col. 814.]</quote>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0268"/>
<col>519</col>
In the attempt to keep the balance between unfair attacks on the police, and, alternatively, the suppression of genuine grounds for complaint, we believe that this order stands fair to succeed. We support it and hope that its aim will be fairly achieved.<lb/>
I have just two questions to put to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell. They have been touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies. First, how does a person with a grievance make his or her complaint known? I was interested that the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, mentioned citizens advice bureaux. I shall come back to this. Secondly, how is the ordinary citizen to be informed of his or her rights in this matter? The average person may well not know how to proceed. And if a complaint has to be lodged with the very people against whom it is being made, it could be a very frightening process which might well deter the less courageous. I should be grateful if the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, could clarify my mind as to whether it is possible to do all this through a citizens advice bureau. With those two questions and few comments, I repeat that we support the order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02192"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, once again, I am very grateful for the close study that has been given by the noble Lords, Lord Prys-Davies and Lord Hampton, to this rather complicated legislation. I apologise for taking so long in presenting so many points, but it probably was worthwhile and indeed I think your Lordships would not have expected me to do any less.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, asked me a number of questions which I hope I shall be able to answer, but I shall have to write to him concerning the statistics that he raised with me. I am afraid that we are not able to compare the Northern Ireland statistics with those of England and Wales as we have been receiving statistics for two years in England and Wales but we have not received similar statistics for Northern Ireland. However, I shall write to the noble Lord on that as briefly and as swiftly as possible.<lb/>
I can stress to the noble Lord and to the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, that no complaints are overlooked or stifled in any way. The Police Complaints Board, which has been the relevant board for dealing with complaints up to now, has confirmed the correct handling by the Royal Ulster Constabulary of cases which the Police Complaints Board witnessed, and it stressed the use of its relationship with the RUC. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, will accept that neither we nor the public believe that complaints are being stifled by the Police Complaints Board.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, also asked how the public could be made aware of their rights. That touched upon the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hampton. The Government are certainly fully aware of the need to publish a leaflet which could explain the new procedure. It is intended to have one published and for it to be made available to the public before the commission comes into operation. I should just add that we are giving careful consideration to the content of that leaflet and we shall certainly take into account the views of everyone who has given us notice on that point, and not least those of your Lordships.<lb/>
<col>520</col>
I am advised that explanatory documents will be available in police stations and in citizens' advice bureaux. I hope that the noble Lords, Lord Hampton and Lord Prys-Davies, do not think that it is necessarily intimidating or gives rise to apprehension for citizens to go into police stations. I noticed a comment made in another place to the effect that they appeared like fortresses. That may be so, but any noble Lords who have been to Northern Ireland will appreciate the necessity for that. However, leaflets and explanatory memoranda will be made available at citizens' advice bureaux if a complainant or any individual does not wish to go to a police station. We shall consider whether there are any further steps that we can take in that line.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, touched upon the novelty of the order and some of the points that went a little beyond the procedures in England and Wales. That was the gist of some of his comments about the Police Federation. As regards Northern Ireland, the improvements are, first, that the individual citizen is able to raise his point with the Independent Commission for Police Complaints. That body will have effective powers to supervise the investigation of complaints.<lb/>
Secondly, we think that the introduction of a flexible system for handling the less serious complaints will be more effective. The first difference as regards England and Wales is that there are no corresponding powers whereby both the Secretary of State and the police authority could refer in the public interest a case which we call in the order "a non-complaint case" to the commission for its supervision of the investigation. We think that this is, even in police terms, a valuable step forward.<lb/>
In Northern Ireland the Chief Constable will be required to refer all complaints which require formal investigation to the commission so that the commission can exercise its investigatory functions. In England and Wales the Police Complaints Authority only has the more serious complaints referred to it.<lb/>
Thirdly, the commission will have the oversight of the informal resolution process and it will receive a copy of every complaint dealt with in this particular matter. This is not the case in England and Wales.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, also asked me about complaints raised by third parties without written consent. That was a grievance which was raised by the Police Federation in Northern Ireland. There are three points to which I should like to reply. In England and Wales, there is a statutory requirement for persons making a complaint on another's behalf to obtain his written consent. That protects the interest of the third party. However, police forces have been given discretion to set aside the requirement in certain circumstances. For instance, they can act upon a complaint without checking whether written consent has been obtained. However, the existing provisions in Northern Ireland do not require third parties to have written consent from the complainant. The RUC have confirmed to the Government and to me personally recently that they have no difficulty in accepting and investigating complaints made in that way.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0269"/>
<col>521</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, also stressed that he felt that there was some reason for fearing that the independence of the new commission might be ineffective. We believe that we have taken reasonable steps to see that the commission can exercise its supervisory functions in the cases which matter. I have already spelled out how we think we have improved on the procedures in England and Wales. We think that the measures in this order present a reasonable framework for investigating and monitoring the procedures where cases might arouse some interest.<lb/>
The noble Lord also raised a query about Section 13 of the 1970 Act. We understand that permission to hold tribunals under that particular section of the Act has proved to be inadequate. In the first place, the tribunal had no powers to subpoena witnesses to attend. Nor was it able to require documentary evidence to be submitted or to take evidence on oath.<lb/>
<col>522</col>
We do not see that that has been satisfactory. We think that the procedures contained in the order will do the job which we believe that the commission should do. We believe that the procedures will provide greater safeguards for the public and for every individual member of the RUC.<lb/>
I hope that I have covered the questions that have been raised by the two noble Lords who have spoken. I promise to write to the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, with the statistics. We are very grateful for the attention that has been shown and not least for the tributes paid to the individual members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and to their fine organisation. I am sure that they will be pleased to read what has been said by the noble Lords, Lord Hampton and Lord Prys-Davies, this evening. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Horseracing on Sundays</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02194">9.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02195"><member>Lord Wyatt of Weeford</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have any proposals to reform the law relating to horseracing on Sundays.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02196">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to ask the Unstarred Question which stands in my name. I should like to thank those enthusiasts who have remained to so late an hour, sitting patiently on their Benches. I hope that it is not too late for the Government to include permission for Sunday racing in their election manifesto, or indeed for any other party to do so. It would be a highly popular measure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02197">We are the only major racing country without Sunday racing, apart from New Zealand&#x2014;and we can hardly call that a major country&#x0021; In France, over three times as many people go racing on a Sunday as the daily average for the rest of the week, including Saturday. In Italy, there is a similar pattern. In Ireland, they began Sunday racing in 1985 and last year the 12 Sunday meetings had attendances double that of the weekday average. I would wager that those three countries also have church attendances on Sundays well over double ours. I am rather surprised to see that there are no bishops here tonight; I thought they were rather keen on this subject. However, many of them think that racing and religion are enemies&#x2014;but they are not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02198">Our churches have the insular belief that they are better informed on this subject than foreign Christian churches. The hostility among churches in Britain to this innocent amusement on Sundays widens their separation from ordinary people who feel the churches have not advanced their thinking since John Knox. If he were alive he would doubtless add a blast against Sunday racing to his blast on the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women. He would certainly invoke hellfire at the sight of a woman Prime Minister.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02199">It is still illegal to charge admission for Sunday sport. Most major sports take no notice. For example, the Wimbledon finals, the final of the British Open golf championship, professional football and cricket, rugby league matches, snooker championships and motor racing all happen on Sundays. Sunday cricket has been a boon to county cricket lovers and clubs. Last year Essex had an average attendance of 7,000 each Sunday&#x2014;over double the Saturday attendances. Yorkshire had an average attendance of 4,000 on Saturdays, but 8,000 on Sundays. Hampshire has as many as three times the number of spectators on a Sunday as other days.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02200">I mention cricket because it is a peaceful sport analogous to racing. At both, good behaviour generally prevails and there is little sign of hooliganism. Racegoers and cricket spectators are as orderly as any bishop could wish. So why do the British racing authorities not do as other sports and flout the law by holding race meetings on Sundays? It is because of the peculiarities of our betting laws. Casinos and amusement arcades with their gambling machines, which are deeply unfair to the punters, are open on Sundays and take cash. Credit betting by telephone takes place in very large amounts on the
<col>524</col>
Sunday sporting events to which I have referred. If you have a credit account you can place your bets on the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> and watch it at home on Sunday on television. If there were Sunday racing in Britain you could do the same. But the law is that there can be no Sunday betting on racecourses or in betting shops.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02201">As with most of this type of nannying legislation left over from the past, it works in favour of the better-off with telephones and credit accounts and against those who do not. Interfering do-gooders always think that they know better what is good for the working classes than they know themselves. The racing authorities have a strong sense of responsibility. They know that horseracing without betting is like a bishop conducting a service without his vestments: it is unnatural. As the law stands, if there were racing on Sundays it would be impossible to stop illegal betting and the acceleration of criminality that would go with it. This would be the fault not of the racing authorities but of those who cling to obsolete laws. Nevertheless, the racing industry does not want to be a party to this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02202">The main objections to Sunday racing among the Churches and their more militant followers are these. First, the opening of racecourses on a Sunday would spoil the quality of the placid British Sunday; but the 59 racecourses are all well away from the centres of towns and housing estates and large populations. They have good parking facilities. If the law were changed it is not planned that there should be more than 12 racing Sundays a year, with perhaps three meetings on each Sunday. Those 36 meetings would be divided between the 59 racecourses so that most of them would not even have one. There would be less nuisance to the public on a Sunday than is caused by the opening of stately homes, museums, galleries, safari parks, garden centres and all the rest of the Sunday activities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02203">The second objection is that high street betting shops would be open for approximately four hours on the relevant Sunday afternoons. As these betting shops are mostly in areas where pubs, restaurants and shops are already open on Sundays, it would not make the slightest difference.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02204">The third objection is that some people would be working on a Sunday as well as on a weekday. The working party set up by the Jockey Club on Sunday racing, of which I was a member, found that it would be easy to get stable lads, horse transport drivers, and so forth, to do an occasional Sunday shift if the money is right. As in the hotel and catering industry, and in other industries, everything can be done on a Sunday if the money is right.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02205">As regards the Tote, of which I am the chairman, no employee would be compelled to work on a Sunday either in the Tote on course, in our betting shops or elsewhere if they did not want to. There would be quite enough volunteers who would like the extra money. Shifts could be easily arranged with other days off in lieu. That applies generally to the betting industry, which was represented on the working party.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02206">The fourth major objection is perhaps the most important. It is that betting on horses is thought to be evil and therefore it must be still more evil if it happens

on Sunday. I fear that this archaic notion is another reason why the Churches have declining congregations in a world from which they have drifted away and which they do not understand.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02207">Statistically, over a year a punter loses on average about 22 per cent. of what he stakes. Let us suppose he lays out &#x00A3;15 a week. He may expect to lose only &#x00A3;3.30 a week over a period. He could well have spent that money on demon drink or hiring a salacious video. Instead, he prefers an intellectual entertainment to exercise his mind. He has to work out the form, consider the jockey, the nature of the course and the going, study the habits of owners and of trainers and decide which horses are tuned up to do their best and then make his selection. For millions that is the only satisfying individual, truly democratic decision they ever make otherwise they are in thrall to their superiors at work or to a union official.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02208">When a punter makes a mistake he examines the reasons and he is better armed next time. Sometimes the punter sees that a horse he has followed is likely to start at remarkably good value at 10 to one or more. He puts on the heroic sum of &#x00A3;3 and pulls off a coup. That makes him very happy and the glow lasts for weeks. It is almost impossible to be more harmlessly employed than in putting bets on horses. Only a few overdo it, as some overdo drink. It is very rare for anyone to take punting on horses more seriously than as an intellectual, mildly exciting pastime for a very modest cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02209">Far from scorning this harmless fun, the Churches should praise it as an extension of liberty of the spirit and individual will. The effect on the racing industry of Sunday racing would be beneficient. Those few courses to which the Jockey Club gave a Sunday fixture would double their attendance. It would be a wonderful alternative to the Sunday family outings now available. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could expect a pleasant addition to the &#x00A3;250 million or so a year that he now collects in betting duty from horserace bets. The levy board would get additional aid with the help it gives to racing generally.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02210">Like cricket spectators, racegoers do not riot in the streets or break up pubs after the event is over.. They go quietly home. The gentleness of Sunday would be untrammeled by racegoers after race meetings; the pleasure of the multitude would be vastly enhanced by Sunday racing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02211">What a wonderful thing if the Derby on 3rd June, a Wednesday, could instead have been run on a Sunday&#x0021; Last year 47,000 paid to watch it. A Sunday Derby would attract double that number to say nothing of the extra numbers on the free part of the Downs. Thousands more would have a lot of fun and feel better about the world and its Maker. The interference to traffic and the habits of those living nearby would be far less for a Sunday Derby than a Wednesday Derby. Only Britain, lost in the fog of Victorian Sundays, would stage the world's premier horserace on a Wednesday. It is a tiny minority which prevents Sunday racing by vociferous objections based on an ill-founded view of the meaning of morality and religion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02212">I hope that such people will come to have a little humility and will not continue to impose a somewhat
<col>526</col>
conceited view of how people ought to behave on the vast majority who do not agree with them. If they do not, I hope that the Government will no longer allow this minority to dictate to the majority. On an earthly note, there are usually more votes in siding with the majority.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02214"><member>Lord Manton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt of Weeford, for giving the House the opportunity of discussing a subject which happens to be very dear to my own heart. As a keen racing man, may I ask the Minister whether he will congratulate his right honourable friend the Prime Minister on deciding to hold the general election on the only free Thursday between the Derby meeting and Royal Ascot?<lb/>
Your Lordships may remember that I spoke briefly of the need to legalise sporting events on Sundays during the Second Reading of the ill-fated Shops Bill when your Lordships were debating an issue that went very much further than the question of racing on Sundays. During that debate I was most encouraged by the point made by the right reverend Prelate the then Bishop of Birmingham who said that he was in favour of leisure on a Sunday. The point was also made by the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford, who stressed the value of recreation on a Sunday. It is no secret that both were implacably against universal trading on the sabbath. I am however encouraged by their support of leisure and recreation on that day. Any legislation to allow racing on a Sunday would be a far cry from Sunday trading. I hope and expect that noble Lords on all sides would accept that racing is both a leisure and a recreation pursuit.<lb/>
It is generally agreed that racing without betting both on and off course is not possible. There are some 10,000 betting shops in this country and I hope that legislation can be passed for them to be open on Sunday afternoon&#x2014;I must stress the word "afternoon". I should remind the House (Lord Wyatt has already done so) that casinos and bingo halls can operate within the law on Sundays. If they can, why on earth should not betting shops be allowed to do so? There is nothing seedy or anti-social about the modern betting shop. If 77,000 public houses and licensed premises can open on a Sunday, surely the addition of 10,000 betting shops would not be unreasonable, especially as they would be open only in the afternoon.<lb/>
I should at this point declare my interest to the House. The Jockey Club working party on Sunday racing was set up in January 1985 under the chairmanship of General Sir Cecil Blacker, when I was Senior Steward. Its report was published in January this year, after two years of very detailed research, soundings and deliberations. Since that time the Jockey Club has been going through a process of consultation and it has been very pleased with the results it has received.<lb/>
I should like to draw the attention of the House to three of the report's major findings. First, the market research people commissioned by the working party indicated a very clear demand among racegoers and punters for racing on Sundays. Secondly, as I have already said, a race meeting without betting is, quite
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0272"/>
<col>527</col>
frankly, a non-runner. The concept of Sunday racing with on-course betting only was very clearly rejected by the working party because of the danger, identified by the market research, of permitting illegal off-course betting. This concern is, I understand, shared by the Home Office. The third vital point suggests that Sunday racing should start on a limited number of Sundays to test the water, although if successful the number of racing Sundays could extend. The Irish experience suggests to us that to be profitable Sunday racing needs to be a special occasion. This will in itself impose strict limitations to the number of Sundays involved. However even to test the water an amendment to the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 is required.<lb/>
At York racecourse, where I am chairman, we would hope to have perhaps two Sunday fixtures a year out of a total of fifteen fixtures a year. The Jockey Club is aware that some opposition to the concept of Sunday racing has been expressed by certain sections of the workforce. The report recognises that Sunday racing will not succeed without the willing cooperation of those employed in the racing and betting industries. Stable lads have indicated that they would have no objection to racing on a Sunday provided that they were adequately remunerated for so doing. I feel sure that this would also apply to those employed in the betting and the catering industries, very many of whom are part time workers anyway.<lb/>
Church officials have, sadly, already indicated to the working party that there will he opposition from them to the idea of Sunday racing, but I have not yet understood the logic of their opposition. Racing takes place on Sundays in France, Ireland and Italy: all countries where the Church enjoys an undeniable influence. In fact we are, as Lord Wyatt, has already told us the only major racing country in the world, except New Zealand, not staging racing on Sundays.<lb/>
Other sports operate in defiance of the Sunday Observance Act to hold some of their major functions on Sunday and continue to attract spectators who might otherwise have gone racing. I shall not list them as Lord Wyatt has already done so. They range from the Open Golf tournament to the Wimbledon Finals. All these fixtures are currently held in defiance of the spirit of the law if not in breach of it. What is more, BBC and ITV are regularly televising those events which may well be in themselves illegal.<lb/>
Sunday racing lends itself particularly well to a family day out and the Irish experience has shown how popular and enjoyable these special meetings can be. Racing is part of Britain's heritage and if it is to survive in an increasingly competitive market it must be allowed to compete fairly both with its international competitors and with other sports at home. All supporters of Sunday racing have been much encouraged by the Home Secretary's personal support&#x2014;I stress the word "personal"&#x2014;for the principle of Sunday racing. I hope that the wind of change is in the air. My noble friend Lord Montgomery of Alamein has already succeeded in a minor but extremely important reform in the licensing laws. I hope that we shall soon see a reform of the law relating to horse racing on Sundays.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02216"><member>Lord Crawshaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should also like to say a few words to support my noble friend Lord Wyatt, who is always a first-class entertainer as I know from having heard him frequently at functions to do with the Tote. I am only sorry that there were not more noble Lords in the Chamber to hear him tonight, and in particular no representatives of the Churches. I thought at teatime that this event might be something of a walkover so I did my best to encourage the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, to come and speak; but I am afraid I was unsuccessful.<lb/>
Believing as I do that the two sides are not poles apart, I thought I would say something in my capacity as an ex-churchwarden of a village church in the Midlands. In the absence of higher authority my text for this purpose comes from Psalm 20, verse 7, which your Lordships will know goes like this:
<quote>"Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God".</quote>
It goes on:
<quote>"They are brought down and fallen",</quote>
which you will note are the exact words used to describe the mishaps of steeplechasing. Then it says:
<quote>"but we are risen, and stand upright",</quote>
which is the kind of confidence that really does invite a disaster and a case of pride coming before a fall.<lb/>
The two sides have a lot in common. There are profits on both sides, as your Lordships know. I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Oaksey is not here tonight because I suppose one could describe him as a twentieth century Elijah. I believe that we could learn quite a lot about racing on Sundays from the Roman Catholic countries, especially from France and Ireland and Italy where, as we have already heard, Sundays are shared between the Church and the racecourse and other recreational places. I am involved in a small way with what is loosely known as the stately homes business and Sunday is certainly the day for this; so why not racecourses, many of which are in superb surroundings? They could provide a wonderful day out for the family.<lb/>
Obviously people will want to have a flutter, but as the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt, has already said, very few are gambling addicts and most come with a fixed view of what they can afford to spend and once that has gone they stop. I also believe that the present situation, with the Derby on a Wednesday, and so on, is a relic of the concept that you must have racing on weekdays in order to keep the aristocracy and the criminal classes occupied. There are a lot of other classes nowadays for whom Sunday is the most convenient day.<lb/>
I should also like to say a quick word about the workforce, especially the stable staffs who are the most important people involved. Anyone going into work with horses knows perfectly well, or soon finds out, that a horse has to be fed and looked after seven days a week, and that includes Sundays, Christmas Day, Easter, whether he is at home, whether he is at the vets, or whether he is at the racecourse or any other venue. I know that you cannot expect one person to do all this on his own all the time, so a rota system is already practised.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0273"/>
<col>529</col>
Sunday racing must increase employment because of the extra racing involved. I am sure that the lads who travelled yesterday to Rome with the extremely successful English contingent for the Italian Derby had a marvellous time and were thoroughly well rewarded. To work with good horses is a marvellous job. The manager at -the Dalham Hall stud in Newmarket&#x2014;that is where the great Dancing Brave is at stud&#x2014;told me the other day that he regretfully has to turn down hundreds of people who want to go and work there, such is the attraction of looking after horses of that sort of calibre.<lb/>
In view of the events earlier today I do not expect my noble friend Lord Caithness to promise all that much tonight, though I know that he and his right honourable friend the Home Secretary agree with what has already been said. My noble friend Lord Manton indicated something of the Jockey Club's plans, and so far as concerns this House a Private Members' Bill in the next Parliament may be the way to proceed. In conclusion, however it is done, for most people's sake I hope that we shall see Sunday racing in this country before very long.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02218"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what an entertaining end to an adventurous and dramatic day in your Lordships' House&#x0021; A speech always scintillating from the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt. We rejoice in this House that we have some of the enjoyment that another place had for many years, and that we are able at times to read him in the papers in his style which all of us appreciate, even if we do not always agree with the content of the article. It is some such experience that many of us might have this evening.<lb/>
I wonder whether, for example, the noble Lord, who has just spoken to us, Lord Crawshaw, realised how apt he was in quoting from the Psalms in support of the case that the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt, was putting to us. If I may suggest to him a more appropriate Psalm, it would be that of the sad punter, who would recite very solemnly:
<quote>"1 lift up mine eyes to William Hill, Whence cometh my help."</quote>
The entertainment that we also had came from an unusual theological discussion to which the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt, entertained us. It was a crusade&#x2014;if I may use that phrase&#x2014;against some of the bishops, and one wishes that the bishops had been here to answer, as I am sure they could have done.<lb/>
All this amounts, in what is going to be a brief speech from me tonight, to this: I have not the slightest doubt that there are arguments that can be put forward in logic&#x2014;as put to us by the noble Lord, Lord Manton, with all his experience&#x2014;for horseracing on Sunday. However, there are many sincere people in our land who attach an important significance to Sunday. We heard them express their views in this House when we discussed Sunday trading. From their point of view, it was most important that Sunday should have its distinguishing features. For Parliament to try to roll over the sincere beliefs of many of our citizens, without any kind of consideration, is something it ought to do with a great deal of hesitation. Holding the religious beliefs which I hold, I say that with a sincerity which I hope your Lordships will appreciate. I repeat
<col>530</col>
that there is a logical case; but there is equally a case against.<lb/>
The most sensible thing in the world would be to adopt the suggestion made in the course of this debate by the noble Lord, Lord Crawshaw. It was that some Member, in either this House or another place, should discover what is the reaction of the public and Parliament to a Private Member's Bill. To commit the Benches on which I have the honour of sitting to a view on this matter would be absolutely wrong. I feel that the opinion of the public should be sought, at a time when the Church can express its views both in this House and elsewhere. This ought to be the time for testing the opinion which may be felt with regard to this very tricky matter. One is dealing with tricky matters when dealing with issues of conscience of this kind.<lb/>
My last word is on the subject of employees in the industry. I listened with great interest and I learned from the remarks which were made by the noble Lords, Lord Manton, Lord Crawshaw and Lord Wyatt of Weeford. I think that there is little doubt that some people may hesitate before accepting the assurance, which I know was honestly given, that those who do not wish to work on Sundays need not do so. We heard that in the debate on Sunday trading. The questions that were asked were very pertinent. They were whether the continuance of employment for someone not prepared to work on Sunday would necessarily be there as against those employees who were prepared to work on Sunday.<lb/>
It has been an interesting and entertaining debate, not least when the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt of Weeford, with that gay eloquence of his (I use that adjective in the best possible sense) talked in terms of the intellectual activities of punters. I thought that I was in a dream world. I was perfectly prepared to float along with him in those dreams when he spoke of the intensity of the intellectual exercise; concentrating on the history of the horse, the trainer and the jockey, and coming to a conclusion which I suppose may one day lead to a degree in our Open University.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02220"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like first to thank the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt of Weeford, for his Question initiating this short debate on Sunday racing. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that it has been a most fascinating discussion.<lb/>
We welcome this debate, which provides a timely opportunity to test opinion on the issue of Sunday racing&#x2014;and on that I would say there has seldom been a debate where I have found the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, as heavily out-voted as he is this evening.<lb/>
As a number of your Lordships have suggested tonight, the racing authorities have become more persuaded than ever that Sunday racing would be viable and ought to be tried. We shall want to reflect on the views which have been expressed tonight. As things stand, there are no plans for Government legislation on this subject. This does not mean, however, that we are opposed on Sunday racing; far from it. We might find that we were able to support a Bill which might be introduced by a Private Member in another place or by one of your Lordships in this House.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0274"/>
<col>531</col>
As the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt, said, of course the real crux is the law on betting. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary does not believe that this needs to prohibit betting on Sundays in order to achieve its wider objectives. The Government will reach a collective view on this issue as and when a Bill is introduced. In the meantime it may help to make some observations and to respond to some of the points made in the debate today.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has made clear his personal support for Sunday racing, subject to two preconditions. The first is that the law on betting should be changed before any Sunday racing takes place. The second is that the climate of opinion should be prepared before any Bill is introduced. I should like to begin with the law on betting. We should be opposed to any experiment with Sunday racing before a change in the law, and I should like to explain why.<lb/>
At present the only form of betting which could lawfully accompany Sunday racing is credit betting. This is not the most popular form of betting. People like to bet in cash either at the racecourse or at betting offices. Here I agree with my noble friend Lord Crawshaw that it is now generally agreed that there would have to be some form of lawful cash betting if Sunday racing were to proceed. We go further, however, and would suggest that the betting offices would need the freedom to open on Sundays if there were to be Sunday racing. The working party set up by the Jockey Club came to this same conclusion. Commonsense tells us that horseracing is too attractive a sport for punters for it to be possible to imagine racing taking place without bets being struck away from the course. If the betting offices are not open while Sunday racing goes ahead, we could be back in the days of unauthorised bookies and the industry would have taken a step backwards. Evening racing is a different proposition in this respect since the betting offices are open until 6.30 p.m. and keen punters can put their money on up till then.<lb/>
I know that many people are sceptical about arguments related to illegal betting. We note with interest, however, the evidence in the market research commissioned by the Jockey Club's working party. This found that among punters who bet more than once a month 36 per cent. said that they would seek the "unofficial channels" for betting if betting offices were not open on Sundays. Those who believe that Sunday racing should go ahead with on-course betting only will need to persuade your Lordships that these fears can be answered. We would not view sympathetically a switch to a proposal on these lines merely as a way of avoiding criticism from those who are concerned at the prospect of the betting shops opening.<lb/>
I would support the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, in saying that we should need&#x2014;and this is the second precondition to my right honourable friend's support&#x2014;a thorough public debate and the most careful preparations before a Bill could be introduced. The debate today is a step in that direction, and this needs to be built upon.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said there were those who held strong views on this matter, but I was
<col>532</col>
interested to read that his right honourable friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath, Mr. Denis Howell, has been able in his mind to separate racing on Sunday from a general change in the law on Sunday trading. He also thought that the trade union opposition could be overcome; so I am glad to see that there is some support on the Labour Benches for this.<lb/>
Your Lordships will continue to have views on the effects of such changes on the traditional Sunday. I should perhaps confirm, as my noble friend Lord Manton suggested, that not only do other major sporting events already now take place on Sundays but other forms of gambling are available: bingo clubs and casinos, for example, are already allowed to operate. Sunday racing, with betting, would not be breaking new ground in this respect.<lb/>
Your Lordships may wish to reflect on whether the advent of Sunday racing would make a decisive change in the character of Sundays or, alternatively, fit in with the character that Sundays now have, as a major leisure day for many families. Some, we know, fear that the opening of betting offices would be a prelude to a more general liberalisation toward trading on Sundays, on which views clearly differ widely. It may be worth confirming that Sunday betting would require an amendment to the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963. The Shops Act would be unaffected and the amendment would not benefit any premises other than betting offices and betting facilities at the racecourses.<lb/>
I should like to refer briefly to the Sunday Observance Act 1780. We are sometimes accused of double standards and of unfairness towards horseracing for suggesting that this Act should also be amended to cater for Sunday racing. The argument runs that we have not insisted on such a change in connection with other sports. The main point here is that other sports have been able to go ahead without needing legislation to allow for betting, since there is little if any betting associated with them. Had they needed to introduce legislation we would have suggested that the legislation also needed to remove the prohibition in the 1780 Act. That is what we say to racing now. Legislation to remove one of the obstacles to Sunday racing&#x2014;the prohibition on betting&#x2014;should deal with the other, the prohibition on charging the public for admission to sporting events on Sundays.<lb/>
To sum up, while we have no plans at present for legislation on Sunday racing, we are happy to see if progress can be made on this subject. We hope that critics will look fairly at the case which can now be made in support of Sunday racing. For our part we know of no reason why Sunday racing should not be tried&#x2014;the intention appears to be at a modest level to begin with&#x2014;and no reason why the law should continue to prohibit betting at racecourses or indeed in betting offices.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Lebanon: UNIFIL Mandate</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02238"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what is the present strength of the United Nations International Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), what prevents it from carrying out its present mandate and by how much it would need to be reinforced to provide protection for all Palestinian refugees living in camps in Lebanon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02239"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, UNIFIL's current strength is approximately 5,700. The continued Israeli military presence in southern Lebanon and the resistance this provokes among the local population have prevented the full implementation of UNIFIL's mandate. Protection of the Palestinian refugee camps is not part of UNIFIL's mandate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02240"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while UNIFIL and UNWRA have done their best under near impossible conditions, may I ask my noble friend whether she can confirm that some 140,000 Palestinian refugees are in the camps? Is not that figure probably an underestimate? Secondly, does my noble friend share the quite widely held view that there is a serious risk that the Beirut camps might be beseiged again? To try to reduce this risk and dissuade Israel from terror raids on Ein Hilwe which has 30,000 helpless occupants, will the Government co-operate with the European Community in raising these questions in the Security Council?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02241"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confirm that the number of refugees in the camps is approximately as my noble friend has described, but the total number is higher. I should not want to speculate on whether or not the camps might be beseiged again, as I believe my noble friend will understand. The Security Council is fully seized of the problem. We, as the Government,
<col>536</col>
have supported the Security Council statements of 13th February and 19th March calling for a ceasefire and for the relief agencies to be allowed access to the camps.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02242"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, against this tragic background, is the noble Baroness aware that Mr. Shimon Peres said recently that Israel fully supports UNIFIL and is further prepared to enter into negotiations with the Lebanon or with any other relevant partner in the area under the authority of Resolutions 242 and 338? To what extent do Her Majesty's Government support that initiative and what are they doing about it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02243"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have argued and said to Israel that she should complete the withdrawal from the Lebanon to enable UNIFIL to deploy to the international border because we recognise the valuable work that UNIFIL is doing. As I believe the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, will know, our own position and that of the Community is based on the ministerial statement of 23rd February in which we expressed support in principle for an international conference as a framework for negotiations between the parties directly concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02244"><member>Lord Bottomley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the best way of easing the Palestine refugee situation be for their leader Arafat to recognise the state of Israel and also to indicate that the peace talks suggested by the Israeli Labour party leader have his full support?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02245"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, will be fully aware of the British Government's policy, which is based on the recognition of the state of Israel and the Palestinian's right to exist.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02246"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, apropos the stated support of Israel for UNIFIL, can the Government confirm that Israel is the only neighbour of Lebanon which is blamed by UNIFIL in its most recent six-monthly report to the United Nations and that to help Israel withdraw, as UNIFIL and we have asked, to its own border, it would be a good idea if whoever it is were to stop firing <i>katyushas</i> at them out of the area that they now occupy?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02247"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I answered in a previous question, the British Government's view is quite clear. We have urged Israel to complete withdrawal from the Lebanon to enable UNIFIL, whose work in very difficult circumstances we admire, to be deployed to the international border.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02248"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Baroness not agree that, as with the invasion of Afghanistan, which this House has rightly condemned, so we ought to condemn the behaviour of the Israelis in south Lebanon where they have blatantly ignored the unanimous decision of Security Council Resolutions 408 and 409? We cannot say in this House that we support only resolutions of the Security Council that are against the Soviet Union.<lb/>
Is the noble Baroness aware of the appalling reports in our British press of the slaying of men, women and
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0277"/>
<col>537</col>
young children in south Lebanon by Israeli air forces allegedly attacking terrorists? Should we not raise our voice and make clear that, as with Afghanistan, we deplore this sort of behaviour?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02249"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think I would draw an analogy between the situation in the Lebanon and that in Afghanistan. The position of the British Government is as I have described it. We do not in any way condone the Israeli raids and the naval shelling of targets in southern Lebanon. The Israelis are well aware of our view that such actions only add to the cycle of violence in the area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02250"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we warmly welcome the initiative of Her Majesty's Government towards a conference. Taking that side by side with the offer of Mr. Shimon Peres for talks, can the noble Baroness say what progress has been made in connection with the initiative and is there any hope that a conference on these appalling problems can be held soon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02251"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with what the noble Lord says about our wish for an international conference. Indeed we have made our view quite clear. We want to encourage and assist the parties to narrow the gap both on participation in the conference and on modalities so that a conference can be convened with a realistic chance of success. We have held important discussions with the parties and my right honourable friend the Prime Minister discussed the issue with King Hussein on 9th April.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02252"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the threat to the Palestinians in the Beirut camps comes from the Amal militia? Is she aware that the Amal are armed with tanks and artillery and that, quite apart from its mandate, UNIFIL would as at present constituted be quite unable to provide the protection which we should all like to see provided?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02253"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept the noble Lord's point that UNIFIL is not the right body to protect the camps in that sense. Its mandate does not cover their protection. We all share his widespread horror at the suffering that has been inflicted on the civilian population by the violence in the Lebanon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02254"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the question of the recognition of Israel by Arafat has been raised, though that was not the object of my Question, would it not help a good deal if the Israeli Government ceased to look with total disdain on binding Security Council resolutions requiring their withdrawal from the occupied territories?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02255"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend will understand that I do not wish to get drawn further into this. The position is as I have stated it and it is built on Security Council Resolution 242.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Football Hooliganism</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02256">2.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02257"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
<col>538</col>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether there has been a reduction in the incidence of football hooliganism during the 1986&#x2013;87 season compared with recent years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02258"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a detailed assessment of the incidence of football hooliganism will be made later this month following the completion of the Football League programme of matches. The Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales will provide my right honourable friend the Home Secretary with statistics on attendances. arrests and ejections at Football League matches and with its assessment of the position in relation to previous years. He will announce the result of this appraisal in due course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02259"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that reply. Will he pass to the police congratulations on finding and bringing to trial the gang of five who were sentenced yesterday? Can he confirm that television video recordings have helped to identify the perpetrators of violence and that this could be a lesson and a warning to others who might be tempted to cause trouble?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02260"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that question and I do so agree with him that the police officers involved deserve the highest praise for bringing a very difficult operation to a successful conclusion. We hope that this will be a warning to potential troublemakers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02261"><member>Lord Hunt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister tell the House whether the imposition of attendance centre orders, whether senior or junior, which have to be served on Saturday afternoons have had a beneficial effect on the perpetrators of football hooliganism?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02262"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there is an attendance order on somebody who might cause trouble at a football ground and he is not allowed to cause trouble as a result of it, that surely must be beneficial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02263"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether when the statistics are published they will include information about hooliganism by British subjects abroad? Can he also say whether they will give an indication of the number of lives lost as a result of this hooliganism?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02264"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure to what extent the statistics will contain the information that my noble friend wants, but I shall draw the points he makes to the attention of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02265"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will similar statistics be produced by the Secretary of State for Scotland in relation to Scotland? If they are, they will show quite clearly that what we are dealing with here as evidenced in the courts is an English disease. Is the noble Earl aware that there has been nothing but praise for the behaviour of the Scottish supporters who went to Gothenburg just the other week?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0278"/>
<col>539</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02266"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no objective assessment has yet been made for the current session in Scotland, but I agree with the noble Lord that the preliminary view is that improvement in football crowd behaviour have been maintained this season. It should be noted that there has been a considerable increase in attendances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02267"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in joining in the general congratulations from these Benches both to the police and to the Scots, will the noble Earl inform the House whether from the reports that he has received so far it looks as though the alcohol provisions which came into recent legislation passed by Parliament have helped in keeping down hooliganism at football grounds?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02268"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we firmly believe that the legislation that this House passed not so long ago has been an enormous contribution. It was the police view earlier in the year that the welcome improvement in behaviour last season has generally been maintained this season.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02269"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend also agree that the earlier legislation which banned drink at football grounds in Scotland showed the way and indicated that this would give rise to considerable improvement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02270"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as so often happens, England has followed the lead of Scotland in this field.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02271"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Earl agree that, of all the elements that can assist in reducing hooliganism, the supporters' clubs have a major part to play? While I understand the Minister saying that they have been part of the consultation process, will he not agree that concentration on encouraging supporters' clubs to be more vigilant not only about their members but about non-members whom they can identify would go a long way to reducing hooliganism?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02272"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton. Of course we wish to give support to the supporters' clubs because anything that can reduce violence and hooliganism at football matches must be encouraged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02273"><member>The Viscount of Falkland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to the widely accepted connection between under-age drinking and football hooliganism, is the Minister generally satisfied with the enforcement of the laws against under-age drinking which leads to these abuses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02274"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the word "generally" takes the noble Viscount's question rather wide of the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Restart Programme: Statistics</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02275">2.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02276"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
<col>540</col>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what percentage of the registered unemployed so far interviewed under the restart programme have been removed from the register and for what categories of reasons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02277"><member>The Secretary of State for Employment (Lord Young of Graffham)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no one with a legitimate claim to benefit has been removed from the unemployment count after a restart interview.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02278"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has got into the habit of not answering the Question I ask. Will he confirm that in the letters sent to the recipients of this restart programme one sentence reads:
<quote>"People who do not attend interviews without good cause may lose their benefit"?</quote>
Can he tell the House how many of those who were called to interview and did not attend lost their benefit as a consequence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02279"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have no doubt the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, is perfectly well aware, being available for work has been a condition of unemployment benefit since 1947. It was re-enacted in legislation in 1975, a date that the noble Lord may recognise as being a year when this particular Government were not in power. I believe that some 8,000 or so people have not appeared and therefore have lost their benefit, but I shall check on the figure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02280"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the past the noble Lord has referred to this scheme as a gateway. Does he recall that in January 84 per cent. of those interviewed under the scheme did not proceed any further? They stayed unemployed. About 1 per cent. succeeded in getting jobs. Can the noble Lord say whether there has been any improvement in that situation since January?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02281"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I have said to your Lordships' House&#x2014;and it appears that I may have to say it yet again to noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that this restart programme, which has interviewed 1.6 million people since it was introduced, is about helping unemployed people back into work; people whom I suspect noble Lords opposite would be quite happy to see receive benefit, and allowed to rot. I say this advisedly because we have found that the only way in which we can help those who have been discouraged from finding work because they perceive that it is difficult to find work is to bring them to an interview.<lb/>
It is remarkable that 1 per cent. of those people go into jobs as a result of that interview. However, I must tell your Lordships that 89 per cent. of people attending restart interviews receive an offer of some sort to help them back into work; 73 per cent. accept that offer. We have to recognise that we have reversed the direction of long-term unemployment, as indeed we have reversed the direction of unemployment as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02282"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord agree that the figure he has just given us of 73 per cent.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0279"/>
<col>541</col>
taking some route to employment underlines the fact that the long-term unemployed are emphatically genuinely seeking employment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02283"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have never in any way implied that those who have been out of work for a long time are not genuinely seeking employment. However, it appears that many of them have given up looking for employment and therefore it is important to bring them back. I also know that one in four of those seeking work&#x2014;some 340,000 people&#x2014;suffer from lack of skills of literacy and numeracy, and this makes their looking for work extremely difficult. There are many problems that we have to solve, and I believe that we are on the way to doing so.<lb/>
Perhaps it will give noble Lords opposite comfort to know that I have read the following in a document called <i>New Skills for Britain</i>, which the Labour Party published on 19th March 1987:
<quote>"We will seek to bring together the restart counselling programme and other initiatives under the general rubric of the jobs, enterprise and training programme".</quote>
I see little difference between that and what this Government are actually doing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02284"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord does not have the figures with him that may be understandable, but under the restart scheme is it possible that people who do not apply can have their unemployment benefit stopped? Is there any appeal for them if that course is undertaken by officialdom?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02285"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is perfectly possible that those who do not attend an interview can have their benefit stopped. That is possible because the condition for receiving benefit is that they should be available for work. Surely if people are available for work, they should also be available to attend a meeting at a job centre. Those who have been referred for failing to attend the interview comprise some 6 per cent. It so happens that at the end of the day 0.8 per cent. are actually disallowed for failing to attend the interview. I believe that this is a very small percentage of all those attending the restart interview. Restart is about helping long-term unemployed people back into work. It is not about anything else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02286"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Secretary of State in a position to tell us how many long-term unemployed people have so far been helped back to work as a result of the additional job-start interviews now available at six-monthly intervals, to which he referred in his Statement to the House on 28th January last?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02287"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a little early to say because these six-monthly interviews started only a week or two ago&#x2014;in the main after Easter. I can tell your Lordships' House that some 320,764 people&#x2014;some 20 per cent. of those written to&#x2014;have left the register after receiving a letter from the Manpower Services Commission. Some 187,229, or 12 per cent., have left after having had an interview. I would not for one moment claim that all of this is a result of the restart programme because, although
<col>542</col>
noble Lords opposite often find it difficult to understand, many people leave the register in any event. We should not wish to take credit for any reduction in unemployment that we did not ourselves create.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02288"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Secretary of State says that he does not understand the difference between the Labour Party's policy on unemployment and his own policy. Is he aware, or will he confirm, that since this Government came to office in 1979 the staff of the jobcentres has been decreased by 2,000 during a period in which unemployment has trebled? Will he also confirm that when the restart programme was begun only 1,800 were employed to conduct the interviews? As a result of both these figures long queues have formed. Does he not understand that the Labour Party will ensure that those programmes which are put forward by a Labour Government will be adequately staffed and will not cut down to the detriment of the unemployed themselves?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02289"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the kindest way in which I can describe the assertions put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, is to say that they are total nonsense. We have substantially increased the staff of the jobcentres. We are well aware of how to conduct the restart interviews. No queues develop because interviews are by appointment. There may be an occasional short queue due to sickness or illness. We managed to interview 1.6 million people by the due date. If it is any consolation, what I saw in the Labour Party proposals&#x2014;I know full well the distinction between that document and our programmes&#x2014;is the general affirmation that restart is a sensible, practical way to help the long-term unemployed. It is only the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, who, I suspect, still tries to make this a party matter. Let us on all sides of the House agree that the unemployed deserve to be helped and should be helped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02290"><member>The Countess of Mar</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say whether inquiries have been made of the people who fail to attend an interview before they are disqualified from benefit? If inquiries are made, what reasons are given?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02291"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, many inquiries are made: there is an appeals procedure by an independent officer. That is why some 6 per cent. of people were referred to the officer for failing to attend for interview and only 0.8 per cent. were ultimately disqualified.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02292">3.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02293"><member>Lord Rodney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what action they are contemplating in view of the growing public concern arising out of the recent "Panorama" programme featuring the Cult of Scientology.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0280"/>
<col>543</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02294"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we think that the "Panorama" programme illustrated again the unpleasant and ludicrous character of Scientology. We are, however, aware of no particular need to take action over the British part of the organisation at this stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02295"><member>Lord Rodney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank my noble friend for that Answer which I do not find satisfactory. I would not go so far as describing Scientology as "ludicrous". It is much more serious than that. In view of the fact that this cult and others are international and cross national frontiers, will Her Majesty's Government consider liaising with other governments on the possibility of controlling and containing these organisations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02296"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that my noble friend suggests that there must be international co-operation when there is an allegation of criminal behaviour. Of course I support him in that; criminal behaviour is a matter for the police.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02297"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the question of civil liberties may arise in regard to questions of this kind, perhaps I may ask this question. Can the noble Earl assure the House that there is no question of Scientology, or any allied cause, achieving charitable status in this country? If that is not the position have the Government any plans to alter the charity law in order to make such a position impossible?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02298"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon; but there must always be a balance between freedom of expression and practice within the law on the one hand the need to safeguard from abuse the basic freedom of members of society on the other. We shall continue to watch that position with care. With regard to his second point on charitable status, I confirm that Scientology is not a charity, and that we have no proposals to change the position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02299"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are over 100 such religious cults operating in this country, coming mostly from America? They exercise the most pernicious influence on our society, especially on family life, separating children from parents and making huge profits and fortunes for their founders. In these circumstances, is it not high time that there should be legislation to curb their activities, for example, by a licensing system under which they could be struck off if guilty of practices harmful to the state?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02300"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, and I am sure the House, are well aware of the concern of the noble and learned Lord in this matter, and of his great knowledge in respect of it. He used the word "religious"; but I should put that word in inverted commas after watching the "Panorama" programme, where there seemed to be no qualification to claim that title. The noble and learned Lord also used the word "children". So far as we can detect, Scientology has been careful not to attract children, because if it did it would break the law and there would be a criminal
<col>544</col>
offence where action must be taken. It appears to be concentrating upon obtaining money and members from the older generation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02301"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, bearing in mind the shadowy and nebulous nature of cults, will Her Majesty's Government consider maintaining so far as possible a register of the cults which are known to the Home Office in order to carry out that suggestion?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02302"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that we in the Home Office are aware of most of the cults operating in this country and we shall watch the position. However, if there is an allegation of criminal behaviour, I repeat that action will be taken by the police in the usual way.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02313">3.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02314">Report received.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02315">Clause 1 [<i>Liability of carriers for passengers without proper documents</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02316"><member>Lord Airedale</member> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02317">Page 1, line 15, leave out ("the sum of &#x00A3;1,000 or") and insert ("a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;1,000 or not exceeding")</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02318">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the penalty in the Bill is described as being "the sum of &#x00A3;1,000". In Committee your Lordships seemed to be of the opinion that it was &#x00A3;1,000 or nothing in every case. I ventured to suggest that that appeared to be a piece of rigidity and did not enable the Home Secretary to demand a penalty lower than &#x00A3;1,000 if there were extenuating circumstances. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, expressed the view that surely it must be open to the Home Secretary to demand a lower penalty in an appropriate case. I take that to be the Government's opinion. If that is so, why not say so in the Bill by using the conventional words?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02319">The conventional method of drafting a maximum penalty is surely to say, "a sum not exceeding so much". Then the matter is perfectly clear. To abandon the convention means that people may be left in doubt as to whether they really are faced here with a maximum penalty or a fixed penalty. The amendment removes any ambiguity, and I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02320"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the amendment and at the same time apologise to your Lordships for being unable to attend the Committee stage of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that I shall not be too guilty of repeating arguments already adduced. However, I am bound to tell your Lordships that a careful reading of the Committee proceedings proved disappointing. Although many eloquent speeches were
<col>546</col>
made, it seemed that the Bill was being rushed headlong through this House&#x2014;with all its defects both of principle and of practical working unrepaired&#x2014;as happened in the other place.<lb/>
It is unfortunate, although one knows how anxious governments are to complete their business, that this Bill should be one of those to be rushed through. It is wholly wrong that, on the one hand, there is this concept of a fixed penalty, as the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, said. but that later in the Bill the word "prescribed" gives the Secretary of State vast powers by statutory instrument to change the amount to any sum that he cares to think about.<lb/>
The whole concept is one of placing on carriers an obligation that is properly that of the Government. The question of who shall, and who shall not, come into the country ought to be exercised by servants of the Crown under the jurisdiction of Parliament. It should not be left as the responsibility of individual carriers who may well incur substantial costs. I should have thought that the matter would give rise to considerable international difficulty in the European Community. I wonder whether the International Air Transport Authority has been consulted and what it has said. This is an additional obligation on the air carriers in respect of which substantial costs could be incurred. I wonder how well the exercising of this right on the territory of other sovereign states will go down among the international community. It seems to me that all this should be looked at very much more carefully.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02321"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have a small point on this amendment but before raising it I must say how very sorry I am that the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, was not able to be present with us last Thursday. The point about this amendment concerns multiple landings. It seems to me that a carrier might well feel it right to bring 10, 20 or even 50 people of one category at one time. I cannot believe it is right that the carrier's fine should be multiplied by the number of passengers. This would be punishing him for one miscalculation&#x2014;or perhaps one act of mercy&#x2014;in a quite excessive way.<lb/>
Had we time, I am sure the noble Earl would agree to look sympathetically at this problem. Even in the present somewhat feverish climate, I suggest that if he found it possible to do that it would gain him great credit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02322">3.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02323"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord McNair, looks at Clause 1, he will agree, I think, that there is no question of multiples because the maximum of &#x00A3;1,000&#x2014;the liability to pay on demand&#x2014;is related to a person; so it is as regards each person a maximum of &#x00A3;1,000.<lb/>
As regards the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, my noble friend the Minister said rightly on the last occasion that the Secretary of State would have power under this wording (as indeed he has) to make a demand of a sum less than &#x00A3;1,000. That really is the scope of the amendment.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mulley, has raised a question which affects the structure of the Bill. That is quite beyond this amendment, but perhaps it ought to be
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0282"/>
<col>547</col>
dealt with very shortly. The structure of the Bill affords totally adequate safeguards for the carrier, but not of course if he ignores the legislation. Indeed, on Second Reading, at col. 878, it was apparent from the Sealink document that certain carriers had threatened this.<lb/>
It does not seem to be appreciated by the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, that under the Bill there is no obligation to pay the fine on demand. There is only the liability to pay which can be challenged, and challenged on judicial review, on the basis that it has not been reasonably demanded because there has been no contravention of Clause 1 (1) or, for example, the Secretary of State, in breach of natural justice, has failed to hear representations that, on embarkation for the United Kingdom, apparently genuine documents were provided.<lb/>
At the end of the day the liability to pay on demand can never be converted into an obligation because, if the carrier refuses to pay, that lies within the province of the civil court. There, the Secretary of State, in the ordinary way, must make good his case on the evidence. With all these safeguards, surely there is no objection to the structure, as raised by the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, and there is no basis in the substance of the amendment, although I accept that the two are not related.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02324"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that your Lordships will not accept this amendment. The Bill is absolutely all right as it stands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02325"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what a succinct and learned observation from the noble and learned Lord&#x0021; It is equivalent to the most lengthy and eloquent speech. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, will forgive me if I say that in extending the ambit of this amendment some confusion has possibly been infused into the debate. As I understood it, there was a simple amendment which was answered very clearly&#x2014;or not so clearly&#x2014;by the Minister; namely, that the penalty of &#x00A3;1,000 had not to be exacted in every case and that it was within the power of the Secretary of State to exact a penalty of a lesser sum if he so decided.<lb/>
The noble Earl, has been kind enough on many occasions to give me hints from the Front Bench opposite. And he is giving me such a hint now. I am going to take advantage of it; and I shall ask the House to say this. If there is not a categorical assurance that the Secretary of State has the power to exact a lesser penalty, I believe the House will be in favour of this amendment. There is a clog, if I may put it that way, on the discretion we would want to give to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
To give an example, would it not be quite absurd, where there was a flagrant case of a carrier making a profit out of some poor individual because he hoped that the man could somehow be smuggled through and he could not care less once he had arrived at our shores or our airports, if all that could be exacted by way of a penalty was &#x00A3;1,000?<lb/>
Then there is the second case in which there is a little culpability in regard to the carrier who brings the passenger over. He ought to have seen that the
<col>548</col>
passport constituted a forgery but he employed an official who was less intelligent than was required in order to look at the passports and the passport had passed the scrutiny of that individual. Therefore, in order to teach the carrier that in future he ought to take a little more care about the officials whom he appoints to examine the passports, the Secretary of State decides to exact a small penalty. If that was not within his power, one would have the injustice or perhaps the complete nonsense that either the Secretary of State has to exact the same penalty against the most culpable character, as he does against the carrier whose story I have just told or, if he does not do that, then he cannot exact a penalty at all.<lb/>
That cannot be right. Quite frankly&#x2014;and if I am in error I am in very good company because the noble and learned Lord assented to my proposition on the last occasion&#x2014;I assumed that the Secretary of State would have the power to exact a lighter penalty. If the advice given to the Minister is contrary to that assumption, this amendment must be right.<lb/>
I do not think that this discussion ought to go into the question of the powers of the courts to look into the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway&#x2014;and I say this with deep deference&#x2014;knows that I hold very different views from his regarding the powers of the courts to look into the evidence that causes the Minister to exact a penalty. I do not wish to debate this matter at this stage because it is irrelevant to this amendment, but I think that the only power of a county court, should a Minister try to sue for his penalty, would be to decide whether the Minister had gone through the right motions; it could not go into the question whether discretion had been correctly exercised.<lb/>
What I have said in regard to this amendment and this penalty is rather material, if I may put it that way, and I think that the sensible way to proceed now is to listen to the Minister's reply as a result of the advice given to him about the Secretary of State's powers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02326"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the disadvantage of not having any legal training and not being a lawyer in any sense. I ask this question purely for my own information and possibly to assist other noble Lords who suffer from the same disadvantage. What does the word "prescribe" mean? Does it mean that at any moment the Secretary of State can write down or promulgate a different fine in a particular case, or does it mean what it seems to mean to one with a very distant classical education, that it must be written down beforehand? In other words, does it mean that if, because of inflation, he wishes to change the sum of &#x00A3;1,000 he can announce that in future the sum will be &#x00A3;2,000 or, if matters go in a different direction, that it will be &#x00A3;500?<lb/>
If it means that he must announce in advance the amount of the fine, it seems to me that my noble friend Lord Airedale has a very good point. On the other hand, if it means that on a mere motion or whim he can prescribe any level of fine that we wants, whether it be higher or lower, then there is no need for this amendment. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me on that point.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0283"/>
<col>549</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02327"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this amendment would allow a carrier who was liable to a charge under the Bill to be charged a sum of up to &#x00A3;1,000, that sum presumably being decided by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.<lb/>
At this point I think it is worth confirming that my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway was absolutely right when he said that in theory there was a possibility of collecting only part of a penalty and forgoing the rest. Surely it is unreal to consider whether the facts require a penalty of less than &#x00A3;1,000. Either the facts justify forgoing the whole of the penalty or the penalty provided by Parliament should be collected. In theory, my right honourable friend could collect less than &#x00A3;1,000, but we believe that it would be wrong for carriers to be under the misapprehension that they might not be charged the full amount. In a matter of this kind that surely is the simplest, fairest and most direct procedure.<lb/>
As at present drafted, the Bill allows liability to be established precisely and clearly. That liability is known and can be well understood both by the carrier and by the Home Secretary.<lb/>
By making the charge infinitely variable up to &#x00A3;1,000 it would be impossible for the carrier to know his liability. It would require infinitely delicate judgments to be made by the Home Secretary as he tried to compare one circumstance with another and developed a sliding scale of charges. It would be an invitation to dispute and dissatisfaction as the carrier sought to argue that a lesser charge should be imposed.<lb/>
Nor is it at all clear on what basis the Secretary of State should make those judgments. Should it be on the assumed culpability of the carrier&#x2014;a matter of no doubt endless dispute&#x2014;or on some judgment of the nature or undesirability of the passengers which I am not sure would find favour in all parts of this House? Or should it be a reflection of the seriousness of any immigration control issue which might arise?<lb/>
No, my Lords, the amendment would be of no assistance to the carrier, nor to the passenger, nor indeed to the Home Secretary, and it would mistakenly suggest that the Bill was the place to draw up a league table of unacceptability. That is not the purpose of this Bill. The principle behind the Bill is that if a passenger requires leave to enter, does not have the documents required by the legislation but is nevertheless brought to this country by the carrier, the carrier is liable except for the specific savings in subsections (2) and (4) of Clause 1 of the Bill. Neither the Home Secretary nor the carrier should be encouraged to try to make judgments on whether, in any particular circumstances, a lesser payment would be appropriate.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Airedale, asked: "What about extenuating circumstances?" At this point I shall draw to his attention the fact that if the Home Secretary thinks that it would not be reasonable to charge a carrier, he should have the courage of his convictions and exercise discretion fully and wholeheartedly. Indeed, I can confirm, as probably the noble Lord heard at the Committee stage, that my right honourable friend has already done so.<lb/>
Therefore we believe that it is best that the charge under this Bill should be an all or nothing charge, with
<col>550</col>
the proviso, which is already in Clause 1(3) of the Bill, that if the charge needs to be changed up or down, it should be possible to change it by statutory instrument. On that basis I invite your Lordships not to accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02328"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister sits down, for my clarification at all events if not to assist other Members of your Lordships' House, I wonder whether he would explain his remark that theoretically the Secretary of State could exact a lesser penalty? I took note of his words. Either he has the power to charge a lesser sum under an Act of Parliament, which is a very pragmatic proceeding, or he has not. I do not understand the use of the word "theoretically". Will he clarify this important matter&#x2014;and say what will happen in the circumstances that I ventured to outline to your Lordships; namely, the case in which somebody has acted flagrantly in carrying somebody and made a huge profit out of it, and the case where a carrier employs a not too intelligent official who happens to think that a passport is genuine when it is in fact an obvious forgery? Does that mean that the Secretary of State has to exact precisely the same penalty in both cases or that he does not exact a penalty at all? Or is the Minister saying that there is the power to charge less and to exact a lower penalty, and that that is what he terms "theoretically"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02329"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord asked me whether the Secretary of State has the power to vary the penalty. Yes, he has. But we believe that it should be an all or nothing charge, because that at least makes it absolutely clear, to solve all the uncertainties&#x2014;and I highlighted but a few in my response to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Airedale. We must make it absolutely clear to the carrier and to the passenger, and for the sake of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, that this must be a &#x00A3;1,000 fine. If there are mitigating circumstances, then of course my right honourable friend can use the discretion that he has available to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02330"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely unhappy with the argument put forward by the Minister. It seems to go like this. This is a maximum penalty and not a fixed penalty, but we are not going to say so in the Act of Parliament because we want the carriers to suppose that it will be &#x00A3;1,000 every time. I do not believe that that is a strictly honest way to draft an Act of Parliament. If this is a maximum penalty, which we now know it is, the Act of Parliament ought to say so.<lb/>
It should be open to the carrier to say to himself: "Because of the particular circumstances of this case, even if I am found to be wrong, I shall not be charged the maximum penalty." He ought to be allowed to know that. This furtive idea of concealing in an Act of Parliament that a maximum penalty is a maximum and not a fixed penalty I simply do not think is the right way to proceed in drafting a statute.<lb/>
If we were not in the feverish circumstances today that were described by my noble friend Lord McNair, I should feel very strongly inclined to take this matter to a Division. I am very unhappy about it&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02331"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: Why not?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0284"/>
<col>551</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02332"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am now being encouraged to think the other way. Very well, I cannot prevent noble Lords taking this matter to a Division if they so choose. That being so, I think perhaps we had better test it in a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02333"><member>Lord Trafford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, it seems to me that a very strange argument is being produced here&#x2014;a fixed penalty for a fixed crime; that is to say, the failure of the carrier to carry out his responsibilities. The suggestion opposite is that if the carrier employs incompetent people in some parts of the world, or has shortsighted or defective officials, this is in some way an excuse. If there is one fixed maximum penalty, everybody knows where he stands. If there is a range of penalties, you could have a variety of semi-intelligent officials or a variety of defective employees who could be blamed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02334"><member>Lord Mischcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not think it discourteous of me and forgive me if I intervened only so that the House has in my view&#x2014;a respectful view, I assure the House&#x2014;a clear picture? The Minister is saying to the House, as I understand it, that this is not a fixed penalty. The words mean that the Secretary of State could exact a lower penalty if he wanted to. But we want to give the impression to the carriers that if they offend against this Bill they will have a penalty of &#x00A3;1,000. He is conceding that the Secretary of State may in certain circumstances award a lower penalty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02335"><member>Lord Trafford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand fully the noble Lord's point, which is that under very special circumstances the discretion of the Secretary of State might apply. I am suggesting that to put in an amendment such as this, which is to give effect to certain types of argument put forward which I was outlining, would be an error. Although I accept that the Secretary of State's discretion is perfectly satisfactory in this field, to suggest to carriers that there are many gradations of competence of their employees, or for any other reason that may explain how they could get away with it, would be an error.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02339">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02340">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02341"><member>Lord McNair</member> moved Amendment No. 2:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02342">Page 1, line 21, at end insert&#x2014;
<quote>("() No liability shall be incurred under subsection (1) above in respect of any person whom the owners or agents are obliged to carry as a result of an order from a foreign Government.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02343">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 2. Since Committee stage I have somewhat changed my ground. In my interventions then I was pleading the case of refugees, or people in grave and immediate danger. Today I plead the cause of the carriers. I must admit that the cause of the refugees is a little closer to my heart than that of the carriers, but I insist that there must be justice for the rich as well as for the poor and that it is just as wrong that a Bill which inflicts injustice on airlines and shipping lines should pass unamended through this House as one which inflicts injustice and perhaps danger on individuals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02344">The amendment suggests that a carrier should not be fined for bringing someone here with imperfect documentation if he does so at the order of a foreign government. It does not mean that we are obliged to accept the passenger. It does not prevent us from ordering a carrier to return the passenger at his, the carrier's, expense after paying the bill for that passenger's board and lodging during his sojourn in this country, both of which powers the Home Secretary already has without the help of this Bill. This only says that he should not be fined for doing something which he was ordered to do by a foreign power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02345">At Committee stage this amendment was moved by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. He withdrew it so that he, I and others could consider the arguments which had been brought against it and decide whether to resubmit it. We came to the conclusion that the arguments were so lacking in logic and even in plausibility that we owed it to the carriers to try again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02346">In reading the <i>Official Report</i> my attention was first caught by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, which was not, I must
<col>554</col>
regretfully say, one of his most cogent contributions. He stated in column 265:
<quote>"a government of one sovereign state is not obliged to recognise the order of another sovereign state save as bound by convention or treaty to which both states are parties".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02347">As a statement of international law I would not presume to question that opinion. I merely point out that the amendment concerns whether an airline, not a sovereign state, is obliged to recognise that order of a state from which it is operating. We expect airlines operating from this country to do so when we give them orders. But this is a relatively minor point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02348">Following the passage which I quoted, the noble Lord continued:
<quote>"In the absence of acceptance of the principle on a reciprocal basis by some further protocol to the convention on refugees by the signatory states, we could very soon, at the behest or order of a foreign government, become the dumping depot of deportees; and deportees not only from the signatory states, who are all member states of the Council of Europe, which is pretty wide, but states anywhere in the world".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02349">If that passage contains any slip of the tongue or lapse of memory&#x2014;aberrations to which I am more prone than most people&#x2014;I should not wish to make any capital out of such a human failing, but the passage contains at least one major misconception and at least one most uncharacteristic misstatement of fact.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02350">First, the amendment did not mention refugees or the 1951 convention. Secondly, even if relevant to the amendment the convention had nothing whatever to do with the Council of Europe. I do not think the Council of Europe was even established in 1951. The phrase:
<quote>"and deportees not only from the signatory states, who are all members states of the Council of Europe",</quote>
must be either a failure of memory or a slip of the tongue. There are 21 member states of the Council of Europe. There are about 100 signatories of the convention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02351">As the passages I have quoted constituted the main gist or kernel of the speech of the noble and learned Lord, I cannot feel that it provided any very good reason why we should not resubmit the amendment today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02352">I turn now to the very short intervention from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning:
<quote>"What foreign government are we considering here? It may be a highly civilised one or it might be General Amin in East Africa. Is a shipping or airline company entitled to obey General Amin and carry someone to this country? No, I do not accept that."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>,7.5.87; col. 266.]</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02353">I re-quote:
<quote>"Is a shipping or airline company entitled to obey General Amin and carry someone to this country?"</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02354">How lucky we are that the noble and learned Lord was not operating an airline out of Entebbe when General Amin was in power. I fear that if he had been and he had felt entitled to disobey any orders that came his way he would not have lived to enrich this House with the fruits of his limitless experience and wisdom as he so frequently does.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02355">It is surely putting an intolerable burden on carriers to expect them to ask themselves whether or not the government who are giving them orders are civilised and to risk the consequences of disobedience if they decide that they are not.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0286"/>
<col>555</col>
Last, but far from least, I come to the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, which contained six lines that I should like to read out and on which I should like to ask him a question. I quote:
<quote>"It would be possible for an unscrupulous carrier to argue that he had been compelled to carry someone when that was not really so. Given the many different systems of immigration control operating throughout the world, it would be quite impossible for the immigration service to check out such claims."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7.5.87; col. 266.]</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02356">I repeat the quote:
<quote>"impossible for the immigration service to check out such claims."</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02357">What is meant here by the immigration service? That is surely an arm of the Home Office The noble Earl could not have been referring to an immigration officer at Heathrow, for example, whose job, as I understand it, is to examine passengers' papers and, if he finds them out of order, to detain the passenger and inform the Home Office. Would it not be the immigration service within the Home Office to which he would report? Yet we have the noble Earl's word for it that it would be quite impossible for the immigration service to check out such claims. I await the noble Earl's comments on that point; but I should be prepared to risk a bet that in his answer and in his reply to the amendment generally he will rely fairly heavily on the famous discretion of the Home Secretary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02358">In a speech occupying less than one column of <i>Hansard</i> the noble Earl used the word "discretion" no fewer than six times. We have heard it again and again throughout the passage of the Bill and even today. That led me to do a little mental doodling over the week-end about the word "discretion".</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02359">It is said that the better part of valour is discretion. I dismiss that and all similar quotations because that would be pure semantic gamesmanship and unworthy of this House as in those famous lines the word "discretion" is being used in a quite different sense to the one in which we are using it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02360">Then my invaluable dictionary produced a most apt and striking quotation. It comes from a speech in a law court in 1780. The advocate was one Lord Camden who was speaking about the discretion of a judge. However, I do not think that that invalidates the quotation because the Home Secretary, in theory, or his officials in fact, will surely be acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when they make their decisions under the Bill. Lord Camden had this to say:
<quote>"The discretion of a judge is the law of tyrants: it is always unknown. It is different in different men. It is casual, and depends upon constitution; temper, passion. In the best it is oftentimes caprice; in the worst it is every vice, folly and passion to which human nature is liable."</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02361">I shall not go quite so far as that&#x2014;certainly not when discussing the right honourable gentleman, the present Home Secretary. However, do not Lord Camden's words contain a warning which we should heed?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02362">For a very long time we have been piling more and more burdens on the discretion of Secretaries of State. That may be due to the increasing complexity of life; it may be inevitable, but it can sometimes amount to legislative laziness. Instead of getting it right in the Bill we say: "It is too difficult, let us leave it to the discretion of the Secretary of State."</p>
<col>556</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02363">My last point is a question about a lamentable phenomenon of recent years which has come to be known as the "refugee in orbit". That is not a very apt description of what happens because it is really more a grim inter-governmental game of ping-pong with a human ball, two governments who are in dispute and a carrier who carries somebody to and fro. What happens all too often&#x2014;I admit that this is not strictly relevant to the amendment, though very much so to the Bill&#x2014;is that the carrier gets fed up and offloads his unwanted passenger at some intermediate refuelling station from which he is all too likely to be sent back to the country from which he is fleeing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02364">However, in the ordinary case of to and fro, is the carrier liable to be fined every time he tries to get rid of his unwanted passenger? Surely repeated fines for the same passenger are unthinkable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02365">I hope that I have made out a case for the amendment. The Bill is unfair to carriers. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02366"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is a certain engaging naivety about the amendment which we saw equally engagingly in the speech to which we have just had the pleasure of listening. It is surely obvious to your Lordships that there are governments in various parts of the world who would be very happy to enter into covert arrangements with carriers to facilitate the transmission of unwanted migrants to this country.<lb/>
It would be only too easy for the carrier and the government to pre-arrange the whole thing and for the carrier to be furnished with impressive-looking orders, probably with a great seal on them, indicating that he had been ordered by the government of the country from which they came to carry those people.<lb/>
That is not fantasy because if your Lordships know what is happening at the moment in Europe, they will realise that that is very much part of the general picture. A great many migrants from Asia, some of themTamils, some others, are coming into Europe rather curiously through Soviet Russia and East Germany, and passing through into West Germany which passes them hastily on. I know as a fact that people in Switzerland are deeply disturbed by the number of those unwanted immigrants who come by those routes.<lb/>
It is quite obvious that those migrants have not arranged their journey themselves by so long and roundabout a route. They could not have paid for the long air passages involved in coming right round by Soviet Russia and through East Germany. It is quite obvious that there is such a trade. An amendment of this kind would leave us wide open to exactly that sort of abuse. It would make fools of the British Government if the steps which, in my view, they have rightly taken to restrict the flow of wholly unwanted immigrants were to be thwarted in this way by unfriendly governments.<lb/>
The only other point I wish to make concerns an important question of principle. We are dealing with a Bill which will be the law of this country. The amendment would enable the orders of a foreign government to override the law of this country. For centuries we have resisted any such idea. That idea has only to be stated to be seen to be monstrous. I shall not be offensive to any country and name it, because we
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0287"/>
<col>557</col>
can all think of governments who are good, bad and indifferent. But it is a monstrous idea that the orders of a foreign government can override the considered law of this country as passed through both Houses of Parliament. It is a monstrous idea and I hope that your Lordships will not waste much time on it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02367">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02368"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this amendment was considered by your Lordships as Amendment No. 6 at Committee stage on the basis of unfairness to the deportee. As the noble Lord, Lord McNair, has said that he did not find my arguments attractive on that occasion, assuredly I shall not repeat them; repetition is idle. However, I am comforted to know that my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter did not find them wholly beside the mark.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McNair, has changed his ground, as he will always frankly say. I shall change mine only to meet the changed ground that he has taken. I hope that today he will find my arguments on that changed ground a little more persuasive than they were on the original basis. As my noble friend the Minister rightly said (at col. 266 of the <i>Official Report</i>) in the passage quoted by the noble Lord, Lord McNair, and as my friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter rightly observed, this amendment would open the door to abuse between the unscrupulous carrier and the dishonest official.<lb/>
The new ground on which the amendment is put forward is that the Bill inflicts an injustice upon the carrier and that there must be justice for the carrier&#x2014;the rich&#x2014;as there is justice for the deportee. We are concerned with deportees. However, in this Bill&#x2014;there is no sense in making a mockery of it&#x2014;there is a reasonable and acceptable safeguard for the carriers who, in the words of the amendment:
<quote>"are obliged to carry as a result of an order from a foreign Government".</quote>
If there is a carrier who can satisfy the Secretary of State that there was an element of compulsion by which the voluntary exercise of his free will was overborne, it is open to the carrier who is in contravention of Clause 1 to make representations to the Secretary of State as to a benevolent exercise of administrative discretion. The person carried by the order of the foreign state is usually known as a deportee from that state. If this amendment were to be accepted and if that were so, the United Kingdom would&#x2014;as I have said and reiterate and will not withdraw&#x2014;become the dumping depot for deportees. Why?&#x2014;because, as I hope the noble Lord, Lord McNair, and your Lordships will accept, there is no similar escape clause for an unscrupulous carrier in the legislation of other member states.<lb/>
My noble friend the Minister said at Committee stage that there will be:
<quote>"cases in which the carrier can show that without any fault on his part he was compelled to carry someone",</quote>
and then discretion will be exercised under the existing regime. This Bill is merely a superimposition upon an existing regime. Your Lordships' House was given an assurance&#x2014;it is no matter for mockery&#x2014;of the due exercise of administrative discretion in such circumstances where there was no fault and where
<col>558</col>
there was compulsion. If the amendment is carried, there is no way in which serious abuse and evasion could be avoided. I hope that your Lordships will not accept the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02369"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, let me explain that I said I had shifted my ground; perhaps I should have said that I was playing a different role. I have not changed my mind at all. On Thursday last it happened that I was speaking on amendments where I was defending refugees. The amendment that we are now considering was always put forward from the point of view of carriers. I did not speak about it on Thursday. That was all I meant by saying that I had shifted my ground.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02370"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me assure the noble Lord that I have not changed my mind either. However, I tried to meet a shifted ground.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02371"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that your Lordships will not accept this amendment. There is a simple solution. If the carrier is justified or if there are good grounds for carrying a person without documents, the Secretary of State will not enforce the &#x00A3;1,000 penalty. My noble friend Lord McNair spoke about discretion. Discretion in relation to a judge dealing with a judicial matter is one thing. Here we are dealing with the discretion of the Secretary of State who, in these matters of immigration and the like, is acting in terms of an administrative and executive discretion with which he is entrusted by Parliament and by our statutes. Therefore, we should not challenge his discretion. I am not in favour of the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02372"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the attitude of the House may be very much guided by the response of the Minister. I hope that he will repeat, in even stronger terms so that they are clearly on the record, that if a carrier is carrying a passenger under a genuine government order, be it by way of deportation or whatever&#x2014;in other words, carrying him is a matter of compulsion&#x2014;there is no doubt that in a proper case the Secretary of State would exercise discretion. If I may humbly suggest it, if the Secretary of State would give that categorical assurance on the record in even clearer terms than those uttered at Committee stage, many of us may be assisted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02373"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened very carefully to the arguments that the noble Lord, Lord McNair, has put forward in support of the amendment, which is identical to the one put down at Committee stage, as my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway said.<lb/>
The Government remain of the view that this is a matter best dealt with by sensible use of the Secretary of State's discretion rather than by way of a statutory exemption. I readily accept that there will be circumstances when a carrier, through no fault of his own, has no option but to comply with the order of a foreign government to carry a passenger to this country. That is not to say that the United Kingdom is bound to accept that person. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway rightly pointed out during the Committee stage that a sovereign state is not bound to
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0288"/>
<col>559</col>
recognise the order of another state except as may be provided by treaty or other agreement. But clearly the carrier may be bound to accept such an order and it is the carrier at whom this amendment is directed.<lb/>
The difficulty is that it would give a very wide saving for carriers and provide considerable scope for abuse. The foreign government order might be a result of the carrier's own original failure to comply with instructions from the government in question. He might, for example, have carried to that country someone whom he had been ordered not to. He might have failed to comply with earlier directions, for example, to take the passenger to another country. It might in the circumstancees have been possible for a carrier to comply with the orders of a foreign government and ensure that the passenger had the proper documentation.<lb/>
In such circumstances it might well be right to expect the carrier to accept responsibility for bringing in such a passenger. I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord McNair, that that is unfair. As my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter said, the amendment opens up the possibility of an unscrupulous carrier coming to an arrangement with a representative of another government and so claiming that he had been compelled to carry someone here when that was not the case.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, wisely told the House about the difference in meaning between discretion for a judge and discretion for a Home Secretary. I merely stress the point that the noble and learned Lord made; and of course the Home Secretary is accountable to Parliament while the judge is not in the same sense.<lb/>
The Government do not believe that it would be right to give carriers a statutory exemption from liability in every case. Carriers should accept responsibility for passengers they are ordered to bring here if it is through their own fault or their own failure.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, asked me to repeat what I said in Committee, that the Home Secretary will be ready to consider exercising discretion sensibly and reasonably where a carrier through no fault of his own has no alternative but to comply with the orders for a foreign government. Not only do I without reservation give that assurance again; I go further and say that it has already been exercised by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary.<lb/>
In that event I am sure that the House will not want to accept the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02374"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot pretend to be altogether happy with the answer that we have had. I am particularly unhappy that the noble Earl has said nothing about the case of the refugee in orbit.<lb/>
However, in the circumstances I bow to <i>force majeure</i>, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02375">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02376">4.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02377"><member>Lord Mishcon</member> moved Amendment No. 3:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02378">Page 1, line 26, at end insert&#x2014;
<quote>("() The Secretary of State shall by Order in Council establish an appeal tribunal to which carriers found liable to a penalty under this Act may appeal.").</quote></p>
<col>560</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02379">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope to deal with the amendment shortly because the point is a very clear one. Indeed, I ventured to argue it in Committee and withdrew it in the light of the reply of the Minister, which I want in sheer courtesy to consider.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02380">If I made a moderate case and not a strong case in Committee, I hope that I can make it a strong case on Report for the following reason. In the course of the discussion on Amendment No. 1, the Secretary of State said repeatedly that he wanted all carriers to know that the penalty that would be exacted, almost regardless of circumstances, if there was a breach of the provision of this Bill was the same penalty. If ever there was a case for some tribunal to listen to the carrier's plea&#x2014;one would have thought very often a reasoned plea&#x2014;that the penalty should not apply in his case either at all or in the flat sum of &#x00A3;1,000, the Secretary of State has made that case for me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02381">I think that if I went on arguing for a very long time, I should only be repeating the simple principle, that we have a reputation in our legislation that where people are ordered to pay some sort of penalty there ought in appropriate cases to be a right of appeal. This is new legislation and these are new powers, new penalties and new duties of carriers. In those circumstances, I hope that your Lordships will think that an appeal procedure is necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02382">There is one weakness in the amendment, to which I want in honesty to admit. I have not said of what personnel the appeal tribunal should consist. I have left it with the bare words "an appeal tribunal". There will be no difficulty in that matter being considered in due course and an appropriate appeal tribunal being set up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02383">I hesitated, as I said in Committee, to try to designate an appeal tribunal because I did not want to waste the country's money by asking Parliament to approve a new tribunal to deal specifically with the matter. It seemed to me that the number of appeals that would come before it would not justify that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02384">I therefore hope that in the administrative bodies in the country we can find some tribunal able to deal with these matters, quite apart from its other work, whether a county court or whatever else it might be. I am hoping that it might not be a county court for reasons that I gave in Committee and do not want to repeat.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02385">I trust that the amendment will be approved by the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02386"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that where there is a penalty there should be a right of appeal. That is common ground between us. However, the amendment, I fear, is based on a genuine misconception on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. This is perhaps why the noble Lord and I had a disagreement in Committee on the last occasion.<lb/>
The origin of the misconception is the General Council of Shipping draft of 23rd March 1987. I am not taking against the noble Lord a drafting point on failure to designate the appeal tribunal. However, the amendment raises some serious problems, because there is a right of appeal under the regime as it stands in the Bill. The carrier cannot be&#x2014;using the words of the amendment&#x2014;"found liable" to a penalty other

<col>561</col>
than by a civil court if he refuses to pay and if, in the civil court, the Secretary of State establishes contravention on the evidence to the satisfaction of the judge. If it is the county court, there is an appeal to the High Court. If it is the High Court, there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal. There is no way in which any appeal tribunal could fit into this procedure.<lb/>
If&#x2014;and it is not quite clear&#x2014;"found liable" in the amendment means that the Secretary of State considers that in view of apparent contravention there is a liability to pay and so makes a demand, the decision to make that demand, if such view could not have been reasonably entertained by the Secretary of State&#x2014;and I am much relieved to see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, in his place&#x2014;or if, for example, the Secretary of State were to refuse to entertain representations that apparently genuine documents had been produced on embarkation, that would be contrary to natural justice. Then on judicial review that decision to make the demand would be quashed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02387"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I am interrupting the noble Lord's train of thought, which is always a very interesting one, I shall sit down and ask for his leave to interrupt him at another stage. Is he really saying to the House&#x2014;and if so, will the Minister kindly deal with the matter&#x2014;that, where submissions have been made in mitigation by a carrier, and the Secretary of State sends a short reply to the effect that they have been considered but the penalty is being exacted, a county court judge can then go into the matter all over again, even though correspondence had been shown to the judge to the effect that submissions had been made to the Secretary of State who had considered them and then decided against them? Is the noble Lord seriously saying to the House as a matter of law that, when the Secretary of State then sues for the penalty, the county court judge, the High Court judge on appeal or the Court of Appeal can look again at the matters in respect of which he had properly exercised his discretion but exercised it against the carrier?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02388"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. This situation stems from the fundamental disagreement, confusion, or misapprehension, as I seek to say today, on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. The words "found liable" mean what they say. In the Bill it is stated perfectly plainly:
<quote>"liable to pay the Secretary of State on demand".</quote>
The liability to pay does not become an obligation to pay if the carrier refuses to pay. I am seriously suggesting to the noble Lord who asked me a question, but at the moment is otherwise engaged&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02389"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the fault is entirely mine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02390"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02391"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said on the last occasion, if a carrier refuses to pay, the only way he can be made to pay is if the Secretary of State established contravention on the evidence in the county court. From that judgment there is an appeal.
<col>562</col>
As regards that aspect there is no question of discretion at all. It would result in total confusion to import the exercise of a discretion to proceed.<lb/>
Either the Secretary of State is entitled to proceed and make his demand because there has been a contravention or he is not, and that is a matter for the court to decide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02392"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will pardon the interruption&#x2014;I promise him it will be for the last time&#x2014;what he is saying is most serious, because it will be in the <i>Official Report</i> that he is indicating that it is the view of Parliament, and certainly his view. He is talking about where the Secretary of State exacts a penalty and the carrier says, "I do not accept your ruling. I am going to the county court, and I am going from there by way of appeal right the way up the judicial ladder to challenge the circumstances in which you have exacted the penalty&#x2014;not your right or whether you have correctly gone through the procedure". If that is being said, and it is not answered by the Minister as being either the right or the wrong interpretation, Parliament will have misled the carriers who obviously look with great respect, as we all do, upon the noble Lord's speeches. On one view the carriers will have a completely wrong idea, and on the other a completely correct idea. I say frankly, and with great humility, that I disagree with the noble Lord's point of view. I leave it to the Minister to deal with the matter; otherwise we are confusing the issue from the point of view of the carrier's liability and his rights.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02393"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. Before the Minister replies I should like to develop my argument and expose what I have consistently maintained was a false premise taken throughout by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. He is perfectly entitled to take that point of view but it is, with respect to him, totally misconceived. Of course, there is no question of misleading the carriers. As the Minister said at Committee stage, the carrier can refuse to pay. If he refuses to pay, the Secretary of State must prove the contravention in the county court. If it is proved to the satisfaction of the judge, the Secretary of State can recover and the liability to pay in rugby terms is "converted" into an obligation. The obligation does not arise, if it is challenged, until it has been judicially accepted.<lb/>
There is no question whatsoever of discretion arising in those county court proceedings. I was seeking to develop an alternative route. The carrier has two barrels. He can either refuse to pay and go to the county court, or he can say, "The Secretary of State should not have made this demand. No reasonable Secretary of State properly directed ought to have made this demand on the evidence", or, as I was seeking to suggest, "The Secretary of State did not comply with the fundamental requirements of natural justice, such as allowing the carrier to make representations along the lines that apparently genuine documents were produced".<lb/>
As there are these safeguards, it would not be appropriate to set up an appeal tribunal from the decision of the Secretary of State to make a demand, as is proposed by this amendment. Failure by the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0290"/>
<col>563</col>
Secretary of State to exercise benevolent administrative discretion could not be brought before the divisional court on judicial review. If such is to be the function of this appellate tribunal it would be open to the most serious objection. The proposed amendment would in fact substitute the discretion of the appellate tribunal for the discretion of a Minister of State, which would be wholly unacceptable.<lb/>
I apologise for the time I have taken to develop my argument but the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and I are poles apart over this matter. We both entertain totally genuine reasons for being poles apart. However, I thought it right to develop my argument.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02394"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will not accept this amendment. Let me imagine the Bill without it: then it is quite clear that the Secretary of State may bring proceedings in the High Court against the carrier for the &#x00A3;1,000 which has been demanded and not paid. In such proceedings the Secretary of State has to prove the elemental points as regards the man entering undocumented. On proving those matters, and on demand, the Secretary of State obtains his judgment. There could be an appeal against the judgment but with no hope of success. If the complaint is against the discretion of the Minister, that is not the subject of an appeal at all. The discretion, as I have said previously, is administrative and executive. It is not judicial and, therefore, there can be no appeal against it.<lb/>
It seems to me that it is quite unnecessary to have this clause when the matter has already been taken care of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02395">4.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02396"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, and only because of the importance of the point, may I say with deep deference that he has said exactly what I was trying to say. In other words, once you get to the county court, if the Secretary of State proves that there has been a breach of this Bill, then the county court judge or the High Court judge has no alternative whatever but to say, "The Secretary of State said &#x00A3;1,000, and &#x00A3;1,000 it is." He cannot hear the defendant.<lb/>

<col>564</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02404"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, was not trying to silence my argument. It is the last thing in the world that I would ever expect of him. I was saying&#x2014;it is the whole purport of my address to your Lordships&#x2014;that the necessity for an appeal tribunal is to be able to go to somebody and say, "Look, I submitted this to the Secretary of State" or "New evidence has come to light, and I want you to find that it is wrong to exact a penalty of &#x00A3; 1,000 from me; you may think it should be only &#x00A3;250 or nothing at all." He has no right, and the noble and learned Lord has confirmed it, to do that in the county court.<lb/>
There is no right of appeal and, with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that was not the impression he gave the House. If he cares to amend it, I am certainly not against the noble Lord addressing the House again before I sit down, or before anybody else sits down. The point is that his argument was based upon something with which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, does not agree and with which I, a very much humbler person in the legal profession, certainly do not agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02405"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, surely he accepts that I would never try to muzzle his argument unless I was in the position of being deprived of any reply. I hope the noble Lord accepts that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02406"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02407"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: The position is again totally misunderstood by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. Once you get into the county court, the discretion of the Minister, in so far as it is the discretion to make the demand, is wholly immaterial. It is the exercise of the benevolent discretion not to proceed. That is what the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, is seeking to set up this tribunal to review, and that is the one thing which would be quite contrary to practice because it substitutes the discretion of a tribunal for the discretion of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
If I have left the noble Lord or your Lordships' House in a state of confusion, all I can say is that I apologise. I can say no more. I hope that your Lordships will not, in any circumstances, accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02408"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure that I had finished. In a way, I agree with everyone. There is certainly an appeal if the county court or the High Court judge finds that &#x00A3;1,000 is payable and it is not paid or is resisted. There is then an appeal either to the High Court or to the county court; there is no doubt about that. The only dispute is on the decision of the Minister whether or not to make a demand and the circumstances which he takes into account. The question is how far that can be queried.<lb/>
I can understand the concern of my noble friend Lord Mishcon that there should be an appeal from that decision-making process. I do not agree with it for this reason. The decision in that respect is administrative and executive but not judicial. Therefore, it is essentially a matter for the Secretary of State save for
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0291"/>
<col>565</col>
this one safeguard; that if the Secretary of State does anything grossly unfair or anything improper, or adopts a wrong procedure, you have a judicial review. The whole procedure is quite simple and straightforward and we do not need this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02409"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the difficulty for noble Lords like myself who have no connection with any branch of the legal profession is that the Bill is drafted in such an indefinite way that we have no knowledge whatever of the manner in which the Secretary of State will exercise his discretion or, indeed, about the procedures which will be adopted. The noble Earl, in his reply to an earlier amendment, made it quite clear that the Secretary of State does have a discretion. However, in a very curious answer in reply to Amendment No. 1, when the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, asked what was meant by the word "theoretically", the noble Earl replied that it meant that the Secretary of State had a discretion to do certain things in theory, but in practice he would never do them.<lb/>
The logic of that would seem to be that the noble Earl himself ought to want to change the Bill so that the discretion no longer exists. But the difficulty I find is that there is nothing in the Bill to explain how the Secretary of State will deal with these matters. To what extent and in what way will he look at the evidence which is brought forward? Will the people who are complained about, who are perhaps later liable to this penalty, be given an opportunity of a hearing and of giving an oral explanation as to precisely what has happened? Many noble Lords will have anxiety about whether or not an individual case has been enquired into properly and whether or not justice has actually been done.<lb/>
I have no doubt at all that when penalties such as these are levied on certain carriers there will be many who feel a profound sense of injustice and believe that they have been put in a position through no fault of their own. They will want to feel that their representations have been properly heard. It may be that they will be properly heard, but none of us will know. And since there is no appeal procedure, there is no way of ever finding out. That is why I hope that some procedure, such as that envisaged in the noble Lord's amendment, will be devised.<lb/>
I accept that it may be difficult&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said that the precise nature and composition of the appeal tribunal is not specified &#x2014;but I feel that what many of us would like to hear (and we would feel happier about the Bill if we did hear it) is that an opportunity exists to ensure that there can be second thoughts about an individual case in which the victim&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;feels aggrieved and considers that he has been dealt with unjustly.<lb/>
I hope that when the noble Earl replies he will be able to give us some encouragement and let us know that there will be some procedure whereby a case can be looked at again if the complainant feels that he has been dealt with unjustly or, indeed, if Members of either House of Parliament, in consultation with those people, feel that the matter has been dealt with unjustly and that the facts ought to be looked at again by the Secretary of State. It is possible that there will be cases where we are not satisfied with the manner in
<col>566</col>
which the Secretary of State's undoubted discretion has been exercised.<lb/>
I hope that when he replies the noble Earl will be able to tell us that there is some procedure whereby he can assure us that in those particular cases there will be a method whereby the case can be looked at again and that we can all know that the case will be looked at again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02410"><member>Lord Trafford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I make one point? We have talked a great deal about the legal aspects of the type of appeal that could be heard and ruled upon by a county court judge. But this amendment destroys the part of the Bill with reference to the discretion of the Home Secretary. It removes the discretionary powers in the sense that with an appeals tribunal, you are undermining or removing those powers.<lb/>
It would be reasonable as an amendment to suggest that such powers should not be exercised by the Secretary of State at all, although in many other respects such powers are exercised. The amendment would remove such discretionary powers which, on a previous amendment, the noble Lord talked about strengthening because he did not wish to clog such powers. It seems to me that there is a considerable risk that the amendment would remove such discretionary powers and substitute this appeals tribunal. If I recall the Committee stage correctly, I believe that the noble Lord referred to two or three independent citizens. The amendment would transfer the Secretary of State's discretionary powers to two or three independent individuals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02411"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand, or at least I think that I do, the thinking behind this amendment which has been the subject of some discussion among the legal eagles in this House. I, too, believe it to be misconceived and that an appeal tribunal is unnecessary in the circumstances provided under this legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, has often been called the best advocate in this House. I was swayed by his advocacy in Committee when he said that,
<quote>"it is not very sensible to set up a special tribunal to deal with a few appeals".&#x2014;[<i>0fficia Report</i>,7/5/87; col. 282.]</quote>
The noble Lord qualified that this afternoon by saying that it was on cost grounds, but I believe that it is right in principle.<lb/>
The effect of the amendment would be to interpose an appellate body between the Secretary of State and the county court in cases where evidence as to liability is in dispute, and to substitute an appeal tribunals' judgment for that of the Secretary of State on matters relating to the use of the Home Secretary's discretion. I believe that it is unnecessary for a tribunal to duplicate the responsibilities of the county court, and that it is not reasonable for a tribunal to subsitute its judgment in these matters for that of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
The issues of fact that can arise are relatively straightforward. There is already ample provision for resolving them at law&#x2014;at the county court. If a carrier disputes a charge imposed upon him because he does not believe he is liable in law, for example, because he believed that the passenger did not require leave to enter, he may decline to pay. Recovery of the debt
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0292"/>
<col>567</col>
would then be a matter for action in the county court which would determine in the normal way whether a liability arose under the law.<lb/>
On the other hand, a carrier may seek to argue that although he was admittedly liable in law, the Home Secretary should have exercised his discretion not to impose a charge. Surely, that is not a matter upon which an appeal tribunal is best placed to form a judgment. No question of law arises. If it is a question of fairness and compassion, it is right that the Home Secretary should accept responsibility for making the necessary judgments, as he is in the best position to take account not just of the particular circumstances of the case but of the wider issues which might reasonably form a part of his judgment.<lb/>
I do not believe that an appeal tribunal, however formulated, would be an appropriate or indeed necessary forum for such judgments; nor would it represent an efficient or sensible use of resources. It would add a further cumbersome, expensive and unnecessary tier to what, under the Bill, are properly straightforward matters. There is a case for such tribunals when an individual's private future is at stake. Here we are not dealing with such matters, but with the potential financial liability of a carrying company. That is not cause for a separate administrative tribunal.<lb/>
I believe therefore that disputes as to civil liability should continue to be dealt with in the normal way under this legislation, and that it is right that the exercise of discretion should be a matter for the Secretary of State's judgment. Surely the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, will agree with me that it is far better for that discretion to be exercised by the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament, rather than by a tribunal which is not. Of course the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, is right when he says that it is always open to a carrying company to ask for a judicial review of the Home Secretary's decisions, for example, on grounds that he acted unreasonably. We believe that an appeal tribunal is not required to deal with any case where a carrier feels that the Home Secretary acted wholly unreasonably.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02412"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Earl a question before he sits down? Are there any circumstances in which the Home Secretary would be prepared to look at a case again, or will it be that once he has made his judgment, that will be his judgment for all time? It is utterly final. Would he be prepared to look again at a case in which a person feels aggrieved?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02413"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord for not covering that point in my answer. I meant to. Of course it is open to the carrying companies to make such representations as they see fit to the Secretary of State. If they receive a notice saying that the Secretary of State intends to charge the carrier, the carrier can of course make representations. They will be considered. If there is further evidence that comes afresh to the carrying company as the noble Lord suggested, of course, it would be considered.<lb/>
As I have said on a number of occasions, we wish to treat the carrying companies entirely fairly in such matters. That is why my right honourable friend the

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02418">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02419">4.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02420">Clause 2 [<i>Short Title, interpretation, extent and commencement</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02421"><member>Lord McNair</member> moved Amendment No. 4:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02422">page 2, line 11, leave out ("4th March 1987") and insert ("the passing of this Act").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02423">The noble Lord said: I brought forward this amendment at the Committee stage and it elicited some information from the noble Earl which obtained for our deliberations the only coverage I could find in the national press. I have put down the amendment
<col>570</col>
again because there are other questions that I want to ask him. It is a probing amendment, not that that makes the slightest difference. The first question concerns his answer at the Committee stage. He told us that 600 notifications had been sent out and that on 100 occasions notifications had not been sent out because the Home Secretary had exercised his discretion. I should like to know how this rate of arrivals between 5th March and when that information was given compares with the rate of arrivals in a comparable period before 5th March? In other words, does the noble Earl think that the Bill is working?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02424">I was able to give the noble Earl notice of my other questions. First, of the 600 notifications that are mentioned, how many were cases of people who had asked for asylum? Secondly, how many of those 600 people were immediately deported? Thirdly, in what kinds of circumstances did the Home Secretary exercise his discretion not to levy a fine? My fourth question, which may be the most important, is: will the Home Office be keeping such records on the operation of this Bill when enacted to enable Ministers to answer questions about the various categories of passenger for whose carriage carriers have been found liable? I say no more. I shall be most interested to hear the answers of the noble Earl.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02425"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord McNair, has asked a series of questions about the operation of the legislation, of which he was kind enough to give me advance notice this morning. Between 5th March and 26th April about 180 passengers have arrived at the ports to claim asylum, of whom just under 50 had the right documentation. At an average of about 25 port asylum applications a week this represents a considerable reduction in the figures for the previous month when applications were running at an average of about 60 a week. In the great majority of cases where a carrier has been notified of liability it was because a passenger had no valid visa. The general rule is that people without valid visas are refused entry and removed. Similarly, the great majority of cases where discretion has already been exercised involve passengers without a valid visa. Those where no warning letter was issued include many of the circumstances already described to the House: where a carrier has been compelled to bring someone here by an overseas authority through no fault of his own; where a stowaway has been brought and the carrier has done everything reasonable to stop unauthorised people from using his services; where a passenger came from within the common travel area; where a passenger not intending to seek entry to the United Kingdom had had to do so, for example, because he had missed an onward flight; where there was a genuine misunderstanding with a carrier; and a number of varied cases where there were particular compassionate circumstances&#x2014;for example, following the Zeebrugge disaster or because someone had unexpectedly to accompany a very sick child.<lb/>
It is not possible in all cases to link the figures for undocumented arrivals under the Bill with the subsequent immigration history of the individual passenger, but we shall continue to keep records of the type of cases in which we decide to exercise discretion and a breakdown of the reasons why a charge was made.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0294"/>
<col>571</col>
With that, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord McNair, will be satisfied that we are keeping the situation very much under review and I am sure he will note that the Bill is working very satisfactorily.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02427"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that very full answer. I am not quick-witted enough to take in all the implications of the answer as he read it out so I shall look at it with great care tomorrow in the <i>Official Report</i>. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02428">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02429"><member>Lord Mishcon</member> moved Amendment No. 5:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02430">Page 2, line 13, at end insert&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02431">("(5) This Act shall cease to have effect on 4th March 1988 unless the Secretary of State by order made by statutory instrument extends the effect of this Act for a period which shall not exceed 12 months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02432">(6)The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument extend from year to year any order made under subsection (5) above.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02433">(7)No instruments shall be made under subsections (5) or (6) above unless a draft of them has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02434">The noble Lord said: My Lords, at Committee stage I ventured to suggest that it would be wise, as this Bill was born out of an emergency, to treat it as an emergency measure and to limit its life to 12 months. The noble Earl made a very reasonable response to that request in that he pointed out that 12 months was rather a brief period. He reminded me&#x2014;and it was kind of him to do so&#x2014;that in my amendment I had not produced the effect I thought I had, which was to make the Act renewable annually. In other words, it would come to rest at the end of the 12-month period unless it was renewed for a further period of 12 months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02435">I am somewhat reminded of a review by James Agate, whose cynical words brought a great deal of pleasure to some people and a great deal of pain to others. He was reviewing a piece of musical comedy of which a relation of mine was the joint composer. He remembered to the very end of his days the words of James Agate, which were,
<quote>"At the end of the second scene of the first act one of the characters says, 'Methinks I should not be here'. Me took the hint: me went".</quote>
That was the pungent criticism of James Agate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02436">I similarly have taken the hint from the noble Earl. I now have down an amendment which would make the Act renewable year by year. If Parliament so decides or if Parliament otherwise decides, it comes to an end. As this legislation was born out of an emergency, I hope that the amendment will commend itself to the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02437"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely this is not an emergency measure as that is ordinarily understood. It is a permanent component part of our immigration control. As I understand it, the intention is that this pattern of Bill will be accepted throughout Europe on a recriprocal basis. In these circumstances the amendment surely would not be appropriate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02438"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the honeyed words of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon,
<col>572</col>
but despite the tasteful honey I find them as unpalatable as I found them at Committee stage. I do not believe that the Bill requires the annual parliamentary consideratation that the amendment proposes. I took careful note of what the noble Lord said on this matter during the Committee stage, when he sought to argue, quoting from a speech by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in another place, that the Bill was some kind of emergency measure. It is urgent but is not and has never been intended to be a temporary provision.<lb/>
It is quite true that it was the arrival here late last year and early this year of large numbers of undocumented passengers that provided what my right honourable friend described as the immediate spur to this proposal. It would have been quite irresponsible of us simply to have ignored those events and taken no action to prevent their recurrence. That is why we acted quickly to introduce this Bill, not as an emergency procedure but as the swift response that this responsible Government demand.<lb/>
But this Bill is intended to form a permanent part of our immigration control, as my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has just said, just as European Community Ministers have agreed to recommend the introduction of similar legislation in all member countries. It raises no novel points either in comparison with other countries' legislation, or indeed in our interpretation of the responsibilites of carrying countries. As your Lordships know, it builds on the long accepted responsibilities of carrying companies under the Immigration Act 1971. It raises no new issues. It seeks only to ensure that people who wish to come here have the documents which they need and which Parliament has approved before they set out.<lb/>
These are not matters which need or which should be introduced as temporary provisions or which should of their nature be kept under regular parliamentary review. Of course in changing world conditions they may not be the whole answer, but they will remain an important and useful part of the armoury of immigration control for the foreseeable future. There is therefore nothing to be gained by looking at the matter again in 12 months' time and every 12 months thereafter. To do so would be an unnecessary burden on our parliamentary procedures which would not be justified by the intrinsic nature of the legislation and it would leave carriers in a state of continuing and annual uncertainty about Parliament's intentions.<lb/>
That is not in the carriers' interest, nor in the interests of maintaining an orderly policy of immigration control. I regret to have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that I can only advise the House not to accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02439"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I accept the expression of regret from the noble Earl. I too regret his reply but realise that there would be no point in this instance in testing the opinion of the House. I therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02440">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02441">Then, Standing Order No. 44 having been suspended (pursuant to Resolution of today's date):</p>

<col>573</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02442"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a third time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02443"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Bill passes through your Lordships' House, and, with the speed to which we shall be accustomed over the next few days, finds it way on to the statute book a few words are appropriate and not many more. From these Benches we have realised the whole time that two aspects ought to be fought: first, the attempted immigrant who cheats; and, secondly, the carrier who makes a fortune or endeavours to do so out of the misery of others. We join the Government in wanting to make provision in legislation to defeat both those sets of people.<lb/>
We have tried to tight from these Benches to ensure that the genuine immigrant is not impeded from making his plea to a country which has never refused to listen to the pleas of those who are in danger of losing their lives or in fear of persecution. I believe that that was a right battle to fight. If I may say so, not only the House has been fair in listening to those arguments but in particular the Minister has been patient, tolerant and courteous in listening to them.<lb/>
From these Benches I do not regret the aim of the battle that we waged but now the end of the battle is here and one can only pray, as I am sure will be the case, that the Secretary of State when reading of your Lordships' deliberations will decide to use the discretion of which we have heard so much with mercy and tolerance, as befits our country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02444"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in wishing this Bill not so much <i>bon voyage</i> &#x2014;perhaps <i>mal de mer</i> is a better expression&#x2014;I should like to make one serious point. We have not opposed the principle of the Bill but I fear that unamended it will sooner or later have some tragic consequences. I am afraid that sooner or later somebody will not get on a flight or a ship because of this Bill, somebody who would otherwise have reached our shores and would have been given asylum had he done so. I just hope and pray that I am wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02445"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should just like to congratulate the Government on the speed and efficacy of this legislation. It will do a great deal to stop those racketeers who have been making money out of innocent people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02446"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I merely wish to endorse what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, said. There was a terrifying abuse and this Bill is a reasonable and measured response to curb it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02447"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill has benefited from the careful and full discussion that we have had both today and on two previous parliamentary occasions. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking all noble Lords who took part in it and my noble friends and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning for the support that I have received. It is perhaps difficult to imagine two clauses being given more careful scrutiny.<lb/>
For our part the Government welcome these opportunities to set out the case for this legislation and to do our best to dispel misapprehensions and misunderstandings. Our debates have, I believe,
<col>574</col>
helped to clarify and explain what is basically a short, simple but effective provision to deal with the problem of carriers accepting people for travel who do not have the basic documents for their journeys.<lb/>
Your Lordships have understandably concentrated on the possible effect on genuine refugees. At each stage I have taken every opportunity to confirm the Government's continuing commitment to the 1951 Convention on Refugees and to show that in practice there is no necessary link between a genuine refugee and the absence of proper documentation. The vast majority of genuine refugees will not be affected in any way at all by this legislation.<lb/>
I think there has been some measure of agreement in this House that we have a problem of asylum abuse which we share with many other countries in the Western world. I ask the House to recognise that we are not alone in concluding that legislation of this sort is the right response. Our response is fully in accord with the recommendations recently made to all the members of the Economic Community and with the action taken in many other parts of the world.<lb/>
The strength and effectiveness of this measure lie in its simplicity and in the fact that its requirements are all-embracing. I am sure your Lordships have been right to resist attempts to import various savings into the Bill which would open up obvious and unacceptable loopholes. But I again assure your Lordships that the Home Secretary will use his powers to exercise discretion sensibly, reasonably and with good judgment. He will continue to maintain a good balance between compassion and the need to bring home to carriers their responsibilities.<lb/>
I cannot accept that the Bill in any way detracts from the Government's continued commitment to providing for refugees under the 1951 convention. This country is rightly proud of its reputation for accepting genuine refugees and this Government's record is an honourable and generous one, as the figures show. Between 1979 and 1985 we granted refugee status or asylum to over 7,500 people&#x2014;that is, an average of over 20 each week. This response represents a real and practical commitment to helping with the problem of genuine refugees.<lb/>
In addition, we have played a key part in resettling a substantial number of Indo-Chinese refugees; and on 8th May my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced that the Government were ready to receive a further 468 from Hong Kong. We believe, as has happened before, that this commitment will help to pave the way to other countries offering further help. This is not the response of a government seeking to ignore the needs of genuine refugees and surely demonstrates in the clearest way possible the practical action which the Government are ready to take in dealing in a responsible and planned way with the needs of genuine refugees.<lb/>
We have also made significant practical contributions to help the victims of various disasters&#x2014;famine and civil war&#x2014;throughout the world. Over the last financial year, we provided &#x00A3;32 million in aid to various programmes, many run under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and we have agreed with our European partners to play our part in a European
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0296"/>
<col>575</col>
Community contribution equivalent to over &#x00A3;100 million for refugee assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in the years from 1986 to 1990.<lb/>
I believe we would be right to give the Bill its Third Reading. Our debates and detailed consideration have shown it is a necessary response to a serious problem. They have shown too that this legislation has withstood a most searching examination by your Lordships and, as I have reported to the House, that it is working in a sensible, humane and effective way. I believe the evidence will continue to show that the Bill presents no threat to or reflection on this country's continued commitment to genuine refugees, which rightly this House holds dear, but that it will ensure that this country continues to have the effective control on immigration which I believe the whole House accepts that we need. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02458">Clause 1 [<i>The Serious Fraud Office</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02459"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02460">Page 2, line 15, after ("him") insert ("on reasonable grounds")</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02461">The noble and learned Lord said: This is the first of a number of amendments which have been tabled by the opposition parties to Part I of the Bill. We would have greatly liked to have scrutinised the Bill thoroughly and taken it through its usual stages during which it would have been considered line by line. We are, however, in unusual circumstances. Because of our determination to take steps to combat serious fraud of the type which has been increasingly exposed and which has, also, been going unpunished, we have agreed that we shall support the steps to be taken to combat it by giving a fair wind to Part I of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02462">We have put down amendments and we believe that the debate will show that at least some of them, which the Government have indicated they may well be willing to accept, will improve the protection of the individual appearing before the courts. That is the motivation of identifying some of them, even in these exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless we face a risk in the procedures being followed today that
<col>576</col>
constitutional harm may be done in an exercise of a kind which, in effect, drives a coach and four through our customary and necessary procedures and functions and our scrupulous care for the protection of civil liberties. That is a price which, alas, in these exceptional circumstances we have to pay.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02463">Amendment No. 1 has, as its object, to require the Director of the Serious Fraud Office before mounting an investigation to have what appear to him to be reasonable grounds for doing so and only to act in those conditions. The amendment would harmonise with the conditions which are imposed on the exercise by the director of his Clause 2 powers. For example, under Clause 2 the director's powers are, under subsection (2),
<quote>"exercisable, but only for the purposes of an investigation under section 1 above, in any case in which it appears to him that there is good reason to do so for the purpose",</quote>
of the investigation. Therefore the individual has that safeguard before he becomes subject to the strong powers which the director is given under Clause 2.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02464">Similarly there is a limitation on the exercise by the director of the powers under Clause 2 to require individuals to attend before him and be questioned. The director must have "reason to believe" that the individual whom he requires to attend has relevant information to give. Thus, as Clause 1(3) stands, the director could mount his investigation without the amendment I move, even though he had no reasonable grounds for the belief that the suspected offence involved serious or complex fraud. It is true that he could not avail himself of the exceptional powers under Clause 2 unless it appears to him that there is a reason for doing so, but that would not prevent him investigating without having recourse to these powers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02465">In addition, the inclusion of the words in the amendment "on reasonable grounds", would be consistent with the limitations on the director of the exercise of his Clause 2 powers. It would make clear and express what was elsewhere indicated to be necessary by the use of the words:
<quote>"there is good reason to do so".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02466">I submit that it is necessary to make that requirement clear and that the director should not exercise any of his powers under this part of the Bill unless there appear to him to be reasonable grounds for doing so. I submit that this is a useful, tidy, sensible and helpful amendment. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02467"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I hope that the Committee will not accept this amendment. The words "to him" appear in our legislation time after time. They give a discretion which is not challengeable in the courts and which ought not to be challengeable. If the words "on reasonable grounds" are inserted, there will be challenges by way of judicial review and the like. This is a special matter for the director. After all, he is the director of the Serious Fraud Office and surely it is for him to decide. He must investigate only offences which appear to him to involve serious or complex fraud. Surely the decision whether or not to investigate can be left to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02468"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: It is somewhat of a tragedy that, after the tremendous support given to me by the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0297"/>
<col>577</col>
noble and learned Lord in respect of the previous legislation. I now seek to disagree with him. I fully understand the wish of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, to ensure that SFO investigations are undertaken only on reasonable grounds. Our own fair assumption was that the director would, in any event, act reasonably and with circumspection before involving himself in investigations. However, we see no difficulty about making clear this foundation for action on the face of the Bill, and can accordingly recommend to the Committee that the amendment be accepted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02474"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member> moved Amendment No. 4:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02475">Page 4, line 35, after ("him") insert ("(a)").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02476">The noble Earl said: In the Second Reading debate on the Bill in this House the noble and learned Lord, Lord Roskill, criticised the inhibition in Clause 2(8) on using compulsorily obtained information in court against the provider of that information. I said then that in this respect we had not followed the precedent in companies' legislation and the Financial Services Act under which statements made to DTI inspectors in the exercise of their powers were admissible as evidence of those making them. However, I promised to reflect further upon what had been said, and in particular about any doubt which the terms of Clause 2(8) might raise about the admissibility of statements made to the Serious Fraud Office which are inconsistent with the account given by the accused in court. This amendment is the product of our reflections.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02477">Under the present law, if a witness, including the defendant, gives evidence of a fact directly relevant to the subject matter of the charge he can be cross-examined on the basis that on some previous occasion he had made an inconsistent statement. As I understand it, this rule applies to statements of every kind, including statements not taken on oath or under caution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02478">We think that it is important to put beyond doubt the admissibility of statements made to the Serious Fraud Office in the same way. However, the primary safeguard of Clause 2(8) will remain. If a defendant chooses not to give evidence in court, or gives answers consistent with those that he gave during an early investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, no statement made to the SFO will be admissible in evidence against him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02479">This is not what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Roskill, called for. However, as I said on Second Reading, we are hesitant to adopt the course he suggested because to do so might appear to infringe the principle that the accused should not be required to incriminate himself. However, where the defendant
<col>578</col>
gives evidence in court it seems perfectly sensible that his credibility should be able to be tested against lawfully obtained information supplied to the SFO under its statutory powers. Evidence of inconsistency will not of course tell the jury which story is true; nor is the jury obliged to believe either version. The purpose of the exercise will be to test the credibility of the witness.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02480">In short, the purpose of these amendments&#x2014;I should have told the Committee that I am also speaking to Amendment No. 5. and I apologise for not having done so earlier&#x2014;is to remove any doubt that there may be about the admissibility of inconsistent statements so that suspects cannot play games with the SFO or the court, and to preserve the general safeguard against admissibility of statements made to the SFO by the accused, which Clause 2(8) provides. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02488">The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to ask the Government to state their position unequivocally in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination. Clause 2 removes the traditional right to silence. Anyone suspected of serious or complex fraud can be made subject to questioning, as can anyone whom the director has reason to believe has relevant information. I refer to Clause 2(1) and (2).</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02489">5.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02490">Under Clause 2(13), anyone who does not comply with any requirement under the clause&#x2014;for example, anyone who fails to answer questions or give information&#x2014;commits a criminal offence. I move this amendment in order to ask: where stands the privilege against self-incrimination? That privilege traditionally applies to a witness in court proceedings. He does not require the privilege before court proceedings begin because he has an absolute right to silence. However, the defendent's right to silence disappears under this part of the Bill. He can be compulsorily questioned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02491">Clause 2(8) provides that a statement by a person in response to a requirement imposed by virtue of this section may only be used&#x2014;and I emphasise "only"&#x2014;in evidence against him on a prosecution for an offence under Clause 2(14). That is the offence of failure, without reasonable excuse, to answer questions. The statement as such cannot be used against him on his prosecution for an offence of fraud. However, that in no way protects him from incriminating himself. The answer to a particular question may well immediately lead the director on to other information and other evidence which could without
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0298"/>
<col>579</col>
restriction be used against the defendant at his trial and have the effect of securing his conviction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02492">There is a question of principle here which I would submit should be determined in this Committee and not handed over to the courts for decision. The question is this. Is the individual who is being compulsorily questioned by the director, and compulsorily questioned under threat of criminal sanction, to be entitled to say at some point, "No, I will not answer that question because I say that the answer will have a tendency to incriminate me because of where it may lead"? Reading Clause 2(13), it provides that:
<quote>"Any person who without reasonable excuse tails to comply with a requirement imposed on him under this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale or to both".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02493">The words, "without reasonable excuse" are there. I pose this question. Is it a reasonable excuse that the answer to the question may have a tendency to incriminate because it will lead the director to other incriminating evidence? I would submit that it is no answer to say, "Leave it to the courts to decide."</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02494">It is a question of principle for this Committee to decide whether a reasonable belief that a particular answer will tend to incriminate in the way that I have supposed and whether that reasonable belief should or should not constitute a reasonable excuse under Clause 2(13). I would think it should, but in any event I would invite the Government to state where they stand on this matter of principle which it appears ought to be decided in this Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02495">I would also make this prediction. If this provision remains as it stands, the courts may well say, "If Parliament had intended anything as well known as the privilege against self-incrimination, it would have said so in clear words. It did not say so and therefore it cannot have intended that and therefore we, the court, hold that 'reasonable excuse' comprehends no more than an inability to answer for some reason but not an unwillingness." I contrast inability with unwillingness to answer because of where the answer would lead the director. It seems that this is a question of principle on which we should have an answer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02496">Perhaps I may make it entirely plain before I sit down that I would not seek to divide the Committee on this amendment; but it is an important issue of principle on which a clear statement would be most welcome.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02497"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: I would be against this amendment. The privilege against self-incrimination has often been abused. A person often says he does not want to incriminate himself because he does not want to be incriminated. But in a way it is much better in this legislation to leave it simply on the ground, "without reasonable excuse", without making a special exception in regard to incrimination. Let that be dealt with by the judge who is always and ever dealing with the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02498"><member>Lord Hutchinson of Lullington</member><membercontribution>: I should like to support this amendment which has been moved so ably, if I may say so, by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine. "Any person" is the phrase used in this clause: Any person may be required to answer questions under
<col>580</col>
pain of six months' imprisonment if he refuses to answer. It is not only the person under investigation who is concerned. The draconian powers given to the inspectors or the personnel of the director's office here are tremendous in their scope. It is not only the suspect or the person under investigation who has to answer questions under pain of imprisonment. It is "any person", and that "any person" may be a completely innocent potential witness who the director thinks has some relevant evidence. The discretion of the questioning is entirely and solely in the hands of the director. If he thinks reasonably, that any person has relevant information, that person can be brought before the inspector and interrogated, under pain of imprisonment if he does not reply.<lb/>
The protection which will be put forward by the Government is to be found in Clause 2(8). There it is said that any statement made during this interrogation cannot be used in criminal proceedings. That of course is a very strong protection and one which this Committee will remember was objected to strongly by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Roskill, at Second Reading.<lb/>
That is the only protection such a person has; but, as every lawyer in the Chamber will know, documents or information which may be disclosed as a result of this interrogation will not be covered by Clause 2(8). Documents and information will be held to be admissible on the precedents, with the greatest respect to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, who has just said, "Leave it to the judge". If it is left to the judge, those documents and that information will be held to be admissible, and those documents and that information may be, on the face of it, incriminating or potentially incriminating evidence, not against the criminal but against the innocent person. Therefore I would support this amendment because it would appear that the documents and information that come from the interrogation have been lost sight of in this clause.<lb/>
On the question of reasonable excuse, I would support what has just been said because certainly in criminal law the interpretation of the phrase "reasonable excuse" has tended more and more to be inability&#x2014;not being able to comply&#x2014;rather than ever having a discussion in court as to the inherent reasonableness of the excuse put forward. Therefore that is very small protection for the person being so interrogated. On those grounds, I should like to add to what has been said already in support of this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02499"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, has again said, "Every lawyer in the Chamber knows". We are not all lawyers. I constantly find throughout the discussions on Bills such as this Criminal Justice Bill that the whole of the legally-trained Members of your Lordships' Chamber address everybody else as though they were equally part of that profession. Sitting here, remembering my experiences as a magistrate, I got the impression that many of the lawyers were there simply to confuse the people who sat on the Bench. I used to think at the beginning of a case that I knew what it was about. After I had listened for an hour to someone like the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, I did not know what it was about. I should just like to ask him to explain how an innocent
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0299"/>
<col>581</col>
person can incriminate himself. I cannot follow that logic. If one is innocent, any question that one answers cannot possibly be incriminating and result in being charged with an offence. Perhaps he can explain how that can be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02500"><member>Lord Edmund-Davies</member><membercontribution>: For the reasons that have already been stated, I venture to support this amendment. Apart from the very pungent point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, in relation to "any person" mentioned at the beginning of subsection (13), we have to postulate under Amendment No. 7 as originally drafted the grounds of reasonable belief entertained by any person, whether he is a party or not, and that if
<quote>"compliance would or would tend thereby to incriminate him such belief shall constitute such reasonable excuse".</quote>
Yet when examining the matter, if some Olympian person or judge comes to the conclusion that the honestly held belief in point of actuality was not a reasonable excuse, notwithstanding that conclusion the accused is liable to be sentenced to six months' imprisonment. That does not seem to me to be justice, and accordingly I support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02501"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: This amendment goes to the very heart of one of the major difficulties that we must address in legislating for the Serious Fraud Office to have the powers which are effective in rooting out fraud but are not oppressive toward those whose affairs are investigated. It is understandable that there should be concern about the position of the suspect and the consequences of self-incriminating answers given in the face of the compulsory powers in Clauses 2(2) and 2(3). The Government have given much thought to this. Our starting point is that these powers are necessary if the SFO is to be able to clear the trail of a complex fraud. The accumulation of documents and answers to a wide range of questions is vital; that is why we have opted for compulsory powers with a criminal sanction for non-compliance on the model of the powers exercised by DTI inspectors under the Companies Act and the Financial Services Act.<lb/>
But there is one significant respect in which we have not followed the approach in companies legislation. In my view it goes a good way toward meeting the concern that has been so well expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine., which underlies this amendment.<lb/>
Under the Companies Act 1985&#x2014;and I refer to Section 447(8)&#x2014;and the Financial Services Act 1986, Section 105(5), statements made in compliance with the compulsory requirements are in due course admissible as evidence against those making them. Under Clause 2(8) such statements will not generally be admissible as evidence against those making them, although, if they are inconsistent with an account that the defendant chooses to give in court, we believe that the normal rules about prior inconsistent statements might result in their admission.<lb/>
The effect of all this is that in questioning suspects the SFO will be able to operate in two ways. If the suspect is willing to answer questions voluntarily, he will be formally cautioned by the police or perhaps a member of the SFO and his statement, subject to the usual rules of admissibility, will be able to be used in evidence against him. That can be done under existing powers without any need for new provision.<lb/>
<col>582</col>
If he is unwilling to answer questions voluntarily, he will be required to do so using the powers in Clause 2 but his answers will not be admissible as evidence against him in any subsequent trial. That seems to us to be a sensible balance. It maximises the SFO's ability to obtain the information that it needs, including information from suspects, but it preserves the right of the suspect not to have incriminating answers used in evidence against him.<lb/>
Of course, the defence of "reasonable excuse" can always be raised in an individual case. Indeed, the court has recently shown its ability to address the precise point on the facts of an individual case in relation to journalistic material held in confidence. It must be right to leave the courts free to take a view on these matters rather than to impose a blanket defence on those from whom the SFO must be able to require information if it is to do the job that we all want it to do. I am sure that on that point there is no disagreement between any Members of the Committee.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02527">The noble Lord said: This is a very short amendment and concerns a very short point, which is to make sense of Clause 6(6). Clause 6 deals with the application by a defendant whose case has been transferred directly to the Crown Court under Clause 4 without any committal proceedings before the justices and it is an application which can be made to the judge to have the case dismissed on the ground that the evidence produced by the prosecution is insufficient to justify a trial. That is a submission which would normally be made to the magistrates. This is the shortened procedure and the submission is made to the judge in the Crown Court. This is, of course, an important right which, as I said, is normally made before the magistrates. It is particularly important in complex fraud where thousands of pounds in costs and months of suspense may be avoided by throwing out a weak case at that stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02528">Under Clause 6(1), an application can be made orally or in writing. Under Clause 6(6), we find spelt out the considerations to which the judge should have regard when he is deciding whether or not to throw it out. It reads:
<ol>
<li>"(a) to the evidence tendered by the prosecution;</li>
<li>(b) to any written statement tendered by the defence &#x2026; and</li>
<li>(c)to any oral evidence on behalf of the prosecution or the defence".</li>

One does not see there any reference to an impassioned appeal by the advocate to the judge asking him to dismiss the case. Therefore I am submitting in this amendment that the word "oral"

They must, of course, also take account of those cases where there are two or more defendants or several counts on the indictment. The last amendment is a drafting alteration to clarify the way in which periods of time may be set for compliance with orders for specific preparatory hearing work. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02575">The noble Lord said: In our view, on this side of the Committee, this is by far the most important amendment affecting Part I of the Bill. It deals with the degree to which an accused person may be ordered by the trial judge to disclose the particulars of his case before his trial begins. Whereas we are totally committed to the efficient and effective investigation and prosecution of serious fraud, and are anxious to see Part I of this Bill on the statute book, we are equally committed to the maintenance of civil rights. Clause 9(4) raises fundamental questions affecting the right of silence and the onus of proof, which go to the very heart of a criminal trial. As drafted paragraph (i) is unacceptable to us. Therefore, we have tabled this amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02576">The amendment which is now tabled is a fresh version of the amendment we originally tabled; it replaces the original Amendment No. 25. If I understand the situation correctly following prolonged negotiations, it may well be that this amendment which I now move proves acceptable to the Government. If that is the case, we should be most grateful for their appreciation of our very genuine concern.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02577">Clause 7 introduces a new power enabling a judge at trial to order what is called a preparatory hearing before the trial proper. The purpose of that is to identify the issues, settle matters in dispute as to the law and admissibility of evidence and generally to get
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0302"/>
<col>587</col>
the whole case into a clear, slimmed-down state fit for a jury to try and fit to present to a jury. That is in every way an admirable aim.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02578">Clause 9 with which we are dealing, sets out the judge's powers at that preparatory hearing. Under Clause 9(3), he can order the prosecution to supply a case statement which should set out their case in detail. Under Clause 9(4)(b) he may order the defence to disclose a number of matters set out in that clause in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). It is paragraph (i) that this amendment deals with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02579">The mischief lies in Clause 9(4)(b)(i), coupled, as it is, with the Sanctions in Clause 10 that arise for noncompliance with the order of the judge. The wording of the present Clause 9(4)(b)(i) is that a judge may order the defence:
<quote>"to give the court and the prosecution a written summary of the defence case in response to each of the principal allegations in the case statement".</quote>
that is by the prosecution
<quote>"specifying the principal facts upon which the defence propose to rely".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02580">The Government have reiterated that they have no wish to undermine the accused's right of silence nor to derogate from the fundamental principle of the criminal law that it is for the prosecution to prove the case to the satisfaction of the jury. But to demand of the defence before the trial begins those particulars which I have just read out is to make substantial inroads into the accused's right of silence. If those facts depend on the knowledge and the observation of the accused himself, must that not force him into the witness box? That would mean that the prosecution could trim their case before trial and put each item of the defence case to their witnesses, who might then adjust their evidence accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02581">That matter was raised by the Roskill Committee&#x2014;it greatly troubled them&#x2014;at paragraph 6.75. I would suggest that it might put defence counsel into an impossible position if he has a duty to the court to disclose and to obey the judge's direction and also has a duty to the client to act on his instructions, which might be not to disclose. No advocate should be put in a position where he must indicate to the prosecution where lie the defects in the prosecution's case; nor should he be put under a duty to strengthen the case against his own client. Our system remains adversarial; it has not yet become inquisitorial. For example, if the accused elects to give no evidence, under the clause as at present drafted he might be convicted of the offence simply for failing to comply with the order of the judge under the sanctions in Clause 10. It would seem likely that the prosecution would soon concentrate on discrediting the defence case rather than on proving its own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02582">For all those reasons&#x2014;and there are many others&#x2014;in our opinion, this subsection is unacceptable. Nevertheless, we take the view that in the fight against serious fraud&#x2014;which we support to the hilt&#x2014;the defence should be expected to assist in the proper administration of justice. They should make a general disclosure of their case or, as the Roskill Report put it, at paragraph 6.82, disclose the nature of their case in general terms, thus avoiding the prosecution being taken by surprise when the defence
<col>588</col>
put forward their case; but at the same time the right of silence and the duty of the prosecution to prove the case should be preserved in their entire integrity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02583">This amendment achieves both those ends. It means that the defence do not have to give a line-by-line detailed reply to the prosecution case statement, which statement can be made as detailed as the prosecution care to make it. It means that the defence must define in writing the general nature of their case and identify the principal issues which in their view will arise during the trial.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02584">On that basis, I propose this amendment. I must add, however, that we take the view, and always have done, that Clauses 9 and 10 go together, for in Clause 10 we find the sanctions for failure to comply with the direction of the judge in Clause 9. In due course I shall be moving Amendment No. 37A which we believe follows on from this clause as amended. I merely say that in order to indicate now what is to come. In those circumstances, I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02585"><member>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Alport)</member><membercontribution>: I have to advise your Lordships that if this amendment is agreed to, I shall not be able to call Amendments Nos. 24, 25 or 26.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02586"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: I rise to support the amendment. I do so with absolute reliance upon its importance. In view of the stress which we place upon it&#x2014;this was communicated to the noble Lord opposite&#x2014;we made it clear that if there was no giving ground on this, it might put in peril our whole attitude towards Part I of the Bill. I feel I should say that. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, was not seeking to indicate that this was merely a brilliant suggestion emanating from the Alliance Benches, because we have made this a condition of our agreement. As the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, in his admirable speech indicated, the traditional principle of the criminal law has been that the defendant is under no obligation to co-operate with the police or the prosecuting authorities and that at the trial he can require the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt without advance disclosure of the defence, which the prosecution learns only as it gradually unfolds during the cross-examination. However, we accept that in serious and complex fraud cases of the kind with which the Bill is concerned the defence should exceptionally make known in general terms the nature of its case in advance of the trial.<lb/>
The reasons which have been adumbrated by the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, so clearly and so forcibly are overwhelming. The requirement in the clause as it now stands, which is that the defence may be ordered:
<quote>"to give the court and the prosecution a written summary of the defence case in response to each of the principal allegations in the case statement, specifying the principal facts upon which the defence propose to rely",</quote>
would impose an intolerable and, I submit, an unfair burden upon the defence. The alternative now proposed in the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, remedies the matter to a considerable degree and receives our support.</membercontribution></p>

<col>589</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02587"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: It is always nice at this time to see such solidarity between the Labour Party and the Alliance. That is well to be noted.<lb/>
The amendment bears on perhaps what is the most sensitive aspect of the preparatory hearing process; namely, the fact that to assist in the hearing the defendant can be required to disclose an outline of his defence. It is also an essential part of the process because without the co-operation of the defendant the preparatory hearing will not yield the considerable benefits which the Roskill Committee foresaw. Those benefits are, as the members of the Committee will recall, that points of law will be able to be resolved in advance of the jury being sworn, that issues which are not in dispute are identified and that those issues which are in dispute are presented in a form that should ease the task of the jury.<lb/>
If the defendant were able to opt out of the preparatory hearing, it would be a case of Hamlet without the prince. We therefore attach considerable importance to the defendant being required to play his part in the preparatory stage and, like the Roskill Committee, we do not believe that such a requirement would infringe on the right to silence. Nevertheless, we are ready to consider the terms in which the requirement on the defence is expressed. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, and to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, for explaining the purpose of their amendments so clearly. Indeed, as both of them said, there has been some discussion on this matter in advance.<lb/>
The amendment would make the requirement on the defendant a little less specific than it is in the Bill as it stands, but it would preserve the essence of what we and the Roskill Committee had in mind. On the whole it seems to us to be an improvement on the original, and I am glad to be able to say that the Government would not wish to stand in the way of the amendment being made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02617">Page 13, line 7, leave out ("the jury may draw such inference as they think fit").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02618">The noble Lord said: I move Amendment No. 37 while discussing with it Amendments Nos. 37A and 37B. This clause is, as I said, linked closely with Clause 9. It spells out the sanction which may arise if either party fails to comply with any requirement demanded by the judge under Clause 9 or if either party departs from the case disclosed before trial. This clutch of amendments indicates, as the Committee may well have guessed, an intense period of negotiation with the Government, as we feel strongly about the broad extent of the words appearing in the Bill at the moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02619">I understand that it is possible that one of those amendments may still be found acceptable to the Government at this late stage. The right which is given to the jury as a result of a failure to comply with any requirement imposed on the defence at the preliminary hearing is set out in Clause 10(1), which reads thus:
<quote>"The prosecution and defence shall have a right, subject to subsections (2) and (3) below, to depart from the case disclosed by them at the preparatory hearing, but if they do so or fail to comply with any requirement imposed on them at the hearing, the judge or the other party may make such comment as appears to him to be appropriate and the jury may draw such inference as they think fit".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02620">Those words are so broad that it would appear that, if they wished to do so, the jury would be entitled to draw an inference of guilt against the accused person simply and solely on the basis that he had failed to obey an order of the judge at the preliminary hearing. The words are,
<quote>"the jury may draw such inference as they think fit",</quote>
or any inference of any kind that it would appear to them fit to draw in the circumstances. Those words in the statute, unvarnished as they stand, would leave the judge complete discretion to say to the jury, "You can draw any inference you think it fit to draw".</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02621">It is in order to limit those words that the various amendments have been put down. The circumstances might arise, for instance, in which there was very little evidence in a case&#x2014;perhaps too little to satisfy the jury of guilt. But simply because of the behaviour of the accused in failing to comply with the judge's directions or failing to carry out some directions which he gave them over disclosure, the jury would be told&#x2014;and the judge would only have to read out the words in the statute&#x2014;that the jury might draw any inference they liked, if they saw fit, because of his attitude at the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02622">In discussions with the Minister and the Government, an attempt was made to come to a compromise on Amendment No. 37, which simply seeks to leave out the whole of those words. An attempt was made in Amendment No. 37A to amend the words rather than to leave them out by adding the word "reasonable"
<col>592</col>
before the word "inference". The line would then read:
<quote>"The jury may draw such reasonable inference as they think fit".</quote>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02623">That would go some way to limiting what the jury could do; it would of course make it possible to take the matter to appeal if it were said in the summing up that they could draw an inference which, on the face of it, was unreasonable. They would therefore be in some way limited as to the inference they could draw.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02624">That was one of the suggestions as to compromise which I understood, at a late moment this afternoon, would in all probability not be acceptable to the Government. Therefore, Amendment No. 37B was put down as a second manuscript amendment. That amendment adds the words "as appears proper" so that the line would read:
<quote>"the jury may draw such inference as appears proper",</quote>
rather than the words:
<quote>"such inference as they think fit".</quote></p>

I am glad that the procedure adopted has been described as a sensible one and in those circumstances I hope that the House will allow me to continue under that procedure and to await the reply of the Government before deciding which of the amendments I shall seek to move.<lb/>
Dealing with Amendment No. 37B, which adds the words "as appears proper", if those words are more acceptable to the Government than the words in the previous amendment, then it would be a grain of comfort in that once again the power of the jury would
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0305"/>
<col>593</col>
be limited in some way to drawing an inference which appeared proper in all the circumstances; in other words, to draw an inference of guilt from the misbehaviour of the defendant in not complying with a direction would clearly not be proper, and one could argue on that basis, which would represent some progress in limiting the power. I do not mention Amendment No. 38, which I have no intention of moving in the circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02630"><member>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</member><membercontribution>: The amendment proposed, page 13, line 7, is to leave out ("the jury may draw such inference as they think fit").

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02631"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: May I briefly rise to support Amendment No. 37B? That amendment seems to me to be wholly proper, totally adequate and to afford no reasonable criticism of the Bill as it stands.</membercontribution></p>

Perhaps I may read the relevant part of the subsection. It says:
<quote>"the judge or the other party"&#x2014;</quote>
as I understand it, that means the prosecution or the defence&#x2014;
<quote>"may make such comment as appear to him to he appropriate".</quote>
The word "him" presumably can refer to the judge and must refer to him only. How, until he has heard them, is the poor judge to decide whether such comments are reasonable and therefore to be permitted? He cannot stop them until they have been made. I find this a great difficulty in the new procedure. I should have thought that the words "to him" could well be left out altogether. One has the expression "appropriate", anyway. I am not sure that "reasonable" adds much to it. Anything that is unreasonable will not be appropriate. Therefore, in my view Amendment No. 37A would be unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02633"><member>Lord Hutchinson of Lullington</member><membercontribution>: The word "reasonable" was to go in the later part of the clause, namely,

I come now to the intentions expressed by the noble Lord. Theia, is not very much in it either way, I should have thought. The real difficulty arises&#x2014;we have no
<col>594</col>
amendment for dealing with this&#x2014;from the strange proposition that,
<quote>"the judge or the other party may make such comment as appears to him to be appropriate".</quote>
This will give rise to difficulty in practice. If my noble friend can, quickly obtaining advice between now and Report, have this dealt with, it would help the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, I think, and would certainly help me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02635">6.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02636"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: May I deal with the point of my noble friend Lord Renton first? As I understand the Bill, the words "to him" mean whoever is making the comment. It is not solely the judge; it could include the other party. It could be:
<quote>"the judge or the other party may make such comment as appears to the judge or the other party to be appropriate and the jury may draw such inference as they think fit"</quote>
as printed in the Bill before us. I hope that that clarifies the situation for my noble friend.<lb/>
The sanctions for not complying with the judge's order at a preparatory hearing or departing without good reason from the case disclosed then are an aspect of the procedure to which the Roskill Committee gave a great deal of thought. The committee was in no doubt that the sanction on adverse comment should be available in appropriate cases. The committee at paragraph 6.82 of the report said:
<quote>"Any failure to disclose the defence outline at that stage should be capable of attracting comment from the prosecution and the judge of the trial. The jury should be entitled to take account of, and draw any appropriate inferences from, the defendant's failure to disclose a particular line of defence on which he relies at his trial.".</quote>
Clause 10, as amended, is intended to meet that end. There would clearly be some cases where there would be no inference that the jury could sensibly draw. In others the fact that, for example, the defendant had changed his story in a very suggestive or self-serving way might well be a matter that the jury could reasonably regard as relevant to the credibility of the new account.<lb/>
The government amendment, which I have just moved and which the Committee has accepted, tightens up the clause by allowing adverse comment by the parties only with the leave of the judge. This means that there will be a degree of judicial control on the process which I hope the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson, will agree goes some way towards meeting the concern that he enunciated. One might also expect the judge to assist the jury in his summing up by guiding it on the kinds of inferences that it might be sensible for it to draw. Beyond that, we doubt whether it helps very much to try to define in statute the inferences that the jury can properly draw. Juries do not, generally speaking, operate in a legalistic way. They make up their minds according to the matters that have been placed before them.<lb/>
I turn to manuscript Amendments Nos. 37A and 37B in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hutchinson. As the noble Lord says, this has been the subject of some discussion outside the Chamber. We are not on reflection attracted by the idea of inserting the word "reasonable" as proposed in Amendment No. 37A
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0306"/>
<col>595</col>
because one cannot read the jury's mind. A requirement of reasonableness could lead to somewhat arid disputes on appeal.<lb/>
However, we see attractions in Amendment No. 37B which proposes to alter the words at the end of the subsection so that the jury would be able to draw such inference as appeared proper rather than as it thought fit. This would be consistent with the language of Section 62 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the court, when someone has refused to provide an intimate sample, to draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper. It would, we agree, provide the judge with a peg on which he could hang guidance to the jury on what it might regard as constituting a proper inference.<lb/>
I am therefore glad to say that we are able to accept Amendment No. 37B, supported by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway. We hope that it will go a long way towards reassuring the noble Lord and that as a result he may be able to withdraw Amendment No. 37, not move Amendment No. 37A and move Amendment No. 37B, which I shall be pleased to accept on behalf of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<col>604</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02917"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, seldom in the long and glorious history of this House has there been such a Session of legislative devastation. From these Benches we certainly wish to congratulate the Deputy Chairman at the Committee stage who conducted his office with aplomb and capability and quite obvious enjoyment.<lb/>
As we reach the Third Reading of this rather hustled legislation, it is necessary only to draw attention once more to the fact that this must never be used as a precedent for rushing through legislation especially in your Lordships' House bearing in mind that we are, in our primary duties, a House where we revise legislation. There are extenuating and difficult circumstances. Quite obviously, if we were not to have agreed to this procedure without precedent, we should have lost Part I of the Bill. As has already been said by my noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, we on this side of the House wanted, without any doubt, to assist so far as we properly could in seeing that the Serious Fraud Office was set up and that it could exercise its duties and powers as soon as possible in order that the stain (which unfortunately has been imprinted upon an otherwise very clean City in its reputation throughout the world) should be dealt with promptly and accurately as it has not been possible to do in past months. It is in those circumstances that we reach the Third Reading of the Bill. I shall say one more thing before sitting down. It will be the joy of my friends on the Front Bench of the Labour Party in the future to draw the attention of the Minister, on whatever side of the House he may be sitting, to the fact, if ever certain clauses of the Bill are before us again, that he voted with such a good voice against all those clauses forming part of his Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02918"><member>Lord Wigoder</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suspect that within the past half hour, for all anybody in the Committee may know, including the Minister, we may well have repealed both Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights. It has been a half hour of almost total gibberish, in the course of which&#x2014;and this is not really such a laughing matter&#x2014;a whole series of starred amendments, of which no one had any notice until this morning when the Marshalled List was issued, have been passed through this Chamber without a word of explanation or comment. I suspect that none of us had any idea of the implication of the detail of what it is we have passed. That strengthens my sense of unease about the whole of the proceedings this afternoon.<lb/>
It has been perfectly apparent that we have been going through the stages of a Bill having negotiated between all the parties in the corridors outside the Chamber yesterday afternoon, yesterday evening and this morning the detail of what was to happen. Of course I can understand the reasons for that. I know perfectly well that politicians in all the parties are about to set out for all parts of the country and they want to be able to say that where fraud is going on in the City of London their party is behind the drive to stamp it out. All the parties want to say that&#x2014;the Alliance as much as anybody else. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that this part of the Bill now comes before this Chamber in the very undesirable way that it has.<lb/>
It is undesirable for the reason that has already been made clear. We have failed in our duty as a House to
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0311"/>
<col>605</col>
exercise our proper legislative function. This is a criminal statute. It is a measure of the criminal law. We all know from history how important it is that the criminal law should be absolutely right. That means that it should be examined with scrupulous care not merely in Committee but at Report stage and Third Reading in both Houses of Parliament, and particularly in your Lordships' House where there are noble and learned Law Lords who can bring a wealth of expertise on legal matters that is not available to the other place. We have abandoned the whole of that; we have shot through the Bill; we have negotiated amendments between ourselves outside in corridors; and nobody knows what the result will be during the next few years.<lb/>
It hardly needs me to point out that some 75 years ago the Official Secrets Act 1911 was passed with much the same speed and we have all been regretting it every since. It was done in good faith and in a way which people thought at that time was absolutely correct. The reasons why we have got into this difficulty&#x2014;and I understand them&#x2014;are twofold. First, the Prime Minister with a large and, so far as I know, entirely stable majority in the other place has chosen to go to the country about a year before she need have done. That is her prerogative and it would be impertinent of me even to begin to criticise it; and of course I do not do so. But the result has been that the centrepiece of the Government's legislation of this Session has collapsed in the rather lamentable way we have seen today. That is the first problem.<lb/>
The second problem is that right from the beginning this Bill had far too much in it. There should have been a whole series of separate Bills. There should have been a separate Bill on fraud, a separate Bill on evidence, a separate Bill on confiscation and certainly a separate Bill on extradition. Indeed if we had had a separate Bill on fraud brought forward after the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Roskill, many months ago now, that Bill would have gone through both Houses in all its stages with proper, careful consideration and would no doubt have been a worthy addition to the criminal law instead of this rushed version with which we have had to put up this afternoon.<lb/>
I appreciate that the circumstances are exceptional. Everyone will say that this is not a precedent until it happens next time when it will then come to be regarded as a precedent. Whichever government come to power after the election, I can only hope, first, that if the Bill is reintroduced, it comes back to your Lordships' House which is the obvious recipient of this Bill, it having been examined in another place; and, secondly, it comes back in a series of digestible portions so that we can properly exercise the functions for which we are here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02919"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that the Bill leaves your Lordships' House somewhat slimmer than when it arrived; but in the short time available before Parliament is dissolved I believe that we have done a good job in saving a highly significant and coherent part of it. As it now stands, the Bill provides for significant changes and reforms to help the criminal justice system tackle large scale fraud vigorously. The new
<col>606</col>
serious fraud office should help to focus effort and expertise on the investigation and prosecution of such cases. The streamlined court procedures recommended by the Roskill Committee will enable serious fraud trials to be brought rapidly into the jurisdiction of the Crown Court where it will be possible for the issues to be refined and clarified by a formal preparatory stage. The change in the ambit of the charge of conspiracy to defraud is a modest but important reform which will make it easier for the prosecution to bring the right charge in the more serious cases.<lb/>
I am grateful for the constructive spirit in which the Committee shared our aims, and I too should like to pay tribute to the Lord Chairman for the excellent work that he did. I acknowledge that there has been less opportunity to debate these provisions than would normally have been the case; but it is a measure of the importance we all attach to the fight against fraud that we have been willing to forgo that opportunity. It is, I would suggest, no more and no less than the country would expect. Your Lordships know that we are always open to constructive proposals for change, and although I am confident that they do what is required of them, I can assure the House that these provisions are no exception. Of course we should have wished to go further and bring the whole of the Bill as introduced to the statute book; but I am confident that that can be done before very long. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, will join me in good voice in getting those parts of the Bill on to the statute book ere long.<lb/>
I was a little disappointed by what the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, said. There was considerable discussion on Part I of the Bill. Admittedly, the remaining parts which were consequential on the agreement were not discussed. But that was the nature of the agreement. They are there to be discussed for another day because I am sure that before long your Lordships will have another Criminal Justice Bill and I hope that I shall have the honour of being in this position to introduce it and get the support of noble Lords opposite in seeking to put it on to the statute book.<lb/>
I shall not detain the House further. We send this Bill to another place in the knowledge that we are sending a clear signal of our seriousness of purpose in tackling major fraud and in the confidence that this measure makes a very important contribution to that end. I commend the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

The amount of money a candidate may spend on the conduct or management of an election is presently restricted by Sections 76 and 197 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, as amended by the Representation of the People (Variation of Limits of Candidates' Election Expenses) Order 1986. Articles 2, 3, 5 and 6 of this order are intended to increase the current limits at parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom, local government elections in Great Britain and ward elections in the City of London in line with changes in the value of money since the last order was made on 1st March 1986. Articles 4 and 7 will provide a corresponding increase of 5.6 per cent. for candidates at ILEA elections and elections by liverymen in common hall to take account of the increase in the retail price index since they were fixed on 16th July 1985 by the Local Government Act 1985 and the Representation of the People Act 1985 respectively.<lb/>
Article 1 provides for the order to take effect on the day after the day on which it is made. This is in keeping with past practice and will enable parliamentary candidates in constituencies with, say, 60,000 electors to spend an extra &#x00A3;190 above the current maximum of &#x00A3;4,920 in borough constituencies and &#x00A3;5,460 in county constituencies at the next general election. It will also enable candidates who are in the midst of a campaign at a local government, ILEA or City of London election to fill a casual vacancy to incur expenditure to the new limits set by Articles 4 to 7 of the order. It will not, however, retrospectively authorise expenses in excess of the present limits which have been incurred before it takes effect.<lb/>
Consideration was given last autumn to the possible need to increase the limits at local elections in time for this year's elections on 7th May. However, no representations for such an increase had been made and there was nothing to suggest that the increase in the retail price index since 1st March 1986 would be sufficienty large to justify making an order at that time. Indeed, it was subsequently confirmed that the index only rose by 1.8 per cent. between that date and 31st October 1986. We accordingly decided to take no action on that occasion.<lb/>
In April, however, the Home Secretary decided to increase the limits at parliamentary elections by 4 per cent. to take account of inflation between March 1986 and 31st March 1987 because of a general expectation that those limits would be increased before the next general election. He also decided that, although such an order clearly could not be made in time for the local elections on 7th May, it would still be desirable to increase the limits for local government, ILEA elections and City of London elections at the same time to benefit candidates at elections to fill casual vacancies and ordinary elections held after that date.<lb/>
I should also stress that the making of this order will not preclude the making of another one for next year's
<col>608</col>
local elections, should this be necessary to allow the candidates to conduct an effective campaign. I therefore recommend these proposals to the House.</membercontribution></p>

The letter was from an investment trust, the chairman and chief executive, and it said that no doubt we shared the same views in the same circumstances etc. I should like to inform the House that this in no way implies that I failed in my duties as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I am looking forward on 12th June to the best possible golden wedding present of a Labour victory.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Parliamentary Constituencies (England) (Miscellaneous Changes) (No. 2) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02927"><member>Lord Beaverbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft order laid before the House on 30th April be approved. For brevity I shall call it the No. 2 order. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has considered the order and has approved it.<lb/>
We are considering here this evening the recommendations contained in a report made by the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for England. The commission has the statutory duty to keep the distribution of seats under continuous review. It has to review the whole country every 10 to 15 years, and the last of these general reviews was completed and implemented in 1983. However, in the interval between general reviews, changes are made to local authority boundaries at parish, district and county levels which mean that constituency boundaries no longer coincide with local government boundaries. The commission has been working to remove these anomalies to avoid the confusion and inconvenience they cause to electors, local authorities and political organisations.<lb/>
The draft order before your Lordships' House is similar in structure to those considered on previous occasions. Article 2 substitutes the constituencies in the schedule for those set out in the Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1983. Article 1(2) enables the order to come into force forthwith once it is made by Her Majesty in Council. Thus the new boundaries will be available for the general election.<lb/>
The No. 2 order deals with two constituencies in Berkshire that were originally included in an earlier review by the commission. This House considered the other 40 constituencies in this review on 17th March this year and the commission's recommendations
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0313"/>
<col>609</col>
were implemented in the Parliamentary Constituencies (England) (Miscellaneous Changes) Order 1987. A separate report was made on these two constituencies because the proposals were considered at a local inquiry in February. The assistant commissioner who conducted the inquiry concluded that the commission had been right to recommend that the newly enlarged parish of Finchampstead should be placed in the constituency of Reading, East, rather than being left divided between Reading, East and Wokingham. This would not only enable the ties within the newly created parish to be developed but also would reduce the disparity between the electorates of the two constituencies from 12,033 to 6,991.<lb/>
I invite your Lordships to approve this draft order for implementing the commission's proposals in full.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02938">Page 1, line 9, leave out ("this Act is") and insert ("the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 was").</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02939">The noble Lord said: I beg to move the amendment standing in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton. For brevity, and I am sure for clarity, this is a plea for retrospection. The arguments have been well rehearsed. The Minister and I had a useful exchange. I was sorry that he was unable to be here last week, and I understand that, but we had rehearsed the arguments some 12 months before.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02940">Let me say in his presence that I am grateful for the outcome of the review which took place and which finally led to the Government supporting the Bill that we have here. There is no argument from any quarter in this or the other House that the Government have acted not only properly but fairly and generously as to the future. I want that to appear on the record.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02941">We are concerned not only to bring people into the scope of new legislation but about the omission of deserving people. It seems ironic that the case for the future is made on the evidence from the past. The case that has been accepted by the Government and their inquiry is that it is right and proper to provide serving members of the armed forces with the opportunity (if they so wish and believe that it is their best recourse)
<col>610</col>
to go to the courts in order to obtain what they consider to be the best redress of a grievance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02942">There are dangers in doing so which must be weighed by the servicemen who feel so aggrieved and their advisers. However, there is a body of people whose experiences it would be too gruesome to read into the record yet again: they have already been read into the record in this House and in other places. In my view, the Minister ought not to rest wholly on the grounds that retrospective legislation is bad or inappropriate. He and a number of his Ministerial colleagues have not hesitated in this Parliament, and no doubt in other parliaments, to say that the circumstances of an issue at a particular time are right for retrospection. Here we are seeking to persuade the Minister to make the Bill effective not from the time that it is passed, which will be very soon, but from 1947.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02943">On the face of this Bill there are various financial provisions under the heading "Financial and public service manpower effects of the Bill", and various sums are mentioned. I am not in a position to query them. The sums are not massive but at the same time I appreciate that they are considerable when one realises that prior to this Bill there were no provisions of this kind at all. I honestly say to the Minister and his colleagues that I hope that the Government, in the last few days of this Parliament, can find it within their heart to produce whatever further sums of money are required. One does not know, because even for the future the wording on the face of the Bill indicates the uncertainty in trying to calculate the sums for the next 10 years. Even if I am right, we are talking in terms of 13 million over the next 10 years. I have no idea what the amount will be in respect of the past 40 years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02944">In my view, the case was powerfully argued by my good friend Mr. Jack Ashley, and by Mr. John Cartwright and Mr. Denzil Davies. I believe that it was listened to sympathetically by Members all round the House. I know that there is anxiety in another place that the Bill should not be lost. It is certainly not my intention to do anything which will cause that to happen. I believe that those who have suffered&#x2014;not merely those who have been injured but also their families and friends&#x2014;are entitled to be given the opportunity to test in a court of law their right to more adequate compensation than that which they received previously under any other system and which the Government and the Minister have fairly told the House has been available to them. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02945">7.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02946"><member>Lord Henderson of Brompton</member><membercontribution>: I support the amendment moved briefly but comprehensively by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton. I am sorry that I was not present at Second Reading but I read the debate with great interest. I feel very strongly that this Bill is entirely an all-party affair. Its provisions offer nothing but gain to the services, with one exception. The Bill creates what I shall say are three categories but which I believe should be one category. The benefits which are to be given under the Bill prospectively should apply retrospectively from 1947, as the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, has said.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0314"/>
<col>611</col>
At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Meston, who cannot be here today, effectively described that a friend of his had said that there were in a military hospital a number of soldiers who had suffered similar injuries during military service. They received three different kinds of compensation from three different funds. There was also the possibility of a fourth soldier who may have had the wrong leg amputated by a doctor and he would have been compensated, if at all, in yet another way.<lb/>
To my mind the Bill creates three further categories. For anyone who has suffered any injury, categorisation is pretty horrific. The noble Lord, Lord Meston, described the soldiers in a hospital. I remember that in the old days it was unthinkable that a soldier should have a right of action for negligence in respect of military service. Soldiers who had no right of action were in hospitals with those who had been injured in civilian life. Some received large compensation, some little compensation and some none at all. The unfairness of life came home to the soldiers when they mixed with civilians in a way which had not struck them before.<lb/>
The way in which opinion changes is illustrated by this Bill. It is a reversal of what we had all previously thought and I think that today we are all happy about it. The categories into which the Bill divides people are, first, those who benefit under the Bill as drafted and will receive its benefits after Royal Assent. They will have a legal entitlement to sue for negligence. Secondly, there are those who benefit on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis under the special arrangements being made in regard to claims between 8th December 1986&#x2014;which is the date of the announcement of this legislation&#x2014;and the date of Royal Assent of the Bill in 1987. Thirdly, there are those who are denied the benefit of claiming because their claim dates between 1947 and 1987.<lb/>
I believe that justice is clearly not being done between those three categories of servicemen and that we ought to be doing something to put it right. Mr. Jack Ashley moved that proposal in the House of Commons. During the debate in Committee I think that the argument was hardly countered by anyone present. It was only the vote on party lines which made his effort unsuccessful.<lb/>
The amendment is being repeated today. It may be that for some reason or another, which I cannot understand, the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, does not feel able to accept the amendment because it might not be agreed to in the House of Commons. There seems to me to be no argument on that matter because this is non-party business and I feel sure that the amendment will be agreed to without controversy. However, if that opinion is taken by the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, and the Minister, I suggest that three courses are available. The first course is that which has been advocated by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, and myself&#x2014;and which I think is by far the best case&#x2014;and it is to accept the amendment.<lb/>
If that course is excluded there is the suggestion of the Member in another place who introduced the Bill, Mr. Winston Churchill, of establishing a fund to compensate victims between 1947 and 1988. I think
<col>612</col>
that that is worthy of consideration but a limited fund might well not be the answer.<lb/>
The third alternative&#x2014;and perhaps this is the one which is really viable and which I would recommend to the Committee if the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, is not acceptable&#x2014;would be to extend the <i>ex gratia</i> proposal which has been put forward by the Secretary of State in another place in respect of those who are affected since the date of the announcement on 8th December last year until Royal Assent to the Bill this year so that the provisions he is going to make for them to have <i>ex gratia</i> payments in respect of admissible claims should be extended further back from 8th December last year to the date of the passing of the Act in 1947. If that were done I should be entirely happy and this unfortunate division of servicemen into three categories would be eliminated. I think that is second best, and with those words I should like to support the amendment put forward by the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02947"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: I am most grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Graham and Lord Henderson, for bringing forward this amendment, for a number of reasons. Like the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, I listened to the speech of my noble friend Lord Meston at an earlier stage of the Bill and I was much moved by the matters he described to us, as indeed I think were a number of your Lordships in all parts of the Chamber. I think I am right in saying that my noble friends on these Benches would all wish to see the adoption of an amendment like this or of one of the courses of action which have been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, because we believe that this is something which should be done.<lb/>
I am also glad that this amendment has been brought forward at a very late stage in this dying Parliament, in the knowledge of course that we may not be able to make a great deal of progress with it for reasons which are understandable. I, like the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, would understand if the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, who has done such excellent work in bringing the Bill thus far, does not wish in any way to imperil it. That would be understandable, though perhaps regrettable, because one hopes that some course of action could be found whereby difficulties could be avoided because of the timing.<lb/>
I think it is perhaps a good thing that this amendment has been brought forward, if only to demonstrate that your Lordships' Committee genuinely tries to do its very best on matters of this kind. I have always been told that this is a revising Chamber. When I sat for about half an hour during the proceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill earlier and listened to the Committee revising some 120 amendments in about 25 minutes, it seemed to me that the scrutiny we were giving them was not perhaps quite as close as the general public might have been led to believe. However, I think it is important that we do not allow the Bill to go further without making the points that have been made by the noble Lords, Lord Graham and Lord Henderson. It is a matter on which there is all-party support in both Houses of Parliament. I too have read most carefully the speeches of Mr. Jack Ashley, Mr. Cartwright and
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0315"/>
<col>613</col>
others, and it seemed to me that the general mood was that something of this kind ought to be done.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Henderson, outlined three possible courses of action. I and my noble friends on these Benches would undoubtedly prefer the first of those courses and we see no serious obstacles to its adoption; namely, the acceptance of this amendment. But if that cannot be done for reasons which we would understand, I hope that the opportunity will be seized for adopting one of the other two courses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02948"><member>The Minister of State for Defence Procurement (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: I wonder whether I might intervene at this moment to indicate where the Government stand. I am afraid I must tell the Committee that it would be quite wrong to try to make the repeal for which this Bill provides retrospective in the way that is proposed in the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and supported by the noble Lords, Lord Henderson and Lord Winstanley. I am afraid the Government are unable to agree to what is proposed.<lb/>
The reason why retrospection would be wrong was clearly stated by my noble friends Lord Gisborough and Lord Glenarthur last Wednesday when your Lordships gave this Bill a Second Reading. In view of their importance, perhaps I should repeat them briefly. First, there is the general presumption that legislation is for the future and not for the past. Secondly, although the noble Lord, Lord Graham, referred last week to examples of where the Government, in his view, had legislated retrospectively on issues favourable to them, nevertheless, I think, with respect, that he may have missed the point and failed to distinguish between legislation which might confer retrospectively rights and benefits on individuals and legislation which, under his proposal, would impose retrospective legal liability upon individuals for their actions.<lb/>
Surely it would be both wrong and unfair to turn back the legal clock and impose upon service personnel, who need not now concern themselves over the possibility that their acts or omissions may give rise to civil actions, legal liability for their past actions, even though the Crown as their employer might relieve them of any financial risk by settling claims and paying the damages awarded by a court. What about those former service personnel, long since retired, who might have to be told that they will need to shoulder the burden of civil liability for what they did so many years ago?<lb/>
Perhaps I can illustrate this point by hypothetical example. The noble Lord, Lord Graham, had a distinguished war service in the Royal Marines, and he told your Lordships about it last week during our consideration of the Bill on Second Reading. I was sorry to learn that he was badly injured during his service. Suppose that he had been transferred from the Royal Marines into the Royal Army Service Corps in the year just after the war, say, after the Crown Proceedings Act was passed in 1947. Let us further suppose that an army vehicle he was driving had overturned, injuring a passenger who was an army comrade. Under the terms of Section 10 of the 1947 Act, as we have heard, the driver would be immune
<col>614</col>
from legal liability for his actions, and perhaps his negligence, in causing the accident and would probably have forgotten all about the incident.<lb/>
Under this amendment the noble Lord would now have us turn back the legal clock some 40 years and say to that driver, "You are now legally liable for your actions so long ago". Although the Ministry of Defence will pay the cost of any claim which that driver's injured passenger might now make in respect of the injuries he sustained all that time ago, nevertheless, formal legal liability and all that that entails would lie for ever on the shoulders of the driver of that vehicle. It might even mean court appearances if a writ is issued. Is it fair or reasonable to turn back the clock in this way and make such a serviceman or ex-serviceman legally liable for what he may have done so long ago? I believe it is not. Does the noble Lord wish to intervene?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02949"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: I shall wait until the Minister has finished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02950"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Thirdly, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, acknowledged in your Lordships' debate last week the practical difficulties that could be encountered. It must be recognised that the imposition of retrospective provisions would create severe problems and would lead no doubt to many examples of unfairness, since the Ministry of Defence, and ultimately the courts, would be unable to consider and properly assess those old cases where the necessary evidence and witnesses are no longer available. Even in comparatively recent cases of death, injury or illness, prospective claimants will not have considered the possibility of raising a common law claim because of the bar established by Section 10 of the 1947 Act. So material evidence, essential when pursuing a claim through the courts, may well have been lost.<lb/>
I turn now to the question of a possible regime of <i>ex gratia</i> payments. We have dealt at some length with the question of whether the Bill should contain provisions to make its effects retrospective, and I have endeavoured to explain the Government's view. But I should perhaps remind the Committee&#x2014;certainly the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, acknowledged this&#x2014;that when my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 8th December last the Government's intention to repeal Section 10, he made it clear that he would consider claims arising from incidents which occurred from that date, not on the basis of legal liability, since the existence of Section 10 would prevent that, but on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.<lb/>
I can confirm that the Ministry of Defence is now dealing with a number of claims on that basis and that this interim scheme will continue to operate in respect of deaths, illnesses or injuries resulting from incidents in the period of time between the Government's announcement last December and the date of the Bill's enactment. It has been suggested by some noble Lords and indeed by others outside your Lordships' Chamber that by somehow extending the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme back in time beyond the date of the Government's announcement in December, we might thereby be able to help those who suffered illness or injury before December.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0316"/>
<col>615</col>
I am afraid that that approach is not a practicable one. I ask those who would argue for an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme for dealing with past cases where the cut-off line for considering old claims would be drawn. Whatever line was drawn would be totally arbitrary and some claims would always fall on the wrong side of it. Furthermore, the same consideration would apply to dealing with old claims on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis as to dealing with them within the framework of retrospective legislation. Many old cases would be impossible to assess because the evidence and witnesses are just not available. How would Parliament be able to justify the establishment of such a system that is riddled with potential injustices and unfairness?<lb/>
It would be unfortunate if our early approval of this very valuable measure were to be clouded by consideration of how, in an ideal world, we might assist further those individuals who are suffering from the effects of accidents in the past. Whatever criticisms might be levelled at the provisions of this Bill, it is worth pointing out that there is a good system of financial benefits available to ensure that those unfortunate ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who have been injured in the past and the beloved dependents of those who have been so tragically killed are not left without any form of assistance.<lb/>
The system of automatic payment of disability and pension benefits will continue to operate with those eligible being entitled to lump sums and, where applicable, annual pensions. These benefits are linked to the retail price index, are largely tax free and do not involve the hazards and expense of the individuals concerned having to resort to the courts in litigation. Despite the fact that those people who were injured before 8th December last will not be able to pursue claims for common law damages, we have an adequate system for meeting the needs of those concerned. We shall continue to review that system of benefits to ensure that they remain adequate for the needs of those involved.<lb/>
The Committee will, of course, wish to consider this amendment on its merits. However, it is my duty to inform the Committee that if the amendment is accepted there will be no prospect of this Bill receiving the Royal Assent in this Parliament. Although the Government fully support the Bill, I am unable to give any undertaking as to when such a Bill would find a place in the Government's legislative programme for the new Parliament. The choice before the Committee this evening is therefore between accepting the Bill as it stands, and it commands a broad measure of support and will be widely welcomed as a genuine reform for the benefit of our servicemen, and losing the Bill with at best uncertainty about the timing of its reintroduction.<lb/>
The Bill introduced by my noble friend Lord Gisborough deserves swift pasasge in what remains of this Parliament. I commend it most strongly to the Committee as it stands. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will not press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02951">8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02952"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: It is easy to have a lot of superficial sympathy for the amendment that has been
<col>616</col>
moved. On the face of it, we should all like to have retrospection if possible. But it has been fully explained how totally impracticable that would be. There would be the problem of a lack of witnesses, who may have died or dispersed. And even if witnesses were available, their memory of events that happened so many years ago would be very faulty and the decisions reached by boards would bear no relation to the facts at the time.<lb/>
I support the remarks of my noble friend the Minister. This Bill is needed and has universal support. It would be a great shame if it were lost by virtue of an amendment being carried, that would kill it for the Session and perhaps for a long time. I hope that the proposers will feel able to withdraw their amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02953"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: I should like to begin by recognising immediately the seriousness and significance of the Minister's remarks that although we appear to have a choice, in effect, we have no choice at all. Like many of those who have spoken in this discussion and in another place, I appreciate the enormity of the step that the Minister took on 8th December last year. No one will lose sight of that.<lb/>
We were hoping to build upon it. The Minister says that if we seek to do so and succeed, in effect we shall kill the Bill. Certainly, I am not willing to do that. However, the Minister needs to reflect seriously upon his conception of an adequate system for those who suffered an injury before 8th December and on what his ministerial colleague said last week was a satisfactory system.<lb/>
This morning I received a letter from Mrs. Carol Mills, who is the secretary of STAG (Section Ten Action Group) and whose name is well known in relation to this issue. She says:
<quote>"It distresses me more than I can say that, as far as the severely disabled members of STAG are concerned, the existing pensions and awards"&#x2014;</quote>
that is the adequate system&#x2014;
<quote>"should be considered satisfactory. If it were true, they would not have felt it necessary to campaign so vigorously for the repeal of Section 10 and the Government would certainly not have agreed to It.</quote>
There is a difference between us, and a dilemma. I can well understand the Minister feeling that the system is satisfactory. He has enormous responsibilities. But I am not speaking on behalf of the Ministry. I am speaking on behalf of the people who have been injured or maimed and whose lives have been wrecked. They take a different view. We are seeking to persuade the Minister and the Government that their claims are sufficiently strong at least to allow them to be tested in a court.<lb/>
The Minister is absolutely right that after 40 years it will entail great difficulty. But it will be their great difficulty and not that of the Ministry. When the Minister defends the nominal individual who has to face the court&#x2014;I shall come back to his remarks about that later&#x2014;there will, of course, be problems. There will be problems in any case, apart from problems of trying to find evidence, documentary or personal. There would be problems after four years, let alone 40 years. Of course the difficulty is enormous. But we are seeking to ensure the principle of having the right to do it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0317"/>
<col>617</col>
Fair and kind comments were made by the Minister about my experience in 1944, which I described to the House last month. But what about the poor man who years ago was involved in a terrible accident? No finger of blame was pointed at him at the time, but he then finds that 40 years later he is summoned to court and charged with negligence of a terrible kind. I venture to suggest that, faced with the knowledge that someone has suffered for 40 years as a consequence of an accident in which he was involved, that man will be able to relieve his mind of the burden of responsibility because he was acting within the services. I think that he will be somewhat satisfied that after 40 years the damage that was done has been compensated and the grievance that was suffered has been redressed.<lb/>
We are discussing hypothetical cases, but I imagine that someone who has been proved liable in a court of law will be aware that the injuries suffered can never by put right by a sum of money, whatever that sum is. I think that he will find it easier to live with his conscience if it has been assuaged by a decision of the court.<lb/>
The Minister asked where one draws the line. He drew the line on <i>ex gratia</i> payments as of tonight or of tomorrow or when this Bill becomes an Act. He drew that line at 8th December when he made the announcement. If that announcement had been made a week earlier one assumes that fewer people would have been affected. We suggest that the line should have been drawn at the date when the previous Act was passed. We understand that 40 years constitutes an enormous length of time but all the evidence that we have does not concern what happened to people after December 8th or will happen to them after 22nd May. We have evidence of what happened to people before December 8th and after 1947.<lb/>
But I take what the Minister has said and, whatever else other people may say, I am satisfied. I know that the Ministers responsible, not merely the Minister who has taken the Bill through this place but the Minister in another place, Mr. Freeman, listen very attentively and deserve the gratitude of many people. In the future, those people will be able to rely upon this repeal to get their redress.<lb/>
Certainly no one has come out of this in bad odour. I understand the problems of the Government, and I simply say that I hope that Parliament will be able to find some means in future to add an additional veneer to the Bill, which I wish well when it gets on to the statute book. That veneer is one of compassion and mercy of people who have suffered through no fault of their own and who will continue to suffer in the future, not from a hurt but from a grievance and from a bitterness that they have not got their justice. Unless anyone else wishes to speak, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02970"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a third time. In so doing, I should like to thank your Lordships for enabling the Bill's passage and for agreeing to the small but important improvements made to the Bill in this House. The Bill is all the better for that. The provisions on appeals against conditions of registration now encompass conditions made at any time, and a formal system exists for the notification by local authorities of their intention to make such conditions. In addition, the provisions on charging for registration have been extended to place health boards in a similar position as regards the scope of charges to local authorities under other provisions in the Bill.<lb/>
It has so happened that our consideration of this Bill has coincided with a very busy time and long hours spent on a major piece of Scottish legislation. Nevertheless, the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, and the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, have found time to give careful attention to the Bill and I am most grateful to them. I am sorry that the reprogramming of today's business means that neither noble Lord can be in his place this evening, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, for his presence on the Front Bench opposite. I should also like to thank the Government, and notably my noble friend the Minister, for their assistance, encouragement and support. Last, but by no means least, I express gratitude to the officials of the Scottish Office who have done so much work on the Bill and have been a very great help to me.<lb/>
My honourable friend Mr. Albert McQuarrie, the Member for Banff and Buchan, is well known for his

energy and expertise in the promotion of Private Member's Bills. It seems to me that in introducing this Bill he has again rendered an excellent service to us in Scotland. As it now stands, the Bill considerably enhances the existing legislation on the registration of social work establishments and nursing homes. It is my hope that the effect of the new arrangements will prove of considerable benefit to the authorities concerned, to the establishments and nursing homes concerned and, above all, to their customers. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02973"><member>Lord Kirkhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would be usual for my noble friends Lord Ross of Marnock or Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, or both, to stand at this Dispatch Box upon this occasion. But as the noble Baroness mentioned, and as I now confirm, both have an inescapable prior engagement this evening, not perhaps entirely unconnected with the events of this week. So I find myself standing on this side of the Table, although for many years I often stood in front of where the noble Earl now sits. But I am sure that he too will stand at the Dispatch Box if only for a moment.<lb/>
I come late to the Bill, but I notice that it is quite technical in character and complex in nature. Indeed I detected from a more than casual reading of <i>Hansard</i> that my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock succeeded in posing a number of quite penetrating questions relating to Clause 2, questions which I thought evinced a measure of confusion between the noble Baroness and the then government spokesman. The noble Lord who sits opposite most kindly copied to me a letter which he had sent earlier to my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock. It appears from that that the important point which he raised under Clause 2 received a very comprehensive reply from the Scottish Office. I acknowledge that publicly and thank the Minister for his consideration.<lb/>
It only remains for me to say that I consider that the noble Baroness has very competently and with considerable graciousness of spirit carried a most complicated yet important piece of Scottish legislation through your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

I am sure that we would all wish to join her in expressing our thanks to him.<lb/>
With regard to the proceedings in this House, I congratulate my noble friend Lady Carnegy on her successful piloting of the Bill, particularly when so much of her valuable time has been devoted lately to another piece of proposed Scottish legislation with which a number of your Lordships here tonight are also concerned and which, to borrow from the terminology of Clause 1 of this Bill, has had to be almost our "sole or main" object of attention over the last few weeks while its detailed discussion has certainly constituted our "whole or substantial function"&#x0021;<lb/>
<col>620</col>
I should also like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Ross, for taking such a keen interest in the substance of the Bill and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, for his support and kind remarks this evening. Like my noble friend Lady Carnegy, I too hope that those concerned with the registration and operation of establishments covered by the Bill will value the improvements which it contains to the existing provisions in this area.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-02984">Whether they have made a new agreement with RoSPA for their road safety work in England.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-02985"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member>: I pay tribute to the work RoSPA has achieved in the past and to the challenge it has set for the future.
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0319"/>
<col>621</col>
A new agreement has just been signed. It follows extensive discussion with RoSPA, and reflects RoSPA's new marketing-led, business orientated approach to road safety. The views of the local authority associations have been taken into account. RoSPA has set itself ambitious but achieveable targets for streamlining and improving cost-effectiveness. Grant for England will be for &#x00A3;530,000 in 1987&#x2013;88 but will reduce as RoSPA achieves its long-term plans. Additional grant will continue to be available for specific activities which offer good value for money.</p>

<title>Overseas Aid Projects: Women's Interests</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03007"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government how they intend to pursue their policy of integrating women more fully into their overseas aid projects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03008"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we recognise the importance of taking the role of women fully into account in all aid projects. Some of our projects include special components for women. We are prepared to contribute to projects specifically devoted to helping women.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03009"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the position of women as workers, as traders and as thinkers is crucial to the whole development exercise? Does she further agree that women in the third world are a disadvantaged group? Is she aware that the reputable organisation War on Want has publicly stated that the British aid programme is damaging the interests of some women in the third world and it is anxious that the Ministry should say specifically what it is doing to assist women in the use of development aid from this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03010"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will be glad to know that I agree very much about the importance of women as traders and thinkers. He will be glad to know that we are well aware that almost 90 per cent. of food for domestic consumption in Africa is produced by women. The ODA's method of keeping statistics makes it difficult to provide precise figures on the amount of aid going to women in the developing world. However, all aid benefits women and some projects have special components for women. We are considering ways to prepare statistics on the proportion of aid going to help women. We want to do more. We have produced a booklet, of which I am sure the noble Lord is aware, which sets out 18 projects designed specifically to help women.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03011"><member>Baroness Lockwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Baroness be surprised to learn that I also agree with my noble friend Lord Hatch on this point? Will she tell us whether steps are in hand not only to obtain statistics on our aid to these countries but also to monitor the effect of the special projects for women? Does she agree that if we are to give the most effective aid to these countries, it is important to monitor, and in the light of the monitoring perhaps to adjust, our assistance?</membercontribution></p>
<col>626</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03012"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. The noble Baroness makes a good point. It is important that we should use our aid effectively and I can assure her that we take steps to monitor how it is used in the developing world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03013"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness take pains to ensure that in the course of our interference with the affairs of the third world we do not interfere with the established rights of husband and wife in third world families?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03014"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's question begs a great many other questions. It is not a matter on which I would want to pronounce this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03015"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the role of the VSO in these matters is of great importance. Is she aware that the number of volunteers who are women is considerable and that the part they play is enormously important?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03016"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can confirm the importance of NGOs in their work both at home and in developing countries. It is something that we appreciate and have supported.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03017"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the welfare of women is involved in practically every aspect of life in developing countries, should not every project undertaken by the Overseas Development Administration be monitored to see that it takes account of the needs of women? I believe that to be the procedure in the ODA in respect of family planning projects. Every one is vetted from that point of view. Would it not be suitable to use the same procedure in relation to women's questions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03018"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, the noble Lord is quite correct in what he says. All aid affects women in one way or another. The booklet to which I have referred, a copy of which is in the Library, gives examples of 18 projects. A recent example is our major support for the Open University in Pakistan, which helps to educate people excluded from formal education, especially rural women. This has been helpful. I accept his point about recognising within our administrative arrangements the importance of monitoring the work that is being done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03019"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the Government are abolishing many of the good things in life, can the noble Baroness give us a serious assurance that the Government have no plans to abolish women?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03020"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the short answer to the noble Lord is that I have always believed in the natural superiority of women over men and would not think of abolishing women.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03021"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her sympathy with the spirit behind this Question. Is she aware that in real terms overseas aid today is 20 per cent. less than it was in 1979, that only 20 per cent. of present overseas aid is spent in the interests of the poorest of the developing countries,
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0322"/>
<col>627</col>
and that therefore the amount that goes to women must be very tiny indeed? Would she consider, in support of what she appeared to be sympathetic towards in the question of my noble friend Lord Oram, the setting up in the ODA of a women's unit to ensure that every development project funded by this country is vetted before it is put into practice to see what its effect on women in the third world country will be, as has been promised by the Labour Party?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03022"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would not accept the remarks which prefaced the noble Lord's supplementary question. We do not believe that a women's unit would be helpful within the ODA. We believe that it would marginalise the issue and that women could be forgotten in many projects. It is much more important to integrate women's interests in all development issues and to ensure that they stay in the mainstream. That is our view about this matter, and this is something to which I personally attach great importance. I believe it is an effective way of helping women in the developing world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03023"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend think that it is a good thing that Question Time should develop to a point where the questioner on the Order Paper seems to have the right to give a winding-up speech as though he is answering a debate?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03024"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister be good enough to use her offices to encourage the policy of integrating women more fully into their inheritance rights in your Lordships' House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03025"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will know that that is very wide of the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>

The Secretary of State for Social Services decided that all medical costs incurred in Belgium by victims of the disaster would be met from public funds.</membercontribution></p>

account of the efficient service that has been provided by the DHSS in the face of that stark disaster, may I further ask whether the Government have expressed suitable appreciation and gratitude to the Belgian authorities for their invaluable assistance at that time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03030"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on 22nd May my noble friend the Minister hopes to visit the six Belgian hospitals which looked after the United Kingdom victims to present each of them with a specially commissioned plaque in recognition of the care and support that they gave to those involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03031"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we would all wish to associate ourselves with the thanks of the House to the members of staff who had such difficult work to do in this terrible disaster. Perhaps I may ask the Minister whether there are any claims still outstanding, and also whether any money payments were in the shape of grants and not loans so that people will not be expected to repay any financial help that was given to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03032"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, I join with the noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, in congratulating our staff on their efforts. I remind her of my first Answer, which showed the great lengths to which the department went in order to be able to help victims as soon as possible both in Belgium and at the port of entry in the United Kingdom. The victims of the disaster are spread throughout the United Kingdom and the department has not collated any special statistics relating to them after they passed into the United Kingdom. However, I can assure the noble Baroness that claims were given the prompt attention of the department, and as in any emergency we have endeavoured to expedite them as speedily as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03033"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend the Minister also consider paying tribute to the many voluntary organisations which helped at that particular time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03034"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03035"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has it been taken on board that the most important thing on this sort of occasion, and which ought to be made compulsory, is that there should be a complete and accurate list of the names of all those on board; and that this is most important not only for the relatives of those who die but also to make sure that the ship is not overloaded, which on this occasion seems to have been a bit marginal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03036"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that that is a question which has nothing to do with the department.</membercontribution></p>

<title>South Africa: Suggested Visit by PM</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03037">2.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03038"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0323"/>
<col>629</col>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the Prime Minister will visit South Africa in order to express, as she did in the USSR, the British people's dedication to human rights by meeting at the British Embassy in South Africa representatives of dissident movements and visiting typical African locations in the company of black leaders.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03039"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has no plans to visit South Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03040"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Baroness whether it is not a fact that on the Prime Minister's visit to Moscow she carried out the activities which are described in my Question on South Africa? Historically is not South Africa far more important to us than the Soviet Union? Therefore should we not be active in South Africa, on behalf of those who are denied human rights, to the same degree at least that we are in the Soviet Union?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03041"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure that the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, would not in any way underestimate the great importance of relations between East and West at the present time. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has repeatedly made clear her total condemnation of apartheid. She has not visited South Africa during her term of office but she has met a number of black South African leaders, including Chief Buthelezi, Archbishop Tutu and Chief Mabuza. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State visited South Africa in July 1986 and visited Soweto. During his visit black opposition leaders refused to see him. Since that time we have noted that a number of ANC leaders have met FCO Ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03042"><member>Lord Kinnaird</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister not agree that this is a clear case of fools rushing in where angels fear to tread?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03043"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness agree that, in the light of the swing to the right in the white South African elections, and the deteriorating situation throughout southern Africa, it is of the greatest importance that Her Majesty's Government show sympathy for those who appear to speak for the oppressed people in southern Africa, of whom the African National Congress and SWAPO for Namibia are among the chief?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03044"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have indicated, my right honourable and learned friend the Foreign Secretary met Mr. Tambo in September 1986. He met Archbishop Tutu in March of this year. Perhaps I may remind the right reverend Prelate that since 1979 we have maintained a wide-ranging aid programme to South Africa and the neighbouring states. We have given &#x00A3;1 million for training 100 black South Africans in the United Kingdom and &#x00A3;250,000 for British Council activities in South Africa. We have recently announced an additional &#x00A3;15&#x00B7;75 million over five years for assistance in southern Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<col>630</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03045"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following the recent election in South Africa, is the Minister aware that Archbishop Tutu, to whom she specifically referred, said that South Africa had reached its darkest stage? To what extent has the situation there, following the election, been considered by Her Majesty's Government, and what steps do they propose to take to ameliorate the position and the appalling possibilities of a great crisis with much bloodshed in South Africa?<lb/>
Does the noble Baroness not agree that Her Majesty's Government have an important responsibility to take positive steps to seek to achieve a settlement in South Africa? Is there any significance in the appointment of Mr. Robin Renwick as Ambassador to South Africa? We read his book with great interest. Finally, what attitude do Her Majesty's Government now have towards the imposition of economic sanctions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03046"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards the election in South Africa, the outcome is a matter for the white electorate. It is disappointing that they have clearly voted against any major change of policy. We have made absolutely plain our position on apartheid. In answering the right reverend Prelate, I indicated what we have done to help black South Africans, the front line states and countries in South Africa. Our view on sanctions is well known. It is interesting that during his visit to London last week President Chissano from Mozambique said that he knew that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister shared the aim of eradicating apartheid in South Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03047"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, did my noble friend see the article by Natan Sharansky in yesterday's <i>Times</i>? It pointed out the astonishing double standard which the West is taking in that 5 million Soviet citizens are in camps or prisons and that, as a percentage of the population, the position is 10 times more serious than the very serious position in South Africa. Is it not possible to make representations on account of those minorities as well as the minorities in South Africa?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03048"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes. The answer to my noble friend is that Her Majesty's Government deplore the violation of human rights wherever they may occur.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03049"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness accept that two appalling and frightening aspects of inhuman behaviour do not make for good behaviour? In so far as she has clearly said that the Government have rightly expressed their detestation of apartheid, can we not on this occasion make it plain that we also support the United States of America? That country has not only expressed, with us, its detestation of apartheid, but is now beginning to inflict a form of industrial control leading to what it believes will make the South Africans think again. Can we not support our ally, the United States of America, in its endeavours?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03050"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware of the view of Her Majesty's Government as regards economic sanctions.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0324"/>
<col>631</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03051"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that, in spite of the results of the election, there is at the moment a strong feeling for reform in South Africa and that it may be necessary to use a little more carrot to encourage them to set about achieving that? Is the Minister also aware that there are 14 different interests there? If we expect them to settle the problem with 14 different interests, should we not show them how to achieve that in Ireland, where we have only two?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03052"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to my noble friend is that we totally condemn apartheid. In 1987 we shall continue our efforts to work with our partners in the European Community and other like-minded countries to promote dialogue towards peaceful fundamental change, and we reject violence on all sides. There is no easy solution. Punitive sanctions are a false panacea and some of its advocates are already having second thoughts. The South African election results show that the United States congressional sanctions were counterproductive with the white electorate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03056"><member>The Lord President of the Council (Viscount Whitelaw)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that one noble Lord must sit down while the other speaks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03057"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Baroness agree that, since the days of Lord Palmerston, it has been a fundamental principle of British foreign policy not to interfere in the domestic affairs of other sovereign states? Will the Minister assure the House that that principle still applies?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03058"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I set out the policy of the British Government in respect of this matter in answer to my noble friend Lord Gisborough.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03059"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the first intervention from these Benches will be in order after four from the Labour Opposition. While the House accepts that the Government have always made clear their detestation of apartheid, could they not now begin to make clear their admiration and respect for democracy, and point out to South Africa and the world that it will get nowhere by having elections among the small white minority while leaving the large black majority disenfranchised?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03060"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we support democracy. We have promoted the principle of peaceful dialogue within South Africa by talking to all the parties. We have implemented a programme of positive and restrictive measures which have been agreed with our 12 Community partners and the Commonwealth, and we have fulfilled all our undertakings. We have helped black South Africans: 80 young black South African students have recently arrived here on scholarships.<lb/>
<col>632</col>
We have taken a firm line on abuses of human rights. Our ambassador made a major <i>d&#x00E9;marche</i> on 19th December on behalf of the Twelve and we have assisted the front-line states in reducing their economic and transport dependence on South Africa. But at the end of the day I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, and to those who think like him that it is the South Africans themselves who will achieve change. External influence is limited and the prime responsibility lies with the South African Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03062"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I thank the noble Baroness for her reply to me and ask her whether it would not highlight the coming general election if a statement were made during the campaign that Britain was not only opposed to apartheid in word but was prepared to take action, as suggested in my Question, to end it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03063"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate the sincerity of the point that the noble Lord makes. I hope he will feel that in answer to his supplementary question I have made plain the steps we have taken in meeting leaders from all parts of South Africa and in our condemnation of violations of human rights wherever they occur.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03064"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, reverting to the original Question, does the noble Baroness agree that there is no point in the Prime Minister, or indeed any overseas visitor for that matter, visiting South African black townships, as they are now called, without during the same visit seeing similar townships in other parts of Africa so as to be able to make a fair comparison?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03065"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no doubt there is much in what the noble Lord says, but I have nothing more to add as regards the policy of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Naval Rules of Engagement</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03066">3.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03067"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in the event of war, NATO navies, including the Royal Navy, would fight under the <i>New Maritime Strategy</i> announced by the US Chief of Naval Operations in January last year, and whether in peacetime they will exercise under the present US rules of engagement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03068"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord Glenarthur)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the event of war, the Royal Navy and the navies of other NATO countries which had been assigned to NATO command would operate in accordance with the concepts developed by the NATO military authorities and agreed by alliance nations. In peacetime, the Royal Navy and the navies of other NATO countries operate and exercise under their own national rules of engagement or, if they have
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0325"/>
<col>633</col>
been assigned to NATO command for a particular exercise, under NATO rules of engagement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03069"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the point is, do the NATO rules of engagement coincide with the <i>New Maritime Strategy</i>? Since this says that during a conventional war Soviet ballistic missile-firing submarines might be sunk in order to change the nuclear balance and to persuade the Russians to sue for peace, is it not a clear example of a pre-emptive strategic first strike? Has it been discussed at political level in NATO?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03070"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Alliance naturally reviews and updates its rules of engagement from time to time but it is not our practice to give details or to discuss operational matters of this sort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03071"><member>Lord Hill-Norton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Question quite misunderstands the arrangements of the Royal Navy and other navies declared to NATO? The United States Chief of Naval Operations, I am sure the noble Lord would agree, has nothing whatever to do with NATO arrangements. Is he aware that the two supreme commanders concerned in NATO are SACLANT and CINCHAN? They obtain their instructions from the NATO Military Committee. There is no conceivable possibility of strategy being developed by any authority other than the NATO Military Committee, and endorsed by the NATO Council. Finally, does he agree that even if the Question were well advised, it would be quite wrong to give the information requested?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03072"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03073"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and gallant Lord is quite right. The United States maritime strategy is a matter for the United States.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03074"><member>Lord Irving of Dartford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that in the short time this Question has been on the Order Paper I have consulted several experts, including the editor of one of our defence journals, and no one has ever heard of the <i>New Maritime Strategy</i>? Will he tell us the essential difference between the <i>New Maritime Strategy</i> and the old maritime strategy, or will he need a longer period of notice?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03075"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that question is one which should be addressed to the noble Lord, Lord Kennet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03076"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that he is quite mistaken in saying that the Government never discuss the rules of engagement? On 5th March this year his noble friend Lord Trefgarne sent to me a very helpful statement of the Government's policy on rules of engagement in the Gulf. Is he also aware that the previous supplementary question was based on ignorance and that I am prepared to send full details of the <i>New Maritime Strategy</i> to any noble Lord who is interested?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03077"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can go no further than my original Answer. It is not our practice to give details or make known discussions on operational matters of the sort to which the noble Lord refers.</membercontribution></p>
<col>634</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03078"><member>Lord Mellish</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that at any rate some of us think this Question is absolutely barmy? I cannot believe that any of your Lordships would be expected to know what the strategy of our nation would be in the event of war. Who is going to tell what to whom&#x2014;certainly not to the enemy. The question could not be more daft.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill</title>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03083"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Lord Lyell)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that no amendments have been set down to this Bill and that no noble Lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in Committee. Therefore, unless any noble Lord objects, I beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03084">Moved, That the order of commitment be discharged. &#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03085">On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03086">Then, Standing Order No. 44 having been dispensed with (pursuant to Resolution of 12th May):</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03087"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a third time.<lb/>
I should like to refer briefly to four matters which were raised by noble Lords in our debate last week. The first of these issues is the question of the composition of the Crown Court for the trial of scheduled offences. The noble Lords, Lord Hampton, Lord Donaldson and Lord Hylton, expressed support for the idea that the court should consist of three judges. The case for such a change rests on two assumptions: first, that a three-judge court would result in an objectively better system of justice; and,
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0326"/>
<col>635</col>
secondly, that a three-judge court would inspire greater public confidence in the administration of justice. The Government are not at present persuaded that either of these assumptions is justified.<lb/>
I should like to say a few more words about the question of a code of practice for the exercise of emergency powers, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Legislation for Northern Ireland is being prepared which will be equivalent to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, including provisions requiring the introduction of codes of practice for the exercise of police powers. The Government recognise the desirability of providing a clear statement of the powers available to the security forces and indicating clearly the ways in which those powers should be exercised, but codes directly equivalent to those issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act would not bite on the exercise of powers under the emergency legislation. My honourable friend the Minister of State in another place accordingly announced on 8th April the Government's intention of publishing and bringing into force a non-statutory code of practice for the exercise of emergency powers by the RUC and the armed forces.<lb/>
Thirdly, I mentioned last week that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State was considering the appointment of an independent person of standing to review the operation of the emergency provisions legislation each year. I am glad to be able to tell the House that my right honourable friend has decided that such a review should be carried out and that the Government have asked my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross to undertake this task. My noble friend produced a thorough and helpful review of the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act throughout the United Kingdom earlier this year and has just undertaken to carry out a rather more substantial review of that Act. All that will put my noble friend in a strong position when separately reviewing the operation of the emergency provisions legislation to assess the whole package of emergency powers that applies in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to cover the point raised by several noble Lords about the availability of remission to convicted prisoners in Northern Ireland. In most cases it is 50 per cent. remission of the original sentence. I stresss that the remission applies only to what we call determinate sentences; that is sentences that are not life sentences. Remission can be lost if the prisoner commits disciplinary offences and unlike what happens in England and Wales remission is conditional. The balance of the sentence may be reimposed by the courts if the person concerned is reconvicted. The 50 per cent. remission arrangements reflect the difficulty of establishing a parole system in Northern Ireland but I can assure noble Lords that the whole system is kept under review.<lb/>
I and the Government were delighted with the welcome given to the Bill last week when we discussed it on Second Reading. I acknowledge that many noble Lords may be disappointed that we have not been able to have a fuller discussion of that particular legislation because, certainly, it is sensitive. We believe that further discussion would have merits but we are very encouraged by the support of this Chamber for the
<col>636</col>
Bill. We hope that its provisions will find their way onto the statute book at the earliest opportunity. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03088">Moved, That the Bill be now read a third time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03089"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for the assurances that he has brought to the House this afternoon. Of course we are saddened that it is still necessary to have emergency provisions legislation in Northern Ireland. But the Bill, which amends the current legislation in a number of respects, will be an improvement on that legislation. It gives greater protection to the individual citizen without causing damage to the requirements of security.<lb/>
In the Second Reading debate last Friday, the Bill was welcomed generally by the House. From these Benches we indicated about half a dozen areas that we should have wished to explore in Committee, believing that the Bill would have benefited from such discussion. However, we have been overtaken by events, as we had anticipated. We are pleased to support the Bill and to facilitate its passage before the dissolution of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03090"><member>Lord Hampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for his comments on some points that I raised at Second Reading and welcome the review planned by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville. In the <i>Official Report</i> I was quoted as saying that we should be happy if the emergency provisions were in future removed annually. The passage should of course have read, "renewed annually". Quite a lot of hard work went into this Bill in the other place and we are grateful that it is in pretty good shape. I do not think that I can with advantage add further to the debate. We support the Third Reading but with some regret that more time has not been available to scrutinise such important legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03091"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may utter a few words of deep gratitude to the two noble Lords who have spoken for all the work that has been done on the Bill in this Chamber as well as that done by colleagues in another place. I am sure that all that has been said this afternoon and during our discussions at an earlier stage will be read with encouragement by my colleagues in another place. I beg to move.<lb/>

<title>Landlord and Tenant (No. 2) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03093">3.15 p. m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03094"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill before your Lordships implements the main findings of the committee chaired by Mr. Edward Nugee, QC, which examined the problems of management in privately
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0327"/>
<col>637</col>
owned blocks of flats. The prime purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the rights of people living in privately owned flats, and it applies whether the flat is in a mansion block, in a more recent purpose-built development or in a conversion of a house or other premises. In some respects we have gone further than the committee recommended, but the core of the Bill is based firmly on the findings of the Nugee Report.<lb/>
The Government set up the committee in 1984 because of our growing concern about the management problems which were emerging in private blocks of flats. The report, which was produced in November 1985, showed that there are indeed severe problems affecting the management of many blocks, although there are also many landlords and agents who undoubtedly achieve high standards of management and consumer satisfaction.<lb/>
The proposals of the Nugee Committee reflected a wide spectrum of opinion. The committee consisted of members drawn from various professional bodies and representing the viewpoints of landlords and tenants. It is a remarkable achievement to have reached unanimous recommendations on so much, and I should like to pay tribute to the committee.<lb/>
Turning briefly to the content of the Bill, Part I gives qualifying tenants a right of first refusal where the landlord wishes to dispose of his interest in a block of flats. The Nugee Report suggested a procedure based on offer and counter-offer which would give tenants the first refusal at a price to be negotiated between the parties within a set timetable. We have implemented those recommendations.<lb/>
Part II enables any tenant of a flat, whether a long leaseholder or rack-renting tenant, to apply to the court for the appointment of a manager to take over the management of the premises where the landlord has failed to discharge his obligations under the terms of the lease.<lb/>
Part III enables a majority of leaseholders of flats in a block let wholly or mainly on long leases to apply to the court for an order to acquire compulsorily the landlord's interest where the landlord has failed to discharge his obligations and the appointment of a manager would not be an adequate remedy or where a manager has been appointed for three years.<lb/>
Part IV deals with the circumstances on which a court may vary the terms of a long lease of a flat. It also safeguards long leaseholders of houses against unsatisfactory provisions on insurance in their lease.<lb/>
Part V deals with management of leasehold property. It strengthens the provisions in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 dealing with variable service charges and extends them to houses and other dwellings. It provides that contributions to service charges, including sinking funds, shall be held on trust for the benefit of the tenants; it adds important rights for tenants on the insurance of their property; and it gives a recognised residents' association the right to be consulted about the appointment of managing agents. Part VI extends a residential tenant's right to information about his landlord's name and address.<lb/>
The Bill as a whole provides a framework for the orderly management of flats in private ownership. All residents, whether they are long leaseholders or renting
<col>638</col>
tenants, have a right to expect that their homes will be properly managed. The Bill strikes a balance between improving the position of tenants and safeguarding the proper interests of landlords. As my honourable friend the Minister for Housing has repeatedly made clear, good landlords have nothing to fear from the Bill. Its provisions should bring the general level of management of flats closer to the standards already achieved by the better landlords and managing agents.<lb/>
The Bill has been widely welcomed and was given all party support in another place. I believe that there is a general wish that it should be implemented as soon as possible. I commend the Bill to your Lordships. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03096">3.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03097"><member>Lord Coleraine</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for her brisk but clear gallop through the terms of this Bill. I am very pleased to welcome this Bill to its Second Reading. It follows, as my noble friend said, the report of the Department of the Environment's committee of inquiry established in February 1984 under the chairmanship of Mr. Nugee, to look into the problems arising from the management of privately owned blocks of flats.<lb/>
These had for many years been a concern of many of us, particularly also of my honourable friend Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, whose frequent attempts to legislate in another place should not pass without respectful comment; of Mr. John Wheeler, who also served as a member of the Nugee Committee; and of Mr. John Fraser in another place, who strongly and effectively supported the Bill on behalf of an Opposition party during its speedy passage through all its stages in another place. It was my honourable friend Mr. Gow who commissioned the report and it fell to my honourable friend Mr. Patten to implement it, and he has steered it through another place with dash and some brio.<lb/>
The decision to legislate most of Nugee's recommendations was made known to us 13 months ago in answer to a Question for Written Answer addressed to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State, and it is clear that the Bill before us has been prepared with care by parliamentary counsel. What we have to consider is a substantial and considered measure of overdue law reform in the field of domestic landlord and tenant law, a corner of our law which your Lordships may not find immediately glamorous, though I know that many of your Lordships are long lessees of flats and well aware of the deficencies in the existing law.<lb/>
Here I shall myself declare an interest, in that I am the tenant of a long-lease flat; and it may be called a lease at the sharp end because it has only 13 or 14 years remaining unexpired. It is also, I have to say, what would be called a defective lease. I may also say that in my practice as a solicitor I frequently have to advise clients on defective leases which they may own or which they may be contemplating buying. Advice in such circumstances is not given or received easily, because people who have seen a flat that they like do not like to be told by their solicitors that they should
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0328"/>
<col>639</col>
not buy it because of some technicality which their solicitor sees.<lb/>
I shall come back to the question of defective leases, but perhaps I may tell your Lordships now that the drafting of and advising on residential leases is boring and repetitive, and has perhaps never received the care and attention that all the possible pitfalls call for. On the basis that you only get what you pay for, and with the pressure for conveyancing costs to be reduced and reduced, we must surely expect many more defective leases being drafted today to return to vex us tomorrow. The use of word processors also does not help.<lb/>
I was delighted to read the Nugee Report, delighted to learn that legislation would follow and delighted when this Bill passed through all its stages in another place. The provisions of the Nugee Report were generally welcomed, as my noble friend has pointed out, and it is worth noting, as she did, that the committee comprised, among other well-informed persons, members reflecting the interests of both landlords and tenants as well as members of the relevant professional bodies.<lb/>
Having said all that, I have to say that a Bill of this nature needs the closest scrutiny, clause by clause, in this House. I am surprised that we are being asked today, with all-party agreement, to take the Bill through all its stages on the nod this afternoon. I expected, as I know a number of your Lordships did, that this Bill would fall with the Parliament. It has been pressed for and worked for for so long that it would he a shame if it were lost, but that does not make its provisions urgent&#x2014;quite the reverse.<lb/>
It passed quickly through another place&#x2014;only three sittings in Standing Committee&#x2014;but that is not an indication that we should deal with it so quickly; merely a reflection of the agreed general nature of the measure, and a clear invitation to us to scrutinise the Bill carefully if we can. Not to give the Bill the close consideration that it needs may well be seen as an abjuration of our role as a revising Chamber, which we may well come to regret at a later date if this Bill does itself prove to be defective.<lb/>
My surprise that we were dealing with this Bill in one day is shared by others outside your Lordships' House. I had a telephone call this morning from a well-known firm of City solicitors, Linklaters and Paines. They saw what they thought were problems in the Bill and they have written to me at length about them. I shall not go into details about the problems that they saw, except that they run through the Bill and they deal with the question of the landlord's and tenant's right to pre-emption; they deal with the tenant's right to compulsory purchase of the landlord's interest in certain circumstances, and they deal with the provisions of the Bill relating to managing agents.<lb/>
When I took up the Bill yesterday afternoon on learning what we were going to do today, I turned to the provisions of Part IV&#x2014;that is, Clauses 35 to 40&#x2014;dealing with the variation by the courts of defective leases. This had always seemed to me to be the area of the report which needed the closest probing. After a little while, I had eight amendments drafted <i>in pectore</i>, but looking at them now I see that
<col>640</col>
they are for the most part Committee amendments and I do not propose to worry your Lordships or my noble friend with them this afternoon. Nevertheless, I should like to address the question whether Part IV should, in an ideal world, pass into law now or whether its contents should be left to another occasion for proper consideration.<lb/>
I have no difficulty in agreeing that the problem of defective leases is a serious one. Defective leases fall into three principal categories. This is at least the best analysis that I can produce at short notice. The simplest category to consider is the sort of case where the landlord or his solicitors have imposed on a tenant a covenant to pay a proportionate part of the expense of repairing the structure of the block, without themselves convenanting to carry out any repairs. Your Lordships will be aware that it is a well-known fact that landlords call the tune and effectively impose their leases on tenants, and if a tenant does not like what the landlord's solicitor suggests all the tenant can do is find another flat.<lb/>
The second type of case is where, as a result of incompetent drafting by the landlord's solicitors, there are errors and inconsistencies and ambiguities in the lease. With the growing use of word processors, and for the other reasons that I have mentioned, I see this category of defective lease as likely to be on the increase in the future.<lb/>
The final category I have in mind is a more harmless one, though very difficult to resolve. That is where what are largely social conditions have changed over the years and left old leases stranded like dinosaurs on a beach. Such leases were relevant to the days of the daily delivery of groceries by errand boys on bicycles into the hands of porters on duty in shifts for perhaps 18 hours a day; of coal stored in flat owners' cellars; of porters, again, who let in the guests through the front door of the block. Now we may want to install entry phones but the lease does not provide for that.<lb/>
Then under this category there is the pressing problem of central heating, which I put in the same category. What about the old boiler in the cellar? It supplies the whole building through furred-up pipes, with boiling water to the radiators in some flats and cold water to others, eating up oil at prices which could never have been envisaged by the draftsman who drew up the lease.<lb/>
If you have a communal system you may turn off your radiators to save fuel on a March morning, but you will probably find that you get very little financial saving yourself from doing that. Indeed, you may notice that your walls are warm because your neighbour has gone off to the West Indies and left his radiators running at his fellow tenants' expense. Nowadays, all the arguments are in favour of individual central heating. However, under the old leases, if tenants install an independent system in their flats they will also have to pay their share of the running and maintenance costs of the old guzzler in the basement.<lb/>
All those are problems and we need new machinery to resolve them. The question is: is the right machinery to be found in Part IV of the Bill? I confess to the gravest reservations on that point. I also have grave reservations about the propriety of legislating on the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0329"/>
<col>641</col>
nod for the massive variation of contractual rights by the courts.<lb/>
The Nugee Report states in paragraph 7.6.8:
<quote>"The evidence we have received of the unsatisfactory nature of some leases leads us to conclude that it should be possible in certain circumstances (which need to be carefully defined) to modify the existing terms of the lease in the interests of the well being of the block and its owners and occupants even in cases where no majority agreement can be reached. The procedure would entail application to the Court for the lease to be varied. Such intervention is by no means unprecedented in statute; for example under Section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Moreover, the recent history of legislation relating to variable service charges from the Housing Finance Act 1972 onwards (and in particular Schedule 19 to the Housing Act 1980) provides examples of obligations to supply information and consult and of rights to challenge charges all of which may go beyond the terms of the actual leases."</quote>
Section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925 allows the Lands Tribunal, not the courts, to discharge or modify restrictive covenants affecting land in clearly defined circumstances. Broadly, those are: where the restriction is deemed obsolete or impedes reasonable use of the land and does not benefit anybody, or is contrary to the public interest. That is a very limited interference with contracts.<lb/>
The other reference in the Nugee Report&#x2014;the reference to service charges&#x2014;is to my way of thinking quite off the point. The provisions in recent legislation do not alter individual contractual rights. They alter the general law.<lb/>
For all their expertise in their respective fields, I wonder whether the committee really paid proper attention to the legal problems involved in the interference with vested rights. We are dealing with the Nugee Report on major defects here, and I should point out that the James Working Party Report, which preceded it and which is set out as Annex 1 to the Nugee Report had considerable reservations as to the desirability of permitting leases to be varied as a general rule.<lb/>
One type of case I have considered is where the landlord's and/or the tenant's interests in the property may have changed hands many times since a defect in the lease became apparent. It will have done so at prices which will have been augmented or reduced on account of the defect.<lb/>
Clearly in those circumstances there is a case for compensation to be paid on a variation of the lease and the Bill contains provisions enabling compensation to be awarded by the courts. Nevertheless, I do not find them clear and unambiguous, as they should be where a Bill of this nature potentially affects literally thousands of laymen. I should have thought that such provisions should be scrutinised further.<lb/>
I want to raise another point and here I shall refer to the Bill. Clause 35 provides grounds where an application may be made for a variation of a lease. That is where the lease fails to make adequate provision for one or more of various matters. I quote as one such matter Clause 35(2)(e) where it is stated that the lease makes inadequate provision for:
<quote>"the recovery by one party to the lease from another party to it of expenditure incurred or to be incurred by him, or on his behalf, for the benefit of that other party or of a number of persons who include that other party".</quote>
<col>642</col>
Why should a landlord who has covenanted to provide services for his tenant, and has not asked his tenant to pay for them, he presented with that invitation to apply for the lease to be varied? Of course, a right to apply does not mean that the court will grant the landlord the variation sought. However, the Nugee Report in effect says that in such circumstances the landlord should get his variation. I refer to paragraph 7.6.9(iii) of the report which states that,<lb/>
the lease should be varied in various circumstances such as:
<quote>"where the service charges payable in respect of the fiats in the block are determined as a percentage of the landlord's expenditure and the aggregate of the percentages is either more or less than 100 per cent. of such expenditure".</quote>
I wish to look for a moment at the significance of the words "more or less". Where we are talking about "more" we are clearly talking about tenants in the building who are obliged under their leases to pay, shall we say, 110 per cent. in aggregate of the landlord's costs of repairing the building and providing the services. When those tenants entered into their leases, they were asked to pay some small percentage in respect of each flat. They will not have received any information as to what the total percentage recovered by the landlord would amount. The Nugee Report states, and correctly in my view, that in those circumstances it is wrong for a landlord to recover the final 5 or 10 per cent. of the aggregate amount of the service charges. However, if we look at a case where less than 100 per cent. is recovered, we see that the landlord&#x2014;for reasons of his own which are unknown to the tenants&#x2014;has told the tenants individually that their percentage will be such and such a figure and those percentages do not add up to 100 per cent.<lb/>
For the life of me I fail to understand why in those circumstances it should be thought right for the landlord then to be able to go to court and ask for the percentages to be raised&#x2014;which is what the subsection to which I have referred provides.<lb/>
I shall now turn to a brief consideration of the court as a forum for applications for variations of lease. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will be well satisfied that the courts&#x2014;I take it that we are primarily talking about the county courts&#x2014;can deal with those various applications.<lb/>
I must confess that I am not convinced either that the Bill gives satisfactory guidance on variations of leases to the judges who will be asked to operate it, or that, with present adversarial procedures, the county court judges should be given the jurisdiction or can exercise it satisfactorily.<lb/>
This matter will be green fields for some years, and I fear that for some considerable time to come there will be a flood of expensive litigation, with appeals. It will for the most part be brought by landlords, because they are generally better able to afford the cost and they will, by the nature of their relationship with their numerous tenants, have more at stake.<lb/>
Landlords will also seek to recover the costs of the litigation from their tenants and that litigation will, for the most part&#x2014;except where leases have simply fallen out of date as a result of changed social circumstances&#x2014;have resulted from defective leases for
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0330"/>
<col>643</col>
which the landlord or a landlord was originally responsible.<lb/>
While I welcome the Bill and wish it a safe Second Reading, I do not feel able to make any further comments on what happens to it after that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03098">3.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03099"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not originally intended to take part in the Second Reading debate on the Bill. I read the various summaries of the Nugee Report upon which the Bill is partially&#x2014;I stress the word "partially"&#x2014;based and, although I have had the pleasure of meeting the distinguished Mr. Nugee, I have no particular expertise on mansion blocks, apart from knowing a number of people who have at one time or another lived in such blocks.<lb/>
However, when I heard only yesterday afternoon (because of the inefficiencies of the postal system) that this highly technical, complex and detailed Bill&#x2014;which is 67 pages long and contains 62 clauses and five schedules and on which we would normally spend at least five and more likely six or even seven days&#x2014;was, without good cause, being rushed through in its entirety in a single afternoon, I knew that I must come and vote against it on principle, not at Second Reading (for that is not our custom) but at a later stage. I say that despite the fact that I know a number of people personally who will benefit directly from the Bill when it is enacted and I know no one personally who will be disadvantaged by it directly. However, if the prediction made in a considered letter from the chairman of the Sussex Private Landlords' Association, published in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of 5th May, is correct and the Bill leads to a drying up of the supply of private rented accommodation, then a large number of people will suffer indirectly.<lb/>
I say that also despite the fact that the intentions which underlie the greater part of the Bill are entirely admirable. Part VI of the Bill seems to be wholly uncontentious, while Part V of the Bill is almost wholly contentious. I should guess that the same goes for Parts II and III, in so far as I have studied them in the extremely short time available. However, Part IV, to which the noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, has drawn our attention, and particularly Part I, which goes way beyond the Nugee recommendations, are a very different matter.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, in introducing the Bill, spoke for a mere four or five minutes. Perhaps she can take time in her summing up to explain exactly why small detached or semi-detached houses with only two tenants in them are to be included in Clause 1. Mansion blocks owned by large impersonal institutions are one thing, but small houses owned by individuals or families are a different matter. Does she not think that the precedent thereby set will give the green light to a future Left-wing government to expropriate all private rented accommodation or to nationalise it for a relatively derisory sum?<lb/>
Moreover, on previous form even the least contentious clauses are bound to be capable of further improvement in your Lordships' House. The Bill may be 90 per cent. right; it may possibly be 95 per cent. right. But it is highly unlikely to be 100 per cent. right.<lb/>
<col>644</col>
It is not as if we face a really serious and unexpected crisis, such as the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands Islands, which would justify rushing through emergency legislation.<lb/>
It is true that there is a much less grave Middle Eastern invasion of London which is said to be responsible for some of the abuses which Part VI of the Bill is designed to rectify. But the abuses could easily be dealt with by confining ourselves today to passing the uncontentious Part VI in the certain knowledge that the all-party support for the principles of the Bill will ensure that the balance of the Bill will receive top priority in a new Parliament, whichever party happens to be in power. People who have waited many years and indeed decades could hardly object to waiting another two to three months in order that the legislation could be got absolutely right.<lb/>
After all, the Government cannot have thought that this Bill was particularly urgent. They did not give it a very high priority in their legislative programme this Session and a June general election has been an odds-on probability for several months now. Why then the new-found sense of extreme urgency? I suspect that the answer lies in the fact that the beneficiaries of the Bill are, to a large extent, articulate middle-class or upper middle-class people who live in marginal constituencies and who are sophisticated enough to know how to vote tactically. If those with similarly valid grievances had been inarticulate working-class people living in constituencies with rock-solid Labour majorities, I doubt very much whether a complicated, 62-clause Bill would have been rushed through in a single afternoon.<lb/>
On 30th March Mr. John Patten, the Minister in charge of the Bill in another place, said, at col. 774 of the <i>Official Report</i>:
<quote>"such will be the excellence of the scrutiny that the Bill will receive in Committee, I am sure that it will pass rapidly through to law".</quote>
Doubtless the Minister was being flippant. The main constituential function of your Lordships' House is that of a revising Chamber. But we are being effectively denied the right to revise or even scrutinise. In other words, we are not being permitted to do our constitutional duty. For that reason alone, and not because I oppose the general principle of the Bill, I regret that I shall have to oppose its passage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03101"><member>Lord Wilberforce</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that I must add a few words in support of what has been said, even though what I wanted to say has been said much better from the Benches behind me. I yield to no one in my admiration for the work which has been done in this area by Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, who, as well as being my relative, is also my Member of Parliament. I have also had many years of admiration for the work of Mr. Nugee, who is in the chambers that I was in at Lincoln's Inn. I have followed the work of his committee with great care and enthusiasm.<lb/>
No doubt the work of the committee is very good and is largely acceptable. Nevertheless, we are presented here with a major piece of legislation&#x2014;almost a code of legislation&#x2014;in an area so far untouched by the law. Your Lordships should not be deceived by the great clarity and simplicity with
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0331"/>
<col>645</col>
which the Bill was explained by the noble Baroness. It is a very complicated measure, as has been said, of over 60 clauses with long subsections and schedules. Each of the parts requires careful study.<lb/>
Your Lordships will be in no doubt, having heard the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, that there are areas of considerable potentiality for discussion, particularly in the areas of compensation, of compulsory acquisition and of variation of contractural terms. One can only repeat that this is essentially the sort of measure which ought to receive careful consideration by this House.<lb/>
One feels that the noble Baroness, who occupies a somewhat isolated position on the Front Bench at the moment, is in a very difficult situation as regards agreeing to vary what is no doubt the agreement of a powerful coalition behind the scenes to the Bill coming forward. However, I feel that many Members of your Lordships' House on all sides, and even on the Benches behind the noble Baroness, in the light of what was said yesterday by the noble Lords, Lord Wigoder and Lord Mishcon, would feel very much relieved if this measure could be deferred and considered at greater leisure.<lb/>
It is not a matter which requires urgent legislation. We want to look at it; we can make constructive amendments to it. The noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, made that perfectly clear. If there were some means by which the noble Baroness could agree to the postponement of Part IV, at any rate, I feel that many constitutionalists in the House, as well as those who care for getting the relation between landlord and tenant right (which is a very sensitive area and one which, once got wrong, is very difficult to correct), will be much relieved. I associate myself entirely with what has been said behind me and what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Coleraine.</membercontribution></p>

I have read the Bill. It is exceedingly complicated, exceedingly legal and exceedingly obscure. It is the sort of Bill on which this House repeatedly does a first-rate job in revising legislation.

It ought to be properly considered by the House in its proper stages before it is passed into law.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03105"><member>The Earl of Kinnoull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to intervene and to apologise for my lack of courtesy in not putting my name down to speak. Although we have heard some stringent comments about the lack of time in which to examine the Bill, I should like to add that this is a good Bill. It is a Bill which will help many tenants. It is perhaps long overdue and it has, as I understand it, received all-party consent through the usual channels to go forward. It has not been a government steamrolling measure.<lb/>
I intervene because I wish to make what are really Committee points. I should like to thank the noble
<col>646</col>
Baroness for giving me time with her officials before this Second Reading to examine the points which have been raised outside the House. I should also like to thank those officials. Perhaps I may put four points to her briefly so that she can answer them for the benefit of those who are interested in the legislation.<lb/>
My first point was raised under the many provisions of notices that come under the Bill in Clause 5, where the landlord proposes to dispose of his interest in premises and serves notice on the qualifying tenants. Although it may seem only a small point, it is a very serious matter and I believe there should be a statutory form of notice giving details of the regulations on the counter-notices. The Bill provides a new right for tenants which will not be easily understood. I believe there is a very strong case for publishing the statutory form of notice which is not provided for in the Bill at the moment. I hope that my noble friend will he able to make some helpful comment on that matter and will consider whether such a form of notice should be published.<lb/>
My second point, again involving notices, concerns Clause 22. The clause provides that one tenant may serve a preliminary notice on the landlord for the appointment of a manager of the block of flats. Obviously such a matter affects every tenant and not merely the one who serves the preliminary notice. Under the present format of the Bill none of the other tenants needs to be served notice. I believe that they have a right to be served. They have just as much an interest in the management of the block of flats as the tenant who served the notice. Again, I hope that my noble friend will say something encouraging on that point. The Nugee Report emphasises that there should be full disclosure among the tenants, as well as to the landlord.<lb/>
My third point concerns Clause 47, which refers to the information available for the tenants as a matter of right; namely, the landlord's name and address. I accept that that is a very important right. It is also important for tenants to be notified of other tenants names and addresses. Nowadays, particularly in London, there are many company lettings and foreign tenants. It would be very helpful for tenants to know who are the other tenants in the block. I hope my noble friend will consider this point and make the information available.<lb/>
My final point concerns the valuation formula. Under Clause 31 the valuation formula, where the tenant is buying the landlord's interest, is based on the open market price, not taking into account the tenant's interest. This is a formula similar to that which, according to my recollection, came under the original Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and which was found to be basically unfair and to give rise to difficult and unhappy results, and it was subsequently amended. There, that principle of valuation stands.<lb/>
I find it very strange that we do not have the same established principle under the present Bill. Although I know that we cannot do anything today to alter the principles of the Bill, I hope that my noble friend will take on board the fact that there are many people outside who feel that the principle contained in the Bill is basically unfair.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03107"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I speak on the basis that my party supports the Bill and agrees with the provisions contained in it. Moreover, my party's policy goes somewhat further than the Government's proposals. However, I have a great deal of sympathy for noble Lords who spoke earlier and complained about the shortness of time. I remind your Lordships, without trying to score political points, that the shortness of time is not the fault of the Opposition. I do not know how we are supposed to organise your Lordships' House or whether the Government consider what they do to us.<lb/>
This time last year we were swamped with legislation, when complex, detailed, long and intricate Bills were given insufficient time. Major amendments were down for complex Bills such as the Financial Services Bill and the Banking Bill. Noble Lords were complaining about the hurry that was forced upon them, which resulted in the fact that adequate time was not available to deal with important matters.<lb/>
In order to deal with that legislation we were brought back earlier than ever before. Although I stand to be corrected, I believe it was the heaviest batch of legislation that your Lordships' House has carried in a Session. My noble friend on the Front Bench who has just come in was involved in having to drop and restrict debates on very important matters that your Lordships should have dealt with in detail.<lb/>
For some reason known only to the Government, when we reassembled in November we had the lightest legislative programme that has been seen for a long time. It is now obvious why. Again, that was not the fault of the Opposition. I believe that as the Government have gone further than the recommendations contained in the Nugee Report, the Bill could have been before your Lordships earlier and therefore had a fuller debate. However, that is not to be.<lb/>
I say, I think without contradiction, that had the election been called when most people thought it was to be called, namely, October, there would have been no complaints today as there would have been ample time to amend and scrutinise the Bill. As I do not have a legal background I am not too familiar with parts of the Bill, which is very complex. However, I like to hear the implications of such legislation when it is explained and examined in detail by noble and learned Lords. As has been said by the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, the Bill has a great deal of good in it, tipping the balance slightly in favour of the tenant. However, my party would have gone further.<lb/>
I was glad to hear noble Lords pay tribute to Sir Brandon Rhys Williams in another place, as I know how he has battled over the years. However, your Lordships will understand if I mention John Fraser, Member for Norwood, who, in conjunction with Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, represented a London borough with all its problems. He has done an outstanding job not only on behalf of my party but on behalf of tenants in general. He has made his expertise available both in a political and non-political sense, which has been of tremendous value. I do not know Mr. Nugee. However, I concur with the expressions of appreciation to him and his committee.<lb/>
<col>648</col>
Having made those points, I should like to say that the Opposition in general were faced with a situation not of their making and would have been letting down a number of tenants if they had said, "Take the Bill away and bring it back later". There is so much good in the Bill&#x2014;for example, the advances towards tenants' rights&#x2014;that my party agreed to support it in its present form.<lb/>
I took note of the fact that the Minister spoke only for four minutes and I shall try not to exceed that, because the Bill, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, has had three sittings in Committee. However, there were extensive debates on some parts of the Bill during those sittings. I have read them. I believe in the later stages there was an attempt by Mr. Fraser to introduce a long, rather convoluted and legally binding clause which would have pushed the provisions further along the road towards the tenant.<lb/>
I shall not detain your Lordships any longer on Second Reading because it has been made quite clear that what is before us now will go through in its present form. Further comment at this point is not the best way of dealing with the matter. On that basis, on behalf of my party I end by saying that we support the contents of the Bill and wish it well.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03109"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Baroness replies, may I ask her to make perfectly clear to those of us who are not part of the usual channels why there should be any objection to postponing the Bill until later, as other noble Lords have suggested. In the recent past I have had to complain about lawyers in the House. But, this afternoon, they have been first class. As most of us, it is fair to say, are not part of the usual channels, we need an explanation of why this serious warning from lawyers who have to deal with the matter and who are experts in it should be ignored. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to give that explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03110">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03111"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that my noble friend Lord Coleraine was the first of a number of your Lordships who feel that the timing of the passage of the Bill leaves something to be desired. The noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, suggested that the Bill should have been brought forward earlier. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, and the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, have said, it is a long and complex Bill. We recognise that.<lb/>
It has been a major task for the Department of the Environment and parliamentary counsel to draft the Bill. There was a long gestation period. As I explained in opening, the committee sat for a lengthy period and made wide consultations. Because the Bill was to embody the recommendations of the committee, it was felt that time should be given to its drafting. Had we been able to introduce the measure earlier, we should indeed have done so. I am afraid that that was not possible because of the care taken in drafting and because of the parliamentary programme.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Monson, added his comment on the suggestion that the Bill was being rushed
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0333"/>
<col>649</col>
through. I must repeat that the committee, in carrying out wide consultations, found extensive evidence of problems in the management of blocks of flats. The Bill puts into effect the committee's recommendations.<lb/>
The noble Lord was incorrect in suggesting that Part I departs from Nugee's recommendations. It does not. My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and other Ministers receive large numbers of letters from residents of blocks of flats who have serious problems. Indeed, we are well aware that Members of another place have made a point of drawing attention there to the size of their mail bags. As a result, I cannot accept that there is no urgency in the matter. Many tenants need the help that the Bill can provide. That is why it has received all-party support in another place. I am therefore grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, for his expression of support in this respect.<lb/>
I should like to reiterate remarks that I made earlier. The Bill as a whole provides a framework for the orderly management of flats in private ownership. This is greatly to be desired and has been given a general welcome not only in another place but in the wider world outside. Therefore, we feel that it is important to pursue the Bill through its remaining stages now.<lb/>
I turn to the references to Part IV made by my noble friend Lord Coleraine. Part IV deals with the provisions for variation of leases. A key element of the Bill, it implements one of the central recommendations of the Nugee Report.<lb/>
The committee found dissatisfaction with leases a recurrent theme in many responses to its questionnaires both among residents and among landlords and managing agents. The report distinguished between complaints that stemmed from the realisation that the lease contained disadvantageous provisions which residents simply did not like and those that reflected a serious deficiency in the arrangemens for the satisfactory management or maintenance of the block.<lb/>
Where a lease is badly drafted&#x2014;this was referred to specifically by my noble friend Lord Coleraine&#x2014;so that it does not make clear who is responsible for what or how any services or works should be paid for, we agree with the Nugee Committee's conclusion that there must be machinery to enable such matters to be put right. Again, where the lease fails to make satisfactory provision for the insurance of the property or where the proportions of the service charges add up to more than the total of the sums required, a mechanism is needed to deal with this. I do not think that there is any serious disagreement on the need for provisions on all of this, and Part IV was welcomed on both sides of the House in another place.<lb/>
Clause 35 was specifically referred to. Clause 35(2) spells out circumstances in which an application can be made for a variation of a defective lease. The clause is a as precise as we could make it, although it is not of course possible in legislation such as this to deal with every conceivable variation or set of circumstances. However, I note the point made by my noble friend with reference to Clause 35(2)(e) in particular.<lb/>
Clause 37 allows a majority of the parties to the leases of flats in a block to apply to the court for a variation of all the leases in the block. The court may
<col>650</col>
grant an order so long as the variation is not opposed by more than a prescribed minority. The purpose of the provision, again based on the Nugee Committee's recommendation, is to allow desirable changes such as the setting up of a sinking fund to be made.<lb/>
We have thought it right, where the effect of a variation would be that one of the parties suffers financial loss, that the court should be able to order that compensation should be paid by the party getting the benefit of the variation. Where, however, the effect of a variation is to disadvantage a party to the lease and the award of financial compensation would not be an adequate way of recompensing him, then the Bill provides that a variation order should not be made. I hope that your Lordships will agree therefore that in this respect, as in others, the Bill is even-handed as between landlords and leaseholders.<lb/>
Although the Bill is primarily concerned with the management of blocks of flats, we have thought it right to deal also in Part IV with the question of insurance provision in leases of other types of dwelling, because of the concern which has been expressed in some parts of the country, especially in South Wales and in the North-West of England about this issue. As I have said, the Bill is in response to problems raised directly with the department.<lb/>
My noble friend was concerned about the impact of these provisions on the workload of the county court. I agree that if the new rights in this Bill are used by landlords and leaseholders, as we hope they will be, there will be some increase in the courts' workload, but we do not expect this to be large in relation to the total work of the county court&#x2014;certainly not a flood of litigation, as my noble friend suggested. After all, we are talking about not more than 500,000 dwellings to which the Bill will apply. We believe that the existence of a statutory right to apply for the variation of a lease will, in many cases, encourage the parties to reach a satisfactory settlement out of court.<lb/>
As I made clear, I hope, we regard Part IV as an important and, indeed, essential factor of the Bill. It will not, of course, be possible to bring it into operation for several months after Royal Assent because of the need to draft rules of court to deal with the handling of applications. Perhaps that will meet some of the concerns expressed by several noble Lords this afternoon.<lb/>
I have already said to my noble friend, I think, that if he wishes to discuss in greater detail any of the points which concern him in this respect, certainly both I and my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale are very willing to do so. I refer briefly to the point that he made about service charges not adding up to 100 per cent. Where total service charges add up to more than 100 per cent. of the landlord's costs, he accepted the tenant's right to be able to apply to the court to vary the lease. In fact, Part IV of the Bill will facilitate that. We believe that the landlord should also be able to apply to the court to vary the lease where the service charges do not add up to 100 per cent. because we want to encourage well-maintained blocks of flats. That is in the interests of landlords and tenants, but if the landlord is to maintain the block, clearly, he must have the resources to do so.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0334"/>
<col>651</col>
Having dealt generally with one or two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, I refer specifically to his comment about small and semi-detached houses. The sort of problems this Bill is aimed at&#x2014;bad management, neglect and lack of repair&#x2014;can arise as often in houses which have been converted to new flats held on long leases as in purpose-built blocks of flats. We see no reason why the tenants of such converted buildings should not have the remedies provided by the Bill. We certainly do not agree that the Bill will harm the interests of good landlords or discourage investment in this sector.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Kinnoull was very helpful in raising various points. I was most interested in them. As he explained, we have already had some discussion about several aspects of the Bill. I hope that I was able to show that the Bill, as amended substantially in another place, already provides adequately for many of the points which were troubling him. In several cases I undertook to consider whether we could meet his concerns. In drafting the subordinate legislation and rules of court which will be needed, we will, of course, take into account the points raised by my noble friends and by all noble Lords who have spoken today.<lb/>
I realise that I am speaking in somewhat unusual circumstances at this point in the parliamentary programme. I welcome the contributions and suggestions that have been made on all sides of the House and the general support both for the aims of the Bill and recommendations of the Nugee Committee. I hope your Lordships will agree that we should press ahead and give the important advantages which the Bill will provide to the people concerned.<lb/>

<title>Black Country Development Corporation(Area and Constitution) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03115">4.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03116"><member>Baroness Hooper</member> rose to move, That the order laid before the House on 8th April be approved. [<i>18th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].</p>
<col>652</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03117">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name. It may be for the convenience of the House if I speak at the same time to the second and third Motions in my name on the Order Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03118">I am pleased that we are able to consider these three orders together. All three are made under the provisions of Part XVI of the Local Government Act 1980. As noble Lords will be aware, there are two well-established UDCs for London Docklands and Merseyside. Two other UDCs have been established recently for Trafford Park and Cardiff Bay. The orders designate land respectively in Tyne and Wear, in the Black Country and on Teesside as urban development areas and set up urban development corporations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03119">These orders were judged to be hybrid, but I am glad to say that no petitions were received on any of the orders. They were debated yesterday in another place. Provided your Lordships are content to approve these orders, the three corporations will come into formal existence tomorrow. As your Lordships know, UDCs assemble, reclaim and service land, provide infrastructure and facilitate development. They are able to offer practical assistance and, in some cases, financial assistance to would-be developers. They bring a co-ordinated, single-minded, sustained and public sector-backed approach to the regeneration of their areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03120">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has power to confer certain functions on a corporation by statutory instrument. He intends to follow the pattern established for the other corporations for which he is responsible and give these corporations development control functions. He will bring forward orders to do this in due course and may vest certain public sector land in the corporations. He does not see the need at this stage to give these corporations housing, building control or public health functions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03121">Each of these areas has been studied by a team of consultants. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State drew on the advice of the consultants when he put forward boundary proposals for each area. He circulated those boundary proposals for comment and subsequently made the orders we have before us today. Each of the teams of consultants has produced reports on their areas. These have been placed in the Library. It will be for the corporations to decide on the strategies that they should adopt, but the studies indicate exactly what each corporation might achieve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03122">I shall now say something about each of the areas in turn. The proposed urban development area in Tyne and Wear covers something under 6,000 acres. In common with the other orders, detailed maps have been laid before the House and a sketch is provided at the back of the order. In the past, the area has provided sites for much traditional industry, particularly shipbuilding, heavy engineering and port-related activity. The task of the corporation will be to reclaim and service the derelict and empty sites along the rivers and to find new uses for them. These uses should diversify the economic base of the area and make use of the natural advantages of the rivers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03123">Mr. Paul Nicholson, chairman and managing director of the Sunderland firm Vaux Breweries, will be appointed as chairman, and the proposed board,
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0335"/>
<col>653</col>
composed of other people with local roots, has already been announced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03124">The Black Country urban development area is also just under 6,000 acres. It encompasses much of the worst dereliction at the heart of the Black Country. The task of the corporation will be to reclaim and improve access to sites within the area, and to upgrade the environment generally. Mr. Bill Francis and Mrs. Jean Denton will be appointed chairman and deputy chairman respectively. Both are well known in the area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03125">The area proposed for Teesside is a good deal bigger than the other two&#x2014;over 11,000 acres. The main body of land lies on both banks of the Tees, from Stockton to Langbaurgh, incorporating parts of Middlesbrough and Hartlepool. There is a separate area covering the south docks in Hartlepool.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03126">The area around the Tees has supported chemicals, steelworks and heavy engineering. These have contracted rapidly in recent years, leaving a legacy of dereliction and unemployment. The consultants have suggested an investment strategy underpinned by major environmental work. Perhaps the most interesting example of this is the proposal to create an international nature reserve on the marshland between the mouth of the Tees and Hartlepool. Mr. Ron Norman, a Hartlepool man with considerable experience of worthwhile investment in inner city areas, will be appointed chairman of this corporation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03127">Your Lordships' House was involved in the first steps that led to these orders. My noble friend Lord Davidson made the first public announcement here of the Government's intention to set up four new corporations in England on 8th October last year. A few days later my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale introduced an amendment to the Housing and Planning Bill which made it possible to set up such corporations outside metropolitan areas, thus clearing the way for the Teesside order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03128">Your Lordships now also have the chance to take the final parliamentary steps in setting up these corporations. Once the orders have been approved here, the corporations will be able to get down to the task of regenerating their areas. That task should start without delay. I therefore commend each of these orders to the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03129">Moved, That the order laid before the House on 8th April be approved. [<i>18th Report from the Joint Committee</i>]&#x2014;(<i>Baroness Hooper</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03130"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for her explanation of the orders. I have one or two questions to ask her. I was slightly surprised to hear that the corporation members had already been settled, because one of the questions I was going to ask was whether the local authorities were to be well represented.<lb/>
Schedule 26, paragraph 2(2) of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act, states:
<quote>"In appointing members of the corporation the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of securing the services of people having special knowledge of the locality in which the urban development area is or will be situated."</quote>
The next sub-paragraph states:
<quote>"In relation to the possible appointment of people falling within sub-paragraph (2) above, the Secretary of State shall consult such
<col>654</col>
local authorities as appear to him to be concerned with the regeneration of the urban development area."</quote>
I should like to ask whether the local authorities have been consulted and whether local authority representatives have been appointed. It is an important point, because we know that there was a certain amount of trouble in Docklands. There were difficulties between members of the local authorities and of the corporation because the local authority members felt that they had been left out; whereas I know, having been a local authority representative on Peterborough Development Corporation, that having local people on it made a tremendous difference to the good will. I hope that there will be reassurance on that point.<lb/>
The areas on the maps which are provided at the back of the orders are rather odd because they cover a great many local authority areas. One understands the reason for that. The areas of dereliction are where the old shipbuilding firms, and industries allied thereto, were. There are two areas. One is on the Tyne and one is on the Wear. They cover the boroughs of North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Sunderland, Gateshead and the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. That makes five authorities. The Teesside area includes the boroughs of Langbaurgh, Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees and Hartlepool. The Black Country area has only two local authorities. Many local authority people will be involved. I should like some reassurance on that point, because I think that it is important.<lb/>
One wished the corporations well. The Minister mentioned a marine reserve on the Tees. I was glad to hear about that. I am sure that it will be welcomed by those interested in such matters. It is an important point, because there were problems in Teesdale. The co-operation of all those interested in conservation is important. With those comments, we support the orders.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03131"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a brief word in support of what my noble friend said about the care that must be taken over the composition of the boards. I can endorse what she said about the aggravation that took place in Docklands. However, that does not mean to say that we do not know and appreciate all that the Docklands Development Corporation has done since.<lb/>
When the Minister introduced these matters I was interested to hear her say that people had been appointed who were well known in the area. I should like to know what they are well known for and what their connections are. I should like the Minister to satisfy the House that care will be taken before the boards are finally composed. When the Minister's ministerial colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, introduced the Trafford Park order, he named some people but said that there were vacancies and that any names proposed would be considered.<lb/>
I know Tyneside and Teesside well. I hope that we can tap the local authorities, but there are other interests in the area. I acknowledge that, in part, political affiliation is a factor to be taken into account. We are talking about industrial regeneration. There are many ways in which we can satisfy the people that an area's history and traditions are being taken on board.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0336"/>
<col>655</col>
There is an interesting aspect to Tyneside, which has many former pit slagheaps. They are made up of minestone. I have raised with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and others the subject of making better use of minestone in roadmaking. I live in the Lee Valley. A great deal of development is held up while gravel is extracted from the land before it is built upon. Much of the gravel is used as aggregate in road building. One of the aggravations is that we have minestone which is a national resource&#x2014;it comes out of the earth and is left when the coal is extracted&#x2014;but if not hideous, it needs to be beautified.<lb/>
One of the best uses to which minestone can be put is for road filling. I am not asking the Minister to respond to this point except to say that she notes it. The heardquarters of the minestone executive is in Philadelphia, at Houghton-le-Spring, in Tyne and Wear. It may be within the broad catchment area here. Good advice would therefore be available through British Coal and the minestone executive which would guide these authorities in the future. As my noble friend said, we are anxious to see that the aspirations of the development corporations come to fruition as quickly and as satisfactorily as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03132"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady David, and the noble Lord, Lord Graham, for their remarks and their welcome for these orders. On the question of membership, I recognise that this is an area of great interest and one that is most important if the urban development corporations are to carry out their work satisfactorily.<lb/>
The Government try to learn from experience. The experiences that we have had with the two earlier development corporations have helped us to make decisions on these three. As I said in my opening remarks, only the Tyne and Wear corporation membership has been announced so far. The full membership, apart from the chairman, has not been finalised for the other two corporations. The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation has eight members other than the chairman and deputy-chairman; three of those are local authority members. The full membership can be greater&#x2014;up to 11 members&#x2014;and there is therefore space for additional members. The three local authorities that are represented are Newcastle City Council, South Tyneside Borough Council and Sunderland Borough Council. Perhaps I may point out to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, that one of the members is Mr. Joe Mills, who is secretary of the local Transport and General Workers' Union.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03133"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: And a very good man too.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03134"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that may go some way to reassure the noble Lord and the noble Baroness. Consultation with the local authorities has taken place and the Government aim to strike a proper balance between local authority and other membership. However, they have insisted that all members are people with local interests or roots. I am sure that everyone will argee that that is the most desirable aim.<lb/>
With regard to nature reserves, the consultants have recommended a nature reserve and the appropriate
<col>656</col>
land has been included in the UDC area. However, it is for the UDC eventually to decide exactly what will happen. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, that I am sure his previous words were not wasted on my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale. I have nevertheless taken note of his remarks about the use of minestone for roadmaking. I commend the order to the House.<lb/>

<title>Definition of Capital Expenses (Scotland) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03141">4.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03142"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member> rose to move, That the order laid before the House on 1st April be approved [<i>19th Report from the Joint Committee</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03143">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move. The purpose of this order is to amend the definition of "capital expenses" contained in Section 94(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 to bring this more in line with the definition of "capital" used in the national accounts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03144">Section 94 was introduced to replace the previous system of issuing borrowing consent for projects. Its intention was to permit the Secretary of State to exercise overall control of the level of public expenditure in Scotland, while at the same time allowing individual local authorities more freedom and flexibility to determine their capital expenditure priorities within the broad limits set centrally. From both the government and the local authority viewpoint the system has by and large been successful, though there has been the need for minor improvement leading to amendments in 1975, 1981 and 1982. The order before us today is another such small improvement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03145">Neither the definition of capital expenses at present used in the 1973 Act nor the amendment the Government propose will reduce local authorities' accounting flexibility to decide whether an individual item of expenditure should properly be charged to a capital or a current account. This is a matter for an
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0337"/>
<col>657</col>
authority's own decision, subject to the concurrence of its auditor. The Government have no wish to become involved in the complexities of trying to decide centrally on the appropriateness of capital or current treatment for everthing a local authority might buy. Nevertheless, a fundamental difficulty for the Government is that the present statutory definition of what we actually control through Section 94 does not quite match our view of what we ought to be controlling. Because of this we have had to make <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which are not entirely satisfactory and we think the time has come to tidy up the statutory position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03146">This difficulty relates to so-called "capital from current revenue" spending&#x2014;CFCR for short. This is expenditure on things which, in terms of the national accounts (and often also in terms of any reasonable layman's view), are capital assets but which the local authority is perfectly free to finance entirely out of current income in the year in question and to charge to a current account. For the purposes of the public expenditure survey and of the local authority capital cash limit reported to Parliament, this CFCR expenditure is regarded as truly capital and therefore the Secretary of State has no choice but to treat it as such. But because of the wording of the present Section 94 he has no statutory means of controlling it. In practice what happens is that we have to make a guess at authorities' likely use of CFCR for the year ahead and then hold back this amount from the public expenditure provision available to be shared out as consent allocations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03147">This rather cumbersome procedure does not present serious control problems provided authorities' use of CFCR does not vary greatly from year to year. Recently, however, authorities' use of CFCR has become much more unpredictable with the result that authorities' Section 94 allocations were set at a lower level than they might otherwise have been. Provisional figures for 1986&#x2013;87 indicate a similar picture for that year. With the prospect that the pattern of CFCR expenditure may be equally unpredictable in future years, the Secretary of State proposes to simplify the present position&#x2014;hence this order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03148">Under the revised arrangements, capital from current revenue will no longer count against current expenditure guidelines as it does at present but instead will score against authorities' capital allocations. Consequently, from 1988&#x2013;89 local authorities' Section 94 consent allocations will cover all capital expenditure no matter how it is financed. This will be more flexible than the existing arrangements under which authorities which express an intention to finance some capital expenditure from current revenue are given a lower Section 94 allocation. If they subsequently decide to finance that capital expenditure by borrowing, it is not possible for them to have their Section 94 allocation increased accordingly and they are stuck with the original decision which may have been made over a year previously. This inflexibility has certainly caused problems for some authorities in the past.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03149">In conclusion, including capital expenditure financed from current revenue within Section 94 is essentially a tidying up exercise to put on a simplified
<col>658</col>
statutory basis the control we already exercise by administrative means. It will be less wasteful of scarce resources and have real benefits for central government in terms of a simplified control mechanism. For local government it will mean greater. flexibility in taking decisions on financing capital projects and will allow a more equitable distribution of the available resources between authorities. I commend the order to your Lordships and I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03150">Moved, That the order laid before the House on 1st April be approved. [<i>19th Report from the Joint Committee</i>]&#x2014;(<i>Lord Glenarthur</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03151"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had the impression that in the last hurried days of this Parliament everything we were doing in asking for the indulgence of Members was related to urgency. I do not know whether noble Lords have had a look at the Definition of Capital Expenses (Scotland) Order 1987:
<quote>"Made 25th March 1987; laid before Parliament 1st April 1987; coming into force 1st April 1988".</quote>
What is the urgency about this? Noble Lords have been holding back. They should have liked more time to discuss the last Bill, which went through in a flash. There is a Bill on Scotland on which I do not think a word has yet been said in another place, and it is unlikely that anything will be said here. There is no justification for this.<lb/>
The local authorities were never mentioned. The Minister did not say whether the local authorities agreed with this, welcomed it or criticised it. That is rather bad. They have been discussing the matter since about November last year. The Government suggested that they were going to do this at some time or other and the local authorities discussed it. They sent a letter to the Scottish Office on 2nd February suggesting that it required more consideration and asking for another meeting if it could not be withdrawn. They received no reply.<lb/>
One of the deputy directors of CoSLA who was down here on other business&#x2014;and we can all guess what the business was&#x2014;discovered by chance that it had been laid before Parliament on 1st April. This is not good enough. It is not good enough for the Government to say that this is a small matter adding to a tidying up operation; that we did it in 1975; that there was another one at another time and that this is just adding to it.<lb/>
The fact that the Government have been asked by CoSLA to reconsider this and to have another meeting to discuss it is symptomatic of the distrust that has grown up over the years between the local authorities and the Scottish Office. It has happened elsewhere as well. The distrust has deepened with every local government finance measure or clause within a miscellaneous provisions Bill. We have guidelines, penalties, clawbacks, interference, determination of local government powers, and here we have a fairly simple thing.<lb/>
I am not saying that the present situation is ideal. It will never be ideal until we have a proper definition of capital expenditure. Many things which are dealt with
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0338"/>
<col>659</col>
out of current expenditure in one area would be considered capital expenditure in another. We heard about the problems with computers in the Highlands&#x2014;software and the rest of it. That might be considerable capital expenditure there, but in Strathclyde it could be construed as normal expenditure that is met out of current expenditure. Some people could construe buying an electric typewriter as capital expenditure. What is wanted is for local authorities to come together with advisers of the Government, work it out and come to an agreed solution.<lb/>
There is plenty of time. What the Scottish Office is doing here is taking more control of all that is construed by the Government to be capital expenditure, whereas at the moment under the definition if a certain project can be completed within a year&#x2014;and within the guidelines, because we are still controlled by guidelines in respect of current expenditure&#x2014;it is allowed. If the authority decides to do it the general allocation for Scotland is changed and the allocation for that local authority is changed. So there is still full control but there is a certain measure of flexibility for the local authorities.<lb/>
The Government are cutting out the possibility of a local authority doing that and saying that everything, whether it is financed out of borrowing, out of the capital fund or out of current revenue, has to be lumped together and has to be approved by the Secretary of State. This is guaranteed to create mistrust of the intentions of the Government.<lb/>
Everything the Government want to do is being done. They may consider that it is being done in a roundabout way. The local authority can decide to spend something within the financial year out of revenue and then a calculation is made in regard to its capital allocation and it is reduced from that. What the Government are trying to do here is unnecessary and has led to suspicions among local authorities that they are being clamped down again by the Scottish Office. We have come to a terrible pass in respect of this and we have seen it getting worse and worse. If the Government are not prepared to drop this they should withdraw it today and have another meeting with the local authorities. They have plenty of time. They have a full year. It does not come into force until 1st April 1988. I suggest that they do that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03153"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is concerned about the commencement date. He ended his remarks by saying that we had plenty of time to deal with it. I am sure the noble Lord will recognise that authorities need to plan ahead. They need to know on what basis they have to complete their financial plans which have to be submitted in the autumn. That is the reason for dealing with the order now.<lb/>
I heard what the noble Lord said about consultation. He explained that an official he had met had thought there had been no reply to the letter. My information is that the objection by letter of 2nd February was dealt with by the authorities being told on 20th
<col>660</col>
February that after due consideration of its comments the Secretary of State had decided to proceed. This was confirmed at a meeting in April. Perhaps the message had not reached the person concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03154"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, April was not that long away and we were busy with other things. What date in April was this?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03155"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have the date with me, but I can certainly find out the precise date and let the noble Lord know.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that the amendment is unnecessary and will lead to further complications. I recognise his concern but I cannot agree that that is the case. The Treasury requires that all capital expenditure, no matter how it is financed, must count against the cash limit, but the statutory definition is out of step with that, requiring us to make assumptions about authorities' likely use of CFCR and hold that amount back before issuing capital allocations. This is a cumbersome procedure and not very accurate when authorities' use of CFCR is as unpredictable as it has become in recent years.<lb/>
So far as concerns the classification of capital expenditure, the convention raised this point when it was consulted in September, and at its request the Scottish Office consulted the Controller of Audit. He confirmed our view that, although there may be difficulty at the margin in drawing a distinction between capital and current expenditure, this would not be exacerbated by the proposed change in the wording of Section 94(2). We are not attempting to define capital expenditure as such. That, as I am sure the noble Lord will agree, is a job for the Local Authority Accounts (Scotland) Advisory Committee.<lb/>
The Government are not seeking to define that, for example, a computer is always a capital item but that a floppy disk, which goes into the computer, is always a current item. That is the sort of example that would fit into the remarks that I have just made, and that surely would be more a matter for the local authorities to settle with their own auditors as a matter of common practice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03156"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the Minister realises it, but the advisory committee will meet fairly soon to discuss the whole question of the definition of capital expenditure. Would it not be far better also to remit this to them for consideration? Why should there be haggling between the Government and the local authorities about this kind of thing? It creates distrust and eventually leads to confrontation. The Government have plenty of time. Why do they not withdraw this order? They can always bring it back; they have time to do so.<lb/>
As regards the business of giving extensions in respect of capital limits, this is done all the time. Even after this order is agreed to, it will happen. Very often one discovers that the capital available is not being used up by one local authority and one gives an additional sum to another during the financial year. That will continue. The noble Lord's remarks in that respect bear no relevance at all to what is being done here.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0339"/>
<col>661</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03157"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord referred to the meeting that the advisory committee is about to have. As I understand it, that meeting will not discuss the definition. The noble Lord seems to think otherwise but I am advised that that is not the case. Nor will the order have any effect on the amount of public expenditure provision for capital expenditure by local authorities.<lb/>
I hear what the noble Lord says, but I think that this is an improvement. I accept that CoSLA has made representations. As I have explained to the noble Lord, this has now been taken forward and we do not believe that the concerns it has expressed are as justified as it believes them to be. It is a reasonable change to make and it is broadly parallel to other changes which have taken place to try to improve the section over the years. I do not think that I have anything else to add to what I have said. I hear what the noble Lord says, and beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03158"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, does he not appreciate that he is simply doing as he is told by the Treasury? They are just carrying forward the kind of cavilling procedure of tying up the local authorities as much as possible. My information in relation to the working party is entirely different from his. My information is that they are going to discuss the difference between capital and revenue expenditure. I do not know where the noble Lord gets his information, but I get mine directly from someone concerned in this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03159"><member>Lord Kirkhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not too sure whether or not the Minister has actually resumed his seat, but on the supposition that he is just on his way down and has not quite got there, perhaps I may draw his attention to one facet of difficulty on the Scottish local government scene at the moment which I hope that this order might at least more clearly define?<lb/>
I refer to the real difficulty which exists between the citizens of Aberdeen&#x2014;and I think that I can put it as broadly as that rather than say the district council of Aberdeen&#x2014;and the use to which they wish to put their common good fund. The Minister will know of the difficulty over the common good fund of Aberdeen. The district council and indeed the wider body of the citizenry properly think of the fund as being under their purview to develop capital investment as they determine.<lb/>
In the meantime the Secretary of State takes the view that this cannot be the case and that they are not to be allowed their most reasonable expenditure. I hope that the Minister will give me some confirmation that the discussions which are about to take place will at least lead to some clearer definition in this regard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03160"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising that point and I shall come back to him in a minute on the Aberdeen common good fund. I may have inadvertently misled the noble Lord on the question of the meeting between the local authority advisory accounts committee and the Scottish Office. That committee is meeting to discuss the definition of capital expenses but the order does not seek to distinguish between capital and current. I think that that is where our misunderstanding may have arisen.<lb/>
<col>662</col>
As for the common good fund, there is no connection whatever between this order and capital expenditure financed from common good funds. Section 94 already applies to expenditure financed from such funds whereas, as I said, the purpose of the order is to simplify the control system by bringing capital expenses financed from current revenue&#x2014;that is, nearly all rating income&#x2014;within the scope of Section 94. I think that that is the answer to the noble Lord's point. If the noble Lord is content, then I commend the order to the House.</membercontribution></p>

I said "modest Bill" because, bearing in mind that a crossbow is a much more lethal weapon than an airgun, some of us thought that the minimum age should have been raised to 18 or even higher. Your Lordships may have noticed that the Chelsea football hooligans, who earlier this week were sentenced to beteen 4&#x00BD; and 10 years' imprisonment and who employed a crossbow as one of their many lethal weapons, were aged between 24 and 31.

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03177"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want briefly to ask the noble Baroness a couple of questions of which I have already given her notice. The first relates to my noble friend Lord Young's concern, which he expressed at Second Reading, that mandatory rather than voluntary reporting might undermine the principle of confidentiality, and therefore fewer people might come forward than at present. Will the Government undertake to keep a sharp eye on any evidence that the Bill is having such a counter-productive effect? If it were, we might need to reconsider in the next Parliament the whole question of mandatory reporting.<lb/>
My second point is that which I made at Second Reading. It is extremely important that no additional costs should fall on health authorities as a result of the Bill. That would be particularly unfortunate at a time when, as reported in the press today, some London hospitals are having to restrict the purchase of the AIDS drug AZT for their AIDS patients because of shortage of funds. That is a matter we must discuss on another occasion. However, there is no doubt that the Secretary of State has made many requests to health authorities in respect of AIDS, but has given no clear indicaton of how he will help them financially.<lb/>
I should like to be assured that there can be no question of the Bill contributing in any way to the funding difficulties. If any additional expenses are triggered by the duties under the schedule&#x2014;it seems to me that certain expenses might arise under paragraph 4&#x2014;I should like to be assured that the Government will make provision for them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03178"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Baroness Trumpington)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, has provided me with the welcome opportunity to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, and the honourable Member for Edinburgh East who, together, have made a little bit of history. The noble Lord's Bill is the first primary legislation solely concerned with AIDS.<lb/>
I should like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, that the existing voluntary confidential reporting system to CDSC will be maintained. Nothing in the Bill should undermine this and it will not therefore affect those arrangements. We shall continue with all the checks that are at present undertaken. It has reassured us of the virtually total completeness of the reporting of AIDS cases to date. As regards confidentiality, I gave the strongest
<col>664</col>
assurances when the Bill was last before us and I gladly repeat them.<lb/>
As regards the second point raised by the noble Lord, the provisions of the Bill should not produce any significant costs for health authorities. We expect the very small cost in producing their reports to be found from within authorities' existing budgets. The Government fully support the intentions of the Bill and believe that it will provide a useful weapon in the fight against the spread of AIDS.</membercontribution></p>

It is important legislation. We have said most of what must be said. But we face a menacing threat to the health of the nation. It cannot be stressed enough that we need accurate information and education if we are to begin to fight that threat.

<title>Environmental Protection</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03184">5.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03185"><member>Baroness Stedman</member> rose to call attention, in the European Year of the Environment, to the case for measures to protect the countryside and environment and to the case for all-party support for environmental protection; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03186">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I spent most of the Easter recess in the Lake District. Sitting high up
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0341"/>
<col>665</col>
on the fells watching a buzzard soaring overhead, I wondered if it realised that this was European Year of the Environment, and if, during all its travels over the years, it had noted the continuing decline in our environment. Had it registered how the hedgerows have been pulled out; how the broadleaved woodlands have been reduced; and how the vital wild life reserves and habitat used by birds and other species have been destroyed or become smaller?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03187">We have seen our ground water polluted by nitrates and pesticides. Our rivers have become polluted. Any success in reducing pollution has been slowed down or reversed by public spending cuts and the fact that the powers of water authorities in relation to pollution control are still too vague. One sometimes has the feeling that environmental considerations come a long way down the queue in relation to their operational requirements. That includes the discharge of sewage effluent into watercourses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03188">We believe that the Secretary of State should have more power to control water pollution and marine pollution caused by the discharge of aldrin, dieldrin and endrin. These chemicals have a totally disastrous effect on wildlife, and the Secretary of State ought to be able to set emission standards and national quality objectives that the water authorities would be required to enforce. Change is never easy to contemplate or to manage. But the difficulties will be much greater if we always cling to the past and to what we know and understand, and try to defend that past because we are afraid of what the future might hold.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03189">We, on these Benches, believe that we have that vision of the future. We recognise that environmental strategies are an essential part of our economic strategy. For far too long, the way in which environmental decisions are tackled within government has been unsatisfactory. The department mainly responsible is the Department of the Environment which is purely a department of local government and housing. Even if the Secretary of State wanted to give more prominence to environmental issues, then, of necessity, local government and housing must be his major concern.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03190">The environmental responsibilities also spill over into other departments like MAFF, Trade and Industry, Education and Science, and Transport. There has been an imbalance between environmental and other considerations in reaching policy decisions because individual departments of government are not required to consider the environmental consequences of their own policies and also because, in some ways, the DoE has lacked clout in promoting environmental issues throughout government. Therefore, agricultural policy has tended to be decided rather more in the interests of the farmer than of the conservationist. The benefits of energy conservation are given less prominence than the interests of the energy producers. Nor do we take account of environmental considerations when we formulate government policy on foreign aid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03191">That is why we are proposing a new Department of Environmental Protection which would be responsible for planning, conservation, pollution control, leisure and recreation, and animal welfare. It would also be responsible for promoting and co-ordinating environ 
<col>666</col>
ment policies in government in general. The secretary of state of this new department would be a full member of Cabinet, giving environmental protection an effective voice at the conference table for the first time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03192">We would want to foster co-operative attitudes and institutions which bring people together to share in the decisions which affect them. to identify our common objectives, pool our resources and work together to make a really integrated rural society. And what better time to begin than in the European Year of the Environment?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03193">We believe in a flourishing rural economy based on a less intensive form of agriculture than we have known until now; but the recent circulars and the &#x00A3;25 million package have not been well-received by farmers, rural dwellers or environmentalists. They do little or nothing to stem the fall in farm incomes or to relieve the fears of totally unplanned growth in industry, housing and forestry in the countryside.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03194">Even so, we believe that we have been given a great opportunity to take advantage of the need to restrain over-production. It would be a tragedy to throw away that opportunity on ribbon development, blanket forests of conifers and unrestricted housing development. Yet the Government's proposals for alternative land use and the rural economy to me look little more than a policy to buy off farmers for the losses that they have sustained through the shift in CAP. We need the conifers and the broadleaved woodlands, but in the right locations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03195">Why cannot the local authorities be more involved in preparing a strategic plan for forestry, as proposed in the latest report from the Countryside Commission, <i>New Opportunities 'Or the Countryside</i>? Why indeed can there not be some kind of landscape conservation order as a reserve power when voluntary agreements cannot secure the protection of valuable countryside features, such as the Association of County Councils has suggested? We believe that we have to balance our economy and our ecology. We want to encourage economic growth that is environmentally beneficial or, in today's jargon, "green growth".</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03196">We see energy conservation, housing rehabilitation and improvements in public transport as being environmentally beneficial. All public policies have some impact on the quality of life and all nations ultimately share the same environment, as was so graphically illustrated by the results of Chernobyl.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03197">A good environment pays dividends in improved health, welfare and personal fulfilment, if not immediately then certainly in the long-term. Our countryside is of crucial interest to all of us because of its wildlife, its beauty and its ability to meet the growing recreational needs, and because it is still primarily a source of our food and other raw materials. A healthy agriculture is necessary for the management and preservation of the countryside. Much of the natural beauty, some of the wildlife and most of the footpaths and open spaces would disappear if the farmers were not there to manage our land. We want to work towards a developing consensus between the conservationists and the farming community. I believe that most farmers would share our view that the maintenance of healthy agriculture, the conservation
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0342"/>
<col>667</col>
of the environment and the sustaining of balanced rural communities must be the objective of any integrated countryside policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03198">That will mean looking at grants, subsidies and price incentives both here and in Europe. It will mean guaranteed protection for our most important landscapes and wildlife habitats. However, beauty needs the protection of the SSSIs, of the nature reserves, the national parks, the areas of outstanding natural beauty, the environmentally sensitive areas, the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council. It also means that our farmers must be adequately rewarded for their share in the management of such areas. I see the farmer as the front-line guardian of the countryside, its landscape and much of our rural environment; so let him have a just reward from the taxpayer for playing that role. Incidentally, how many projects have been put forward for European Year of the Environment grants and how many have been agreed so far?</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03199">We believe that we need to look at the Wildlife and Countryside Act to make it better able to protect our most valuable features and the wildlife habitats. We need much more research into soil erosion and into the link between fertilisers and nitrates in our water supplies. We need much more research into organic fertilisers and their uses. We want to be able to enhance the rich diversity of our landscape and its wildlife.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03200">We welcome attempts to provide alternative sources of energy and we believe there should be serious and well-funded research into tidal power. However, at the same time we need parallel research into how to retain marshland and mud flats for the wildlife and plant life which depend upon them. For example, we have to find out if tidal energy is feasible and, if so, if it is also feasible to build up the levels of mud flats to ensure that bird life can be maintained. We ought to know the consequences of our actions before we embark on using tidal waves and estuaries for an alternative source of power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03201">We also need to look at our towns and cities, many of them with areas of dilapidation and dereliction. Townspeople need the freedom to move around in pleasant surroundings in the fringe areas; and it ought to be possible to protect the environment&#x2014;natural and man made&#x2014;in the course of development.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03202">We have to learn to manage our waste properly, to use recycling wherever possible and to control much more carefully where noxious waste will be disposed and by what methods. We have to do more about cleaning up our sewers and sewage outfalls so that our lakes and rivers will be unpolluted and our seas fit to swim in, and so that our bathing beaches will be cleansed and purged of the despoliation of today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03203">I believe that the time has come to act on the principle that the polluter should pay. We should be planning much more research into the physical and biological sciences, into ozone levels and estuarial problems, into new forms of energy, marine conservation and so on&#x2014;sciences which explain the natural processes of the environments. Yet organisations associated with the Natural Environment Research Council are being starved of funds and
<col>668</col>
the Freshwater Biological Association is facing a cutback of 30 in its staff of 100. Surely we do not want research scientists just to run a high-quality consultancy. We ought to be encouraging much more multi-disciplinary research.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03204">A green environment and growth do not necessarily have to be in conflict. It is possible to have economic and housing growth while still conserving and enhancing our environment. What we must do is to recognise the interdependence of economic and ecological priorities and the need to bring environmental issues much closer to the heart of economic policy to achieve a real balance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03205">There has to be greater interplay between environmental policies and other key policy areas such as agriculture, energy, transport, housing renewal, and so on. We believe that a properly conceived public investment programme could achieve more jobs in Britain and that projects for energy conservation, the repair and renewal of water and sewage systems, improved public transport and rehabilitation of our housing stock would all bring significant environmental gains. We could also add to job creation if we were to do more in connection with tree planting, derelict land reclamation and the restoration of wildlife habitats, on the scale that was being achieved by the Greater Manchester Council before it was abolished.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03206">Before concluding, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister's right honourable friend Mr. William Waldegrave, for the efforts which he has made to bring environmental policies to the fore. Many more people in this country are environmentally aware of, and take an interest in, issues such as pollution, acid rain, erosion of the ozone level, conservation and changes in land use. More and more people are learning a greater understanding of our flora and fauna. Surely now is the time in the European Year of the Environment to set aside any party differences, to get round the table all the political parties, and the voluntary and statutory organisations who are concerned about conservation and environmental decisions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03207">As the recent Bruntland Report asserts, only if governments reform their decision-making can sustainable development be achieved. Economic objectives have been built into the national systems of administration. We want to see a new understanding that "economic" also means "environmentally sound".</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03208">I ask: why can we not try to hammer out an agreed programme for the protection of our environment and, having agreed a basic programme that is acceptable to all political parties as well as to environmental and other groups, have that conservation and environmental protection policy honoured and funded by successive governments with periodic recall to the conference table to update the priorities? I believe that my suggestion is a practical way forward and one that would be acceptable to most of the voluntary and statutory organisations and certainly to the public at large. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03210"><member>Lord Craigton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, for giving us an opportunity
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0343"/>
<col>669</col>
to debate this important subject. I have happy memories of the time when she was a Front Bench spokesman for the Department of the Environment. In my speech I hope to give a background to her emphasis on the importance of the environment.<lb/>
In 1983, the United Nations formed the World Commission on Environment and Development to report on the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment. That is the Bruntland Report to which the noble Baroness has referred. It was published last month and consists of 383 pages convering virtually the whole globe and all its conservation problems. It was produced in the European Year of the Environment. It is the latest of many such reports. There is a surfeit of such reports and we must ask ourselves how serious is the situation.<lb/>
There are two increasingly dangerous problems, both of which are of mankind's own making and of recent origin. First, there is the growing shortage of living space. Already the world population of 2&#x00BD; billion people in 1950 has nearly doubled, and will double again in the early years of the next century. Many life forms as we know them now will not survive.<lb/>
Secondly, for little over 100 years man has been feeding back into the atmosphere the fossil fuels that have accumulated over the past 500 million years, and in the past 50 years we have added the waste products of the chemical era. The records show that carbon dioxide levels in today's atmosphere have increased by 27 per cent. since the mid-19th century. Carbon dioxide holds heat close to the earth and has the potential for melting the polar icecaps and raising the levels of the oceans. Now that methane and chloro-fluoro carbons have been added, it means that we are not just polluting the atmosphere but that we are tampering with our basic weather-making components. We do not know the outcome. The risks are a warmer, flooded earth or a world seared by the sun.<lb/>
In the meantime, those extractions and additions are causing the pollution and destruction of many life forms with which we have evolved. In Britain since the turn of the century there has been some public awareness of the damage that is being done and the dangers that lie ahead. The RSPB was started in 1889; the National Trust in 1895; Flora and Fauna Preservation in 1903; the CPRE in 1926; the BTCV (British Trust for Conservation Volunteers) and Youth Education in Conservation in 1959; and the World Wildlife Fund in 1961. Those are all voluntary bodies.<lb/>
The first world gathering of governments was the Stockholm Conference in 1972. At last fears were being turned into world action. That was the year that the All-Party Conservation Group of both Houses of Parliament was formed. In those early years&#x2014;only 16 years ago&#x2014;the group was worried about badgers, seals, whales, mining in national parks, how little use was being made of SSSIs and the iniquity of transferring nature conservancy to the Department of the Environment. Today the impetus has changed from protecting endangered species to protecting their habitats, which includes our own.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness has said, the problems and dangers are so great that governments are forced to take responsibility for their solution or diminution. In
<col>670</col>
this they must have the support of the few&#x2014;some of whom are in this Chamber today&#x2014;but whose numbers are increasing, who know and care about those problems and dangers. As that growing minority of people who are actively aware of the dangers come from all walks of life and hold varying shades of opinion and belief, I can see no merit, as the noble Baroness has said, in turning any particular danger into a party political problem. If one does that, it alienates a large number of potential supporters and encourages those who have points of view other than conservation to jump on the bandwaggon, as it were.<lb/>
One basic fact is that critics, both constructive and destructive, must have a much better chance of success with their governments if they are fully and correctly informed. It is at this point that an all-party group such as ours comes into its own. The group seeks to give Members of both Houses an opportunity to hear and question the men and women who are personally answerable for an activity or policy. Thus are so many misunderstandings clarified and answered. Common sense imposes limitations on the choice of subjects for discussion. If the Member or the Government are to do something about the problem there must be some degree of ministerial responsibility. In that case, should the Minister or his responsible official take part and if there is some difference of opinion should someone of weight attend to give the opposite view?<lb/>
All that must happen before the Government have made up their mind to act. Once a Bill or order is tabled the discussions, which one hopes are better informed, fall within party debate. The all-party group is there to provide the correct information and not to influence Members, who will make their own decisions on how to act. The group meetings are attended by Members who have a special interest in the subject under discussion. The debates are circulated among some 160 Members of both Houses and that ensures that those who are interested but were not able to attend the meeting are nevertheless kept fully informed. The subjects have changed over the years but the need to keep Members of Parliament fully and correctly informed remains the same.<lb/>
I should like to think that our group has helped to keep conservation out of party politics, but the credit is due to the Ministers and the ministry, especially the Department of the Environment whose publications and many meetings that have been so willingly arranged have disclosed the facts, thoughts and conclusions behind the evidence on which decisions will be based.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03212"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the Motion that has been put down by the noble Baroness and I thank her for giving us an opportunity to speak on 'a subject on which I have both spoken and written for well over 20 years. However, I wish to make one reservation in that welcome.<lb/>
When the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, asks why it cannot be the case that all-party support is given to the environmental decisions that must be made for the survival of mankind, I can give her the answer, which is very straightforward. Since election fever has hit the country, we have already seen the Government make
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0344"/>
<col>671</col>
one abject withdrawal on the question of burying nuclear: waste. That was clearly designed solely for electoral purposes.<lb/>
But the important issue is what reason the Government gave for changing their mind&#x2014;changing their mind against what their scientific advisers had advised them to do&#x2014;about burying nuclear waste in shallow trenches. The reason given was that they had now discovered that the cost of burying in deep trenches was no more than that for burying in shallow trenches. In other words, it was the cost factor which dominated the decision according to the Government. This Government measure everything by the cost factor. That is the reason why it is fantasy, and indeed dangerous fantasy, which may well dilute the conservationists' case simply to try to smooth over the differences of philosophy between the parties.<lb/>
I want to concentrate on one issue, which the noble Lord who preceded me raised briefly during his speech, and that is the question of the ozone layer, because this again is an illustration of the central point that I want to make. Presumably everybody knows now that the layer of ozone which covers this planet absorbs the sun's ultra-violet radiation and if it is removed or weakened then, on the best prescription we get an increase in skin cancers, while on the worst, if it is really removed, the human race is extinguished through burning.<lb/>
As the noble Lord mentioned, the emission of chloro-fluoro carbons (CFCs as they are commonly known) has in the opinion of many scientists already begun to damage that ozone layer through the use of aerosols, the use of fridges, fast food production, plastic foam and other commodities of that kind; and the CFCs, we are told by the scientists, once emitted can last for 75 to 100 years. So we are talking about the future of humanity as well as the present.<lb/>
Already there have been seen through satellites seasonal holes in that ozone layer over the Antarctic&#x2014;interestingly enough, missed by the computers. But what are the Government doing, what is this country doing, in the face of this grave menace to the human race? Though I could not contact the Minister who is to reply, I have contacted her staff so I hope that she will be able to give me some specific reply to this issue and the Government's stand upon it.<lb/>
In 1985, we had the Vienna Convention with 30 countries approving a vague set of measures. What measures were they? The United States, Canada and Scandinavia have already banned aerosols. What have our Government done? As recently as December 1986, the United States proposed a freeze on the production of CFCs and a 50 per cent. reduction within 10 to 15 years. They were supported by the Canadians, the Scandinavians and the Soviet Union&#x2014;not by the British Government.<lb/>
Only two weeks ago in Geneva it was hoped that a treaty would be ready by September, but next week, on 21st May, the EC Environmental Committee meets. Our Government have a veto, every government has a veto, on that decision. What will the Government do at that meeting in Brussels next week? The record of this Government has been to oppose the cuts that have been suggested by other countries in the production of
<col>672</col>
CFCs. Why? It is because of the cost that would be involved, because ICI is British and believes that American Dupont is in advance of British companies in the research for replacements for CFCs.<lb/>
I pay tribute, as has already been paid, to William Waldegrave for the partial U-turn that he led in March in suggesting a 20 per cent. cut in six years. I wonder how long William Waldegrave will last in this Government. But that was the suggestion in March. We do not have time to wait for this bickering, for this guesswork. Between 1978 and 1986, that ozone cover was decreased by 4 per cent. and today, if four out of five of the industrial countries were to freeze their production of CFCs, the ozone layer would be reduced by 16 per cent. by the year 2060. Can we afford this kind of risk?<lb/>
I know that we are talking, and I am talking, of scientific uncertainties, but the human race cannot afford to wait for proven certainties. If this issue is to be judged, as it apparently has been in the past by this Government, on the test of profit and loss, then the probability is that the verdict on the human species will be that it made 100 per cent. profit but that in doing so it incinerated itself into extinction.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03214"><member>The Lord Bishop of Manchester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I also should like to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, on her choice of subject and also on the splendid speech with which she introduced this debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, indicated, questions of the environment are of very great gravity indeed and they call for an all-party approach.<lb/>
There are encouraging signs. I am reminded of this every morning, especially on a lovely day like this when I look out from the house where I live in Salford down below to the environmental improvement scheme of the Croall-Irwell valley. This was a threefold partnership scheme between the Department of the Environment, the lamented GMC, which played a predominant role, and also the four local authorities through which the River Irwell and the River Croall pass.<lb/>
Clean air and new technology are giving marvellous possibilities for cleaning up the environment and protecting the countryside in new ways. However, I believe that we should appreciate that pressures on the environment come both from the rich and from the poor. The pressures are very great indeed&#x2014;pressures to create wealth, pressures of those already possessing wealth to enjoy it in the way in which they would wish and particularly pressures from the poor. I expect we are thinking particularly in this debate of the countryside in our own country, and yet already I am glad to see that an international note has crept in, because all of us realise that we are concerned with the management of a very small planet and that these environmental issues run into each other all the time.<lb/>
Pressures on the environment by the poor come in many parts of the world and they are contributed to in various ways by those in wealthier countries. You think, for example, of landless people of Brazil being ordered by their government to clear forests in order to secure more areas for cultivation for schemes which are sometimes supported by money from western
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0345"/>
<col>673</col>
countries, or for cash crops which are damaging the environment. Or you can think of the search for wood as the only source of energy for cooking in many parts of Africa, which is causing devastating results.<lb/>
To succeed, environmental policies surely have to have at home and abroad a great weight of public opinion behind them and that is the point to which I should like to address myself in these few moments. It is very difficult to get public opinion fully behind environmental causes, whether here in Britain or overseas. In this connection, the traditions that we have had from the past and the outlook that we have on theworld in which we live and on our environment around us are of great importance. Religious traditions have a value here. I am bound to confess that the Judeo-Christian tradition has been under very severe criticism in the past from environmentalists.<lb/>
I shall read a few words from <i>The Environmental Revolution</i> by Max Nicholson in which he goes for the churches with no holes barred. He writes:
<quote>"The adherents of the church have, with few exceptions, persisted in behaving as rampant Old Testament tribes, now terrifyingly endowed with modern technological knowledge and equipment, and making mischief for the world on a corresponding scale &#x2026; In South America, giant crucifixes stand proudly on summits overlooking deforested hillsides and dried up stream beds. In Spain, Italy and in many other lands, the extent of erosion and of wanton destruction of wild life is closely co-related with the proportion of regular churchgoers".</quote>
I read those words in penitence. However, things are changing in the churches, as elsewhere. For example, the World Council of Churches has promoted a major study under the heading <i>Faith, Science and the Future</i>, which culminated in a conference in Boston in 1979. Some of the conclusions of that conference were very important for the subject with which we are concerned. The churches were called on to:
<quote>"foster the exploration of less consumptive and wasteful styles of life, and promote programmes which restrain governments and private enterprises from depleting non-renewable resources".</quote>
The conference delegates backed the idea of "world commons", namely things held in common such as the oceans, the Antarctic, the atmosphere and space, and called on the scientific and technological communities to:
<quote>"abide by and implement the principles of justice, sustainability and participation in dealing with each other".</quote>
They called on the churches to do what they could to:
<quote>"promote education and awareness of the nature and injustices of environmental damage".</quote>
Therefore, I believe that things are changing. We are all very familiar with the concept of loving our neighbour, but the concept which is now being promoted is that our neighbour includes future generations. That is very hard to get across when people are faced with the short-term commercial pressures which are experienced in every country. They are much more excusable in countries where people are very poor and desperate to live.<lb/>
If policies to protect the countryside and the environment are to succeed nationally and internationally, we must act as though the earth's resources are for all and share them much more equally than we have ever done in the past.<lb/>
I was very interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, refer to the dangers of overpopulation. He
<col>674</col>
was absolutely right to do so as it is one of the gravest pressures of all on the environment on a world scale. However, people often forget that efforts to deal with overpopulation must go along with development. A simple illustration of that may make my point. I remember that when I was in Kenya two posters were produced. One showed a man and his wife, who was very badly dressed, sitting on packing cases outside a dilapidated hut with a crowd of children. The other showed a nice neat hut with a man his beautifully dressed wife and two children sitting outside. The latter poster was to promote the idea of family limitation and birth control.<lb/>
They had to withdraw the poster because too many people were going around saying: "Look at that poor man. He has only got two children". It is clear that unless one gets away from the idea that security lies in the number of children that people have, it is very difficult to promote the concept of reducing population and reducing pressures on the environment.<lb/>
Let us not be naive and suppose that in our country we can meet pressures on the environment without very difficult political questions being raised. I am thinking particularly of the planning applications for huge super shopping "cities" which are being submitted at the moment in a number of areas. They could gravely damage our environment, although I have no time to develop that theme.<lb/>
I conclude that care of the environment must have a very high priority, but changing attitudes is absolutely crucial. Attitudes can only be changed by promoting concepts of the fairer sharing of resources both at home and abroad.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03216"><member>Lord Hunt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether it lies with me formally to thank the noble Baroness for giving us an opportunity to discuss this subject. She already knows how grateful I am personally.<lb/>
In the few minutes at my disposal I thought it best to narrow the focus from the broad range of topics that have been raised so far and speak for a few moments about our national parks. I declare an interest, having had the delectable experience for the past six years of being president of the Council for National Parks.<lb/>
Last year marked the launch by the Countryside Commission of a three-year campaign to increase public awareness of our 10 national parks. Here I follow the right reverend Prelate in stressing the importance of that. Public interest is there already. Last year, nearly 100 million people visited our 10 national parks, but relatively few people know much about them. A Countryside Commission survey conducted recently found that under half of those questioned could name more than two of our national parks, which must perhaps partly account for the overcrowding which occurs in Snowdonia, in the Lake District and in the Peak Park during the year.<lb/>
The year 1986 also marked 50 years since a Standing Committee on national parks launched a movement to establish parks in England and Wales which culminated, a quarter of a century later, in the designation of the first of our national parks. Our national parks embrace under 10 per cent. of the land
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0346"/>
<col>675</col>
surface of England and Wales, but they represent a great deal more than that in terms of values which bear on the quality of life, especially for city dwellers. The parks, as I see it, are standard setters for the countryside in general. They help to create public concern for the rural scene as a whole.<lb/>
We do well to remember that, unlike national parks in many other countries, our national parks are areas where a quarter of a million people live and very many work&#x2014;principally of course on the land. Our parks contain few of what might be properly called wilderness areas. Indeed, most of their traditional landscapes are manmade. They continue to depend on human skills and human labour to preserve and develop in ways that are sensitive to landscape and wildlife. One essential condition for the future of the parks is the continuing commitment and co-operation of local communities in maintaining a national asset for the public at large.<lb/>
Over the past 20 years or so, one of the problems has been the conflict in the needs of agriculture&#x2014;encouraged by MAFF grants and aided by modern technology and chemistry&#x2014;in contrast to those of the national parks, where now attitudes are changing under the painful necessity to cut back on food production. There is now a new prospect of working together in a common interest of land management in the parks.<lb/>
There is a great deal more I should like to say if time permitted. However, I shall limit myself to a few of the things which need to be done to defend the purposes of the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. I am presenting them as statements or matters of opinion, but I should be grateful if the Minister could find time to comment on one or two at least of them when she replies.<lb/>
First, there is a strong case for elevating the status of the committees, which are entirely accountable to county councils, to that of the boards which operate in the Lake District and in the Peak Park. All national park authorities should also have statutory authority for their own development plans in the context of the Government's new proposals for development planning.<lb/>
Secondly, the national park authorities need greater financial resources, and that notwithstanding a most welcome increase which has been made for the national park supplementary grant in the current year. There is a strong case for grant-aiding all national parks at the same 90 per cent. level as Exmoor receives for making management agreements, instead of the 75 per cent. which all other parks receive at present.<lb/>
Thirdly, I wish to stress that the Government are to be commended on their insistence on the voluntary principle in regard to their policies in the parks. However, in one respect, powers of last resort are needed to prevent damaging developments which a very small minority of farmers can and have carried out, despite the withholding of MAFF grants. Landscape conservation orders, which my noble friend has mentioned, have now been proposed by the Government. However, they will be needed over the whole designated areas of the parks and not simply in key areas within them.<lb/>
<col>676</col>
Fourthly, broadleaved farm woodland schemes, which the Government propose to encourage in their consultative document, ALURE, are welcomed; the planting of more conifer forests as alternatives for the cutback in food production are not. All forestry should be brought within the ambit of planning control in the national parks. We cannot afford more disfigurement of the uplands by blanket conifer plantations as has happened over the years in the Lake district, in the Brecon Beacons, in Northumberland and in Snowdonia.<lb/>
Last but perhaps most important of all, we need an example from government. Changing attitudes on the ground should surely be matched by a policy at the centre which upgrades the value and importance of the countryside to that of food and industrial production. I am sure that the right reverend Prelate will be able to confirm that it can be said on impeccable authority that man shall not live by bread alone.<lb/>
We need a strategy by government which integrates all relevant interests in the uses of rural land. That is the policy of the parties represented on these Benches and it would hopefully be the strategy which we would pursue. The national parks have fully proved their worth since they were dreamt of some 50 years ago. They exert their influence upon and they are influenced by policies which bear on the countryside in general. With greater leisure, affluence and mobility the need for and the role of the parks in the next 50 years cannot fail to assume greater importance to the quality of life in Britain. For the sake of posterity, we must make that asset secure for future generations.</membercontribution></p>

I join her in her generous tribute to William Waldegrave for his work, especially in the Council of Ministers in Brussels.<lb/>
A related subject to that of national parks, on which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt spoke with such authority after his splendid service, is the preservation of green belts in this country. That is a good test of government soundness on conservation of the environment because it affects most town dwellers. All governments want more houses built and some past governments have fallen for the temptation of taking a slice of green belt land for quick and attractive development of new houses.<lb/>
This Government's record is good. Not only have they significantly extended the green belts in various parts of the country but they have also resisted the tempting proposal of a powerful consortium of builders to take 750 acres of farmland in Kent and build on it a new community of 5,000 houses at Tillingham Hall. The Government rejected that scheme on the ground, first, that it breached the green belt and, secondly, that there was enough land with planning consent within the boroughs of Greater London.<lb/>
Consent would have created a precedent, opening a flood of similar applications which would soon have obliterated the green belt not only around London but
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0347"/>
<col>677</col>
around other cities and would have deprived Londoners and other city dwellers of what are literally the lungs of their cities. The financial incentive to crack the boundaries of green belts is so huge&#x2014;a factor of at least 10 times&#x2014;that the developers' continuous attack, using every ingenuity, is ever pursued. Only the vigilance of government and of local authorities safeguards them.<lb/>
Conversely, the Government have given a splendid lead in developing alternative unused urban land with the massive redevelopment of the eight square miles of London's derelict docklands. That area was evidently beyond the capacity of the London boroughs to revive it; it has now been transformed by the Government's urban development corporation into a hive of new building and activity with some 10,000 houses already built or being built and 8,000 new jobs, with the prospect of four times that number in the next four years. It has been financed mainly by private money, in that for every &#x00A3;1 of Government money there are &#x00A3;6 of private money. That has been a spectacular success and shows what can be done in the area of urban renewal. It was interesting to hear, before this debate started, the Minister moving that further urban development corporations should be set up so that some six corporations will cover the country. The Government get full marks from me for conserving the green belts, and that of London in particular, while they have, at the same time, renewed housing stocks.<lb/>
I turn briefly to my old friends in the water industry. The Government have achieved some good things in that area. Despite the ambivalent attitude of the Government to their legitimate child&#x2014;the 1973 Act&#x2014;they tend to treat the water industry rather like a father in ancient Rome who had the power of life and death over his children&#x2014;with death too often uppermost in his mind&#x0021; Fortunately, a period of reprieve now obtains.<lb/>
In the meantime, great credit should be given to the regional water authorities for the clean-up of estuaries and coastal waters. They inherited a shocking condition from local authorities 13 years ago; all sewage outfalls from towns and cities round our coasts were no more than pipes discharging raw sewage on the tidal edge of the beaches. In the past five years, all regional water authorities have given top priority to curing the pollution by constructing long sea outfalls or new treatment works. They have devoted some hundreds of millions of pounds to that important expenditure. Now we have a report that two-thirds of all our beaches conform with the EC standard and that the remainder will soon follow. Even the murky old Mersey will eventually be cleaned to the standard of the Thames and the Tyne.<lb/>
A similar story of progress in cleaning up our rivers is also going forward. However, I say with all seriousness to my noble friend that the Government must restrain their zeal for financial stringency which limits the strength of monitoring. They will never keep rivers clean without sufficient monitoring. That is essential for maintaining river quality standards. To the Government goes the credit for unified water management, which they or their predecessors brought about in 1973 and which has made progress possible. I hope that my noble friend will take on
<col>678</col>
board the message that whatever is done in the future, that will never be changed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03220"><member>Lord Gibson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with the greatest interest to the speeches made in your Lordships' House this afternoon. Some have referred to the environment on a global scale. However, I should like to return in the few minutes that are permitted to me in a short debate to the way in which agricultural and planning policies affect our countryside. I am very glad that this debate is taking place before the end of this Parliament. I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, for introducing the debate.<lb/>
There was anxiety earlier this year when the Government indicated some relaxation of planning control. I think that that was largely unjustified anxiety. All we were being told was that, except in land of the highest quality, agricultural production should cease to be the paramount factor in deciding planning applications. Protected areas were to be protected as before. I hardly think that that is equivalent to treating special areas as land museums, as has been claimed, while letting all other land take its chance. To my mind, it is simply a recognition that economic pressures are already changing the countryside and that if we are to combine protection with furtherance of national economic and social interests, some changes in planning assumptions are necessary.<lb/>
So far as agriculture is concerned, as has often been said, it is the victim of its own success. There is now an abundance of food and unless European taxpayers are prepared to underwrite the export of food at uneconomic cost to the hungry parts of the world, which in any case is not a long-term solution, agriculture must adapt to the new situation and the countryside will change accordingly&#x2014;but not I think necessarily for the worse. The ideas now being canvassed&#x2014;such as a return in some places to low input/low output farming, the Minister's scheme for fallowing, suggestions for, in effect, paying farmers to manage the countryside in places where farming without subsidy would be uneconomic, the farm woodlands scheme, and the various diversifications of the rural economy that have been suggested&#x2014;all these ideas, whether practical or not, (and I expect some of them are not) are not ideas which would harm the countryside. They may even do more for the beauty of the countryside than an ever-more productive agriculture would be likely to do.<lb/>
On the other hand, there are economic pressures which do threaten it. Here the problem is how to ensure that planning controls effectively minimise the damage, and how to reconcile our love of the countryside with the need for some changes in land use. I yield to no one in my love of our countryside. I think I care about it almost more than anything else. I have spent much of my lifetime trying to protect and preserve it, having been the chairman of the National Trust for nine years and closely involved with it for nearly 25 years.<lb/>
Moreover, I am now chairing the Royal Society of Arts Environment Committee, so I think that I can lay some claim to being an environmentalist at heart. I am
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0348"/>
<col>679</col>
totally behind the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, in urging the importance of environmental protection and a reconsideration of the present administrative set-up within government to achieve it.<lb/>
The fact is that if we cannot generate the resources to afford to maintain the countryside it will, in any case, disappear as we know it. We must therefore have regard to economics; and moreover people's livelihoods are at stake, and with them the stability of society<lb/>
To illustrate what I mean I should like to talk for a moment about the South-East of England, where I live. Although I should hate to see the view changed&#x2014;whether from my garden or anyone else's&#x2014;we have to consider what is our paramount national interest. One element in the matter is to do everything we can to reduce unemployment. So far as concerns planning land use, this means recognising that the south-east quarter of England is where most of the unfilled vacancies are. If we build the Channel Tunnel, this will increasingly be the case.<lb/>
From the national point of view, therefore, it does not make sense to maintain present restrictive policies in an area of England which can help relieve unemployment. Everyone knows that people seeking work often find it in the South-East and then find that they cannot afford to buy or rent a house there. My belief is that a future government ought to insist that the South-East does rather more to help the country as a whole by accommodating more low-cost housing than it is doing now.<lb/>
What planning procedures will best ensure that encouraging economic growth, and jobs where they are most likely to be available, does the minimum damage to the countryside? Can we find a way to prevent development from ruining it? I believe that we can. As the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, pointed out in your Lordships' House last February, we do not want housing estates tagged on to our existing villages.<lb/>
What we shall need are new villages, not in green belts&#x2014;I hasten to support the noble Lord, Lord Nugent of Guildford, on that matter&#x2014;but there are places where new villages can be sited without doing any harm. As architects are now more responsive to traditional values and popular taste, why should these villages not be attractive? Why should we not add to their attraction by planting trees, as has been done in Milton Keynes&#x2014;not little trees, but big trees which will grow in a way that will give scale and dignity to their surroundings.<lb/>
However, these are points of detail, and although details are critical to the appearance of the countryside, before we can get those details right what we surely need is a strategic plan, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for land use over the whole country, drawn up in the light of the changing situation.<lb/>
I am not clear what strategic planning the Government contemplate. I know that they propose to replace the county structure plans and local plans with a single system of district plans, but districts will need to operate within an overall plan. Perhaps the Minister will expand that point, for the nature of the broad
<col>680</col>
framework within which districts would work is crucial.<lb/>
If the next government set up the machinery for deciding at national level the broad lines on which public resources are to be allocated between different forms of land use&#x2014;for example, industry, farming, housing, conservation, forestry and all new kinds of activity within the rural economy&#x2014;then district authorities can be left to make planning decisions within that framework.<lb/>
What we shall still need&#x2014;and this is my last point&#x2014;is a sufficient number of planning officers with the training to do the job really well. The planners have saved us from many visual atrocities, but we can all give examples of planning absurdities which have sometimes been due quite simply to a lack of proper education in visual matters. I believe we could do infinitely more by careful training to produce a larger body of planning officers with a sensitivity which is now sometimes missing.<lb/>
When local government was reorganised in 1974 the number of planning authorities was greatly increased without a corresponding increase in well-trained planners and there was a constant dilution during the &#x2019;seventies in the quality of planning officials. If the inevitable changes in our countryside are to be managed without detriment to its beauty we need a strategic plan for land use and more well-trained people to implement it on the ground.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03222"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, for instigating this debate. I am delighted that it is not one of the victims of one of the Government's cuts and that we still have it. I should like to follow up what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, and welcome the Government's initiative on the alternative uses of farm buildings and farmland. I was delighted particularly about the alternative uses for farm buildings. Last week I went to see a snail farm in our local area which has taken over a derelict farm building, and is actually exporting snails for consumption in France, which I thought was rather good news.<lb/>
I echo the noble Lord when he said that there was unjustified criticism concerning the restriction on planning controls. However, I go further and say that there was a lot of nonsense talked about it, particularly in the local press where there were headlines to the effect that farmland was to be covered with rashes of new housing, and that farmers would go mad and sell every acre for building. I also echo what the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, said, but I feel very strongly, as the noble Baroness said, that farmers and landlords in this country are the front line guardians in the battle for conservation. Many of them have lived for generations on the land and the one thing they want to enjoy is an attractive countryside. Of course there are exceptions but I do not believe they are the rule.<lb/>
I have mixed feelings about planners. We live in a lovely part of the world. I am lucky enough to live on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales. We have many visitors now, especially since Mr. Herriot made his money from writing his "vets" books. The most attractive and popular place on my estate is known as
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0349"/>
<col>681</col>
Druids Circle, which is wonderful. It is on the edge of the moor. It is perfect in every way. There is even a stow with a channel down which the Virgin's blood was supposed to run. It may strike you that there is nothing very strange about this. However, visitors come and say it is better than Stonehenge&#x2014;so it ought to be; it was built only 150 years ago&#x0021; It was built by the then owner of the estate at a time of high unemployment. He could indulge his fantasy in Victorian folly and also produce some wages for the locals at a time of high unemployment.<lb/>
I was thinking about this matter the other day and I thought that if I had wanted to do that sort of thing I would never have got planning permission. To put forward a folly in this day and age would be a folly.<lb/>
I am not suggesting for a moment that planners should be abolished, but I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, that some of them could reconsider their ideas. In case I am being too complacent and too kind to the Government, I should like to put out a marker for the next government&#x2014;I am quite sure that a member of that government will be the noble Baroness who is sitting on the Front Bench and will be answering this debate&#x2014;on the question of the common land forum and any future legislation on the lines suggested. I know that this was a unanimous decision by those in the common land forum. Unfortunately, there was a North-South divide. Those who gave evidence and the members of the forum could not spot the difference between common land, especially in the South of England, and the large heather commons of the North, which are a very different proposition.<lb/>
I hope that any government will consider seriously the evidence recently put forward by the moorland association, which has gone into some detail about the heather commons of the North of England and produced a cogent and well informed report. I hope that whatever government look at it will take advice about the matter. In case your Lordships suspect that I should declare an interest, perhaps I should say that none of my moorland is common land, so I do not gain anything from what I say.<lb/>
A short debate like this is not the right time for me to go into the arguments. There are good arguments. The report has been submitted to the department; it makes interesting reading and I hope that it will be well considered&#x2014;I rather enjoyed it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03223">6.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03224"><member>Lord Buxton of Alsa</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness not only for a vigorous survey of the problems of the European Year of the Environment&#x2014;I sit on the United Kingdom committee&#x2014;but for the wording of the Motion, because it enables me to deal with a specific case for special measures. That is the subject of afforestation in the far North; that is, the wild wilderness in Sutherland and Caithness known as the flow country. Before anyone thinks that I am against forestry or afforestation, let me say that I regard this particular case as a specific political, social and environmental problem. I am entirely in favour of forestry and indulge in it myself.<lb/>
<col>682</col>
The blanketing of this area with coniferous plantations is doing irreversible damage to a unique and delicately evolved wild habitat. It will eliminate many fascinating natural species, especially birds and plants. Once it has gone, it will probably never recover, even in centuries.<lb/>
I believe that it is immoral to eliminate and perhaps even exterminate highly specialised species of birds and plants, unless it is absolutely essential for mankind's economic survival. Even then it may still be immoral, but in that case it would proably be inevitable; in this case&#x2014;the flow country&#x2014;it is not even necessary.<lb/>
The Government have initiated new forestry policies, and prospects for the forestry industry are bright. Henceforth large areas of the country will be available for forestry. There is no excuse therefore for eliminating a unique wilderness. It is like saying that agriculture is threatened because we do not plough up medieval mounds, forts and barrows or stands of ancient oaks. People have gone to prison or been fined for that, yet in the case of the flows there is not only no discouragement but the Government are compounding the crime and encouraging it by subsidies and even more by substantial tax benefits for only a very few shareholders.<lb/>
The public interest has simply been ignored. It has been ignored because a sort of gold rush has been discovered, a way of making a quick killing, which is not even consistent with sound forestry practice. I say this having been a business man all my life. In this instance there is a clear case for making a quick killing.<lb/>
The reasons why this valuable ecological heritage is being destroyed are simple. First, the land is cheap for the forestry industry to buy. Secondly, it is available, because if an owner needs the cash he may find there is only one potential purchaser, a forestry company. Thirdly, the shareholders of the forestry companies gain substantial tax concessions. Forestry schemes are put to clients in the City simply as tax effective investments with no concern for the local issues. In many cases the shareholders do not even know where their land or plantation is.<lb/>
I do not blame the people involved. As my noble friend Lord Onslow so frequently says, if the Government provide a nice trough, we are all tempted to put our snouts in it. Therefore, I do not blame the people involved. The Government have to intervene in the public interest and for future generations.<lb/>
If an owner has to sell, nobody will benefit from forestry in this area other than the vendor of the land and the few shareholders of the forestry company&#x2014;the local inhabitants least of all. How can it possibly be to the advantage of the next generation of locals and their successors to have the area sterilised by blanket forestry? If a few hands during draining, ploughing and planting are employed today, there will be nothing for their children and their grandchildren to do. The area will be no more than a dark green desert.<lb/>
The cycle here should be recognised. Some hands are employed now but then there will be a 30-year blank period, after which some people will be brought back, probably from outside; that will be followed by another 30 years of blight. That cannot be in the interests of the local communities.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0350"/>
<col>683</col>
The traditional pursuits of tourism, open air life and sport provide stable and consistent employment. Leisure is the in-thing in the City. Tourism is high on the Government's agenda. The future prosperity of the flow country and its people is bright if the prospects and the natural resources are not extinguished now. In leisure and amenity terms, with the associated employment opportunities, one can even argue that the long-term consequences of blanket forestry in this wilderness will have longer term negative results than Chernobyl.<lb/>
There are, I believe, some 5,000 people employed in forestry in the UK, but there are hundreds of thousands&#x2014;perhaps in due course millions&#x2014;with a mounting interest in birds, botany and this type of wild wilderness. That means in Sutherland and Caithness that if the resources are preserved the visitors and tourists would have to be housed; they would need bed-and-breakfast and hotels. They would need gillies, wardens, stalkers, guides, petrol services, garages, shopping centres and so on. None of these rewarding and attractive occupations will exist once the coniferous forest has blanketed the moorland. Nobody will drive hundreds of miles to see row upon row of furrows and lines of conifers. The future of employment in the flow country should be as bright as it is in the Norfolk Broads, where the Government have taken such keen interest, if it is given equal priority.<lb/>
I therefore ask my noble friend the Minister to take into account the serious problem which concerns not simply wildlife and the environment; it is a social community problem in the far North of Scotland. Government measures take time and maybe no instant action is likely. Since the situation is critical and the deprivation is proceeding, perhaps my noble friend can express concern about it and consider reviewing the question of subsidies in that area, especially tax concessions. I myself like tax concessions, if I can find them. However, these are unjustified because they are against the public interest and the local interest.<lb/>
The Government have shown commendable concern in the Norfolk Broads. The wild country of Sutherland and Caithness is just as important for the recreation and employment of future generations. The area needs comparable protection now.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03226"><member>Lord Henniker</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to join the chorus of thanks to my noble friend Lady Stedman for introducing this important subject and doing it so very well. She soared like a lakeland buzzard over the whole scene. I shall approach it from another angle, a more earthbound position of the toad beneath the harrow.<lb/>
For the last 10 or 12 years&#x2014;and I should declare an interest because I have been involved in all matters connected with the environment in my area&#x2014;we have tried to conduct what a visitor called a controlled experiment in seeing how we can improve the environment, open it to the public and prevent the countryside in a very rural area of Suffolk becoming a museum, with little employment and a small amount of housing.<lb/>
<col>684</col>
I have followed all the speeches and concur with nearly all of them. From my worm's eye view, on a small scale, I think that I can say something optimistic. What we have done at home is totally unimportant. But we have been trying to show farmers and landowners that what we have done can be achieved without threat, without ruining the countryside and without any really serious problem.<lb/>
When we started 10 years ago we had a lot of obsolete farm buildings and we converted them. We now have 14 separate industries working in them, some trading abroad. I hate saying that we have created jobs because people get jobs if they want them, but we have provided a foothold for about 40 jobs. We have also opened a place for helping handicapped people to start their own industries.<lb/>
We have heard things said about planners. All I can say is that the planners considered me to be a zany diplomat when I returned, but they let me perform one job that I wished to do. They were pleased and since then we have become total allies. They are ahead of me most of the time and it is an extremely satisfactory partnership.<lb/>
If we are going to do this, we must have housing for rent. This is one of our big problems. Suffolk is becoming a commuter county. I am all for the sale of council houses. I think it has done good. But we have now to get on to providing houses for young and old people. The young are starting their work; the old are finishing and wish to stay in their villages. We are very much homebound in Suffolk. We have to provide houses. I have managed to provide five out of my converted farm buildings. We have also made, with the assistance of the National Agricultural Centre Housing Association, a small scheme in the village. I am chairman of the Suffolk Rural Housing Association. We are trying to go ahead with what villages want; that is, small housing schemes. We have no wish to be ripped apart by large developments.<lb/>
It is very sad, in a way, that we go so slowly. We started about three years ago. We are getting our first bricks on the ground this year. The Housing Corporation that will fund us spends 87 per cent. but, of course, its priority consideration is the inner cities and we recognise that. However, it spends less than 1 per cent. of what it receives on small villages and the need is getting urgent. Our houses now cost up to four times what they cost about two years ago and the people there cannot possibly buy them.<lb/>
Another matter that worries me is that as we try to provide work, the infrastructure shrinks. For example, just as we got going the doors of the post office clanged shut. The number of children in the village having risen in six years from three to 49, we were treated to an argument that the local school must be closed on the grounds of a demographic trend which we thought we had bucked. We are also trying to develop access to bridle paths and to create walks in woods and in areas around ponds, providing recreation for our locals and also for London children. We have a big camp to which children from less happy homes come in the summer and throughout the year. We have reached a figure of 20,000 people a year and can prove to our peers that there is no threat. We are very vulnerable. We sit in the middle. The context is that we have no
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0351"/>
<col>685</col>
particular house to show and no particular site to display, but we have beautiful countryside. Unfortunately, we have no large capital sums that we can spend. We have shown our farming colleagues what can be done without threat. We turned our cow house into a school for environmental studies, and last year we had 6,000 children visitors.<lb/>
My experience is that militant people on both sides create most of the trouble between conservationists and countrymen. Most people do not understand, and one has to help any educational project. We urge the Government to adopt this approach, perhaps by exchange rural and urban studies between urban and rural schools. We find that even with country children&#x2014;we had 75 in on Saturday from Bury St. Edmunds&#x2014;some have never been in a green field in their lives. The problem, of course, is finance. One needs to be very experienced or very clever to find where one can get money. We have been greatly helped by the Countryside Commission which has provided a warden. My wife and I did all the work at the start with the local council. I am glad to see that the development commission&#x2014;Cosira&#x2014;has more resources now and it has also been of great help.<lb/>
The MSC has been absolutely invaluable in country districts, particuarly in connection with the community programme. We hear that the programme is going to be cut., and the enormous problem is trying to get labour to do the things that need to be done. Rural people have at their fingertips, when they start, all the things which the MSC has to do; for example the ability to dig, saw, cut ditches and so on. I hope that instead of unemployment schemes there can be provided subsidised jobs in a rural craft, such as forestry. I am sorry that I have exceeded my time and I apologise.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03228"><member>Lord Gibson-Watt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, is happy with the result of the debate which she initiated. I have been very interested in all the contributions which have been made. It is a pity that the television cameras are not here today when we are discussing a matter of far greater importance than some of the issues upon which we normally spend much of our time.<lb/>
Conservation takes many forms, both in creating and preserving what is fine and beautiful and in improving the environment. I take, for example, old buildings. For some years I was a member of the Historic Buildings Council in Wales. We inspected castles, great houses, cottages, churches and even dovecots. Of course, we gave grants to deserving cases where we could afford it. As a result, part of our heritage is the richer today. This is going on in England and in Scotland, too.<lb/>
In the sphere of archaeology, for example, last month the Offa's Dyke Society, of which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was once a notable president, and of which I myself have the honour to be president at the moment, heard a lecture on the action being taken to maintain and preserve Offa's Dyke. As its current president I should like publicly to thank English Heritage for the work it has done in renewing and improving the Dyke at Sedbury. The present use of the Dyke and the care taken of it by the society and by
<col>686</col>
others again adds to our heritage. However, like other remains, if it is not repaired it can be damaged.<lb/>
As regards nature conservancy, in the past few years care by the RSPB has safeguarded the existence of many bird species. I remember inquiring in 1972 from Mr. Lovegrove, the head of the RSPB in Wales, how many peregrines there were and he told me there were six pairs. Today the position is very different because there are now a great number of hawks around. For people in some areas there are perhaps rather too many&#x2014;and for some small birds&#x0021; Indeed, the picture has changed greatly. I only wish that other countries, like Italy, would stop this needless slaying of <i>uccellini</i> and the netting and shooting which goes on. In time, education may teach them.<lb/>
It is reported that the RSPB has lately had a report from an expert committee on the "edge effect"&#x2014;the effect of forestry on bird populations at the edge of plantations. Press reports say that the report casts great doubt on the RSPB's former understanding of this matter, and it would be as well if the report were to be published by it. If its former understanding of that point were found to be inaccurate, the RSPB would gain great kudos from admitting that its views had changed. We should base all these value judgments on the evidence of expert and scientific research.<lb/>
Let us take acidification, which has been mentioned. It is a huge problem. The latest research, which I and other Members of your Lordships' House were privileged to see the other day portrayed by the Welsh Water Authority, shows that the water run-off from conifer forests is more acid than the run-off from bare moorland. To alleviate the problem, the Forestry Commission has issued instructions about keeping such planting away from watercourses. Other steps have also been taken.<lb/>
Timber Growers (UK), of which I am at present chairman, has also issued a code of practice to achieve the same improvements in the private sector. The real cause of acid rain, as others of your Lordships have said, is the sulphur and other muck which for years has been gushing from the timbers of industry. Very few people have criticised that. I welcome the start that the Government have made in finding money to improve that matter. However, it is a long-term problem and it is heavy industry, rather than forestry, which is the prime cause. Here again, the efforts which must be made could over a long time eventually improve our heritage.<lb/>
I say on behalf of the timber growers that we have created the Minet award for the best woodland managed for commercial and conservation objectives. It is rewarded by the presentation of the Dulverton Flagon as its first prize. I do not see the noble Lord in his place, but I am sure that he is here in spirit.<lb/>
Let us take the work of the national parks, which has already been referred to. Country parks, camping sites, chalets in the forests, nature trails, footpaths, bridle paths and paths in the woods for the blind all add, as other noble Lords have said, to a continual improvement in our heritage. Let us not forget the great contribution made by voluntary organisations.<lb/>
Being a forester, I must also talk about the work of foresters, both state and private. Since 1919, not only have they created a viable industry that is attracting
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0352"/>
<col>687</col>
investment from overseas, but over 40,000 jobs in the countryside are now found in that industry. I welcome the recent policy statement on forestry targets and farm forestry as sensible guidelines for the future, although I think that the Treasury will have to cough up a good deal more money if the target is to be reached.<lb/>
Forestry has made a great contribution to our heritage, and by co-operating with the NCC and other bodies in many areas it must be admitted that advance has been made. The noble Lord, Lord Buxton, talked about the flow country. I shall not go into the details of the problem which I readily admit exists, but the action of the Secretary of State for Scotland who has said that any planting in the flow country will take place now only after discussions between the Forestry Commission and the NCC is a great step forward. That should complete what the noble Lord told us today about that area.<lb/>
Finally, I wish to say a word for those who live and work in the countryside and who have cared for it for generations. I quote from the Countryside Commission for Scotland:
<quote>"It behoves those who seek to promote conservation policies to bear in mind all the time that, without the conviction and practical support of those who earn their living on the land and are directly responsible for it, no conservation policies are likely to succeed.".</quote>
How true&#x0021; Without the willing co-operation of those people, none of the improvements in the quality of our heritage can be achieved. That voluntary principle was recognised when the Wildlife and Countryside Act was debated in both Houses and became law.<lb/>
We all have a part to play in conservation&#x2014;to make Britain a better place. Only then can we hope to influence those other countries which lag behind.</membercontribution></p>

I too would like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, for giving us this timely opportunity to debate the environment.<lb/>
It has taken a long time for the present consensus on the importance of the environment to be reached. In 1962 when I was in Washington, I got to know Stewart Udall who was President Kennedy's Secretary of the Interior. He was then one of the few politicians who took a real interest in the environment. I remember at dinner in my house that we spent a great deal of the night trying to persuade the late Hugh Gaitskell that there was political mileage in conservation. Nowadays I think that everyone knows that there is.<lb/>
The other day I received, as other noble Lords will have done, a glossy pamphlet from Shell, extolling what the oil industry has done in the field of conservation. I contrasted that with a visit that I paid to Shell with some of my colleagues in the early 1960s when Shell Chemicals' executives sought to persuade us that Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i> was nonsense. Well, it was not. But happily, attitudes have changed in politics and in industry.<lb/>
In the 25 years since then, as we all know, immense damage has been done to our environment in Britain.<lb/>
<col>688</col>
But, if we go about it in a common sense way, we now have a chance of reversing the trend, not only in this country but throughout Europe.<lb/>
We have reached the point where there is general agreement in Europe that we cannot go on generating vast agricultural surpluses at enormous cost. All the talk now, as the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, pointed out, is of set-aside, low-input farming, alternative crops or what is known as the policy of 'conifers and caravans'.<lb/>
What is important is to ensure that, now that radical changes in the pattern of agriculture are being forced upon us, environmental considerations should at last be given their full weight, and that we should no longer merely subsidise overproduction but link grants to environmental and social needs. Environmentally sensitive areas are a modest but useful start. But it is the whole countryside which needs sensitive handling, not just a few special sites.<lb/>
There should be no more taking of chalk downs, wetlands, moorlands and old broadleaved woodlands to grow food which no one needs. Not only that; we must not merely halt but should reverse the process. We should put back the chalk downs to grass, re-flood some of the wetlands and plant more native, broadleaved trees. We must also take a much stronger line over agricultural pollution. Silage and slurry effluent are damaging our streams and the life in them. I hope that Her Majesty's new Inspectorate of Pollution and the water authorities will pay attention and that offenders will be prosecuted.<lb/>
We need an end to the excessive use of chemicals. I was very much struck by what the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, said about nitrogen in this House on 21st January. I am sorry that what seemed to me to be his sensible suggestions were dismissed by the Government.<lb/>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food now has a responsibility to consider environmental aspects. Indeed, it has acknowledged that. But not everyone in that great empire has caught up. I have a high regard for ADAS and for its work in our part of Wales. But the latest ADAS <i>Powys Digest</i>, which we have received this month, has an article called:
<quote>"Sulphuric acid&#x2014;the cheap silage additive".</quote>
It says that the number of brands sold has increased to 17 and that the cheapest is waste acid from industry, such as battery acid, which is extremely corrosive and dangerous to handle. That type of thing puts off consumers of agricultural products just as they are put off by what they read about growth hormones and the misuse of antibiotics. There has been a sharp reduction in the consumption of red meat. At big supermarkets, like Waitrose, organically-grown vegetables are now specially labelled in response to public demand.<lb/>
Agriculture is not the only culprit. There are developments that gives cause for concern. For instance, there are over 30 threatened barrages on rivers such as the Severn, the Mersey, the Taff and the Humber, which may have a devastating effect on birds and possible migrant fish. Ski developments in the Highlands, although very desirable in some places, may, if not carefully watched, affect bird life there. The case for protecting the countryside and the environment is overwhelming. However, we can only put
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0353"/>
<col>689</col>
things right if we tackle the problem more vigorously and with a greater sense of urgency, first and foremost here at home, but also in Europe, and wherever we can make our influence felt in the world.<lb/>
We are on the eve of a general election. I should therefore like to end by quoting a leading article which appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 29th August last year, which was entitled "Politics of conservation". It said:
<quote>"If 'green' issues play a large role in the next election the Labour and Alliance parties will have to convince voters that their substantial programmes are not just vote-catching rhetoric but could and would be implemented; the Conservatives will have to explain their very late interest in the subject &#x2026;On one set of issues &#x2026; all parties would need to be resolutely convincing: their determination to control agriculture, conifer forestry and land drainage".</quote>
That is the end of the quotation but I might add that at the end of the leading article the <i>Financial Times</i> pointed out that the Conservative Party had more individual members than the individual members of the other three major parties put together but that their numbers were still less than those belonging to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03232"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should also like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman. I was driving, I think last Friday, on the Surrey-Sussex borders. I was looking at the surrounding green trees and thinking that there was absolutely nothing wrong with England; it was so mind-blowingly beautiful. I had to draw myself up short and remind myself that there were, as my noble friend Lord Buxton said, issues such as The Flows of Sutherland, the ruined Dorset Downs, and the hedges and ditches which have been removed from the finest hunting country in England.<lb/>
It seems to me that the greatest threat to our environment at the moment is the problem of surpluses. The noble Lord, Lord Moran, spoke about this issue just now. By using chemical and plant-breeding methods I believe that we can double yields of corn per acre from what we have at the moment. Saudi Arabians are exporting wheat. I did not know this fact until the other day when I met someone who is in the wheat business. They exported a large tonnage of wheat. It cost them about &#x00A3;800 a tonne to grow. They sell it at &#x00A3;36 a tonne but they like to do so because it is a way of spending some of their oil money. Anyone can grow wheat now, given the right financial support and the correct tools to do so. We are in danger of churning out infinitely large amounts of feed grain which nobody knows what to do with.<lb/>
I shudder to think what will happen if Mr. Gorbachev manages to turn Russia back into what it was in the days of Tsar Nicholas II: a grain exporting nation. At the moment they are the only buyers of surplus wheat on the world market. Not only are these surpluses threatening everyone's environment but they are ruining third world agriculture. As I have said, anyone can grow wheat but there must be some price that one has to be paid for it. If the Community and the United States of America are dumping wheat on the market which has a subsidy of approximately &#x00A3;86 a tonne we shall ruin third world agriculture. Third world agriculture can easily pull itself up by its
<col>690</col>
bootstraps. It does not need aid. It has only to be shown what can be done in the Punjab. The green Punjab area of India is now flourishing. In the Punjab area of Pakistan they are still being incompetent and are not growing wheat properly. Anyone can grow wheat; it is a question of getting their act together. I suggest that the famines in East Africa are helped by God and made certain by man.<lb/>
This brings me back to the damage that these surpluses can do to the countryside of Great Britain. Unless we plan for the rundown of food production in the United Kingdom and Europe&#x2014;and I am afraid that this then goes on to link not only with Europe, but with the United States of America and Australia&#x2014;it also means opening up the Japanese food market. Your Lordships may have seen an article in the <i>Economist</i> about two weeks ago on the question of Japanese land use. Their governing party is based on small farmers who are subsidised. One can buy rice in America f.o.b. at 136 dollars a tonne and it costs 2,000 dollars a tonne in Japan. This is how to ruin things. This is a global problem and has to be attacked globally.<lb/>
However, we return to this question. What do we do with England's green and pleasant land?&#x2014;because, by golly, it is still green and pleasant in England especially at this time of the year. I suggest that the way we do this&#x2014;it is perhaps a hobby-horse of mine&#x2014;is that we pay farmers to be gardeners and gamekeepers instead of producing food. What the farming or land-owning world has done is exactly what the public and Parliament have asked them to do. Because there were U-boats in the Channel and because we thought the world was going to starve we were told to go and produce food, and we did so. We did it superbly efficiently and superby well. What I would hope that the Government will say to us now is, "Thank you, farmers. You have done absolutely splendidly. We now want to change your remit. The countryside of England is marvellous. We want you to grow food, not by having grants to cut out hedges, but in a way that is attractive and we shall pay you to manage the landscape".<lb/>
It seems to me that there are two uses for grants. One is to create wealth. I am not convinced about the value of grants to create wealth; but I am convinced about the value of grants with which to do nice things. Most of us like the idea of going out to earn money; that is a good thing. We then like to spend our money on something that is pleasant and civilised. I suggest that it is reasonable, with the growth economy that we have in this country, with the surplus in FEOGA funds, to say, "We have created the wealth and now let us use some of that wealth to look after this very precious asset&#x2014;the European, English, Scottish and Welsh countryside."<lb/>
There have been methods put forward to start this process. One may say to a farmer, "We want you to keep your dry-stone walls. We want you to plant small copses, hedges and cut and ley them. We want you to grow old meadow grasses." Let us take some of those Dorset Downs which have all been ploughed up&#x2014;perfectly reasonably, because the U-boats were in the Channel and we needed the food and wheat. One might say, "Instead of paying you &#x00A3;86 a tonne subsidy on feed wheat to grow 2&#x00BD; to 3 tonnes of wheat on
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0354"/>
<col>691</col>
Dorset Downs" (because that is the net subsidy on feed grain) "we shall pay you to put 2&#x00BD; sheep per acre on that land and to put it down to an old ley with lots of wild flowers and so on." The country would save money, the countryside would be prettier and we should hit at surpluses. That seems a very good combination.<lb/>
There is one matter on conservation about which we have to worry. I am president of a canal preservation society in Surrey and Hampshire. After 19 years' hard work we have practically re-opened this 18th century canal. Lo and behold, the Nature Conservancy Council has said that if we put any boats on it we shall ruin all the water life. This is an interesting example of a clash between two totally legitimate conservation interests.<lb/>
That is outside the remit of my speech and I have gone slightly over time. I shall finish with the delicious thought of the cure for unemployment of the noble Earl, Lord Swinton, which is reproduction troughs for virgins' blood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03233">6.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03234"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, on arranging for the subject to be debated this evening. I should like to contribute a word or two about the marine environment. To mark the European Year of the Environment, an international organisation, the Advisory Committee on Pollution of the Sea, known generally by the acronym ACOPS, is organising an international conference later this year. The organisation started in Britain. Its headquarters is still here though it is now widespread and has members in many countries. I should explain that I am speaking on this matter because I have suddenly become the acting chairman again for unexpected and sad reasons. I was acting chairman for a year and a half before the late John Silkin became chairman. His untimely death has deprived us not only of a friend and able parliamentarian but also of his leadership in ACOPS. I was asked to become acting chairman again as the time for the conference was approaching.<lb/>
There are some achievements to record in the progress of reducing marine pollution. It has been steady but not as rapid as some of us would have wished. Regarding oil, the international conventions, combined with practice and policing which have improved, have had this effect. Deliberate operational creation of oil slicks through cleaning oily ballast out of tanks at sea is now much less common. For accidental and casual spills, vigilance and discipline are essential and must be sustained. Of course navigational disasters like the "Amoco Cadiz" could still occur but in Britain we are much better prepared and our neighbours are also.<lb/>
Other causes of marine pollution such as toxic chemicals must have our attention. In this area, part of what is known as the MARPOL Convention has recently come into force. It is not enough, however, to conclude international agreements; it is necessary to have the facilities at ports to put the intentions in the agreements into effect, such as facilities for disposing of chemical waste. Two other sources of pollution
<col>692</col>
must be controlled, effluents from rivers and refuse from shipping thrown overboard which makes unpleasant litter on the coastline and spoils beaches.<lb/>
Turning from the marine to other parts of our environment, there are some measures on which there is general agreement but they cost money. There is the conversion to unleaded petrol by stages and reducing pollution emissions from coal-fired power stations. I am glad to see that there has recently been an announcement from the Central Electricity Generating Board which operates in England and Wales that it is to spend &#x00A3;170 million over the next 10 years. No one wants to make electricity more expensive but the control of pollution is a common end. Then there is control of the effects of the use of nitrates and other substances in agriculture. Here the aim must be to avoid penalising particular farmers or adding to the price of food.<lb/>
The Motion calls attention to the case for all-party support. It comes at a time when, unfortunately, for the next four weeks the areas where the political parties disagree are likely to be more emphasised than the ones on which they agree. Some months ago the SDP announced that it was proposing that there should be a new Ministry for environmental protection. The noble Baroness mentioned it again today. I have a question here as well as a word of caution. Will its scope include Scotland? It appeared from everything the noble Baroness said&#x2014;and I did not want to interrupt her in a limited debate&#x2014;that she was speaking about England and Wales.<lb/>
The word of caution I have is that a similar Ministry was announced before the 1964 general election and was set up by the Labour Party when it became the Labour Government. That was the Ministry for Land and natural Resources. Many people will now have forgotten about it. The Ministry lasted for only two years and was then wound up. During 1964&#x2013;65 when I was in another place I was questioning the Prime Minister of the day and other Ministers with a number of points. I asked in particular whether it covered Scotland. At first the answers were not at all clear. Then the answer eventually came through, no. That meant that more than one-third of all the land resources in Britain were not included, although the intention had been that this Ministry should exercise overall supervision in Britain.<lb/>
I am not suggesting that Scotland should be included in the scope of such a Ministry. I am simply pointing out the difficulties. The Scottish Office and its Ministers have these responsibilities, the equivalent of those exercised for England and Wales by the Department of the Environment. It would be reversing about 60 years of administrative devolution to take them away from the Secretary of State for Scotland, and this is unlikely to appeal to any incoming government. I took the proposal in 1964 and its carrying into effect seriously but I recognised when it disappeared after two years that the role and functions of the new Ministry had not been properly thought out beforehand.<lb/>
There are international problems which we should be considering in this year&#x2014;acid rain; the damage to the ozone layer of the atmosphere, the layer which protects us from dangerous radiation; possible damage
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0355"/>
<col>693</col>
to life from what is known as the greenhouse effect. Noble Lords will remember that I have put these points at Question Time in recent months. None of these problems seems to have obvious solutions yet and we shall have to co-operate with other countries in trying to find them.<lb/>
There are also international problems which fall within the sovereign territories of particular countries where we cannot interfere. I refer, first, to the spreading of deserts, with the Sahara the particular one in mind, and, secondly, to the clearing on a massive scale of forests in Latin America. Here I applaud the recent statement by the World Bank that in future it will include some conditions in loans to countries concerned, with the object of protecting the environment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03235">6.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03236"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there seems to be a certain irony in the fact that we are devoting these last hours of a dying Parliament to debating what is perhaps the most important issue of all facing this nation and the world today. We should all be deeply indebted to my noble friend Lady Stedman for enabling us so to do.<lb/>
When winding up a debate of this kind in a short time, about which I make no complaint&#x2014;I am as anxious to get away as everybody else&#x2014;it is impossible to comment on earlier speeches, which is very sad indeed. The speeches have been of the highest possible quality. Every one has been important and they have all been made by experts in a particular field. Each has shown great credit to the noble Lord or Baroness who made it, and all the speeches collectively have done great credit to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
It is also perhaps unwise at this stage to try to introduce any new themes. I shall therefore content myself merely with trying to underline and emphasise what I believe to be the basic assumptions from the recognition of which policies on these matters should be derived.<lb/>
We face three parallel, related and menacing trends. They are, first, an increasing rate of depletion of the basic, irreplaceable raw materials on which we depend for our lives and for our continued existence on the planet; secondly, an increasing rate of contamination, pollution and destruction of the environment in which we live; and, thirdly, an ever-increasing world population which itself adds to the rate of consumption of scarce resources and the rate of destruction of a fragile environment. I shall say a brief word about each of those trends.<lb/>
On depletion of resources, I point merely to energy and say that our energy resources are at least finite, which means that sooner or later they will run out. It behoves us all to husband and cherish the resources we now have with great care so as to give ourselves enough time to pioneer and develop safe and adequate alternatives.<lb/>
On pollution of the environment I shall look only, as did the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, at our atmosphere and what we are doing to it. There is the phenomenon of acid rain; the problem of lead in the atmosphere from exhaust fumes; the problem of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting
<col>694</col>
in the greenhouse effect, to which the noble Lord referred; the problems of fluorocarbons from aerosols and their effect on the ozone layer which, along with the greenhouse effect, is perhaps resulting in a measurable, gradual and steady increase in the mean average world temperature. I am not predicting that the seas will boil or the rocks will melt; nor am I saying that the Polar icecaps will melt tomorrow; but I do not advise my friends to pay a lot of money for properties at sea level.<lb/>
On population, I can do no better than merely quote from an excellent address given in a committee room here in the Palace of Westminster by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh to a joint meeting of the all-party group on population and development, at which I was present as president of the Birth Control Campaign (a job that I took over from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gardiner), and also to the all-party conservation committee of which the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, is the chairman.<lb/>
His Royal Highness said:
<quote>"I believe that human population pressure&#x2014;the sheer number of people on this planet&#x2014;is the single most important cause of the degradation of the natural environment, of the progressive extinction of wild species of plants and animals, and of the destabilisation of the world's climatic and atmospheric systems".</quote>
I believe that, not for the first time, His Royal Highness was absolutely right. He went on to give some startling figures. I shall not repeat them. I shall just give two more of my own. On my calculations, at the moment the world population is growing by 8,000 an hour, which means that by the end of this debate we shall have added considerably to the burdens that the world has to carry.<lb/>
On recent figures it appears that 50 per cent. of the world's present total population consists of people who are under the age of 15, which is an indication of the potential for explosive growth in population. To those noble Lords who say that this is a matter for the undeveloped world and not for us, I would merely say that the United States of America, with 6 per cent. of the world's population, now consumes more than 50 per cent. of the world's irreplaceable raw materials.<lb/>
In Britain we have special problems. We certainly have a population which is too big for England, and also perhaps too big for Scotland and Wales. We also have a population with an increasing amount of leisure time, with an increasing number of people choosing to spend that leisure in what they call countryside activities.<lb/>
One of the principle challenges facing us at the moment is the provision of opportunities for the constructive and fulfilling use of leisure in ways which are not consumptive of scarce resources and which are not destructive of a fragile environment. We are not doing that. Noble Lords who doubt me should merely pay a visit to the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads during a hot day in the middle of the season to see part of our national and natural heritage being slowly destroyed by the people who love it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, referred to the pressure on the National Parks. When I was chairman of the Countryside Commission we had a visit from the director of the Yellowstone National Park. He told us about his problems and the number of people for
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0356"/>
<col>695</col>
whom his staff had to provide in a year. I was able to tell him that the figure he quoted was almost precisely the figure of the number of people who move into the Peak District National Park on a hot Sunday in August, and he thought that he had problems&#x0021;<lb/>
I have not spelt out remedies and I do not expect the noble Baroness to spell out the remedies. I am not recommending draconian steps like dissolving the pill in water supplies. I am merely concerned that we recognise the problem. So far as population is concerned, if we could ensure that no children are born who were not wanted at the time of conception, we would solve the population problem.<lb/>
I am not expecting the noble Baroness to give all the answers, but I hope that she will tell us that she recognises the problem. I was much impressed years ago by some words of Senator Fulbright. I wrote them down and I shall quote them. He said:
<quote>"When our perceptions fail to keep pace with events; when we refuse to believe something because it displeases or frightens us, or is simply startlingly unfamiliar, then the gap between fact and perception becomes a chasm. Action becomes irrelevant and irrational".</quote>
We are in danger of being in that position.<lb/>
If the noble Baroness can tell us that she recognises all these problems, we shall have partly solved the problem. I hope that in years to come our successors in this Chamber will not be saying, "What on earth were they doing? Didn't they know? Couldn't they see what was happening? Did nobody tell them?" My Lords, we are being told. We should listen, heed, and take action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03237">7.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03238"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, seven minutes is not enough time to deal with what has been an excellent debate, but I happily devote 15 seconds or so to the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, in order to thank her for the opportunity to have the debate. Perhaps I may be forgiven if I single out just one or two things for which I have a particular feeling, particularly Lord Buxton's passionate plea for The Flow country, which I think we should all heed. I should like to add too to Lord Moran's statistics on the RSPB, which were quite telling. I understand that this year they are attracting new members at the rate of 1,000 every week. That should make the political parties think, if nothing else does.<lb/>
I should also like to support the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, in his plea that the water industry be left alone. I know that we had a hectic time over it last year, and it was mainly because of the environmental aspects of it that people got so upset and uptight. The solution to these problems will not be found in the direction that the Government have proposed to go.<lb/>
With what is left of the time I can deal only with perhaps the least interesting but also the most essential part of the debate, which is how we organise the undoubted concern that everyone has for the environment and its protection. How can we translate that concern into action? I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, that the present system will no longer do. We have to face the fact that without exception all government policies have environmental implications. Almost all departmental activities have environ
<col>696</col>
mental effects. The noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, mentioned the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and I am sure she would also include the Department of Agriculture in Scotland, the Department of Energy and the Department of Transport. There is no way that anything they do does not affect the environment.<lb/>
We must try to achieve better co-ordination of the whole range of environmental protection measures. Environmental considerations must be built into the system. We believe, with the noble Baroness, that there must be a ministry of environmental protection and we have created this post in the Shadow Cabinet. I note what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said about the short life of the last one, but that was a more limited brief. Public perception and individual perceptions have changed since then. I have hope that this will be a longer lasting ministry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03239"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will it apply to Scotland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03240"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a limited debate. If I can finish within seven minutes perhaps we can return to that point. In addition, there must be a requirement that environmental considerations should be part of every activity. Every significant action of government or local government&#x2014;because we must not forget the impact that local government has on the environment&#x2014;must be automatically examined for possible environmental consequences to the best of the knowledge which prevails at the time. All major development applications, whether publicly or privately funded, should be required to be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. I believe that this requirement should be introduced now. It is being introduced in 1988 as a result of European Community requirement. But I hope that whichever government are in power after the election will realise that this matter is most important and will introduce it now. Some big developments where this has not been done are going ahead.<lb/>
The Minister who is to reply&#x2014;I do not envy her, except that I should like her 15 minutes&#x2014;will no doubt produce a list of the Government's achievements. At this point I should like to add to the commendations that have been given to the Minister, Mr. Waldegrave. He has done a splendid job and I believe that his heart is in the right place. I do not believe that he has his own way as often as he should but I support his attempts.<lb/>
No doubt the noble Baroness will produce a list of the Government's achievements; for example, the first marine nature reserve, the environmentally sensitive areas and the other designations which have been mentioned. While we welcome what has been achieved and do not wish to take away from it in any way, I emphasise yet again that if the facts are taken in isolation from a more general, positive approach to environmental detection their value is greatly reduced.<lb/>
Past and present policies of this Government&#x2014;I hope not future&#x2014;show a disregard for the generality of protection. We are faced with a programme which would in the long run leave us with a few isolated museums of the countryside in a landscape of commercial development. It could even be argued,
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0357"/>
<col>697</col>
given the lack of sympathy in other policies, that creation of these special areas diverts public pressure and in the end defeats what should be our main objective.<lb/>
Finally, we must remember, as has been said by other noble Lords this evening, that we are part of a very small planet which is at risk. Though this evening we may have been talking primarily about our own environmental protection, we must remember that everything we do affects our neighbours. We do not have the best reputation in European terms, but as the years go on I hope that we shall do something to improve that situation. I leave your Lordships with a less exalted quotation than others which have been given this evening. It comes from my grandmother who, after all, was a Victorian. She quoted often to us as children a Victorian tract which showed a picture of chubby faced Victorian children sweeping the village street. Underneath it read:
<quote>"If each before his own door swept the village would be clean".</quote>
This applies in environmental protection more than in anything else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03241">7.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03242"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by saying that as always on these occasions this has been a wide-ranging and most fascinating debate. I should like to emphasise that protection of our environment is a continuing government commitment. We are keen that the nations of Europe should put into practice the policies which we collectively develop. I believe that we need not be ashamed of our record. Alone among member states&#x2014;apart from those most recently joined&#x2014;the United Kingdom has never been taken to the European Court of Justice for failing to implement a European Community directive on the environment.<lb/>
Your Lordships will be aware, I am sure, that the European Year of the Environment has two principal aims. The first is to raise awareness of the importance of environmental protection so that better progress can be made in conserving and improving the environment. The fact that this debate is taking place today is an example of such a raising of awareness. We are grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Stedmen, for both introducing the debate and emphasising this point, admittedly in relation to government departments. I can assure her and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, that in addition to the commitment of the Department of Environment to the European Year of the Environment, other departments are also making contributions.<lb/>
For example, the Overseas Development Administration has produced a booklet entitled <i>The Environment and the British Aid Programme</i>. The Department of Transport is preparing a booklet entitled <i>Transport and the Environment</i>. The Ministry of Defence is involved with the army training areas clean-up week in July and the Department of Education and Science is organising a project on the use of school grounds for environmental teaching. The Scottish, Northern Ireland and Welsh Offices are supporting financially the organisation of the European Year of the Environment. We are moving in the right direction, albeit slowly, and I hope that that reassures all noble Lords who have had qualms on the subject.<lb/>
<col>698</col>
The other main aim of the EYE is to carry out projects in support of an awareness campaign which will have lasting effects. The personal support given to the year by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is a great encouragement to all involved. The year enjoys the support of all political parties, a fact that has been welcomed in the course of this debate. I understand that the committee has already heard of nearly 1,000 events and projects which are taking place under the EYE banner. They involve schools, youth organisations, local authorities, industry, business and voluntary groups of all kinds, and of course government departments. That is exactly the kind of all-sector involvement called for by the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman.<lb/>
The Department of the Environment, for instance, is sponsoring a number of events, including the new better environment awards for industry and a handbook on community environmental policy. We were also a major sponsor of the recent and very successful International Pollution Abatement Fair and Conference at Birmingham. Other departments are also making contributions, some of which I have already enumerated.<lb/>
I should like to draw attention to the Government's commitment to the protection of the countryside and the environment which has perhaps been the main topic of the debate. In so doing I hope that I shall be responding to a number of points which have been raised. We remain firmly committed to protecting green belt land from inappropriate development. It is worth remembering that since 1979 the area of approved green belt in England has more than doubled. I have noted the request made by my noble friend Lord Nugent in this respect. In another place we have introduced the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Bill, which has been referred to. This aims to create for the first time a properly integrated authority with powers and functions for the management by both the waterways and the land space. The Bill will be coming to your Lordships' House in due course. In view of his remarks, I feel sure that it will be particularly welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley.<lb/>
The Government fully recognise the need to protect the countryside for its own sake. We firmly believe that a strong and efficient rural economy is the best protection. The farming and rural enterprise package which we launched in March has been genuinely welcomed for achieving a reasonable balance among farming, economic and social needs, conservation and enjoyment by the public.<lb/>
I noted the suggestion for further action made by my noble friend Lord Onslow. My noble friend Lord Swinton referred to the common land forum. We have recently reached the end of the consultation period on the recommendations of the forum. I know that the Moorland Association in particular has expressed concern about the effect of the access proposals on heather moorland and the lack of restriction for game purposes in the proposed model scheme for management. I can assure my noble friend that the Government are well aware of those concerns. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale has already discussed their worries with the delegation. My honourable friend William Waldegrave agreed at a meeting at
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0358"/>
<col>699</col>
Bolton Abbey last week that there should be further detailed meetings at official levels.<lb/>
Turning to the question of adequate funding, a concern expressed by a number of your Lordships, the Government's commitment to the countryside is clear from the increased resources which they have made available to the agencies charged with its protection. Grant in aid to the Countryside Commission, for example, has risen from &#x00A3;11.2 million in 1982&#x2013;83 to &#x00A3;19.5 million for the current financial year. The supplementary grant to national parks in England has increased from &#x00A3;5 million to &#x00A3;7.3 million in the same period and perhaps I might particularly draw the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, to that fact. These are both very substantial increases in real terms.<lb/>
The Department of the Environment also has a &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million programme of research on countryside affairs and the Nature Conservancy Council funding has increased from &#x00A3;8 million in 1979&#x2013;80 to &#x00A3;36.5 million in the current year. Therefore I trust your Lordships will not feel quite as anxious on this particular aspect as appeared in the course of the debate.<lb/>
As has been said, without wildlife in its many forms our countryside, and our cities and towns too, would be poorer and meaner places. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 now protects many hundreds of our animals, birds and plants. It also gave the Nature Conservancy Council new powers to protect habitat through the creation of national nature reserves and sites of special scientific interest which have already been referred to. The Act is based on the principle of voluntary co-operation and partnership in the countryside between the statutory agencies, farmers and the voluntary conservation movement. We designated Britain's first statutory marine nature reserve at Lundy last November. I have to say that to satisfy the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol&#x0021; Several more such reserves are expected to be designated over the next few years. I recognise the points made, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, in this respect. I can also reassure the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that the Government are well aware of calls from some quarters for a change in the status of the national park committees. This would require legislation and could not be considered without recourse to a detailed review of the administration in national parks. The Government decided against such a review in 1981 and do not feel that decision should be reversed as yet.<lb/>
The noble Lord also considered that national parks should be the statutory authority for development plans. We see no reason for a change in this system, but in any case it would not be considered without an administrative review to which I referred earlier.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Buxton, and others, spoke about the problems of blanket conifer afforestation. The Government share this concern, which stems from policies of earlier years. Certainly we are in total agreement when it comes to the development and adoption of sylvicultural practices which minimise the adverse impacts of forestry on the environment. We already have well-established guidelines and mechanisms in place to ensure that forestry developments take place in harmony with nature conservation. I can assure the House that efforts are
<col>700</col>
now being made to ensure that all new forestry schemes are designed not only to fit in with the landscape but to ensure that planting schemes do not harm the surrounding environment and that a balance is reached with other land-use interests. However, I have taken careful note of my noble friend's remarks and those of all the other speakers who have referred to this. I shall particularly bring them to the attention of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale.<lb/>
Turning now to other aspects of environmental protection, we are aware of the particular problems posed by chloro-fluorocarbons and this is one of the matters which will be discussed in Brussels at the Council of Ministers' meeting scheduled for the 21st May. I can assure the House that the United Kingdom is by no means holding back the development of a European Community policy; nor are we isolated within the Community on this complex issue, as seemed to be suggested perhaps by the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby. The noble Lord, Lord Craigton, also referred to this point. We are also contributing to international efforts such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Climate Programme in considering the implications of CFCs and the ozone layer for national policies.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03244"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid there is very little time and I cannot give way: there may be time at the end of the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Gibson, asked what will replace structure plans. Our proposals for replacement of the cumbersome process of structure planning were established last year. I cannot describe them in detail now because of time constraints, but I can assure the noble Lord that district councils will not be left without guidance from the county councils on the key issue of planning.<lb/>
The formation of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution on 1st April presented a concentration of resources which will be deployed as the organisation develops in a co-ordinated approach to pollution control. I hope this will reassure those noble Lords who have expressed concern about monitoring and implementation. In particular, I am addressing the anxiety of my noble friend Lord Nugent. I can assure him that the Government's firm objective is to maintain and improve water policy and the HMIP will discuss the performance of individual sewage treatment works with the authorities concerned. The Government take compliance very seriously and expect all works to meet their consent conditions.<lb/>
At the International Pollution Abatement Fair in Birmingham, my honourable friend William Waldegrave&#x2014;and I am most grateful to all those who have paid tribute to his undoubted commitment in this area&#x2014;launched the environmental protection technology scheme. This will aim to encourage innovation in the field of pollution abatement and cleaner technologies generally. We are committed to ensuring the widespread availability of unleaded petrol well before the European Communities' deadline in 1989 and we intend that newly registered cars should be capable of running on unleaded petrol by October 1990.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0359"/>
<col>701</col>
Some further matters are worth mentioning, particularly since we, as a country, are taking a lead in this area. I feel that this should be recognised. Next month our agreement with the Paintmakers' Association will reach full fruition when lead will cease to be added to all decorative paints made by its members. We have also taken strong action to control the use of anti-fouling paints for boats based on tributyl tin. That has been shown to damage shellfish and other sensitive marine organisms&#x2014;a concern which has been expressed in the course of this debate. We are taking the initiative on this particular matter within the European Community to ensure that we carry our partners with us in both these actions on paint.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Gibson-Watt referred to the problems of acidity, and others also referred to this point. The Government fully share the widespread concern about acid rain and accept the need for action to tackle the problem. Emissions of air pollutants from the United Kingdom have already fallen substantially since 1970 and the Government are aiming to achieve a 30 per cent. reduction on the 1980 levels by the end of the 1990s. Emissions will fall even more dramatically after the turn of the century as new "low-acid" technology comes into play. Last September the Government authorised the CEGB to instal flue gas desulphurisation equipment at three major power stations and announced that all new coal-fired stations would require to be fitted with appropriate technology to remove sulphur emissions.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy welcomed the fact that last week the Government took a further significant step in authorising the CEGB to begin a major 10-year programme to instal low nitrogen oxide burners at the board's 12 largest power stations. Low NOx burner technology will also be a requirement for all future fossil-fuel fired power stations. These measures mean that we are now in the forefront of European countries taking positive action to reduce emissions. The Government have a substantial research programme and will be guided by the research work in considering further policy options.<lb/>
Every one of these topics deserves treatment at much greater length than has been possible today. I have not even got on to the points on villages which were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Henniker, nor the specific schemes referred to by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, that the Government recognise the problems and will take note of the many points that have been made in the course of this important debate. We believe that care for the environment transcends regional and political divisions, as the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, indicated in the wording of her Motion.<lb/>
I am sure that your Lordships will join me in applauding and supporting the aims and activities of the European Year of the Environment, which I have no doubt will make a major impact, raising further the public's awareness and their concern for our common environment and our common heritage of the future.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Motor Cycle Noise Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03249">7.31 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03250"><member>Lord Bottomley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
I must congratulate the honourable gentleman the Member for Christchurch on presenting the Motor Cycle Noise Bill and piloting it successfully through the other place. He asked for my asssistance, which was readily given, in seeking support for the Bill in your Lordships' House. The Minister of Transport, Mr. Peter Bottomley, supported the Bill on behalf of the Government. He made some amusing comments about our sharing the same surname. It is my privilege to count as friends his mother and father. I worked with Sir James Bottomley, who was an outstanding and distinguished diplomat in the old Dominions Office and in the Commonwealth Relations Office. I am glad to be associated with his son in asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill.<lb/>
The purpose of the Bill is to control the quality of replacement exhaust systems and silencers in motor cycles when they are offered for sale. The House will be aware that legislation already exists to control motor cycle noise but that it is difficult to catch the users of noisy machines. There is now a British standard for motor cycle exhausts and the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to require replacements to be marked with a standard number or with the words "Not for road use". All silencers offered for sale will have to bear some marking. The Bill is not dealing with the initial equipment that is supplied on new motor cycles but with replacement exhausts that are deliberately designed to create as much noise as possible.<lb/>
The motor cycle fraternity as a whole is composed of very responsible members of our society. Motor
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0360"/>
<col>703</col>
cycling gives them a sense of adventure and mobility which is to be encouraged. This Bill is aimed at the minority who cause social nuisance and annoyance to others. Deliberately exacerbated noise from motor cycles causes much disturbance to those who go out for a gentle stroll during the summer and it annoys those who are resting in their homes. The Bill attempts to deal with noise that is deliberately made. It is aimed at those motor cyclists who set out to make as much noise as possible. Its provisions will in no way interfere with the normal everyday activities of motor cyclists.<lb/>
The Motor Cycle Association is in favour of the Bill and the British Motorcyclists' Federation also supports it. It will benefit not only those who are fit and have good hearing but also those who are less fit, hard of hearing or blind. The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association also hopes that the law will be strengthened as a result of the passage of this Motor Cycle Noise Bill. There has also been support from local authorities.<lb/>
The enforcement of the provisions of the Bill will be by trading standard officers employed by local authorities. At present enforcement of the law dealing with noisy exhaust systems is the responsibility of the police, who have the almost impossible task of chasing offenders round the towns and countryside. Relieved of those duties, the police will have greater opportunities to concentrate on other forms of crime. I commend the Bill to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03251">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Bottomley</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03252">7.37 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03253"><member>Lord Strathcarron</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support this Bill wholeheartedly. I have been riding motor cycles for 47 years and I normally come to your Lordships' House on two wheels. Motor cycling is the last freedom of the road; traffic and parking problems disappear like magic, journeys take a fraction of the time that they do by any other form of transport; and I believe that motor cyclists should be appreciated by other road users for taking up so little space on our crowded roads.<lb/>
However, I am afraid that the motor cyclist is unpopular. In part, this is due to the irresponsible antics of some dispatch riders in London who weave in and out of traffic with their radios blaring, frightening everybody&#x2014;possibly including themselves. I should like to mention that the number of motor cycle accidents has decreased steadily over the past 10 years. In the past year alone motor cyclists are the one category of road user in which the number of accidents have actually gone down.<lb/>
Noise is the main complaint about motor cycles. The exhaust systems that are fitted by the manufacturers are commendably quiet. Strangely enough, the larger the motor cycle normally the quieter it is. My own four-cylinder BMW is as quiet-running as any car. Motor cycles are nowadays very expensive machines. Prices range from about &#x00A3;300 for a modest moped up to &#x00A3;5,000 or more for larger motor bikes.<lb/>
Unfortunately, spare parts are also expensive, particularly exhaust systems. A young rider will often
<col>704</col>
use all his available money to buy a machine, often without regard to any additional expense for accident repairs or spare parts. Therefore when the exhaust needs replacing he is hard pressed to find the money to buy the manufacturer's system, so he buys what appears to be a similar one from a motor cycle shop at a very much lower price. Only when it is fitted does the rider discover that it makes more noise. He may not have intended it to make more noise, and he certainly could not afford to change it afterwards. I must admit that there are riders who tamper with the exhaust of their motor cycles in order to make more noise, in the usually mistaken belief that the performance will be better. Unfortunately, these machines are often low-powered and of small capacity so it takes a long time for the noise to pass one by.<lb/>
Some of your Lordships may have attended the demonstration put on by the Institute of Motorcycling in 1985, at which the difference between the exhausts supplied by the manufacturers and the unofficial ones was all too plain. It is often suggested that the police should stop motor cyclists and measure the degree of noise, but to do this requires very expensive equipment in large quantities, which would be totally impracticable. It is far better to prohibit the sale of exhaust systems which do not meet the required standards. For this reason, I support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03254">7.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03255"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in following the noble Lord, Lord Strathcarron, I cannot claim the motor cycling experience that he has. In fact, in the long distant days when I was young and active my preference was to belong to a pedal cycling club. The noble Lord, Lord Strathcarron, has put forward sound reasons for supporting my noble friend in bringing this Bill forward. I congratulate and thank my noble friend and also Mr. Robert Adley in the other place who sponsored the Bill originally. My noble friend Lady Nicol reminded me that there is one aspect of pollution which was not mentioned in the last two-and-a-half hour debate and that was noise pollution, which is what this Bill seeks to eradicate in one respect.<lb/>
Many of the motorcyclists coming down my road have tampered with their exhaust systems and, although we can control the exhaust noise of new machines, there is a gap as regards replacement exhausts. But this Bill will get to grips with that replacement problem.<lb/>
I am glad that both my noble friend Lord Bottomley and the noble Lord, Lord Strathcarron, emphasised that this is not a Bill hitting at motor cyclists. I have never been a motor cyclist and, as I said, was a pedal cyclist, but I recognise that a vast number of people enjoy their motor cycling. We see them in the Highlands and elsewhere thoroughly enjoying their pursuits.<lb/>
I wonder whether I may mention two points. Noble Lords receive, as I do, a copy of the journal <i>Motor Cycling</i>. There is an article in the current issue stating that unless motorcyclists wish to have more harsh laws, they should put their own house in order by refusing to buy illegal systems, by not tampering with exhausts to make them noisier and by replacing them promptly when they cease to function properly. That is the attitude of responsible motorcyclists.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0361"/>
<col>705</col>
I should like to give an example of why, although some of them weave in and out and have a high accident rate, we should not regard all motorcyclists as if they are in the same category. My daughter is chairman of the Social Services Committee of Nottinghamshire County Council. At Christmas a local motor cycling club arranged a special event and no less than 200 motor cyclists decorated their machines and rode through Nottingham City carrying a toy to be presented to children in the care of the Social Services Committee. The same thing happened at Easter, when there was a vast number of motor cyclists carrying Easter eggs to homes where children were in care. I mention that because we must not classify all motor cyclists together. There is a vast number of good motor cyclists who will welcome this measure against pollution, which will assist decent motor cyclists who wish to ride properly.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03257"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should very warmly like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, for having brought this Bill before your Lordships this evening. I should also like to pay tribute to my honourable friend the Member for Christchurch for having introduced the Bill in another place. After what we have heard this evening, there is very little left for me to say about this Bill, because it has been so well described by the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, and so warmly supported by my noble friend Lord Strathcarron and the noble Lord, Lord Underhill.<lb/>
We all know that noisy motor cycles are a cause of distress to a great many people. Many of these machines are equipped with inadequate exhausts, and this Bill aims to ensure that replacement silencers for motorcycles meet the required standards. Mention has been made of deliberately tampering with motorcycle exhausts to make them noisier. I can only say that that is an offence under existing legislation. The police do their best to prosecute where possible; but, as has been mentioned this evening, it is not easy. I can only endorse what has been said by other noble Lords, that responsible motorcycling organisations condemn this practice. We as a government equally condemn it, as it is indeed an offence.<lb/>
The Government most warmly support this Bill and hope that it will become law very shortly. We shall not have to go through the normal procedures. I do not think that would have been necessary anyway, because I do not think there is any conceivable amendment that could have been necessary. Once again, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Bottomley, for having brought this Bill forward.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Protection of Animals (Penalties) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03261">7.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03262"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill was piloted through the other place by Mr. Harry Greenway, the honourable Member for Ealing North, who had two previous attempts with a similar measure. The first attempt in 1985, prompted by his enthusiasm to crush the villains who promote dogfights, involved a Bill with penalties of &#x00A3;10,000 and 10 years in gaol. That was no good; the Government realised that the penalties were far too heavy. Cases would also have had to be tried in Crown Courts rather than in magistrates' courts. The position would have been hopeless because the Crown Courts would have been so clogged up. Under the existing Bill such cases can be tried in magistrates' courts.<lb/>
This is an excellent Bill. If it is passed, the present fine of &#x00A3;1,000 will be increased. That is equivalent to Level 4 on the standard scale, or three months' imprisonment, or both. The present Bill will double that. The fine proposed is &#x00A3;2,000; that is Level 5 or six months' imprisonment, or both.<lb/>
The Bill was originally entitled the Dog Fighting Penalties Bill. The reason for that title was that Mr. Greenway was concentrating on this atrocious custom&#x2014;one cannot call it a sport or a pastime&#x2014;which appears to be on the increase. However, it was thought to be far more useful if a Protection of Animals Bill was introduced which imposed penalties with regard to the ill-treatment of any animal. Under the terms of the Bill cruelty to any captive or domestic animal, which is considered to be extremely serious, can lead to the perpetrator of that cruelty being fined up to the maximum.<lb/>
I shall now go back about 150 years to show how dog fighting came to pass. The baiting of animals 150 years ago was carried out chiefly with bulls and hears. It was made illegal principally because the bull often got loose and tossed the spectators. It would also toss dogs severely harming and often killing them. However, when such baiting was made illegal, dog fighting came into practice.<lb/>
I consider dog fighting a greater evil than cockfighting, although both have been illegal for a long time. After all, the dog has been man's companion for thousands of years. The Egyptian pharaohs worshipped the pharaoh hound as a god up to 5000 BC. Apart from being a lovable animal, one could not farm sheep without dogs, especially in wild country. Guide dogs help the blind. And the police use dogs. Therefore, the dog occupies a superior position to the game cock. A game cock is bred purely for fighting, despite the fact that this has been illegal for a long time.<lb/>
The dog is an extremely useful animal, a great companion, and brings enjoyment to many people. In the last five or six years, however, dog fighting has come back into vogue. It appeared to die out at about the time of the First World War, but we are told that it is now on the increase. There was a bad incident in 1985, although that was the first prosecution for dog fighting ever brought in this country.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0362"/>
<col>707</col>
Some of your Lordships will probably have seen pictures in the press of a bitch which was mangled and had her jaw torn off. She was left in a most appalling condition and had to be put down. It is extraordinary that there are men who can do that. They must be very sadistic; they must enjoy watching animals tearing themselves to pieces.<lb/>
I should like to see the penalties for promoting dog fights stiffened. But the number of trials that would arise would clog the county court.<lb/>
The Bill is very short; it has only two clauses. The first clause is the important one. It sets out the appropriate fines and imprisonment for such offences. The other clause is of no great importance. It repeals two enactments but those enactments do not affect the Bill to any great extent. Clause 2 also states that the Bill will become law within two months from the date that it is passed and that it shall not extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, I hope that one day, it will.<lb/>
The Bill has passed through all its stages in the Commons and the Government wish it to pass through all its stages today. Therefore, there is not much more that I can say about it. Dog-fighting has been called a sport, but it is only performed before thugs. It is an extraordinary thing that people&#x2014;chiefly men&#x2014;can enjoy seeing animals tearing themselves to pieces or human beings such as heavyweight boxers giving one another brain damage or some such injury. It is a degenerate pastime and it appears to be on the increase. It is mystifying that people can enjoy such a form of entertainment.<lb/>
Finally, pehaps I may say that if the promotion of dog fighting is not crushed there will have to be another Bill and the penalties will have to be increased. It is possible that the penalty of six months' imprisonment will have more effect in stopping dog fighting than the fine of &#x00A3;2,000. Having said that, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03264">8.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03265"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the clear presentation that the noble Viscount has made in moving this short but very important Bill. I also very much enjoyed the highly informed details which he gave concerning the historical background of the question of animal baiting and dog fighting.<lb/>
We on these Benches certainly share the horror and repugnance that the noble Viscount has expressed at any form of cruelty to animals. I think that the necessity for this Bill has been made clear by the examples which the noble Viscount has given and which were given in the debate in another place as regards the increase in cases of dog fights which have been brought before courts in the past year or so. Therefore it seems right that the law should be amended in the way suggested in an attempt to deter people from that barbaric and cruel habit.<lb/>
Perhaps I may widen the discussion briefly and touch on one or two other matters which may be kept in mind when considering how best to protect animals
<col>708</col>
from cruelty. The first and most important matter is education. Surely it is important to educate society and especially young people to have respect for animals and to treat them properly. That must be seen as an ongoing process which is of the most fundamental importance.<lb/>
Secondly, there is the question of dog wardens. In Northern Ireland, dog wardens are already appointed by local authorities. I feel that if that practice were to be brought in throughout the United Kingdom there is little doubt that the role of the wardens in looking after and protecting stray dogs would make an important difference.<lb/>
Lastly, perhaps we should also examine the powers of the police and the RSPCA inspectors in order that one day future legislation may enable them to enter premises with a warrant when they believe that an animal is suffering unduly. While recognising that such powers would have to be exercised very carefully, I nevertheless feel that that would avoid some of the appalling suffering which can at present be experienced by animals when the RSPCA cannot gain entry to relieve suffering.<lb/>
With those few additional points concerning future thinking on how we may further the protection of animals, perhaps I may say that we support the Bill on this side of the House. We believe that it is a step forward towards ensuring that animals are not treated cruelly. As I say, I hope that extra safeguards will be kept in mind for any future legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Prescription (Scotland) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03271">8.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03272"><member>Lord Sanderson of Bowden</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0363"/>
<col>709</col>
This Bill is a small but important measure introduced in another place by the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Before I deal with the detailed provisions of the Bill now before the House, I must take the important step of declaring an interest since I hold a position as a director of Clydesdale Bank plc. As I hope to make clear, however, the provisions of the Bill which I move are not designed to benefit solely institutions such as a bank but rather are designed to protect the interests of all creditors. I can confidently assure the House, therefore, that in promoting this Bill I do not in any way seek to forward my own or my bank's pecuniary interests. With that assurance, I now go on to deal with the Bill itself.<lb/>
The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the law of prescription in Scotland to correct an anomaly resulting from the combined effects of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985 and the Insolvency Act 1986. It may be helpful to your Lordships if I remind the House that the law of prescription in Scotland is the law relating to the periods of time after which rights and obligations are extinguished and cannot be enforced.<lb/>
The Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act and the Insolvency Act had the effect of repealing the enactment which provided that the presentation of, or the concurring in, a petition for the winding up of a company or the submission of a claim by a creditor in the liquidation of a company interrupted the running of prescription (or the time limits) on the debt claimed. This interruption was achieved by Section 9(1)(b) of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973. However, the combined effects of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act and the Insolvency Act have resulted in creditors requiring to raise a court action to preserve their entitlement to their debt.<lb/>
These effects have been twofold. From 1st April 1986 until 29th December 1986 only the submission of a claim in a winding up (and not the petition for winding up) had the effect of interrupting prescription. The anomaly arises in the case of a claim by a creditor in liquidation only in liquidations commenced after 29th December 1986 when the Insolvency Act came into force.<lb/>
What should have happened is that when the relevant section of the Companies Act 1985 was repealed on 29th December 1986 by Part II of Schedule 10 to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act and by Schedule 12 to the Insolvency Act, Section 9(1)(b) of the 1973 Act should have been amended in the way now proposed in this Bill.<lb/>
Clause 1(1) of the Bill amends Section 9(1) of the 1973 Act by adding to the definition of what is a "relevant claim" for the purposes of interrupting the running of prescription after which the debt claimed is extinguished and cannot be pursued. It provides that a relevant claim should include the presentation of, or the concurring in, a petition for the winding up of a company or the submission of a claim in a liquidation in accordance with the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 made under Section 411 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Clause 1(2) repeals in Section 9(1)(b) of the 1973 Act the references to the now repealed Section 613 of the Companies Act 1985, which I mentioned earlier.<lb/>
<col>710</col>
Clause 1(3) makes the amendment to Section 9(1)(b) of the 1973 Act retrospective, or I should perhaps more correctly say retroactive, so that it covers expressly any claim which has been submitted in a liquidation which commenced on or after 29th December 1986. This is an important point. It will ensure that the submission of a claim will always have had the effect of interrupting prescription and will avoid the need for creditors to resubmit claims in order to derive any benefit from the Bill. The Bill therefore preserves rights. It does not take away any vested right. It is not considered necessary to make the Bill retroactive all the way back to 1st April 1986 because, as a practical matter, the submission of a claim in a liquidation would have protected any creditor who petitioned, or who concurred in a petition for the winding up of a company.<lb/>
I appreciate that this Bill, however small, contains technical and complex provisions. It is important, however, that it restores the position to what it should always have been and I commend it to the House.</membercontribution></p>

the average family in bed and breakfast accommodation rather than house the 200 homeless families in empty council houses; and what they believe to be the justification for this policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03308"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member>: The council's housing policy is a matter for them, but I would applaud their work in satisfying the demand for owner-occupation among their own tenants and those on the waiting list and at the same time releasing rented accommodation for the homeless. I understand that at the end of April, 1987 the council had 611 dwellings empty awaiting sale. They have the smallest waiting list of any Inner London borough. On 11th May 1987 there were 244 homeless households placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by the Borough at an average cost of &#x00A3;6,000 per household per annum. The council recognises the Government's advice that bed and breakfast is an unsatisfactory form of temporary accommodation for homeless households and is taking positive action to reduce its use through the development of assured tenancy schemes and the short-term leasing of private sector empty dwellings. Wandsworth puts significantly fewer homeless households into bed and breakfast accommodation than many other London Boroughs, including Camden, Tower Hamlets, Brent, Hackney, Haringey, Newham, Lambeth, Hammersmith &#x0026; Fulham and Ealing.</p>

<title>Enfield Small Arms Factory: Future</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03310"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make a statement on the future of the Enfield Small Arms factory in the light of current negotiations concerning the ownership of the Royal Ordnance Factories.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03311"><member>The Minister of State for Defence Procurement (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the sale of Royal Ordnance to British Aerospace plc was completed on 22nd April. Strictly speaking therefore the future of Enfield is a matter for British Aerospace. However, the company have assured us that it is their intention to develop the business as a whole and run it successfully.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03312"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister tell the House how the Government propose to influence the commercial judgments and decisions of the new owners? Is it not a fact that the workers of the Enfield Small Arms factory have been cast off, abandoned, and sacrificed for party purposes? Is the Minister aware that there are thousands of workers at the Enfield Small Arms factory who helped to save this country in the Falklands war, and in many others, and that they have been abandoned and betrayed by this Government? How does the noble Lord intend to secure the future welfare and well-being of such workers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03313"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so, I am afraid that the noble Lord is labouring under a very considerable misapprehension. There is certainly no question of the Government seeking to influence the commercial judgment of British Aerospace in its dealings with its new subsidiary, Royal Ordnance, or for that matter in any other way. The future of the factory at Enfield will be secured by it becoming as efficient as possible. As the noble Lord may be aware, we made it clear before we disposed of Royal Ordnance to British Aerospace that for example, the order for the second tranche of the SA.80 weapon was available to the new owners of Enfield if they thought fit, and we are now waiting to hear British Aerospace's decision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03314"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord tell the House whether all disputes about pensions and other employment rights regarding former employees of Royal Ordnance factories&#x2014;and there were some, about which the noble Lord told us&#x2014;are now settled?</membercontribution></p>
<col>716</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03315"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of any outstanding details that have not been settled. Of course the sale of Royal Ordnance was a sale of shares, so the whole of the enterprise, including all its existing schemes and liabilities, has passed to the new owners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03316"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister confirm that, if in the commercial judgment of the new owners it is in the best interests of their shareholders to transfer work, to close down a factory completely, or to put it to other use, that is perfectly within their gift? In that circumstance, has the noble Lord no shame that workers who have served the national interest so well are to be abandoned in that way?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03317"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord puts an entirely hypothetical question to me. As he is aware, and as I have already said, British Aerospace has made it quite clear that it intends to operate Royal Ordnance as a single entity. There is no question of it chopping up Royal Ordnance bit by bit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03318"><member>A noble Lord</member><membercontribution>: Wait and see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03319"><member>Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can help me on one matter having regard to his general statement about the rights and liabilities of the firm in reply to my noble friend Lord Winstanley. Can the noble Lord assure the House, having regard to the attitude of the Government towards innovation, that the rights of employees in relation to intellectual property rights have been looked after and preserved?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03320"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the resolution of the question of the ownership of the intellectual property rights was one of the more complex matters that had to be agreed with the new owners during the course of the discussions that we had with them. I am happy to say that agreement was reached.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03321"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who had the misfortune to be a machine gunner in the front line on the Somme in the First World War, I should like to pay very great tribute to the Enfield Small Arms factory and its products.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03322"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right to point out that the Royal Ordnance factory at Enfield has been manufacturing small arms for a long period of time, and with great success.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Local Authority Borrowing: Repayment</title>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03324"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have any responsibility for the interest on, or repayment of, loans obtained by local authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03325"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. A local authority's debt, both principal and interest and its
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0367"/>
<col>717</col>
creditworthiness have always been that authority's own responsibility. As my right honourable friend made clear in another place, the Government do not stand behind local authority debt. The great majority of local authorities understand the importance of maintaining their creditworthiness and behave in accordance with the rules of financial good practice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03326"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that clear and comprehensive reply. Am I right in assuming that it means that those foreign banks who provide loans for British local authorities, for whatever reason, do so on their own assessment of the creditworthiness of the borrower?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03327"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, absolutely so. They took upon themselves the business of lending to these local authorities on normal commercial terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03328"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend give some indication of the extent to which local authorities mortgage their properties as security for these loans and whether any of these properties are at all at risk of passing into the hands of the lenders?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03329"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that I cannot provide my noble friend with details on the number of such arrangements. In terms of protection for creditors and for anybody else who lends on this basis, of course the normal preference rules apply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03330"><member>Lord Harvey of Prestbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that what she has said could be disastrous for British trade in countries like Switzerland? What can be done about the situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03331"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what can be done, we hope, is to persuade local authorities not to behave in this extravagant and outrageous manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03332"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the problems of deferred purchase (which of course is what is being referred to) are not confined to Labour authorities? I have here a list of 84 authorities which went into deferred purchase arrangements between 1974 and 1984, and a great many of them are Conservative councils.<lb/>
Is the noble Baroness aware of the Harrogate case, where the authority, which was a Tory one, used deferred purchase for the building of a conference centre to the tune of &#x00A3;20 million in 1977, and the Secretary of State bailed out the authority, if I may use that expression, in 1982 by turning the deferred purchase into ordinary loans to the tune of &#x00A3;16 million to be repaid over a conventional period? That is exactly the proposal that the Labour Party has in its plans for the reform of local government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03333"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have taken action to deal with a number of devices used by local authorities, including deferred purchase arrangements. The measures we have taken will apply equally to all authorities. Of course I am aware of the case of Harrogate Borough Council. It entered into a deferred purchase arrangement in 1977 to finance the construc-
<col>718</col>
tion of a conference centre. This was just the sort of one-off project for which it is reasonable to use deferred purchase, but costs escalated for unforeseen reasons.<lb/>
The arrangement was terminated in 1982, with the assistance of an approval for additional conventional borrowing by my right honourable friend the then Secretary of State. At a time of substantial capital underspending by local authorities nationally, the approval was given in recognition that the borough council was facing unforeseen financial difficulties as a result of its commitment to the conference centre project. These were, we feel, rather special circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03334"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend tell us where the ratepayers stand in this? Is there any possibility of these debts falling back on them or are they protected under the rate-capping legislation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03335"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my understanding of what happens in these situations is that, first, the local authorities must apply to the Public Works Loan Board, and if the board finds that it cannot meet the liability the auditor can institute proceedings surcharging and disqualifying councillors, and the responsibility is that of the councillors themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03336"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Baroness say whether the Government might consider reconstituting and updating the Public Works Loan Board, which was very effective and might be able to help all local authorities with some of the difficulties which they face?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03337"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in present circumstances the Public Works Loan Board could not lend to an authority which chose to act illegally or which appeared unable to service and repay debt, even under its lender of last resort facility. We have no present plans to alter this arrangement and I trust that the authorities which are so vigorously mortgaging the future will recognise this fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03338"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the Minister agree that the Government must find words even more categorical than those which she used today in answering the Question on the Order Paper to make certain that the British Government will not pick up this tab? So long as there is any doubt about the matter, the chances of lenders being misled into lending is a problem for the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03339"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are well aware that a number of authorities have used creative accounting devices simply to flout the Government's expenditure controls. They have knowingly mortgaged their future at the expense of their ratepayers and have entered into these schemes with their eyes open. We have made it abundantly clear to both them and to the City that we shall not bail them out.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03343"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that that has always been the aim of the Government in these circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03344"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may now ask my question. Will the noble Baroness kindly confirm that, provided local authorities behave legally, the Public Works Loan Board is a lender of last resort? Will she also confirm that the Treasury has a number of outstanding exchange rate guarantees on local authority foreign borrowings and that they will also be met?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03345"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Public Works Loan Board will not perform its function only if local authorities are acting illegally. Any arrangements and guarantees into which the Government have entered will be honoured.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03346"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that despite the positive arrangement made by the Government to deal with the Harrogate situation, both Her Majesty's Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Neil Kinnock&#x2014;and the Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Cunningham, have for some time made clear in quite definitive statements that under no circumstances will a future Labour Government bail out any local authorities, whatever their political colour, which indulge in creative accountancy?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03349"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the British Airways plan for transatlantic passengers, offering a round trip to any of British Airways 45 European destinations free to anyone who bought a British Airways ticket to Heathrow, was formally approved by the Civil Aviation Authority and, if so, what action they have taken to support such approval.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03350"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport (Lord Brabazon of Tara)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Civil Aviation Authority formally approved British Airways' fare proposal but the United States Department of Transportation disapproved it. The UK-USA Air Services Agreement requires all tariffs for public transport between the two countries involving the airlines of the two parties to be approved by both sides. Tariff initiatives sometimes
<col>720</col>
fail to get approval when one or both governments consider that they do not satisfy the criteria set out in that agreement. United Kingdom and United States government officials tried without success to find a solution to the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03351"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply, but is it not correct that Mr. Spicer has stressed the importance of the European market being treated as a single entity? Is it not true that the British Airways' plan, as supported by the CAA, would have been an important step in that direction? Can the Minister say whether the Government or the CAA are contemplating any further action in respect of the matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03352"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with the remarks of my honourable friend Mr. Spicer as regards the European market. I wholly endorse the view that many European countries remain too protectionist. This matter was between the United States Department of Transportation and our Civil Aviation Authority. I am afraid that the United States Department of Transportation failed to approve the fares.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03353"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if British Airways considers that such an offer is commercially good for it because in effect it reduces fares, does the Minister agree that that is an excellent example for BA to set for reducing fares in Europe?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03354"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the offer of British Airways&#x2014;which was followed by a similar offer from British Caledonian&#x2014;was for a limited period only. I believe that it was originally planned to last for six weeks; a fairly short period of time in the tourist calendar. It would have been good for their business, and British Airways are looking forward to the time when we reach agreement on European air fares. I am sure that they will be ready to compete when that time comes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03355"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister say how the United States civil aviation authorities managed to reconcile licensing the United States airlines for cross-state agreements with airlines coming into a United States port of entry, but disagree with British Airways doing precisely the same thing in respect of European airlines?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03356"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we vetoed a proposal by the United States airlines as regards transatlantic flights including free internal flights in the United States because the internal market in the United States is entirely closed to our airlines, whereas United States airlines operate in Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03357"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister help a little further? Is he aware that my information is that five European governments, in addition to America, were also attacking the British Airways plan because they were afraid that it would damage their pooling arrangements, which we all should like to see abolished? Will the Minister further agree that so long as European governments support their own national airlines in this matter, we shall
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0369"/>
<col>721</col>
make no progress on liberalising air fares for the general public?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03358"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly agree with the second half of the noble Baroness's question. I hope that over the course of many questions we have made clear that we believe the European market should be opened up. One of the purposes of working towards such a market is to strengthen the European airline industry as a whole in its relations with airlines from outside Europe. Regarding the point about five European governments having disapproved of this proposal, I am afraid that, the Americans having turned it down, that stage was never reached. It would have had to be endorsed by the Europeans, but it never reached that stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03359"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards that last point, I should like to ask the Minister this: because I have information to the contrary that those five governments have done so, if I give him the names outside this Chamber, will he have the matter inquired into and write to me?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03360"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly do my best to do so. I did not mean to imply that they had not sought to influence the United States Government: that may well have been the case. However, they never reached the stage of having to give formal approval.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HEA: Education Service Representation</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03361">3.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03362"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether either primary or secondary teachers will be represented in the new Health Education Authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03363"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the regulations setting up the Health Education Authority recognise the essential role of the education service in health education by stipulating that one of the members of the authority must be directly nominated by the Secretary of State for Education and Science. My right honourable friend nominated Mrs. Kate Wood, a former chairman of the Wirral Education Committee with experience as a member of the Schools Curriculum Development Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03364"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that rather disappointing reply. Is he aware that practising teachers feel left out and saddened by the fact that they are not represented on this new authority?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03365"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall draw the noble Baroness's remarks to the attention of the Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03366"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while warmly supporting the noble Baroness's plea, perhaps I may
<col>722</col>
turn to another point: namely, the fact that this authority applies to Wales as well as to England. Why have the Government neglected to put a Welsh representative on this authority? I note that Tesco Stores are represented, together with Bowater and no doubt a number of other reputable companies in England. Why is the Welsh nation always neglected by this Government? It has a worse reputation than any authority since Edward I.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03367"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall have to write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03368"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord say how the activities of the new Health Education Authority will be affected by the sex education provisions of the recent Education Act, particularly in relation to AIDS? Will the new authority have any funds for this principle and will its writ extend to schools?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03369"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards the authorities responsible for sex education in schools, under the Education Act 1986 from 1st September responsibility for the form and content of sex education in schools will progressively pass to the governing bodies of schools. Under the new arrangements the HEA will be able to offer advice and prepare materials for use in schools, but it will be for individual governing bodies to decide whether and how they are employed. We expect the HEA to maintain close liaison with the Department of Education and Science on these matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03370"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that those of us who are all too familiar with respiratory and orthopaedic wards know so well that good posture is the defence against very costly ill-health? It would seem that in recent years the teaching of this to children has not been notably successful. As it is one of the most important subjects, and of inestimable value to everyone concerned, one would hope that this would be reflected in the new authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03371"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe it is felt that it would be inappropriate for the Health Education Authority itself to include advice about posture. However, I am sure that a very large number of people are involved who are very keen on posture and on physical education. I would remind the noble Baroness that, among others, Mr. Sebastian Coe, is a member of the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03372"><member>Viscount Tonypandy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord, in answering the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, bear in mind that the Welsh Office has responsibility for health and education in Wales and that it is ordinary common courtesy for consideration to be given to the matters raised by the noble Lord? Secondly, will he bear in mind that it is to the Government's own advantage to have the experience and knowledge of practising teachers on this important body?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03373"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I very much take the point that the noble Viscount has made to me, and hopefully I shall be able to provide an answer when I write to his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0370"/>
<col>723</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03374"><member>Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to what the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, has said about the important matter of Welsh representation on this committee, will he be good enough also to send me a copy of the letter that he has promised to send to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03375"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall do so. I shall place a copy of the letter in the Library.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03376"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the support which I have received from the noble Viscount and also from the noble Lord on the Liberal Benches. However, will the noble Lord do more than write me a letter on the matter? Will he give the House an assurance that he will discuss this carefully with his right honourable friend as a matter of deep importance, because the Welsh people will be very offended if a constructive reply is not received?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03377"><member>The Lord President of the Council (Viscount Whitelaw)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it might be appropriate if I replied to the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition at this moment in this particular Parliament. I think that this is an appropriate time for me to do so. I fully understand the representations he has made on behalf of the Welsh nation and I also understand the representations made by the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, and others about the representation on this Health Education Council. I shall certainly speak personally to the Ministers concerned, as the noble Lord has requested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03378"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03379"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that I strongly support the plea made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, that teachers' representatives should be on this Health Education Authority? Health education is vitally important when it starts in the primary and secondary schools. We have to get away from the surfeit of sausages, chips and beans which seems to be the staple fare for many young people today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03380"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very interested in the noble Lord's comments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03381"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that those members of the current HEC who are known to be critical of the Government's policy, particularly with reference to the health divide, have not been renominated or re-appointed to the new Health Education Authority? What conditions will be imposed on the new authority regarding future publications?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03382"><member>Lord Hesketh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that that is a little wide of the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03401"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
This Bill will implement most of the tax changes announced by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget in March. That Budget was set against the background of a flourishing economy and was designed to enable that to continue. What we are experiencing today is not a sudden spurt of growth but the fruit of eight years' prudent management of the nation's finances&#x2014;prudence which enabled us last year to reduce public sector borrowing as a proportion of national output to a level achieved on only two other occasions since 1950. This reduction in public sector borrowing was achieved at the same time as a significant reduction in taxation and followed the increase in public expenditure announced in the Autumn Statement&#x2014;a unique hat-trick.<lb/>
We are now entering our seventh year of steady growth, inflation is at levels we have not seen for almost 20 years and living standards have reached record heights. Unemployment is now firmly on a downward trend, as today's figures confirm, and the size of its fall over the last 12 months has not been matched since 1973. Industry is more profitable than at any time in the last two decades and the number of industrial disputes is around the lowest level for almost half a century; so it comes as no surprise to learn from the latest CBI <i>Quarterly Survey</i> that business optimism is rising rapidly.<lb/>
But our performance has improved not only when measured against our past record but also when
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0372"/>
<col>727</col>
measured against that of our international competitors. Since 1980, the UK has grown faster than all the other major EC countries. In 1986 we grew faster than the US and Japan too and the IMF is forecasting that this year we shall once again outpace all the other major industrialised countries. The story on productivity growth in manufacturing industry is similar. In fact on that count since 1980 we have grown faster than any other major industrial country, even the Japanese. The improvement in unemployment took a little longer to achieve but over the last year we have experienced the largest percentage fall of any major industrialised country apart from the United States, while we have created more jobs since the last election than the rest of the EC put together.<lb/>
Our external position is secure too. Our net overseas assets had risen by the end of last year to around &#x00A3;110 billion, equivalent to 28 per cent. of GDP&#x2014;the highest level since the war and second only to Japan. These assets now earn us over &#x00A3;4 billion a year in interest, profit and dividends and in 1987 our surplus in invisible exports is likely to be the largest in the world. Despite fears expressed in certain quarters of a looming balance of payments crisis, our visible exports are also performing well. Export volumes (excluding oil and erratics) rose by 11 per cent. over the last year&#x2014;a faster rate of growth than that of any of the five major industrialised countries.<lb/>
There is no reason to doubt that this encouraging performance will be sustained. We are forecasting that the economy will grow at 3 per cent. this year and that manufacturing output will grow faster still. This growth will be balanced, with exports, investment and consumer spending all forecast to rise at the same rate. Inflation at the end of this year should be around its current level and the strength of the economy means that there is every chance that unemployment will continue to fall. So that is the favourable economic background against which we can examine this year's Finance Bill.<lb/>
Because of the shortened timetable, we have thought it right to drop certain measures from the original Bill to allow time for proper consideration. The Government have, however, still thought it right to retain those clauses which confirm measures already in effect or where a change at this stage would give rise to practical problems. Other measures have been included because of their significance. To assist your Lordships, I shall summarise the main provisions retained in the Bill. The clause numbers refer to the Bill as originally printed.<lb/>
Clauses 1 to 5 enact the excise duty changes. Clauses 11 and 14 give effect to the VAT package which will be of particular help to small businesses. These measures were the subject of wide consultation and were warmly welcomed. Clauses 12, 13, 15, 17 and 18 form a package designed to block a significant VAT loophole.<lb/>
Clause 20 and Clauses 23 to 29 give effect to the Government's income tax proposals. The increased personal allowances and reduced basic rate of 27p will be reflected in pay packets after 17th May. A married man on average earnings will be &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;87 a week better
<col>728</col>
off as a result; a married man on half average earnings will be &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;59 a week better off. The special increase in relief for those aged 80 or over, and in relief for the blind, have also been included as a matter of priority.<lb/>
Companies have told us how much they welcome the certainty of having the rate of corporation tax set in advance for the financial year. That is why we have included Clause 21. Clause 22 gives effect to the 27p rate of corporation tax for small companies. Clause 37 will put all companies on a nine months' payment basis for corporation tax.<lb/>
Clause 33 gives eflect to certain useful changes to the rules on tax relief for employee share schemes as they affect employees. The Government attach importance to the encouragement of training, and Clauses 35 and 36 therefore provide the new reliefs for employees seconded to educational bodies and for training not specifically connected to an employee's present job.<lb/>
Clauses 45 and 46 make useful improvements to the business expansion scheme. Clause 67 will increase the limit for retirement relief from CGT. Clauses 138 to 146 are concerned with stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax. Though almost wholly technical, these measures have been included because of the impossibility of back-dating stamp duty changes.<lb/>
Another important feature retained in this Bill is all the reductions proposed for inheritance tax, as well as other useful measures which will help the heritage. These are contained in Clauses 147 and 149 to 151.<lb/>
The Finance Bill also contains a balanced package of measures affecting the oil industry in Clauses 54 to 56 and 153 to 159. These were carefully designed to give oil companies and the offshore supply industry an opportunity to adjust to the oil price fall and to help mitigate its effect on development and research. Certain of the measures are already in effect.<lb/>
Finally, we have retained Clause 160, which abolishes the Exchange Control Act. A number of minor but useful measures have also been included which I have not mentioned. There seemed no good reason to lose time by omitting these.<lb/>
Of the measures which we have thought right to postpone because of lack of time for parliamentary consideration, the most important are the clauses on pensions and profit-related pay. Other measures that we are leaving on one side for now are those affecting dual resident companies, double taxation relief on interest on bank loans and members of Lloyd's syndicates. We also think that the proposals for a new system of assessing and collecting corporation tax&#x2014;pay and file&#x2014;need to be properly explained and debated: they are also being left on one side.<lb/>
However, I should say that it is the Government's intention, if re-elected, to reintroduce all those provisions which have had to be left out of the shortened Finance Bill as early as possible in the next Parliament. For those measures which would have taken effect from Royal Assent to the original Bill, the operative date will be Royal Assent to the new legislation. In other cases it is intended to retain the operative date proposed in the original Bill. I commend this Bill to your Lordships on the basis proposed. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

"After discussion with British Aerospace, I am glad to tell the House that agreement has been reached that up to &#x00A3;450 million in launch aid will be provided to enable the company to participate in the Airbus A.330 and 340 projects.<lb/>
"This launch aid will be fully repayable on terms designed to yield an acceptable return in real terms on the Government's investment.<lb/>
"At this stage our support is conditional upon our partner governments also making the arrangements that are necessary to enable their manufacturers to participate in the projects.<lb/>
"At a time when the competitive pressures in the world aerospace industry are as strong as ever, I should like to praise the determination of Airbus Industrie and its partners to extend their family of large airliners."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03405"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement given in another place. I am particularly pleased to note the last few words of the Statement where the Minister praises,
<quote>"the determination of Airbus Industrie and its partners to extend their family of large airliners."</quote>
So far the programme of Airbus Industrie has been profitable. It has been successful for British Aerospace and successful for British employment. I understand that at its peak the present programme is likely to reach an employment level of 13,000, and if this additional programme goes ahead it will mean 25,000 jobs by the mid-1990s for British Aerospace.<lb/>
I am a little mystified by the fourth paragraph, which reads:
<quote>"our support is conditional upon our partner governments also making the arrangements that are necessary",</quote>
because my understanding is that if the partner governments do not make any arrangements Airbus Industrie just will not be able to proceed with its future programme on the A.330 and the A.340.<lb/>
I should like to ask an important question. Airbus Industrie has its general launch aid costs. British Aerospace asked for &#x00A3;750 million. The Government by this Statement are agreeing up to &#x00A3;450 million. I take it that there is utter and complete agreement with British Aerospace that it can meet its obligations to Airbus Industrie in the general overall launch aid costs, because it is understood that if by any chance Britain should withdraw there will be other
<col>730</col>
manufacturers who will wish to come in and take our 20 per cent. Provided that British Aerospace is thoroughly satisfied that it can manage with this aid of up to &#x00A3;450 million and can meet the balance from its own funds, we welcome the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03406">3.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03407"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we too should like to thank the Minister for making this Statement at this particularly opportune time. It is a further example of how general elections concentrate a government's mind on the employment needs in particular constituencies, and we welcome it accordingly. I too want to be assured as to the position with regard to the manufacturers' requirements. They have said that &#x00A3;750 million is their minimum figure and &#x00A3;450 million is the figure which has been&#x2014;I hope&#x2014;agreed upon. We on these Benches have no objection whatever to government expenditure being kept at figures which are acceptable to the Government, if the same purpose can be achieved, and we wish to congratulate the Government rather than criticise them on this reduction in the figure, provided that it is satisfactory on second thoughts to the manufacturers.<lb/>
We regret also that there has been, in our view, unnecessary delay in reaching this conclusion. That has caused uncertainty all round, and I must say that it must have been damaging to the reputation of this country as a country which can be relied upon as a good partner, an interested partner and an enterprising one.<lb/>
There are two further points of lesser detail which I should like to put to the Minister. First, could arrangements be made in the future for more accountability with regard to the joint enterprise? It has proved rather difficult to find out what the results have been, and we can see no damage to those concerned in more open disclosure of these figures and in what one would generally call accountability.<lb/>
As to the Statement itself, could the Minister be a little more explicit on the third paragraph, which says:
<quote>"This launch aid will be fully repayable on terms designed to yield an acceptable return"?</quote>
That is an extremely vague phrase. We would understand it if the Government felt that they had to rush through a Statement on this the last effective day before the general election in order to get matters clear. But we really think that this should be much more carefully considered, and I hope therefore that the Minister can give me a considered and satisfactory answer on the meaning of those words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03408"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Diamond, for their reception of the Statement which I have just repeated. Perhaps I may comment on one or two of the points. Both noble Lords have drawn attention to the importance for the employment market of our joining in this venture. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, mentioned figures which are a little larger than those I might have given, but certainly when this project goes ahead a number of jobs will be secured and as we move into the 1990s there is a good prospect of more jobs being created.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, spoke about our governmental partners' involvement. Perhaps I may
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0374"/>
<col>731</col>
say this in response to him and indeed in response to the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, who spoke of delay. In fact, we are the first of the partner governments to make a statement of our commitment to the project. So there has been no delay alongside our partner governments in this. I recall answering a Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, in, I think, March or April of this year, and certainly nothing has been lost for Airbus Industrie in the time that these long and very complex negotiations have taken.<lb/>
In October last year, British Aerospace asked for a sum of money very much in excess of the &#x00A3;450 million which I have announced this afternoon. The programme has indeed changed since October last year. The fortunes of the industry and of British Aerospace itself have changed, and this amount has been agreed between the Government and British Aerospace as being practicable. I should perhaps remind your Lordships that the whole project&#x2014;that is, the launch aid and the development&#x2014;will cost some &#x00A3;1,200 million. The company is quite confident of being able to provide from its own resources and resources available to it the balance of those moneys.<lb/>
I noted carefully what the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, had to say about accountability. I have answered that question on more than one occasion. The noble Lord himself will know that Airbus Industrie is protected under French law from the necessity of publishing accounts. British Aerospace's involvement in the partnership&#x2014;its 20 per cent. share&#x2014;is reflected in its own accounts. That is the avenue of accountability.<lb/>
Launch aid is designed to assist the company, not only in monetary terms but also in establishing the confidence that the Government have in the industry. That enhances the company's ability to raise funds in the City as may be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03409"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome very much the &#x00A3;450 million launch aid, although it is considerably less than the &#x00A3;750 million asked for by British Aerospace. However, in spite of the most helpful letter that the Minister sent me in reply to my query on the delay, and while I am glad that our delay is less than that of other governments, I still feel that there has been a considerable delay in this matter. I am glad that the imminence of the general election has rather hastened a decision on it.<lb/>
Does the Minister agree that failure to offer the launch aid would have meant the loss of our credibility as a European partner and all chance of participating in large-scale civil aircraft manufacture for the foreseeable future? I, in common with everyone else, I am sure, welcome what the Government have done and hope that it will spur the other governments in Europe to do the same.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03410"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I recognise the interest of the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, in this matter. However, I am rather sorry that she should draw the inference she has with regard to the matter of delay and a general election. That is perhaps a little unworthy since the noble Baroness among many others has consistently urged us to come to an early conclusion on the matter. We have come to the earliest
<col>732</col>
conclusion that we could&#x2014;in fact, in advance of our partners.<lb/>
The matter has been complex and there have been changes in the project. There has been no real delay that has caused damage, either to the credibility of Her Majesty's Government or indeed to British Aerospace or to Airbus Industrie. As we have not failed to make an offer of lauch aid, I do not feel the necessity (if the noble Baroness will forgive me for saying so) to answer the hypothetical question that she addressed at the end of her remarks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03411"><member>Lord Bruce-Gardyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the light of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, can my noble friend confirm that Airbus Industrie has acknowledged that to date it has never made a profit and that there is no conceivable expectation of a profit before the 1990s&#x2014;if then?<lb/>
Can my noble friend shed some light on what he means by an acceptable rate of return in real terms? If Her Majesty's Government really believe that the project will be a winner, what is the point of giving British Aerospace a little more than half of what it believes to be the essential initial investment? Is it the assumption that once we are committed to that extent British Aerospace will be able to come back, like Oliver Twist, for a top-up in due course?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03412"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne knows very well that according to the criteria that have been established for a number of years under more than one administration launch aid is repayable and is neither a grant nor a subsidy. The intention is that the principal sum advanced shall be repaid in full, together with an adequate return during the programme life of the A.330 and the A.340 by a levy on sales designed to yield a positive rate of return to the Government in real terms.<lb/>
As the life of a new plane is about 20 years and it is estimated that the plane will come into service in 1991 we are talking about a very long time. When I said a positive rate of return, I meant exactly that&#x2014;a positive rate of return. It would be imprudent in 1987 to suggest a figure for something that will not mature for 22 years or so.<lb/>
As regards the profits of Airbus Industrie, I cannot agree that, with the success of the A.320 which will go into service next year, and for which some 442 orders have already been placed, that company will not be in profit and that British Aerospace's share in that profitability will not accrue. We believe that the programme is a good one; otherwise we should not have committed the taxpayer to the launch aid as we have done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03413"><member>The Earl of Kinnoull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to support my noble friend not only by saying that the programme is an important one, but also by saying that it is a very good programme for not merely the British aerospace industry but all the many support companies. What does the project mean for the many sub-contractors who will obtain the benefits of being able to join in the scheme? It is very easy when one looks back at Concorde and all the other projects that have taken place to take a negative view. This project is long term.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0375"/>
<col>733</col>
I wish to ask my noble friend a little more about the potential orders for the project. What do they mean and how do they compare with the considerable impact that the European industry has had on American orders? That is a very substantial impact and I should like my noble friend to recall what that means, because this is the movement of a European industry going forward in a civil industry. That takes tremendous courage and it is a watershed for any government to come in and support launch aid for a private company. I congratulate my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03414"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Kinnoull for his support of the Government's action. The Government are advised that British Aerospace expects to have a 25 per cent. work-share in the new A.330, A.340 programme, as compared with its 20 per cent. partnership in Airbus Industrie. The work-share on the current airbus programme is 25 per cent. in respect of the A.320 and in the 16 to 18 per cent. range in respect of the 300 and the 600. There will therefore be a major British involvement in and contribution to all those programmes. That will, in its turn, have an effect upon the component industry.<lb/>
Such is the success of the A.320 that a number of US airlines have either placed orders or taken options. We, with British Aerospace, anticipate that the new programme, when it comes into service in 1990, will also enjoy its share of the medium-haul and short-haul markets and, with the A.330, the long-haul market.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03415"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to press the Minister again on one point. Of course we are all in favour of the project and we hope that it will be very successful, both in terms of the profits for those participating in it and because it illustrates what we on these Benches believe is a very good principle and one which should be carried out as often as possible in joint enterprise in European activity. This is a time when the Minister could make his reservations felt. I hope that he has more reservations than he has expressed in replying to my question about accountability.<lb/>
I hope that he will think that now is a time when he can make representations that, although Airbus Industrie is protected and does not necessarily need to disclose its accounts, profits and returns fully, it could nevertheless willingly do so. There is nothing to compel it to hide under the cover which it has. It would be far better for all concerned if everyone knew what the total results were, both in terms of the present project and as a precedent for future activity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03416">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03417"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate what perhaps lies behind the question of the noble Lord, Lord Diamond. I do not think that there is any question here of Airbus Industrie hiding under the cover of anything. The company is established under French law and that law, because of the arrangement of the company, does not require the full disclosure for which the noble Lord is looking.<lb/>
I can assure the noble Lord that Her Majesty's Government and British Aerospace have access to the figures and all the circumstances in regard to Airbus
<col>734</col>
Industrie's activities. I think that the noble Lord may have confidence in both British Aerospace to ensure that its 20 per cent. share is properly looked after and in Her Majesty's Government to ensure that our share is properly taken care of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03418"><member>Lord Bruce-Gardyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may ask my noble friend whether he, together with his right honourable friends the other Ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry, has taken up the suggestion I made to him on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter. I suggested that perhaps, as a gesture of their confidence in this great venture, they might commit some portion of their own personal net wealth to the success of British Aerospace in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03419"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since I do not have knowledge and do not seek knowledge of the shareholding of my colleagues in my department in any company, anywhere, I do not think I can be of any further help to my noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne than I was on the last occasion when he raised the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03420"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be highly improper for them to invest in this venture?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03421"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the proprieties of the shareholdings of Ministers are well known. I believe that I said&#x2014;I shall check it in <i>Hansard</i>&#x2014;that I have no knowledge of my colleagues' shareholdings, nor would I seek to have any knowledge of their shareholding anywhere in the stock market.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Finance Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03422">4.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03423">Second Reading debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03424"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, for having addressed himself to the Motion on the Order Paper. His contribution fell into two parts. First, he dealt with the fiscal aspects of the Finance Bill, and in the course of that he revealed the limited extent to which its taxation provisions would apply to those whose incomes are rather low. However, he was careful not to mention the massive benefits that are confirmed by the reduction in the rate of taxation to those in the higher income groups who on average benefit some 13 times as much as their less fortunate colleagues. I shall not endeavour to deal any further with the taxation provisions of the Bill and the various other more technical parts of it because most of them have been lost.<lb/>
However, in the course of his remarks the Minister mentioned expenditure, and because it has long been the claim of the Conservative Party that it is the party of lower taxation, it may perhaps be in order for me to point out that since 1979&#x2014;at which point government expenditure was some 38 per cent. of the national income&#x2014;under this Government it has risen to 45 per cent. I do not want to make any further point on that matter, other than what is revealed by the stark statistics themselves. However, it perhaps enables us to place some value on the broader and more general
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0376"/>
<col>735</col>
statements which are made by Her Majesty's Ministers from time to time and which will doubtless be re-enforced in a more elaborate and colourful form during the electoral struggle with which your Lordships will not be involved but which will doubtless be fought with vigour up and down the country.<lb/>
I do, however, have to ask the noble Lord about VAT. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and his right honourable friend the Prime Minister have in another place been singularly reticent about the future of VAT. Your Lordships will recall that, in speaking on 12th February, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said:
<quote>"I see the extension of the VAT base as an essential part of the budget strategy and a necessary counterpart to the reduction in income tax".</quote>
That suggests to me that the Government have it in mind, in very much the same way as the former Chancellor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, when justifying the reversal of the election promises not to double VAT after the election, so very aptly said in his first Budget, and indeed pleaded as justification, that the income tax reliefs had been necessary in order that people could pay the increased VAT. I found that most disarming.<lb/>
The question that I wish to ask the noble Lord, speaking in the absence of his noble friend, is a simple one. Can the noble Lord give the House an undertaking (on the possible assumption that the present Government are in office after llth June) that VAT will not be increased during the time that elapses before the next normal Budget, which will be in March/April 1988? That would immediately dispense with any misunderstanding about the matter. We of course know that the European Commission has brought a case against Her Majesty's Government&#x2014;Case No. 416 of 1985&#x2014;in which it is claiming that a 15 per cent. VAT should be imposed on all new buildings and on newspapers, as well as advancing a whole series of other provisions concerning which Her Majesty's Government have been brought to the European Court.<lb/>
As your Lordships know, I am not of a suspicious nature. However, I am bound to say that the Government declined to let me, as an interested party, have their pleadings in the case which is being brought against them by the European Commission; they seemed to me to be singularly reticent about that. There is no legal reason why they cannot provide the pleadings. As your Lordships will know, normally in civil cases before the courts the pleadings are made public, the press can discuss them and during the progress of the case the whole of the prosecution and defence cases are revealed and made public. However, for some reason the Government declined to let me have the pleadings. When I wrote to the registrar of the European Court on the subject, the reply was that it cited as its authority a ruling which was concerned purely with the archives, which I thought was somewhat disingenuous. I shall not press the matter until a more convenient stage.<lb/>
However, I suspect that the Government will very much welcome the increase in VAT. They will not fight very hard to resist such an increase because on the basis of 200,000 houses per annum&#x2014;which is the low
<col>736</col>
level to which housing has fallen during the past eight years&#x2014;the increase would mean an extra &#x00A3;900 million revenue to the Exchequer. That figure excludes VAT on factories, warehouses and all the other marvellous wealth producing structures which the noble Lord has invited us to envisage as a result of the prosperity which he alleges is blessing the country at the present time. However, will the noble Lord deny that there is any idea of introducing a 4 per cent. tax on food? Noble Lords will recall that some time ago a Select Committee pointed out for your Lordships' information that this country was unique in having a zero rating on food. A 4 per cent. VAT on food was suggested as a means of standardising the situation. Are we to have any standardisation on the assumption that the party opposite is, through some oversight of the electorate, returned to government on 11th June? These questions should be answered.<lb/>
In the course of the past six weeks we have observed a remarkable <i>bouleversement</i> in government policy. It reminded me very much of the statement made by the Prime Minister in 1985 attacking Members of her own government. I refer your Lordships to <i>The Times</i> of 9th July 1985. The Prime Minister attacked her colleagues who were seeking to have a mildly progressive policy and accused them of being spineless spenders. Who were the spineless spenders over the past six weeks, miraculously, in view of the forthcoming or anticipated election? Where have all the old concepts gone? Or is it merely a repetition of a matter that your Lordships will remember very well indeed? Immediately prior to the 1983 election, the right honourable gentleman the Member for Henley (who at that time was Minister of the Environment) said to the local authorities: "Spend, spend, spend." So of course they did. Unemployment at that time went down slightly. Will the noble Lord give the House some idea why this death-bed repentance has occurred?<lb/>
The second part of the noble Lord's speech dealt with the Government's achievements. The noble Lord has proved himself a worthy deputy to the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, in this respect. We regret the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Young, today. I understand that he may have more pressing duties as the public relations officer of his party during the forthcoming campaign. We understand the reason why&#x2014;if it were not for pressure of work&#x2014;he modestly refrains from appearing on the Benches today. It is because in spite of the adjustments, seasonal or otherwise, the figure of unemployment is unfortunately above the figure below which the other place will be missing the services of the right honourable gentleman the Member for Chingford. As noble Lords will remember, that honourable gentleman said that if unemployment was not below 3 million at the time of the election he would not be worthy of being elected a Member of Parliament. One can understand the noble Lord's reticence to appear today.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, echoed what the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, has said many times before, that suddenly we are on the threshold of a new heaven and a new earth. Production and productivity are increasing; the balance of payments is in swinging form; the exchange rate is magnificent;
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0377"/>
<col>737</col>
exports are rising; employment is increasing&#x2014;though unfortunately not in manufacturing and industry&#x2014;and everything is lovely. He cited a number of figures. Like the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, he was selective in the figures he quoted and was careful to refer to "after 1980". The intellectual effort to go back to 1979 was evidently too much. The noble Lord referred to the past two or three years&#x2014;he did not specify which. He referred to specific countries for specific years. I venture to suggest that, although what the noble Lord said was completely truthful, it was not the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<lb/>
I remember the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham (and doubtless he will recall the incident, too) when he boasted to the House that the Government had brought down inflation from 20 per cent. to 5 per cent.&#x2014;the figure that it was at the time. Such a statement was quite truthful, but not the whole truth. He did not say that inflation was 10&#x00B7;3 per cent. when the Conservatives took office, and that it was not until after they returned to power that the figure increased to over 21 per cent. Therefore, while it was quite truthful for him to say that they reduced the figure to 5 per cent., it was not the whole truth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03425"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord give way? Does it not occur to the noble Lord that perhaps that may have something to do with the legacy that we were left in 1979?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03426"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that the noble Lord must do his homework a little better. I gave the complete reasons for the increase in the rate of inflation in one of the first speeches that I made in your Lordships' House. I gave the precise figures&#x2014;for example, 4&#x00BD; per cent. of the increase was due to the fact that the rate of VAT was increased from 8 per cent. to 15 per cent; and the other figures are listed. Even the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, who, unhappily, departed to warmer and more lucrative climes, was unable to refute the figures that I gave on that occasion. I advise the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, to refer to the figures, or alternatively to reinforce himself from the usual sources, if one requires mathematical and factual verification.<lb/>
My noble friends will deal in some detail with various aspects of the Government's so-called achievements. They will consider their impact on the regions and the social services, and a number of other matters in detail, upon which, in the interests of time, I shall not touch. However, I am going to make one of their achievements very clear indeed. What they have done is to achieve the most massive shift of power to the owners of capital that has taken place since World War II.<lb/>
I venture to remind your Lordships of something of which I am quite sure you must be aware. The role of capital in civilised society is to provide the means of production and then it is for management and workers to produce the goods and services which supply our material needs. For this purpose it does not matter whether capital is in private hands or in public hands. A pound note does not change its look because it is in the hands of a private individual or in the hands of the Government. That is the function of capital.<lb/>
<col>738</col>
The Government have secured a massive shift of power and a massive excess of freedom to the owners of capital. The result has been very simple. The owners of capital have not found themselves subject to any particular social constraint or taken into account any particular social purpose as to where they put their money, whether at home or abroad. With the lifting of exchange controls as one of the first actions that this Government took after they first came into office in 1979, there has been a massive export of capital&#x2014;&#x00A3;111 billion since they took office.<lb/>
The noble Lord told us&#x2014;and I shall most certainly return to it later&#x2014;that there is a certain return of money to this country (I refer to "this country" geographically) by way of dividends and by way of other services that are provided; but whether they get into the pockets of ordinary people remains very much open to doubt. One thing is certain. Capital, free from its constraints, is invested wherever it is thought necessary in the world, in Europe or in this country, regardless of any kind of expressed or implied social responsibility for the country in which its owners live.<lb/>
The result has been very simple, and these are the figures that the noble Lord did not mention. The manufacturing output in the United Kingdom still remains 4 per cent. below what it was in 1979 and investment in manufacturing industry is 28 per cent. below what it was in 1979. Consequently there has been a massive increase in unemployment by 2 million, mainly concentrated in the manufacturing industries.<lb/>
It is said that we have prosperity. It is said that the economy is on the upturn and booming. We have to differentiate. We all have material needs and the Government themselves say that manufacturing industries have declined in other countries and manufacturing industries are of diminishing importance. If that be so, why is it that we are importing, in terms of manufactured goods, &#x00A3;30 billion worth of goods a year with a deficit, for the first time in our history, of some &#x00A3;5.8 billion in our exports of manufactures compared with our imports? Therefore manufactures are of importance in the supply of our material needs.<lb/>
Yet, in spite of the slightly artificial pre-election euphoria, in which it is suggested that everything is booming, it would be very difficult to find any reputable economist or reputable analyst who saw any future significant expansion of manufacturing industry in this country. That will apply while the financial constraints are free and it is more profitable to indulge in takeovers and mergers&#x2014;in fact, to do anything rather than perform the correct function of capital, which is to enter the tripartite arrangement to which I have referred; namely, in conjunction with management and workers, to produce the material needs of this country.<lb/>
Do the Government envisage, in the course of the next few years, our living merely on a diet of computer printouts? That is all that has been produced by the City of London in material terms. That is not going to be very much of a diet for the people of the United Kingdom. The fact is, of course, that this freedom has been used to make money out of money on terms that many may think are scandalous. Salaries are grossly excessive, some representing a 150 per cent. Increase
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0378"/>
<col>739</col>
in a year. Salaries of &#x00A3;283,000 per annum are quite common. Your Lordships will see on page 20 of today's <i>Independent</i> newspaper that tables of remuneration are set out. The amount of increases to the lower orders, who are merely costs so far as this Government are concerned, are limited to around about 5&#x00BD; per cent. per annum.<lb/>
This, then, is the achievement; to make capital dominant. Moreover, it has enabled capital to take strike action where necessary; to strike, to refuse to invest where social responsibility&#x2014;if there is such a thing as social responsibility&#x2014;dictates that it should.<lb/>
It is not the strike which is marked by the presence of pickets. It is not the strike which is marked by the presence of police. It is the strike which is consummated merely by the pressing of computer buttons which transfer sums of money from one side of the world to the other. This indeed is what has occurred and I well remember, when my party was in government and I was sitting on the Benches opposite, hearing the noble Viscount, Lord Watkinson, threatening at the time that we might have to face a strike of capital; and so indeed we have had selective strikes in that respect.<lb/>
In this role also the Government have had a part to play, because of course the Government do not govern any more. They are the mere creatures of capital; they have actually increased the power available to capital by the transfer of public assets to the private sector in terms of British Telecom, British Gas, British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and the transport undertakings&#x2014;all at prices which, if they were subjected to the Companies Acts in a public company, would make them liable for misfeasance for having flogged off assets below their value.<lb/>
At the same time they have done their duty in the process. What they have done is to endeavour to make this transfer of power to capital acceptable. They have done that by inducing small savers to transfer from their savings into ordinary shares so that one-fifth of the adult population have converted their savings into shares. Also, they have employed direct bribery to council tenants, with creative accounting invented by the Government, by selling off houses to tenants at half their real price in order to give them the illusion of somehow becoming capitalists themselves. They are the owners of shares instead of having their money in other forms of saving. Not all the people have money. Fifty per cent. of the population own only 6 per cent. of the United Kingdom's net disposable wealth. They are given the illusion of power through share ownership.<lb/>
The Government have also acted as the tool of capital by weakening the power of the trade unions, by progressively diminishing or abolishing minimum wage standards and by the reduction in local government powers. I was amused at Question Time this afternoon to hear accusations of local government being involved in creative accounting. If anyone has been guilty of creative accounting over the past eight years, it is the Government. They have euphemistically called the proceeds from the sale of assets&#x2014;in a term completely unknown to the accounting profession&#x2014;negative expenditure. The realisation of capital assets has enabled them to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement.<lb/>
<col>740</col>
Those are the achievements. The result has been large-scale unemployment through which our people have become imprisoned. Any talk of freedom becomes a complete irony to people who are denied any vista of freedom and who in many cases are denied even the ability to travel outside their own towns. Their lives are caged in by being denied the opportunity to work. There has also been damage to the social services and so forth.<lb/>
We shall have to make some decisions very quickly. They should of course be made in a general election if people were afforded the opportunity of having the issues placed squarely before them by an unbiased press and media. People will have to make a moral choice. We must make the choice of either running our country with a naked cash nexus, as the Marxists would put it, being the principal propellant for activity, or governing the country in the interest of all its people. Instead of the all pervasive greed, we must substitute enlightened self-interest combined with cooperation and a sense of responsibility.<lb/>
In place of envy, we should directly pursue competitive excellence. In place of fear, everyone should have the opportunity to work and therefore have the normal vista of freedom which the better off take completely for granted. Instead of despair, those who can work should have a sense of purpose, and for those without wages there should be the prospect of some serenity.<lb/>
One of the most frightening aspects in the lead up to this election has been the arrogance displayed by the Head of Government. It is true that the right honourable Lady the Prime Minister has not yet completely echoed Hitler's boast of a thousand years of the new Reich. But in true arrogance she has suggested that she should be in power for at any rate a further nine years because she wants to rid the country of Socialism. That, if anything, is arrogance. It is to be hoped that when the time comes they will know how to deal with it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03428"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on these Benches hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, will take his message to the hustings over the next three weeks. The Budget is a major instrument of economic policy. As such, it is based on assumptions about the state of the economy and predictions of its future development. I did not agree with a great deal of what the noble Lord said, but I agreed with his reference to the highly selective figures which had been given to create the impression of great success in our economy at present.<lb/>
I ask the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, to explain how he relates his figures to those given in the economic indicators in the current edition of the <i>Economist.</i> In case he has not read them, I shall draw his attention and that of your Lordships' House to what it has to say about the position over the past year and the past three months. The figures are for the 13 major industrial countries. I shall give the United Kingdom's ranking in relation to those 13 countries.<lb/>
Over the past year the increase in industrial production in the United Kingdom has been 2.6 per cent. The United Kingdom did not do badly because it ranked fourth of the 13 countries. Over the past
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0379"/>
<col>741</col>
three months&#x2014;of course three months is a short period and there can be many fluctuations and special factors during that time&#x2014;the figure was 1.3 per cent., and the United Kingdom ranked eighth. Over the past year unemployment averaged 11.6 per cent. and the United Kingdom ranked ninth. Over the past three months, unemployment has indeed fallen to 11 per cent. and the United Kingdom ranked eighth.<lb/>
Inflation has been the Government's boasted success. We welcome any improvement in inflation, as indeed must everyone who cares about the country's development and people's standard of living. Over the past year the average has been 4.4 per cent. and the United Kingdom was ninth. Over the past three months inflation rose to 4.9 per cent. and the United Kingdom was tenth. Over the past year wages and earnings increased by 7.5 per cent. and the United Kingdom ranked twelfth. In the past three months that figure has increased to 8.5 per cent. and the United Kingdom ranked twelfth.<lb/>
It is difficult to equate those figures with the rosy picture that the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, has given. As the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, pointed out, he chose&#x2014;we all know this is the oldest trick in the statistical book&#x2014;1980, which was an especially low year. That meant that increases would seem extremely high. If one starts from a low base, it is not difficult to achieve a high percentage increase. Surely 1980 was the year that we would expect to be pretty low. It was one year of Conservative Government following five years of Labour Government. What would one expect from that mixture? One would expect what happened&#x2014;an all-time low. So much for the figures; so much for the rosy forecast based on those figures.<lb/>
We do not see the picture as the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, presented it. We grant that there have been some successes. There has been a reduction in inflation. There has been a slight improvement in growth rates. The picture is better than it was. It certainly does not justify the self-praise and eulogies that have been given to it not only by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon&#x2014;he is doing his best this afternoon with a difficult brief&#x2014;but by his lord and master, the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, to whom many of us have made these same comments in one form or another on a number of occasions.<lb/>
What we see in the country is a widening of the gap between the poor and the rich with a despairing group of long-term unemployed who have given up hope to a considerable extent. That does not look well against the figures, and it does not bear out the opportunities and air of hope that the noble Lord has tried to convey to us this afternoon.<lb/>
We see also that in many ways we are not comparing favourably with the countries with which we have to compete. It is not much good looking just at the figures showing what we in this country are doing unless we look at comparable figures for other countries, because we have to compete with them. If we are making progress but they are making faster progress, we are still losing out. That is what is going on in a great many areas at present.<lb/>
Given our interpretation of the real economic situation, we on these Benches would not have handled the Budget in the way that it has been handled
<col>742</col>
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We would not have cut 2p off income tax. We do not believe that the problems confronting the country can be dealt with just by throwing money at them. We know that parties and politicians who advocate that are appealing simply to the electorate. That kind of promise cannot be fulfilled except at a price, which the poorest would themselves have to pay.<lb/>
However, when one has money to dispose of&#x2014;there cannot be a 2p cut in income tax unless there is money to dispose of&#x2014;a responsible Government, faced with the situation in this country, have to ask themselves very carefully how that money should be distributed&#x2014;not, we say, in a 2p cut; not, we say, in maintaining for the higher income groups a level of mortagage interest rates that benefits those who are already best off and, incidentally, that tends to put up the already excessive price of houses.<lb/>
We would use the money available in a quite different way. We see the problems of the country under three main heads. The need to revive industry must be the first, and with industry in particular but not exclusively we include manufacturing industry. We do not mean just small businesses. Small businesses have their place but they depend to a large extent on larger businesses, larger manufacturing industry, to which they act as sub-contractors and which they service in one way or another. The recovery of industry on a much greater scale than anything done so far is one direction in which the extra money should be aimed.<lb/>
What is it that we should like to see? We should like to see an increase in research and development expenditure. In your Lordships' House recently we had an outstanding debate on our failure adequately to provide for civilian research. The research money that is being spent, as everyone knows, to an excessive extent, is going into defence and not into commercial research. I point out to your Lordships that our expenditure on commercial research is very much less than expenditure on commercial research in both Japan and the United States. That is a direction in which we would wish to go, linked with&#x2014;this is of course a part of it&#x2014;an attempt to revive and encourage research in universities. This we debated last week. How can the Government be so complacent about the longer term development of the country when research is so low and the people carrying out the research are leaving the country, as we all know they are?<lb/>
Along with that, we would put far more money into the training and retraining of the older population to fill the jobs which are coming on stream but which we shall not be able to fill unless we spend money on proper training to convert people from older skills or give people who have never had it the chance to acquire skills in their more mature life.<lb/>
We would encourage industry in other ways too. We should like to see a 25 per cent. cut regionally, selectively, in the employer's national insurance contribution. This is one way in which one can help both industry and unemployment. Unemployment is the second target, the second area in which we should like to see expenditure to encourage industry in this and other ways to take on more people. The reduction in national insurance contribution is an obvious start
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0380"/>
<col>743</col>
in this direction to encourage industry and to help the unemployed, with greater training opportunities for the adult population.<lb/>
We recognise that the Government have put a good deal of money into the training of younger people, but the training of older people still lags sadly behind. Along with this there should be training and carefully selected job creation in infrastructure, and particularly expenditure on the kind of capital development which will have to be undertaken sooner or later. We have said this very often in your Lordships' House. A little has been done but nothing like enough in the form of road and railway development, and above all perhaps on the maintenance and insulation of housing, which is so badly needed as a way of preventing deterioration in one of the country's most important capital assets.<lb/>
We would also devote some of the resources that the Government have seen fit in our view to squander on a straight attack on the alleviation of poverty. We know that throughout the country there are a large number of people who because of long-term unemployment are living at a deplorably low standards, while the growth of the ageing population continues apace.<lb/>
We need to spend more money on the sharp end of the social services. There has been a great deal of talk about community care. Community care is a hollow mockery unless backed by money and by some of those resources that have been used in tax cuts and other ways by the Government to help their own supporters. That money should have gone into expenditure on community care to make it a reality.<lb/>
That is how we should have liked to see the Budget go. Of course it is not surprising that we do not agree with the Government. We disagree with their analysis and with their objectives. We hope soon to be able to make them change their minds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03429">4.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03430"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can agree with one comment of the noble Baroness, Lady Seear; namely, that in our discussions on the condition and working of the economy we are right and sensible to use as a check comparison with conditions in other countries.<lb/>
One comes straightaway in that matter to the question of unemployment. Unemployment, as the noble Baroness knows, is sadly endemic in practically all the major developed countries of the world and has resulted from many causes&#x2014;common causes affecting them all in greater or less degree. If one is making a comparison, it is only fair to point out that the creation of new jobs in this country in the last year or two has been a great deal better than in the countries of our neighbours in Europe.<lb/>
I accept at once, therefore, that one should make these comparisons, although I am afraid that they drive me to a totally different conclusion from that of the noble Baroness. She referred to the reduction in income tax provided in the Bill and said that she and her party would have used the money in a different way. That begs every question, does it not? It begs the question whether available funds should be laid out by the Government in the way that the Government
<col>744</col>
think fit, or whether they should be allowed&#x2014;I am sure that the noble Baroness will like a quotation from Mr. Gladstone&#x2014;to fructify in the pockets of the people. In other words, will your economy work better if the major control of spending is organised and run by government or, if a very substantial amount of it is done not by government but by individuals, by companies and unofficial bodies?<lb/>
Perhaps I may take up the comparison with other countries which was made by the noble Baroness. It is the unchallengeable fact that the two economies in the world that are doing best today&#x2014;those of the United States and Japan&#x2014;are the economies of countries which spend a smaller proportion of the gross national product with the government and have lower levels of taxation than we have. It is therefore so easy, particularly if one is a kind-hearted person like the noble Baroness, to think of all the good directions in which public money could be spent and no doubt very pleasantly and agreeably so. However, with respect, it is ducking the central question of our discussions: whether one wishes to see the main management of the economy and of spending in the hands of central government or whether one wishes to see it widely dispersed, with the private citizen and private individual having a larger say in the management of those funds and the management of the economy. That is the difference.<lb/>
I was not surprised to hear that line taken by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. This is the traditional, old-fashioned Labour view. I was rather surprised to hear it from the Leader of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party at one time used to have a certain belief in the beneficial values of private enterprise&#x2014;a belief which was not very conspicuously brought out by the noble Baroness this afternoon.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, had enormous fun, as he thought, with the general question of the use of funds. However, I should like to tell him in all seriousness how much I resented his personal criticism of the Prime Minister, which is wholly uncalled for. Perhaps the noble Lord speaks with a certain expertise on the subject, but to talk about arrogance in criticising the Leader of a party who has a policy in which she believes&#x2014;a policy which she does not claim for one moment has yet fully come to fruition, and who therefore wants the people of this country to give her the authority to continue, and to carry through the job to the end&#x2014;indicates a certain deficiency in the English vocabulary of the person who does so.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, said a great deal at very considerable length about the general freedom that had been given to capital which he thought was terrible. Who does he think should have that freedom? Is it central government? Apparently he does not know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03431"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is very kind. In the course of the remarks that I ventured to address to your Lordships I conveyed that freedom should be accompanied by responsibility and a sense of social responsibility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03432"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is the most splendid platitude that I have heard for some time, even from the noble Lord. However, it does not
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0381"/>
<col>745</col>
answer the question. He knows that perfectly well. He is arguing basically that control of capital and control of investment should be in the hands of government. That is socialism. That is the policy of the Labour Party here and of socialist governments throughout the world. It is not without significance that those socialist governments throughout the world are doing a great deal worse in the present economic situation than the governments of the countries that pursue a more open and freer enterprise policy.<lb/>
It is not enough just to criticise that freedom has been given to capital. Of course what the noble Lord was getting at&#x2014;and I think at one point that he said so&#x2014;was the abolition of exchange controls. That is finally dealt with in Clause 68 of the Bill. It is interesting, however, to see how that has worked in practice. The knowledge that we have no exchange control restrictions in this country has proved an enormous attraction to foreign investors whose investment in this country has greatly increased. They have confidence that if they place their funds here they will not be trapped by some governmental action, that those funds can be placed here to work remuneratively, and that this is a good country, particularly under its present Government, in which to invest.<lb/>
The noble Lord seemed to think that because exchange control had been abolished there had been a fall off in investment in this country. Of course he is quite wrong. Last year the total investment in this country was &#x00A3;60 billion, the highest level ever recorded. Therefore, to argue that because the Government have abolished exchange control that investment has been restricted does not for a moment hold water. On the contrary, the fact that the Government have directed the British economy into the open area of advanced companies, advanced countries, and advanced economies in which trade is allowed to flourish, in which it is not restricted by government inhibitions or Government prejudices is one of the reasons why investment in this country was at a record level last year. Therefore, with respect, the noble Lord has no basis whatever for attacking the Government on those lines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03433"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. For the convenience of the House and the record I should be glad if the noble Lord would confirm that he said that outside investment in this country last year was &#x00A3;50 billion?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03434"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. I said nothing of the kind. I said that total investment was &#x00A3;60 billion. The noble Lord got the figure wrong. That is total investment in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03435"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03436"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a great deal of it was from British funds, and some was from foreign funds. I do not have the breakdown of the figures, nor do I think it material to my argument.<lb/>
The noble Lord was strangely, and for him unaccustomedly, silent on the major feature of this Finance Bill&#x2014;that is, the reduction of 2p in the standard rate of income tax. The noble Baroness, Lady Seear, to her credit, referred to it, but the noble Lord
<col>746</col>
did not. This is very interesting. The party of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, has stated publicly that were it to be elected and come to power it would reverse that. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, is prepared to confirm that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03437"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes. The noble Lord may not have been here at the time, or he may have been distracted, but if he reads <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow he will find that I specifically referred to the reduction in the rate of income tax. I am sorry to correct him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03438"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that was not the question I asked. I asked whether it is the policy of his party to reverse that cut.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03439"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have confirmed that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03440"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is. The noble Lord seems extraordinarily shy on the subject. In this coming week millions of people, will receive an improvement in their paypacket of just under &#x00A3;4 a week in respect of a man of average earnings with a wife and two children, up to a couple of pounds a week for someone at half average wages. To all those people who will receive this improvement, the Labour Party is saying "As soon as we get to power we will take it away from you". I wonder whether the noble Lord is altogether happy about that. Does he not appreciate the extraordinary value of being able to reduce the burden of direct taxation in this way?<lb/>
First, it means&#x2014;I have given some of the figures&#x2014;that the level of take-home pay for a man on average earnings can be substantially increased without increasing at all the labour costs of the industry in which he works. There has been some comment from those who have been critical of the performance of our economy that in certain industries wage costs have risen a little dangerously; but if you are able to say to people "You need not receive an increase in your nominal wages because you will get more through the reduction of taxation with the state taking less", you are benefiting the natural wishes of those who want naturally, as we all do, an improvement in their position without the inflationary effect of forcing up wages.<lb/>
This is an enormous practical advantage. There are many others. There is the stimulus that this gives to enterprise, the stimulus to harder work, the knowledge that if someone does overtime he will receive a larger proportion of those overtime earnings to keep and to use.<lb/>
Taxation in this country is still by world standards high. The proposals in the present Bill do not touch the higher rates and there is a considerable gap now developing between the standard rate and the first of the higher rates. From 27 per cent. to 40 per cent. is an enormous jump, and some time in the future some government may have to tackle that. We are still (the noble Lord himself said so) a highly taxed country. Therefore when a proposal is made for reducing&#x2014;and reducing on this occasion only the standard rate of income tax&#x2014;to come forward and say that it will be
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0382"/>
<col>747</col>
reversed at the first available opportunity is a startling proposition.<lb/>
I wonder whether the noble Lord does not realise that he is strongly fortifying the feelings of those people who believe that the Labour Party is a party that likes high taxation for its own sake; that feels that people should not be allowed to have a very large proportion of their earnings to spend themselves; that a beneficent and benevolent state should take it from them and spend it on such purposes as that state thinks good. This is where I ask the noble Lord to accept that there is a profound difference between him, his noble friends and his honourable friends in another place and those of us on this side of the House. We accept that the major purposes of the state have to be served, and properly served, but the idea of retaining an unnecessarily high level of taxation for its own sake is abhorrent to us, as I have no doubt it will be abhorrent to a great many people outside when this is fully understood.<lb/>
There are many other excellent aspects of the Bill. The reduction in the duty on unleaded petrol is an excellent improvement. The only further comment I shall make will be on the main criticism that the noble Lord made. We all of us&#x2014;it has been said so often but I think it can bear being said again&#x2014;wish to see not only a continuation of the improvement in our nation's economy, but we wish to see that operating, as I believe it is beginning to operate, on the total figures of unemployment.<lb/>
But I believe, and I think many of us believe, that that beneficial effect will be achieved not by taking large sums in taxation and expending it through government machinery, but by spreading that wealth as wide as possible so that it stimulates the creation of further wealth and thereby will bring people back not into temporary jobs created by government expenditure but into real and permanent jobs created by companies that are creating wealth. That is the prospect which I believe, in the light of what my noble friend Lord Brabazon said earlier, is close to us if we have the determination to go ahead to get it.<lb/>
I venture to end on what I hope the noble Lord will not regard as a frivolous note, by saying that when next week the wage packets of those on PAYE appear so much larger than they did last week there will be one or two people who will drink the health of Mr. Lawson.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03441">5.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03442"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I start on a slightly personal note. May I say what a pleasure it is for me to follow the noble Lord in this debate? He does not know it, but some 25 years ago I was a very junior economist in the Treasury when he was a very senior Minister. I fancied myself as a forecaster in those days, as I still do, but I should never have forecast that both he and I would sit together in your Lordships' House. I suppose that if I had been able to forecast that I should also have forecast that he and I would sit on opposite sides and disagree in the debate today.<lb/>
Indeed it is also of interest, following the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, how one can look at the same reality and get a different perception of the events&#x2014;a point that the noble Baroness, Lady
<col>748</col>
Seear, also made. I do not think that happens just because there is a little whiff of politics in the air or even because economists are notoriously disputatious people, although they are and I am one of the worst of the breed. There are genuine differences in the way one views the economy and in what one feels ought to be done. I shall enlarge on those in due course.<lb/>
I always believe in starting by saying where I agree with the people with whom I shall mostly argue. I certainly agree with one or two aspects of the Government's policy; the emphasis they place&#x2014;although they are following earlier policies&#x2014;on intensifying training and in general on investing in human beings, human capital as we call it. That is an extremely sensible policy. Emphasis on improving the workings of the labour market is clearly sensible. The emphasis they place, which again is following earlier administrations, on the need to raise productivity in both the private and public sectors is one that I should place myself.<lb/>
If we have any future at all it must lie along the productivity route; we all agree on that. I even might say slightly cynically that the Government, at least some of the time, seem to want us to agree with them about public expenditure. It depends on which debate one is taking part in, but in discussing the public services the Government want to convince us that on those occasions public expenditure is a very good thing. However, I should go further. I believe it is worth saying that it is a good thing on a general economics debate. They are the areas of agreement.<lb/>
However, on one aspect of this I am a trifle puzzled. It has to do with policies with respect to the labour market and all that. I refer in particular to a remark made by the Secretary of State for Employment the other day at Question Time when he was discussing the restart scheme. He linked that programme or scheme to the availability for work criterion. Surely the availability for work criterion is that a worker would be willing to accept a suitable job on more or less the going rate but with the usual conditions.<lb/>
The point about the restart programme is that it is not linked to a specific job offer. It would be infinitely better if it were. Therefore it seems to me that a failure to co-operate with restart may be regrettable on some grounds, but I am bound to say it is not all that irrational on the part of workers who fully appreciate the depressed state of the labour market. A failure to co-operate with the restart scheme should surely never be grounds for threatening to end benefits. I should like the point made by the Secretary of State on that matter to be clarified.<lb/>
The real issues here are to look at the Government's record and to note the paradoxes about it&#x2014;the fact that government expenditure relative to national income is relatively high and the Government cannot make up their mind whether they like that or not. One reason for that is that national income is relatively low. Taxation relative to income is high.<lb/>
Much more important within the context of some of the Government's beliefs is that we have the highest real interest rates in the world, and that famous indicator of the stance of policy, the money supply, notably sterling M3&#x2014;although I gather from this morning's papers that it is going to be re-named, but
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0383"/>
<col>749</col>
I have not caught on to what its new name is going to be&#x2014;is rising at an extraordinarily high rate. I should like an explanation of why that is no longer as dangerous as we were led to believe for so long. There are certain paradoxical aspects of the Government's record which are worth bearing in mind.<lb/>
Another aspect of the matter that I draw your Lordships' attention to takes us back a long way. It relates to my opening remarks. People have talked a bit about performance relative to 1979 and other bases. What interests me in assessing the record is, say, performance relative to the 1960s. Many people on that side of your Lordships' House and their colleagues in the other place tell us how terrible the 1960s were. But if you make a proper comparison the position is quite startling.<lb/>
In fact the rate of rise of gross domestic product per capita in the 1960s was significantly higher than it has been in the last seven or eight years. Even the much vaunted improvement in the rate of manufacturing productivity&#x2014;and it is to be welcomed&#x2014;is hardly any larger than it was in the dreadful 1960s. Of course our favourite is the inflation rate. During the period when I was taught economics and in the 1960s we were always arguing that the inflation rate was too high. We have to do something about it. Typically in the 1960s it was 4 per cent. per annum. We are now told that 4 per cent. per annum represents a spectacularly good achievement.<lb/>
But the major comparison to make is with unemployment. Average unemployment in the 1960s was under half a million. I do not want to bandy words about whether this or that is a better measure of the total amount of unemployment at the present time, but no ones seems to disagree that it is more than 3 million, and that is an enormously large number.<lb/>
We are not uninterested in these matters on this side of the House. We are interested in fighting inflation. I must tell your Lordships that both in the 1960s and the 1970s when I was a government adviser if I had been told that one of the rules of the game was not to keep unemployment low but that one could let it drift up to 3 million, I should not have found it in the least difficult to devise policies or to suggest initiatives that would have brought the inflation rate down, except that I should have got it down well below 4 per cent. per annum. A government, who having created unemployment of 3 million, cannot get inflation down to zero are about as incompetent as can be.<lb/>
I view what has happened in the 1980s, if I may use a football analogy, with the notion that our side is not scoring any goals and the other side is, because the other side, so far as the referee is concerned, has changed the offside law and there is no offside for it whereas we are still stuck with the same set of rules. That is not as good an analogy as it sounded when I started off. What I am saying is that the rules seem to have changed if a figure of 3 million unemployed is now acceptable.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Minister whether that really is the case. One of the things I am fearful about&#x2014;and I know we always have to be arguing this politically but it is not entirely a political point&#x2014;is whether noble Lords opposite and their friends in the other House
<col>750</col>
have now more or less settled for a number like 3 million unemployed as the way to run the system indefinitely, give or take a hundred thousand.<lb/>
If they have, then this is an apalling state of affairs in the policies of one of the great parties of our nation. It is not that long, 40 years or so, since the famous unemployment White Paper, when we were committed to full employment. If now the Government either wish to define 3 million as full employment or to say that they no longer regard that as a desirable or attainable objective, that is serious. I should like to know the Minister's view.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, referred to the tax cuts and the reluctance, as it were, to acknowledge the reversal of them. I have no reluctance whatsoever. Just before I joined your Lordships' House I spent quiet a bit of my spare time advising Shadow Ministers in the other House. I was absolutely adament that were the Government to decide to cut taxes in the forthcoming Budget it was a matter of honesty to say that were our party to be in power we should reverse those cuts. I say that in terms to the noble Lord.<lb/>
I go further. One of the things I find most unattractive about the Budget speech and the Finance Bill is that the Government did not index the excise, which in a sense is an implicit tax cut. I would reverse that as well. I am absolutely confident that were the present Government re-elected they would find it necessary to reverse those implicit cuts in the next Budget. They would find it necessary to put at least the correct rate of duty back on alocholic drinks and on cigarettes, and not merely for general economic policy grounds but on broader social policy grounds. If I may reassure at least the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, about my "honesty" I object to both those tax cuts.<lb/>
I object to the direct tax cuts on economic grounds. On economic theoretic grounds there is no basis whatsoever for the so-called incentive arguments about cuts in direct taxation. This is old doctrine. Lord Robbins, who regretfully is no longer with us but was a Member of this House, was one of the first to demonstrate in the clearest possible terms that there was no theoretical foundation for that view. What is also of great interest, since I believe that the Treasury has commissioned various studies on this subject, is that there is no empirical basis for the view that direct tax cuts are beneficial.<lb/>
I would agree with the noble Lord if what he then said was that we could also use our judgment. We neither believe the economic theory nor the empirics. But at least one ought to recognise that to take the other view, the view that tax cuts are beneficial, flies in the face of pretty well all that is known on the subject.<lb/>
The other reason for objecting to the tax cuts is not a wilful desire not to cut taxes or to have higher taxes. It is simply that there is a better way of using the resources. This goes back to my original point that one is debating what you would do with available resources. What my noble friend Lord Bruce and the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, said, and what I say, is that there are at this time in the economy better ways. If we have resources we can use at this time there are better ways in terms of expenditure on education, on health and on urban renewal. There are better ways of using these resources.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0384"/>
<col>751</col>
To go back to my search for agreement I believe that the Minister might well say that he thinks that as well, but he is not allowed to say that because he has to defend the position as it is in the Finance Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03444"><member>Lord Peston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not mean the Minister himself. What I mean is that I am struck by how other Ministers on his side of the House will often tell us how valuable it is to spend money in those areas. I apologise to him for suggesting that he might think it was a good idea to spend more money on health, education, or any of the matters I mentioned. I strongly apologise, but I have heard some of his colleagues say that.<lb/>
If you believe in the incentives argument, then the main incentive is one that the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, mentioned, which is cuts in the national insurance contribution of employers. They are a genuine disincentive to taking people into work. Therefore if there are resources available, those are where one ought to place them.<lb/>
I discover, much to my regret, that I have prepared many more notes than I have time to enlarge on, but there is one final matter I should like to state&#x2014;a more doctrinaire matter. It is sometimes said that the views of economists like myself are somewhat old-fashioned in that they were valid up to the 1970s but are not so any more. Setting aside the curiosity that members opposite regard the age of a doctrine as a bad characteristic, it is worth noting that the economic views that they appear to hold go back a long way. They were rampant in the 1920s and 1930s when they were held steadfastly in order to justify similar complacency about unemployment then as now. They were then incorrect and were convincingly shown to be so.<lb/>
Unfortunately, unlike the natural sciences, error in economics can never be finally scotched. It remains and needs to be dealt with in every generation. I must take issue here with my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington because I believe that he is criticising the Government for changing their economic position and doctrines. My noble friend seemed to imply that they were turning round a little and becoming a little spineless and wet, in the same way as some of us. I am not certain that he was saying that&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

It is precisely the time when one should congratulate them.<lb/>
<col>752</col>
It seems to me that the time has come when not only do we need to change direction but we must intensify the change. Regretfully for Members opposite, but not for Members on this side of the House, that will require certain changes in political events of which we have no part but to which I look forward.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03448"><member>Viscount Chandos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I should have enjoyed being a student of the noble Lord, Lord Peston. The opportunity to debate even the truncated Finance Bill which the Government have now proposed is most welcome because the economic policies of the Government, which this Bill symbolises, are the single most important factor in the election campaign now under way. In this area your Lordships' House does not have the same detailed revision role as it has in respect of other legislation. Therefore the removal of the more complex clauses from the Bill may strike a less discordant note with your Lordships than with our colleagues in another place.<lb/>
All the same, in the Government's unseemly haste to call what the <i>Financial Times</i> today described as "this unnecessary election", a good deal of wheat has been thrown out with the chaff, as your Lordships' House is more acutely aware in connection with other legislation. Measures as important as those covering profit-linked pay do not deserve to be discarded like a used paper handkerchief, however confident the Government may be, in their complacency, that they will be in a position to reintroduce the measures after the election. I am not sure that the country will associate this with good government.<lb/>
Predictably, the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, based his opening speech on the strength of the economy and the evidence that that provided for the success of the Government's eight years of economic policy. Not only are those claims disputable, as other noble Lords have shown, but there is a logical gap in atttributing the improvements that there have been to the Government's premeditated policies. In today's <i>Financial Times</i> the authoritative commentator Samuel Brittan wrote:
<quote>"The achievement of a real growth rate above that of other countries is mainly due to last year's successful sterling devaluation".</quote>
He went on to say:
<quote>"The Thatcher Government did of course let sterling soar in its first two years of office; and nearly all the serious argument about its degree of responsibility for the unemployment explosion goes back to the those years".</quote>
The devaluation in the past year may have been successful but it was largely accidental, judging by the Government's stated economic objectives during this period; while the appreciation of sterling from 1979 to 1981, as Mr. Brittan rightly analyses, had a devastating effect on manufacturing industry's competitiveness, which can still be felt six years later. I differ from Mr. Britian in believing that such devastation needed to be precipitated to stimulate the necessary blitz on overmanning and productivity turn around.<lb/>
It is ironic that today, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said, the Bank of England announced its
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0385"/>
<col>753</col>
intention to provide information on yet two more aggregates of broad money supply with the words:
<quote>"Any choice of a dividing line between those financial assets included in, and those excluded from, broad money is to a degree arbitrary, and is likely over time to be invalidated by developments in the financial system'".</quote>
I am sure that the victims of the Government's early obsession with monetary targets will find comfort as they wait in the queue for employment, by this change of heart. But a favourable gloss on our economic performance can no doubt be put by the Government for three reasons. First, if sufficient damage can be done in early years, any recovery can be portrayed as a success, as other noble Lords have pointed out. Secondly, as my colleagues in the Alliance and I have always acknowledged, there have been some modest successes. Thirdly, the Conservative Party propaganda machine, recently operating so effortlessly with what should be the non-political government information services, will find imaginative and creative ways of portraying near disaster as heroic triumph.<lb/>
It is over two years since I suggested to the Government Front Bench that their policies resembled the business activities of the asset strippers of the 1960s, selling national assets to make the books balance, whatever the consequences for the customers and the country, while preparing a false prospectus for the country laced with creative accounting. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, has already used that phrase. We are now at a point where that false prospectus is about to be issued once more, and I believe that the vast majority of the country who are older, wiser and, if not all poorer many not much richer, will be very critical readers of that prospectus. Of course since the 1960s asset stripping has been replaced by corporate raiding, but the activity remains essentially the same and the Government's right to be called the raiders of the lost economy remains unchallenged.<lb/>
Every corporate raider, having acquired its new victim, achieves a miraculous turn around in profitability through spectacular economies achieved by closing down the head office, attacking marketing expenditure, slashing research and development budgets and declaring a pension fund holiday. With their cuts, the only thing that the Government seem to have forgotten to do is to close down the head office.<lb/>
The Alliance have this week issued their new prospectus, as my noble ally Lady Seear has said. Supported by an independent review of its fiscal viability, it outlines the increase in investment in those areas where the Government have been and are continuing to propose the most harmful cuts. For instance, in the Department of Trade and Industry's budget for assisting industrial research and development, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, said, we are proposing an 80 per cent. rise in cash terms after five years and a doubling of support for export promotion in the same period.<lb/>
In adult and higher education an extra &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;2 billion is projected over the period, and an extra &#x00A3;400 million is projected for the funding of scientific research councils for which the Government are proposing the sharpest cuts in real support. Those are the long-term investments which are needed; not to boost our economic performance this year so that we can boast
<col>754</col>
of being top of the league table among European and other developed countries, such as a take-over creditor comparing his growth in short-term profitability with that of his projected victim, but to give us some chance of having a successful and prosperous economy in the decade to come.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, last month issued his customary dire warnings of retribution for the Alliance's failure to support his unsuccessful amendment to the Banking Bill, with its flawed design to alleviate the serious plight of the developing countries, I should like to draw his attention to the projections in the Alliance prospectus of more than a &#x00A3;4 billion increase in overseas aid in the next five years, to a level by the early 1990s of 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. of gross domestic product, which is the United Nations' target.<lb/>
I cannot mention the phrase "rates of taxation" without taking up the challenge issued in another place to demonstrate the consistency of the Alliance's policy towards the Government's reduction in the standard rate of income tax, incorporated, by some odd coincidence, within even the truncated Finance Bill. As my noble ally Lady Seear has already said, as have my colleagues in another place, we would not have judged this income tax cut to be the fairest and most prudent way of exploiting the current short-term buoyancy of the economy and hence of the Government's tax receipts. The Government themselves, with their declared objective of lowering the standard rate to 25 pence in the pound, have had to make a judgment of what would be fair and prudent, as well as, I dare say, of what electorally would be most beneficial.<lb/>
I am sure that many of your Lordships would agree that, by cutting income tax by only half their remaining targeted amount and thereby having a little more room for manoeuvre on public spending and for restraint of the apparent government funding requirement, the Government are trying to have it both ways. It is no less consistent for us in the Alliance to say that, the tax cuts now proposed having been enacted, an immediate reversal might be counterproductive and unhelpful for many taxpayers who in all sincerity would have agreed originally to forgo a tax cut for improvements to education, health and employment but who are now budgeting on the promised change. Families, like companies, cannot be expected to plan their life and prosper in a constantly and unnecessarily changing environment.<lb/>
For that reason the Alliance would not reverse the tax change on taking office and has drawn up its plans, as outlined in the prospectus published this week, on the basis of the 27p standard rate proposed by the Government. Whatever government hold office after 11th June will thereafter need to review the levels of taxation on an orderly timetable in the light of the progress of the economy and a fair and balanced judgment of priorities in ever-changing circumstances.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, supported the principle of international comparisons by citing the strong economic performances of the United States and Japan, with their low levels of taxation. However, if my memory is correct I believe that the top marginal rate of taxation in Japan is 70 per cent.&#x2014;10 per cent. higher than in this country. That is
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0386"/>
<col>755</col>
perhaps a salutary illustration that levels of taxation, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said, are not the only or even the most important influence on enterprise and economic success. But I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, may not really have wished to encourage noble Lords on the Labour Front Bench to increase taxation to comparable higher levels.<lb/>
As your Lordships' House has a heavy programme still before it today, I should like to address only one other subject: the financing of the Alliance's proposed programme of spending. With the necessary increase in public expenditure, combined with the elimination of those cases of privatisation where the interests of the industry, the consumer or taxpayers are damaged, there is an inevitable but modest increase in the future borrowing requirement, but only to a level of under 2 per cent. of gross domestic product. Such a requirement, still of less than &#x00A3;,10 billion, in any of the future five years projected would be financeable through the sale of gilts and other government debt without any necessary increase in interest rates and with less disruption to the financing requirements of manufacturing companies which the Government have created through their excessive and headlong privatisation programme.<lb/>
I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, who treated with some ridicule my suggestion during the arduous passage of the Gas Bill that the Government's proposed privatisation programme risked squeezing out and disrupting corporate fund raising. I wonder whether the noble Lord might now be able to comment on press reports that in February the Treasury, against the strong advice of the Bank of England, insisted, in order to give the sale of British Airways the fairest of winds, that every sector of the sterling capital markets, even the Euro-sterling bond market, was closed for a week, leading to a period of considerable excess activity subsequently and consequent indigestion.<lb/>
This Finance Bill represents an inglorious finale to this Government's eight years of economic mismanagement, and I am sure that all noble Lords on this side of the House look forward to the opportunity of the coming general election, however cynically timed, to ensure that these policies are changed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03449">5.36 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03450"><member>Lord Strathclyde</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I begin, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, for not being here when he was speaking. Unfortunately, all the efforts of London Transport could not quite get me here on time.<lb/>
Unlike the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, I believe that the Bill shows all the hallmarks of the responsible approach to financial management that this Government have taken since first being elected in 1979. The Chancellor was able to reduce the PSBR and reduce income tax against a background of real economic growth, lower inflation and the start of a sustained fall in unemployment figures. This is a creditable and extraordinary achievement, reached by continued good sense over the years.<lb/>
Since the Budget, interest rates have fallen considerably in response to the Chancellor's words,
<col>756</col>
which will give industry the boost it has wanted and thus lead to the prosperity which is ultimately what we all want. I do not think this situation would have been possible had the policies recommended by noble Lords opposite been followed.<lb/>
With the election almost on top of us, it is fair to reflect that the only reason the Labour Party feels it can promise so much excessive extra spending is due to this Government's careful stewardship of the country's financial situation over the last eight years. It is inconceivable that the Labour Party in 1979 could have dreamt of carrying out the policies which it now promises so glibly. The reason it could not promise them then is that it did not have the money; but today money saved by this Government goes towards real economic goals of reductions in borrowing and tax. If the criticism and advice expounded by the Opposition were to be taken seriously they would simply send us back down the road to the IMF, where we were a decade ago.<lb/>
At this point I should like to say a few words about the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. It was amazingly full of the most turgid dogma, reminiscent, with respect, of a very bored university lecturer talking to an even more bored bunch of first-year students. The phrase,
<quote>"capital controlling the means of production",</quote>
slipped so smoothly from his tongue. It sounds so oldfashioned&#x2014;though I know the noble Lord, Lord Peston, would tell us that it was not oldfashioned&#x2014;and almost laughable, except that for one moment I felt the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, actually believed what he was saying.<lb/>
It is not capital that counts. It is people who make economies grow, and it is this Government who put people first. Incidentally, would the noble Lord's party stop all the billions of pounds that have been invested in this country from abroad? Would he suddenly fling the barriers up and throw all that money back to the terrible foreigners to whom it belongs? And what about unemployment? I know the noble Lord, Lord Peston, mentioned this, but surely he realises that we now have over a million more people in employment than before, earning money and paying taxes. That is a real achievement.<lb/>
However, I am not here to discuss the past record of the Labour Government. It seems unlikely that they will ever be able to put their proposals into effect. I am here to congratulate the Government on their economic direction and in particular on the way in which this Bill has not been used to create an artificial pre-election boom, the consequences of which would have been disastrous. No, the Chancellor has seen that there is no need to bribe the electorate with large-scale cuts in income tax but has offered instead a gentle reduction over the years.<lb/>
I believe that the most valuable and relevant aspect of this Bill is the reduction in income tax. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, has already mentioned the point that a reduction of 2p does not sound much, but as an employer as well as an employee I can tell your Lordships that this reduction is extremely important in furthering the principle of allowing people to keep as much as possible of the money they earn.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0387"/>
<col>757</col>
There is nothing dishonest or selfish about that principle. It gives incentive and offers reward. I know that the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, disagrees, but when I was campaigning in Glasgow in the general election of 1979 and again in London in 1983, the message was the same from the young who had just received their first pay packets, from families and from those approaching retirement. They felt that they could spend their money far better and more wisely than any Chancellor could ever do. So I congratulate the Chancellor for listening to the people and for reducing their burden of direct taxation.<lb/>
Because of that tax cut, a married man on average earnings of &#x00A3;11,600 per annum will need a pay rise of only 2 per cent. this year to keep pace with inflation. That is a real success and one that I hope will continue. If I have any regret it is that there has been no reduction in the higher tax bands, especially since I feel that the jump from 27 per cent. to 40 per cent. is far too great. However, I believe that it is fair and correct that those on lower incomes should be the first to benefit from the nation's economic success.<lb/>
I welcome this Bill for its positive outlook and beneficial effects. I look forward to a new Finance Bill in the near future in a new Parliament under a new Conservative Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03452"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, better than anything else, the last speech demonstrates the wide gulf in attitudes to the management of the economy and fiscal policy in this country that exists between the Government and the Opposition. It is rather sad that although there are certainly people who benefit from the Budget, we have failed to hear from Members opposite anything about large sections of the community who not only get very little in comparison with others but have been disadvantaged by the way in which the Budget has been drawn up.<lb/>
Beneath the glitter, the tinsel and the dazzle of 2p off income tax the cold fact remains that a great opportunity has been lost. I do not underrate the remarks of the noble Lord about the usefulness of having 2p off income tax both to individual recipients and businesses, and I honestly believe that everyone including myself can find something kind to say about paying less tax. However, I think that the mood of the country, as it was indicated earlier this year and as I hope it will be reflected in the polls next month, showed that people of this country would be prepared to forgo a reduction in income tax if it would benefit the poorer sections of the community.<lb/>
Let us look at the Budget and at the additional and ancillary financial measures that form part of the Budget strategy. One sees that the single pensioner can look forward to an increase in his pension of 80p a week. Let us reflect on that&#x2014;80p a week. A married couple can look forward to receiving an increase of &#x00A3;1.30. If the Government had not decided to change the system that was in existence at the time they took office eight years ago and the option of deciding which of the higher methods were used had been taken, the single old-age pensioner would have received an increase of &#x00A3;7.20 a week and a married couple would have received &#x00A3;11.40 a week.<lb/>
<col>758</col>
I am speaking about little people who are not very articulate. They are affected by the Budget. Instead of offering tax cuts worth &#x00A3;3 billion, which admittedly will benefit a lot of people, the Chancellor and the Government could have used the money differently. They could have used the money to build 90,000 new houses. Anyone who has been a constituency MP, as many Members on both sides of the House have been, will realise that the housing problem is one of the most agonising problems to solve. However, that was the Government's choice. I believe that most of the people who will now enjoy a reduction of 2p in income tax, when faced with that kind of choice would have wanted to assist housing.<lb/>
Yet even if we do not consider 90,000 new houses, let us consider the 250,000 houses that could be repaired for that sum. This country has housing stock in very poor condition. The money could have been used to produce over 1&#x00BD; million nursery school places. One cannot say that the Government must do one thing or the other but I think that there are higher social priorities than cuts in income tax. The money could have provided day centres for 2&#x00BD; million old people or offered additional treatment in our hospitals for 3 million people, or the Government could have increased the old-age pension by &#x00A3;6 a week. I do not deny that the government of the day are entitled to decide how to spend the taxpayers' money. Every government can do that, However, I think that the Government's priorities are wrong.<lb/>
So far as jobs are concerned. all the measures of tax reduction are estimated to generate 80,000 jobs, but if the money had been used to target job creation 300,000 jobs would have been created. I repeat that a great opportunity has been lost.<lb/>
I should like to illustrate the enormous differences in incomes that the Government have not only sanctioned but encouraged. Reference has already been made to an article in the <i>Independent</i> newspaper today. On page 20 there is this statement:
<quote>"While the average director had a salary increase of 11 per cent. last year, the top 10 per cent. of directors received a rise of 18 per cent. And what might be called the 'A Team' of British managers, the top 10 per cent. of directors in large companies&#x2014;those with a turnover of more than &#x00A3;500 million&#x2014;saw their base salaries increase by a remarkable 45 per cent.".</quote>
The figures are given in percentages, but what do they actually mean? We are talking about the top 10 per cent. of chief executives earning salaries of &#x00A3;263,000 a year. They earn more in a week than many people are expected to survive on for a year. Directors earn &#x00A3;124,000 a year.<lb/>
Let me contrast those figures with another piece of government legislation that affects our kind of people. When changes in the statutory sick pay arrangements came into effect in April, which was the same time as the Budget, the Government who provided in the economy for the kind of salaries that I have just mentioned deliberately changed the rules. Prior to that time if one earned &#x00A3;74&#x00B7;50 per week or more&#x2014;as little as that&#x2014;statutory sick pay was &#x00A3;46&#x00B7;75. If one earned between &#x00A3;55&#x00B7;50 and &#x00A3;74&#x00B7;49, the sick pay was &#x00A3;39&#x00B7;20. If earnings ranged between &#x00A3;38 and &#x00A3;55 per week&#x2014;wages as low as that&#x2014;sick pay was &#x00A3;31. Instead of there being three bands of benefit the Government decided to reduce the number to two. At present if one
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0388"/>
<col>759</col>
earns &#x00A3;76&#x00B7;50 or more one receives &#x00A3;47&#x00B7;20; earning between &#x00A3;39 and &#x00A3;76 means receiving &#x00A3;32&#x00B7;85.<lb/>
What on earth is the noble Lord talking about? There is a whole section of people who would have come in the middle band when it was a three-tier system, who earned between &#x00A3;57 and &#x00A3;76&#x00B7;50 a week&#x2014;as low as that&#x2014;who will now in fact, because there are only two bands, lose &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;50 a week in benefit. We are talking about people who when in work are earning less than &#x00A3;80 a week and who when they are sick will get less than &#x00A3;40 per week. There are thousands of low paid workers, particularly shopworkers, and the Union of Shop, Distributive, and Allied Workers has drawn this to my attention.<lb/>
Is it not obscene and despicable that a Government who are proud of many things, not least the fact that they have distributed largesse of &#x00A3;3 billion, take action which results in people who are already living at a low level getting &#x00A3;6 a week less while they are sick? I think that noble Lords ought to reflect. I believe that they will be as angry as I am about the matter, if not ashamed.<lb/>
Let me conclude by saying how grateful is the friendly societies movement for an action by the Government which has benefited them. Clause 30 is enormously beneficial to that movement. I have declared my interest before and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who presided over the passage of the Financial Services Bill, was always kind when I mentioned the interests of the friendly societies.<lb/>
It is worth putting this on the record very briefly. In the Finance Act 1984, the tax exempt sum assured limit was reduced from &#x00A3;2,000 to &#x00A3;750 because at that time there were a great many new friendly societies which were acting in what I am sure the Minister and I would have said was an unpublic way of attracting business. That not only put out of business a great many people who did not deserve to be in business, but it also punished the traditional friendly societies&#x2014;the small, long-time serving friendly societies.<lb/>
This was pointed out to the Chancellor, and Mr. Ian Stewart in another place said, "Fair enough. If there is some damage to them, let us have a discussion". Discussions have taken place over a period of time. What the friendly societies wanted was something that would put them back to where they were, and I am told by them that they are highly delighted with the changes which have been made.<lb/>
Changing the limits from a sum assured base to a premium base allows policies of the type offered by traditional friendly societies, which have a relatively high emphasis on life cover per &#x00A3;1 premium, to be for realistic sums assured. So I should be grateful if the Minister would take back to his colleagues the thanks not only of the Ancient Order of Foresters, which has an interest in this, but of the whole movement, because in this one measure the Government have done a great deal to promote thrift and help continue in existence the friendly societies which serve the nation well. To show that I am a fair-minded man in these matters, I shall certainly look forward to the Minister's comments on the latter part of my speech much more than on the first part.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03454"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, noble Lords who have intervened in this debate so far have taken a broad view of the economic and financial policies of the Government and have expressed their views according to their particular party affiliations. This is absolutely right and proper, particularly in this context of an approaching election. But I feel at this stage that it might be helpful if I were to concentrate on a particular aspect of policy, because I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord Diamond, who will be summing up for the Alliance, will be taking a broad sweep of the economic and financial policies of the nation.<lb/>
I should like to start with the reference by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, to the Government's achievement in the reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement. There is no doubt that it has been reduced very substantially. But what he perhaps failed to mention for lack of time was that there were two exceptional items which contributed to that reduction; namely, the fiscal benefit of North Sea oil and gas and the massive sale of public assets. Both of these are extraordinary items which are likely in time to diminish in their effectiveness.<lb/>
I should like to restrict my comments to the privatisation of public assets, because I feel that that has been a most important part of the Government's economic and financial policy. It is a policy which they made clear they would seek to continue if they were returned to office. But at this stage it is not inappropriate to make some comments on what has happened so far and on what would be the implications if this policy were to be pursued in the future.<lb/>
When you look back on the Government's privatisation programme, you can see that it divides fairly neatly into two parts. The first part roughly corresponds with the Government's first period in office from 1979 to 1983, and a whole series of enterprises, which were either actually or potentially in a competitive situation, were then sold off into the private sector. I think many would agree that on the whole that was no bad thing. Certainly the Government's manifesto for 1979 was fairly restricted in its intent on privatisation. It referred to the privatisation of aerospace and shipbuilding, which, in the latter case, has not been completed yet, of buses and of national freight. It said that in regard to those industries which remain in public ownership the Government would try to see that they were enabled to run their businesses with the minimum of interference possible.<lb/>
However, in due course the Government's policy perceptibly changed, and that occurred in their current period in office, when they moved from the privatisation of smaller enterprises in a competitive situation to the privatisation of large-scale public utilities. That raised a whole new series of problems and, as it looks as if the Government, if returned again to power, would proceed in that direction and would seek possibly to privatise the water supply industry, the electricity industry, the Post Office and perhaps others, it is appropriate that we should ponder a bit about the implications of transfering large-scale monopolies in the form of public utilities from the public to the private sector.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0389"/>
<col>761</col>
It is notable that in the Government's manifesto for 1983 they said that,
<quote>"merely to replace state monopolies by private ones would be to waste an historic opportunity. So we will take steps to ensure that these new firms do not exploit their powerful positions to the detriment of consumers or their competitors".</quote>
Mr. John Moore, who was then Financial Secretary to the Treasury and who seems to have been the philosopher on privatisation, added to that to the effect that,
<quote>"we are not so naive as to think that an unrestrained monopoly in the private sector would be less inclined to exploit its position than the monopolies in the public sector".</quote>
So we have in those two statements acceptance, apparently, by government that monopolies are not a particularly desirable state of affairs, and that whether they are in the public or the private sector they are likely to use their monopoly position to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of others, unless restrained in some way.<lb/>
Later on, Mr. John Moore said that the Government had concluded that,
<quote>"regulated private ownership of natural monopolies is preferable to nationalisation".</quote>
This was just a statement without any corroborative evidence produced; indeed, none could be produced because this is a totally new concept. However, it raises two questions which were referred to repeatedly during the course of the debates on the Telecommunications Bill and the Gas Bill. The first question is: why was there not some restructuring to introduce a competitive situation in these two enterprises before they were privatised? The second question is: if they were to be privatised as they stood was the regulatory framework adequate? Those two questions are very relevant to future possible developments.<lb/>
There are many conceivable ways in which big public utilities could be restructured, if that was thought to be desirable. They could be divided on a regional basis. They could be divided as between their common carrier capacity&#x2014;most of them are common carriers, whether they be water, gas, electricity, the postal services or British Telecom&#x2014;or they could have a degree of sub-contracting or franchising introduced into their systems.<lb/>
In fact, none of those options appear to have been examined. The two public utilities which have been sold off so far were sold off exactly as they stood. We should be well advised to question the application of that policy should a future effort be made to privatise further public utilities.<lb/>
Having sold them off as they stood, the second question is whether the regulatory mechanism which the Government introduced was adequate. There were many who doubted that during the passage of the two Bills, but the proposals made to that effect from these Benches were rejected by the Government and their supporters. However, I should like to draw the attention of noble Lords to the situation as it now exists of the two public utilities that have been privatised. In the case of British Telecom, which was sold off for a sum in excess of &#x00A3;4 billion, the annual cost of the regulatory authority, which has a staff of about 100, is under &#x00A3;4 million. That is a relatively
<col>762</col>
modest body to control such a vast organisation. However, the figures that I have for the annual cost of running the regulatory body for the gas industry&#x2014;an enterprise which has a turnover of &#x00A3;7 billion and employs more than 100,000 people&#x2014;shows a sum of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 million and a staff of 15.<lb/>
On that projection, if the electricity industry were to be privatised as it presently stands, we might be lucky to obtain a regulatory body with a staff of about half a dozen costing a few hundred thousand pounds a year. Therefore it is not unreasonable to ask whether that type of regulatory framework is at all adequate for the massive change in the status of those large organisations.<lb/>
I believe that that aspect of the Government's policy will need to be carefully reconsidered in the ensuing parliamentary session&#x2014;whatever government may be in power&#x2014;to see whether we have found the right way of dealing with those big public utilities.<lb/>
I am not particularly arguing that the big public utilities should be publicly or privately owned, but there should be adequate safeguards for the various interested parties. I cannot see that the transfer of the two public utilities which have already been moved from the public to the private sector has been of any benefit to the taxpayer. On the contrary, the taxpayer has lost substantially because of the costs of privatisation and because of the relatively low rate at which the shares were sold. The shareholders have certainly gained. Whether or not consumers will gain, time will tell.<lb/>
This is one of the areas which demands a good deal more consideration and more attention in any future attempts to privatise public utilities than has so far been given to it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03456"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always an enormous pleasure for me to follow my noble friend Lord Ezra, who speaks with such authority on the matters that he is discussing. I found his speech today wholly acceptable. He was talking about the efforts that we all put in to try to provide some measure of competition in the gas industry when it was being privatised, in order to maintain the Government's philosophy that one should not turn a public monopoly into a private monopoly. In the time that we all all spent on that, I was not lacking in either industry or patience myself.<lb/>
When I think of the time that we spent on that and our complete lack of achievement in persuading the Government of the continuing truth of their previous statements as to the foolishness of attempting to run a public monopoly as a private monopoly, I am very saddened. As regards that part of my noble friend's speech, I am more than delighted to be in the position of following him.<lb/>
There is some usefulness in having a debate of this kind at this point in time. However, as a practical politician, I am bound to say that there is a slight feeling of artificiality about it. We are addressing one another and nobody else. None of what we are saying today will appear on television. None of what we are saying today will appear in the newspapers. They will fill their columns with other things. Of course, all that the Minister said was in preparation for the speeches
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0390"/>
<col>763</col>
that he will no doubt make in various constituencies when he will describe the Government's policy in a way which some of us would not recognise. I wish him luck.<lb/>
I wish him particular luck when he goes to the North, the North-East and Scotland and explains to people there how successful the Government have been. I wish him joy. If he gets out of it without any physical damage, he will be very fortunate indeed. He will tell the people in those places that the Government have achieved unparalleled economic progress, unparalleled growth, a fall in the cost of living which has been unparalleled and an improvement in the standard of living which has been unparalleled. If the Minister says those things in those places, the people will naturally laugh at him in the way that they should.<lb/>
I should like, if I could, to agree with some of the measures in the Finance Bill. There is very little of it left, and in what there is left there is very little to agree with. I do not think that the Government have received sufficient congratulations on the step that they took in the time of the noble Lord, Lord Barber, in establishing free exchanges. That was a very courageous step and it has been beneficial to the country. The Finance Bill contains a useful provision in that it makes it necessary for any future government who wish to change it to first have to prove their case before Parliament.<lb/>
I am sorry that the provisions&#x2014;this has been referred to already&#x2014;for profit related income proposals have been dropped. They would have been very beneficial and I cannot see that there would have been much opposition to them. However, they have been dropped along with many other things.<lb/>
I wish to tell your Lordships of the way in which I think the people of this country see the achievement of the Government since they came to power. They will give the Government credit for the following records: first and foremost, a record in unemployment which was previously unimaginable. As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, mentioned, in my time in government it was accepted that unemployment rates in excess of 1 million meant that there would be riots on the streets. Here we are, as a result of government propaganda, with 3 million embedded in our thinking as being a tolerable figure for unemployment. That is the first record that the people of this country will recognise.<lb/>
The second record which they will recognise is a record in the reduction of the size of our manufacturing sector. Thousands of people who had jobs and who no longer have jobs in manufacturing will remember and be aware of that record. Those who are involved in the financial area will be aware of the record of achievement by the Government in real interest rates. I think that record goes back for all time. But certainly even in nominal interest rates the record they have achieved will be remembered.<lb/>
They have also achieved a record in that the country, for the first time, has been unable to contribute to earning its living through the net export of manufactured goods. For the first time we are in a situation in which we import more manufactured goods than we export.<lb/>
<col>764</col>
There is also a record, which has been expressed in humble language and which I wish to express in a more detailed way, in the change of direction and of increased divisions among our people. Perhaps that is the most serious matter of all. I cannot express, in one sentence, the record on social divisions. But I am able to express in one sentence the record on financial divisions. I am able to demonstrate, on the basis of the Government's own figures, what I have known to be the truth but could not prove by Government figures previously. Drawing on my recollection as the past chairman of the Royal Commission on the distribution of income and wealth, I believe that this is the first time in this century that there has been a movement away from equality. Through the period, there has been a growing together of the levels of income of those at the top and those at the bottom, and of the share of capital of those at the top and those at the bottom.<lb/>
That is the shape of our society. There can be a difference of views as to the pace at which the richest and the poorest should be seen to become more comparable. There is a possibility of a difference of views about savings and capital. But there has never been a difference of view by any government, Conservative or otherwise, throughout this century, that we ought to drive as far as we reasonably can towards greater equality, until this Government came into office.<lb/>
As I said, the ordinary person would see that in simple terms of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. I wish to demonstrate that that is not an emotional statement: it is an accurate statement of the facts. Those facts are drawn from Government figures and particularly from the reply I received from the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffilam, on Monday, 9th March, when I asked for the figures of the Gini coefficients for various years and was given them.<lb/>
The Gini coefficient is a description, invented by a clever Italian professor, which enables us to have a look, simply and shortly, at the shape of our society in financial terms. A government statement from the Front Bench confirmed that it is the best available description. It is not perfect and I would not claim perfection for it. But it is the best we have. The figures go from 1979 to 1983 and further figures have been published for 1984 and 1985. The figures do not yet exist for 1986. However, common sense tells us that the differentiation has increased rather than reduced in that period. The conclusion for the years from 1979 to 1985 inclusive is that the inequality of original incomes&#x2014;what people have earned first of all&#x2014;has increased over all by nearly 10 per cent. It also shows that when a proper measure is taken&#x2014;that is to say, the measure of post-tax incomes&#x2014;and making all the necessary adjustments for cash benefits, income tax, indirect taxes and the like, then the inequality of post-tax incomes for families (because that is where the shoe pinches, rather than with the individual) has increased by more than 10 per cent. during that period of this Government's control of finances.<lb/>
That shows a marked moving away from a trend towards greater equality which was obvious throughout the century. That moving away gives every justification to those who say that under this Government the rich get richer and the poor get
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0391"/>
<col>765</col>
poorer. It is not surprising, therefore, that people feel that importance should be attached to the figures which have recently been described of an 11 per cent. increase in the remuneration of chief executives who, on average, earned over &#x00A3;200,000 per year last year. Compare that with the kind of increase&#x2014;less than half&#x2014;which the Government are offering to those who provide all our essential services in hospitals and elsewhere. It is not surprising that people feel that there is a great drive towards division in this country.<lb/>
I may say that it is not surprising to me either that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, thought that in those circumstances a reduction in taxation was helpful because it would enable the people who earn more than &#x00A3;200,000 a year to keep more of their income. I was much moved by that argument. I am delighted to see the noble Lord. I had great affection for his late grandfather, as indeed I had for his father. I am delighted to see him among us. But perhaps I do not share his background and his views entirely.<lb/>
That is the situation that we see, and we feel that this Government must answer for that at the next general election. That is why, if we had time, we would argue this Bill in the greatest possible detail. As we have not, we shall leave it by saying that those are the records of this Government. That is the achievement of the Government, and they ought to be ashamed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03457">6.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03458"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I first have to apologise for my noble friend Lord Peston, who has been called away. I think he sent a message to the noble Lord the Minister. He was hoping to stay for the winding-up speeches but unfortunately, as is frequently the case in this House, we went on a bit too long and he was called away on urgent business.<lb/>
I believe that this is the last debate on economic matters, certainly in this House and possibly in either House of Parliament. That is as it should be because the election is upon us and the general election campaign, in large measure, is going to be dominated by the conduct of the economy by the Government which is presently in power and the plans of the different parties for correcting what they perceive to be the imbalances that a number of noble Lords have referred to this afternoon. I think that it is a measure of the sophistication of your Lordships' House that we can debate these matters in a relatively tolerant and civilised way before the blood and the thunder of the election is upon us.<lb/>
I should like to pick up three themes which a number of noble Lords have introduced in today's debate on the Bill. They are tests against which the Bill should be judged. First, does the Bill unite the nation? That theme introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and taken up by my noble friend Lord Graham; the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, has also referred to it. Secondly, does the Bill aid the transition from a North Sea oil economy to a post-North Sea oil economy? I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, started along this line before he went on to give what I thought was an excellent exposition of the problems involved in privatisation of the utilities.<lb/>
<col>766</col>
The third test, as has been put forward by several noble Lords, is: does the Bill contribute towards the generally desirable aims of growth and the reduction of unemployment? I think that noble Lords on all sides of the House will agree that both growth and the reduction of unemployment are desirable general aims.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Diamond, has already commented&#x2014;and therefore I shall try to be brief&#x2014;upon the question whether the Bill, and indeed the conduct of government policy since 1979, has united the nation. I agree almost entirely with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Diamond. All I can do is expand on the matter of the regional question which the noble Lord touched on, but perhaps did not cover in as much detail as he would have liked.<lb/>
There is no doubt that there is a North-South divide. However, there is doubt as to exactly where that line between North and South should be drawn. Indeed, a study produced by Lloyds Bank argues that the line should not be drawn from the Severn to the Wash, but from the Wash to the Solent; and that the statistics show that the South-East and East Anglia are the two areas which have benefited most, and still benefit most, and that other areas are well behind.<lb/>
I should like to quote some figures on the matter. The South-East and East Anglia are the only regions where the gross domestic product per head is above the national average. In all other regions it is below the national average. In Wales, it is 88 per cent. of the national average, whereas in the South-East it is 114 per cent. and in East Anglia it is 101 per cent. That is just one measurement of the unemployment situation.<lb/>
The regional breakdown shows that the South-East and East Anglia are the only two areas where unemployment is less than 10 per cent. In all other areas it is higher than 10 per cent. For example, Berkshire, which is on the M.4 corridor, has an unemployment rate of 6&#x00B7;7 per cent. whereas Cleveland has an unemployment rate of 21&#x00B7;2 per cent. That is the measure of the regional disparity.<lb/>
Indeed, the European Commission has pointed out that more than one-third of the poorer regions of the European Economic Community are to be found in the United Kingdom. Personal income tells the same story. Expenditure on housing in the South-East is 50 per cent. more than it is in the North. Average rent, rates and water charges are 20 per cent. higher than they are in the North. Investment in new company formation is much higher in the South-East and East Anglia than it is in the North, Scotland and Wales.<lb/>
We have to ask the question: what does the Bill do to correct these imbalances? The answer is that it does not do anything. It does not do anything because the Government have never set out to do anything. I believe&#x2014;and this point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, with great clarity&#x2014;that the idea of trying to correct these imbalances went out of the window in 1979. There was a clear change in philosophy; there were imbalances regionally and imbalances between the rich and the poor.<lb/>
In so far as concerns the balance between rich and poor, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. I think that this is an over-taxed country. However, the increase in indirect taxation has been
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0392"/>
<col>767</col>
absolutely enormous. To return to the 1979 portion of gross domestic product taken by the Government in tax would, by my calculations, require a tax reduction in the region of &#x00A3;12 billion, which again by my calculations is equivalent to 9&#x00BD;p off the standard rate, rather than the 2p as suggested in Clause 20.<lb/>
The next test is: does the Bill aid the transition to the post-North Sea oil economy? Various noble Lords have referred to the necessity to revive manufacturing industry and to promote research and development, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, spoke at length. I totally agree with what she said and therefore I shall not repeat it. We must improve training and have more productive investment. Above all, we must make sure that manufacturing exports increase and manufacturing imports decline, or relatively decline&#x2014;in other words, that our manufacturing balance of trade improves. The Government claim that the long-term decline in the United Kingdom's share of world trade in manufactures has been reversed. I wish that that were true.<lb/>
However, the sad fact is that in making that claim the Government have once again moved the statistical goal posts. This was shown by The Henley Centre study at the end of March of this year. Formerly, DTI figures simply measured the share of exports as a proportion of main manufacturing country exports; those figures were reproduced at Budget time by the Treasury up until 1985. Now, of course, the Treasury produce rather different figures, giving greater weight to our largest export markets, and making an adjustment accordingly. What a surprise, the Treasury figures show a favourable picture, while the DTI figures show a volume share little different from the low point of 1981.<lb/>
The reason is quite clear&#x2014;our export markets have been less buoyant than those of our competitors. In value terms, the picture is worse, because over the past few years the devaluation of the pound, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos referred, has been reflected in the revenue received, and that is really what matters. Our share of manufacturing trade has fallen drastically since 1961 and we need to do something about it.<lb/>
I believe that the analysis made by your Lordships' Select Committee on Overseas Trade, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Aldington, in a most distinguished manner, has yet to be disproved. That is a point on which we shall continue to insist and we shall be insisting throughout the forthcoming election campaign. In my view the Bill does nothing to help the manufacturing sector get the manufacturing balance of trade back anywhere near where it was in 1979, and anywhere near where it has to be as North Sea oil starts to run down.<lb/>
The third test is whether the Bill contributes to the generally desirable aims&#x2014; for example, growth, which we certainly need. Between 1979 and 1985 OECD figures show average OECD growth at 2.2 per cent. per annum and UK growth at 1.3 per cent. per annum. IMF figures for the period between 1979 and 1986 show world growth at 2.6 per cent. per annum, that for industrial countries at 2.3 per cent. per annum, and that for the UK at 1.4 per cent. per annum. As the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, pointed out, at present
<col>768</col>
our growth rate is relatively high, but there are dangers in this. Consumer spending is flat for the first quarter of 1987 compared with the first quarter of 1986.<lb/>
Consumer spending was, after all, the great motor of growth over the past year or two. The world economic outlook, according to the International Monetary Fund, is deteriorating. The forecasts for 1987 produced by the International Monetary Fund in April 1986 show that for the group of seven countries there would be a growth of 3.3 per cent. When the IMF revised its forecast in April 1987 it said the figure would be only 2.4 per cent. It looks as though we may be coming to the end of what has been a growth cycle, from a low point in 1981 and now moving into somewhat rougher waters.<lb/>
Nothing in the Bill does anything to promote growth in the United Kingdom and there is no reason why it should because the Government specifically rejected the idea which we used to hold and which my noble friend Lord Peston used to teach; namely, the Keynesian view that governments could actually do something about growth. The Government have specifically rejected that view, so it is no wonder that the Bill contains nothing that will ensure that growth in the United Kingdom is not just a once-for-all affair on the back of a consumer boom and on the devaluation against the Deutschmark to which the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, referred, but is a solidly based performance over the years. Ultimately we come back to the question: what does this Bill do to reduce unemployment? Here I refer to the point that my noble friend Lord Peston made. It seems to me to be a very fundamental point.<lb/>
Are we to assume that the Government are telling us that an unemployment level of 3 million is given for economic policy over the next few years, or are we to suppose that the Government do not accept that and that they have some other plan? Do we believe, with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that unemployment is endemic&#x2014;I think that was the expression he used&#x2014;in the industrial nations? Let us again look at the facts. The OECD standardised cross-country basis for unemployment, October 1986, gives the total for the OECD as 7.7 per cent.; for the US, 6.8 per cent.; West Germany, 8 per cent.; Japan, 2.7 per cent.; France, 10.5 per cent.; UK, 11.4 per cent.<lb/>
Again we are right down the league to which the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, referred. What can we look for in the Bill to correct that? Every study made, as my noble friend Lord Peston said&#x2014;unless the Treasury has made some new study of which we know nothing&#x2014;has shown that direct tax cuts are a dreadfully inefficient way of reducing unemployment. That cannot be said too often. The noble Lord may report to us this afternoon, as a result of some new magical study which theTreasury has done, "Oh no, all that is rubbish and we really do believe, and we have solid empirical evidence to show, that cuts in income tax are the right way to reduce unemployment". Unless he can show that, we are compelled to come to the view that the Government accept that 3 million unemployed is going to be a given in our economic affairs for the next few years.<lb/>
I believe by these tests of uniting the nation, aiding the transition to a post-North Sea oil economy and contributing to generally desirable aims such as a
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0393"/>
<col>769</col>
reduction in unemployment, that the Bill before your Lordships' House is a lamentable effort. Yet the underlying economic policy is presumably that which the Conservative Party is putting before the electorate. We all know&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, have told us&#x2014;that the monetary prospectus which was adopted by the Conservatives in 1979 was more or less bogus. They have now given all that up and say that monetary aggregates no longer really matter; you can choose the one you want and you can decide what you want it to be. But just because they got away with one bogus prospectus, there is no reason for them to get away with another.<lb/>
I accept the view of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that there is a political divide between this side of the House and his side. I am quite happy that if this is put to the electorate in honest terms the electorate will be able to make up its mind. If it is put to the electorate in honest terms, we on our side are not in the least worried about the outcome.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03460"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had an interesting debate this afternoon. I had intended to begin my closing remarks by dealing with any particular queries that noble Lords had on the Bill, but nobody has actually raised any question of detail on the Bill itself. I shall try not to take too long because I appreciate that there is a lot of business to follow, but I shall deal with some of the points that have been raised during the course of the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Diamond, said that he felt that there was a slight feeling of artificiality about this debate. We have even lost the television cameras this evening, so although we have been doing a good deal of electioneering, we may not get any reporting of it, and certainly none of us has a vote to cast when the election does come.<lb/>
However, the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, began by querying the fact that although we have reduced taxation it still stands higher now than it did before. We regard real take-home pay as much more important than a percentage of earnings taken in tax. That takes account of both direct tax cuts and indirect tax increases. A two-child family on half average earnings has seen a 17&#x00BD;per cent. real increase since this Government came to power. On average earnings that increase goes up to 21&#x00BD; per cent. in real terms since this Government came to power. I have to grant that in the period of the last Labour Government there was also an increase in real take-home pay for the two-child family. That was over the five-year period half of 1 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03461"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does that take into account any increase in VAT and other direct taxation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03462"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: I said, "and indirect tax increases", my Lords.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, asked me specifically about the extension of VAT, and I should very much like to answer those points. As far as new construction is concerned, the noble Lord is well aware that that is the subject of a European Court Case
<col>770</col>
and the hearing is due in September. The Government have made it quite clear that they are fighting the case vigorously. They will have to consider the terms of the judgment. Zero-rating for newspapers, however, is not part of the court case so it is not under threat. On food, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister repeated on 28th April in another place her 1984 undertaking that an incoming Conservative Government would not put VAT on food. I hope that that gives the noble Lord the reassurance he was looking for. Generally, the Government are committed to prudent reductions in the overall burden of taxation, especially income tax. As the Budget demonstrated, this is being achieved without commensurate increases in indirect tax rates.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Seear, criticised us&#x2014;not for the first time&#x2014;for having chosen 1980 as a base date for certain figures we gave. So far as manufacturing productivity is concerned, it has grown faster than that of all other major industrial countries since 1979 as well as since 1980. That is in contrast to when we were at the bottom of the league in the 1960s and the 1970s. Total output in the economy has grown faster than in any other major European country since 1980 and that contrasts again with when we were at the bottom of the league in the 1960s and 1970s. Industrial production is at its highest ever levels and manufacturing output is growing faster. It is up by 4 per cent. over the past year and forecast to grow again by 4 per cent. this year.<lb/>
Inflation is near its lowest level for nearly 20 years and under firm control. It is forecast to be at 4 per cent. at the end of this year and in the middle of 1988. I do not need to reaffirm the Government's determination to keep down inflation and further to reduce it. In fact, zero inflation is our aim.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03463"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord deny the position in the league tables that I quoted from the <i>Economist</i>?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03464"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot recall the figures that were quoted from the <i>Economist.</i> I shall look at them. I am telling the noble Baroness how we are doing now in comparison with other countries and how we did in the 1960s and 1970s.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03465"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord like me to give him the inflation comparisons, because I can do so? They bear out what the noble Baroness said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03466"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order to get through the business, I shall not accept the noble Lord's offer. I shall look at the figures when they are published in <i>Hansard.</i> We agree that wage settlements are too high. However, the rapid growth of manufacturing productivity means that industry's competitive position has been transformed. United Kingdom unit labour costs are forecast to rise no faster in 1987 than those of our major competitors. Industry's tremendous opportunity is reflected in the optimism contained in the CBI's latest survey. I do not think that noble Lords can quibble about that.<lb/>
The noble Baroness also talked about training. The Bill contains a specific measure designed to assist
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0394"/>
<col>771</col>
training. My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter quite rightly took the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, to task over his remarks about my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. I am grateful to him for having done that.<lb/>
The noble Lord also talked about the abolition of exchange controls&#x2014;I am glad that this was endorsed by the noble Lord, Lord Diamond&#x2014;and how we were finally abolishing them in the Bill. Of course they have not been used in practice since 1979. We are now finally getting rid of them, I hope. From the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, I was not sure whether it was Labour Party policy to reintroduce exchange controls. I had it in my mind that the Labour Party had dropped that idea, but perhaps that is no longer the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03467"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I verify the party's policy? It is clear. It has been set out in the conference document. We do not propose to reintroduce the old form of exchange controls because we think that we have a repatriation policy on portfolio investment which is rather better.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03468"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall perhaps be forgiven for having thought from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, that he was probably keen on having them back.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked whether the Labour Party, if elected, would reverse the 2p cut in income tax. Noble Lords opposite confirmed that they would do so. I have to tell my noble friend that I do not think that will be enough. The Labour Party has a public expenditure programme of some &#x00A3;34 billion. That would involve the doubling of income tax or the trebling of VAT. Noble Lords opposite may laugh. I am not saying that they would necessarily bring in the whole of that public expenditure rise at one go, but I suffer the misfortune of living in a London Labour-controlled borough. I have just experienced a 50 per cent. rise in my rates and I am promised a further 50 per cent. rise next year. That probably indicates that the calculations are not too far wrong.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, gave us a good overview of the Alliance's published prospectus as audited&#x2014;as looked at by Messrs. Coopers and Lybrand. I understand that "audited" is not the correct word to use. I thought that he made rather light of the fact that the proposal included a &#x00A3;4 billion increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. He said that that probably would not have any effect on interest rates or inflation. We have reduced the public sector borrowing requirement by &#x00A3;3 billion. That resulted in two points off the interest rates. I wonder what will happen as a result of a &#x00A3;4 billion increase.<lb/>
The noble Viscount also said that the top rate of income tax in Japan is higher than it is in the United Kingdom. That is true. I understand, however, that the Japanese plan to bring down their top rate from 70 per cent. to 50 per cent. In any event, that top rate is not reached until income is well over &#x00A3;200,000, and so I do not think that that is an especially good comparison to make.<lb/>
<col>772</col>
I can confirm that my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that the Government may need to bring down the top rate of income tax in the next Parliament. I hope that that will encourage my noble friend Lord Strathclyde.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Graham of Edmonton, Lord Williams of Elvel and others, suggested that tax was a less efficient means of alleviating unemployment than infrastructure spending. Many simulations of economic models show that extra public spending or tax cuts boost demand in the short run but that merely boosting demand ultimately leads to higher prices. The case for tax cuts is based on their longer run effects in improving incentives, rewarding enterprise and reducing distortions. Those effects are not given proper weight in any economic model simulations.<lb/>
I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, for his kind words about what we have been able to do to help genuine friendly societies. I shall certainly draw my honourable friend's attention to his remarks.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Ezra, in the course of a speech which I imagine he had saved up from yesterday afternoon and in which I could not see any great relevance to the Bill, said that the public sector borrowing requirement had been reduced due only to privatisation proceeds and oil revenues. I am sorry to have to prove him wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03469"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not say that, I said that there were two extraordinary items which had helped to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03470"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I stand corrected. Even without the privatisation proceeds, the public sector borrowing requirement last year was at its lowest level as a ratio to gross domestic product since 1971. That is also despite the &#x00A3;6.5 billion fall in oil revenues from 1985&#x2013;86.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Diamond, talked about the inequality of income distribution. It is true that the inequality has increased, but all those in work, even the lowest paid, those on half average earnings and in the bottom decile, have gained substantially in real terms.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and other noble. Lords talked about the United Kingdom's share of world trade in manufactured goods. On all measures of world trade, the United Kingdom's performance has improved, or declined more slowly, since 1981 after decades of decline. There has been no previous five-year period in recent history in which United Kingdom manufacturing exporters have been so successful. Manufacturing exports are at record levels at the moment.<lb/>
Many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who is not here, the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, talked about full employment. The Government accept that unemployment is too high, but it is already falling steadily. The policies that we have put in place are creating the conditions for a sustained growth in output and employment. We can already see the results. Over 1 million new jobs have been created
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0395"/>
<col>773</col>
since 1983. With the labour force growth expected to slow down over the next few years, there is a good prospect of further falls in unemployment. We do not see 3 million as a base figure from now onwards.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams, talked about regional variations in unemployment. Although I have said that unemployment is of course too high, it has fallen fastest in some of the regions, such as Wales, over the past 12 months. In the past six months unemployment has fallen in all regions except Scotland where there has been a small increase. Even in Scotland the trend is improving. All regions will benefit from the &#x00A3;4.75 billion spending increases in priority areas announced in the last Autumn Statement.<lb/>
A number of noble Lords have, not criticised but drawn attention to, the absence of my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, said that this was probably the last debate that we would have in the House on economic matters before the Budget&#x2014;that is, if I am lucky later this evening. All I can say is that I hope very much that, shortly after 25th June when we debate the Queen's speech, my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham will be standing here to answer the economist part of the debate.<lb/>
The Bill contains a number of important measures. Chief is the reduction in the basic rate of income tax to 27p. The Government are well on their way to reaching an objective of a basic rate of 25p. It also includes measures to help businesses, particularly small businesses. The main measures in this category are the reduction in the small companies' rate of corporation tax to 27p in line with the income tax cut, and the package of VAT measures, especially optional cash accounting for traders up to &#x00A3;250,000 per year turnover. Business will also be helped by the favourable economic climate.<lb/>
Your Lordships should not just take my word for it; let us look at the evidence: base rate down 2 per cent. since March, many foreigners now saying that Britain is the place to invest in at present; the CBI quarterly trends survey, one of the most bullish for many years; stock exchange indices within a whisker of all-time highs; we have already said that unemployment has been down for the last nine months in a row; and one million new jobs created since 1983.<lb/>
This favourable economic climate, which is the product of eight years of prudent management, has enabled the Government to achieve the unique hat trick of lower taxes&#x2014;down by &#x00A3;2.5 billion&#x2014;reduced public sector borrowing&#x2014;down by &#x00A3;3 billion&#x2014;but increased public expenditure&#x2014;up by &#x00A3;4.75 billion. The Finance Bill gives effect to the first of these. I commend it to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03616"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.<lb/>
This deals with development risks defence. The matter was debated at some length in your Lordships' House at every stage in the passage of the Bill. It is clear that both the other place and your Lordships' House agreed the need for this defence in the Bill as a part of the overall balance between the needs of industry and those of the consumer. We disagreed, however, over the wording of that defence.<lb/>
When the Government introduced the Bill into your Lordships' House, it contained the form of words in the Bill before us today. On Report, an amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, changed the wording to that in the European directive. This was agreed by the House. That decision was reversed in another place so that the Bill now contains the clearer wording with which it was introduced. No one doubts the importance of this defence in the Bill and for that reason it is equally important that the defence is understood by both producers and users of their products.<lb/>
I have explained to your Lordships' House at both Committee and Report stages that we have used the words of the European directive where we can and where they are readily understood in the United Kingdom law. For most parts of the directive, and thus the Bill, this has been a satisfactory approach and has caused few problems. It has also confirmed the Government's intention, which has been to implement the European directive&#x2014;no more and no less. However, where there is doubt or vagueness about the wording&#x2014;and this is undeniably an example&#x2014;in the interests of all concerned the Government have redrafted the words of the directive so as to make clear the intentions of the directive.<lb/>
I do not intend, nor do I think I need, to repeat the arguments which were placed before your Lordships during the earliest stages of the Bill. However, perhaps
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0401"/>
<col>785</col>
I may say this. Industry has made it quite clear that without a development risks defence in this Bill the future of this country's research and development leading to new products will be severely hampered. What is important now is how that development risks defence is understood by those who produce the products and by those who will insure the risks of those producers; because at the end of the day it is the insurers of the producers' risks who will provide the ultimate protection for any injured user of the product. It is important therefore that the precise nature of the risk is clarified so that premiums can be quantified.<lb/>
The Government believe that the words in the directive are not clear. However, the directive's intention is clear. The only plausible interpretation of the directive is that the information that is to be taken into account is information that any reasonable person, looking at the matter in an objective way, would say that a producer of products of that kind should be expected to act upon. It is that meaning that we have conveyed in the draft before your Lordships today.<lb/>
I do not think that I have to remind noble Lords of how narrow this defence will be for a producer or how difficult it will be for him to prove. The times when a producer will be able to rely on this defence will be very few indeed and will only be in those industries which are operating at the forefront of technological knowledge. However, those are the industries on which everyone in the United Kingdom will depend for their future. It is important that those industries understand just what this defence means and that their insurance companies can correctly assess those risks.<lb/>
For those reasons I hope that your Lordships will see and accept the necessity for using the words that we have in this Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03617"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the reasons for the Commons Amendment No. 1. I am bound to say that we are somewhat disappointed that the Government did not accept the amendment that was passed on Division in your Lordships' House on Report. I am the more disappointed because in another place when this Bill was discussed the Minister in his Second Reading speech said that he wished to hear the views of both sides of the House before reaching a final decision. That was on 27th April 1987. As I understand those words, they meant that he had something of an open mind.<lb/>
It appeared subsequently&#x2014;because 27th April is not long ago&#x2014;that the government collective mind hardened on the subject, and although there was only one speech on the Second Reading in another place that I can see (which came from Mr. Richard Page), arguing very strenuously in favour of the Government's original wording rather than your Lordships' amendment, nevertheless at Committee stage in another place the Government tabled an amendment seeking to reverse what your Lordships had done.<lb/>
I should have thought that if the Government felt as strongly as they quite obviously do about the
<col>786</col>
amendment that your Lordships approved they would have made their views known in some way or another. I also believe that, had they felt strongly about it, the Minister in another place on Second Reading would have said, "We intend to reverse this." Although there is nothing unconstitutional about this, it would have been customary. One of the points about the revising nature of your Lordships' House is that we have a chance in normal circumstances when the Commons decide to reverse one of our amendments&#x2014;in particular an amendment that was carried on a Division&#x2014;to have a full discussion of what the reasons were.<lb/>
In the circumstances I can only say that with reluctance, but understanding the timetable that has to go forward because of events that are outside your Lordships' control, we on these Benches will not oppose this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03618"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret very much the action of the Government in the matter of this particular amendment. Even more than that I regret the manner in which it has been done. I should like to say straight away that that is not a criticism of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I am referring to matters outside this Chamber altogether.<lb/>
At Report stage on 9th March we had a useful discussion on the amendment put forward by myself and supported by the noble Lord, Lord Morton of Shuna, from the Labour Benches, by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, from the independent ones, and by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, with his wealth of legal experience.<lb/>
Apart altogether from this amendment, several noble Lords had suggested in previous discussions on the Bill that we should support the proposition that we keep to the words of the directive. Noble Lords and myself wished to do so on this occasion because it seemed to us that the modification put forward by the Government draftsman had surely softened the demands made upon United Kingdom producers. Instead of having to prove that the state of knowledge was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered at all, we found that what I would term more wishy-washy concepts were introduced. Clause 4(1)(c) stated:
<quote>"might be expected to have discovered the defect if it had existed in his products while they were under his control".</quote>
But there was nothing in the directive about that. Our argument was accepted by noble Lords and the amendment was agreed to.<lb/>
In another place on Second Reading on 27th April the Minister, Mr. Michael Howard, in answer to an interruption from a Conservative Member, said:
<quote>"Some have welcomed that amendment, but others have opposed it. I wish to hear the views of both sides of the House before reaching a final decision".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 27/4/87; col. 53]</quote>
Moving on to Standing Committee D, meeting on 5th May, I must confess that I find myself at a loss. At col. 32 of the <i>Official Report</i> for that day the Minister said:
<quote>"Government Amendment No. 11 concerns the working of the defence. When the defence was originally introduced in the Bill, it was worded in the same way as that contained in the present amendment. During the Bill's passage through the other place, the words were changed to resemble more nearly the words in the
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0402"/>
<col>787</col>
directive. I accept that the words in the Bill now resemble more nearly the words in the directive, but that, I fear, is their only real merit".</quote>
We in this House thought that real merit had carried the day. Reverting to Standing Committee D, I can find no evidence that the government amendment was either put or voted on and I am wondering whether the Minister, before he replies, would look at col. 36 of the <i>Official Report</i> of the Standing Committee. Perhaps he could enlighten us on that matter.<lb/>
As I said at the beginning, I very much regret the refusal to accept the amendment passed by this House and particularly the manner in which it has been done. I want to convey to the House that I feel very strongly about this&#x2014;not about losing a particular issue because somebody has to win and somebody has to lose&#x2014;because this issue was not settled by argument. It was not settled by vote, but by arrangement. I think that was quite disgraceful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03619"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, did I hear the Minister say that the Government have redrafted the directive? If he said that, did he strictly mean it? Surely even the English language version of the directive is under the control of the Community. If member states are to be allowed to redraft their language version of a directive, at the end of that road we shall arrive at chaos.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03620"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too, should like to say how sorry I am that the Government decided to reverse engines and to put back the form of words which had been replaced in this House by an amendment which was voted on after full discussion. I am equally sorry that we have still not heard or read any satisfactory explanation&#x2014;I say this with no disrespect to the Minister&#x2014;but I suppose we never shall.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Williams, referred to a decision of the collective mind of government. But I cannot help wondering at what level of government the issue was put. We shall presumably never know that, either, unless we all survive for another 30 years, which seems a somewhat improbable hypothesis.<lb/>
The CBI briefing&#x2014;the CBI was kind enough or perhaps rash enough to send me a copy&#x2014;argues in effect that the amendment now before us will make it easier for a company to mount the defence of development risks. But as the form of words approved of here (as has been pointed out) followed the wording of the directive, what the CBI must be saying is that the clause with the amendment before us will be more favourable to industry than will the directive itself&#x2014;the directive which the Bill purports to implement. If that is so, it seems to be a pretty serious state of affairs. I am no lawyer, but without going into a detailed discussion at this stage I feel that the substitution of a subjective for an objective test is doubtfully consistent with the directive. Indeed, the whole sense of the wording of the amendment is that the test is whether a producer might reasonably be expected to have discovered the defect. Indeed, I believe that is the interpretation which the Minister put on it when he was explaining the amendment.<lb/>
I can just see it being argued that a small producer, for example, could not reasonably be expected to carry
<col>788</col>
out any extensive inquiries; but that is not what the directive provides. I cannot help thinking that the Government may be laying up trouble for themselves in the European Court. We shall see.<lb/>
Although I go along with the view that the Bill as a whole should be lost, tempting though it is to call a Division when one looks at the serried ranks opposite, I regard the action which has been taken as pretty deplorable. I do not think that the Government will be able to look back with any pride on their surrender to the arguments of industry which seem to me largely misconceived and in defiance of the considered view of this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03621"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate the views that the noble Baroness and the noble Lords have made. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, encapsulated, perhaps for all of us, some of the feelings that some of your Lordships might have had over this matter. However, I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, (who referred to the Standing Committee in another place) that it is not for me to comment about the way another place conducts its business; but the amendment was made and this is shown on the record. No vote was taken. Indeed, no vote was needed, so that in effect no further education is needed.<lb/>
So far as concerns the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, I did not mean to say that the text of the directive was redrafted. That, as the noble Lord said, was a Community matter; but member states are all free to implement the directive in their own legislation in their own words. This we have done on a number of occasions. As I sought to underline, here we originally made the change which has been sustained in another place purely for the sake of clarity.<lb/>
To the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, I say that we do not believe that we are storing up trouble for ourselves within the Community largely because of what I have said in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Airedale. I understand the passionate feeling that the noble Lord has about this matter. I take the opportunity, if it is of some comfort to the noble Lord, to remind your Lordships that the development risks defence will be reviewed 10 years after the date of notification of the product liability directive. That will be in July, 1995, eight years from now. The decision about this defence will be considered again throughout the community after we have had the benefit of eight years' experience of the legislation. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03630"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 <i>en bloc.</i> The House will recall that when the Bill was passing through your Lordships' House we debated at some length the issue of what kind of legal status the code of practice on price indications should have. As it then stood the Bill provided that compliance with the code should be a complete defence to a charge of giving a misleading price indication. Many of your Lordships took the view that the status proposed by the so-called concordat was preferable. That is, joining the National Consumer Council, the Retail Consortium, the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Trading Standards and the National Federation of Consumer Groups.<lb/>
In the light of the views expressed by your Lordships I undertook that we would consult further with interested parties on this matter. At that time I made it clear that my honourable friend would bring forward any necessary amendments to reflect the outcome of the consultations in another place since it would not be possible to complete the consultations before the Bill completed its passage through your Lordships' House.<lb/>
In the event the consultations revealed a consensus in support of the status proposed by the concordat, and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Consumer Affairs announced the Government's intention to lay amendments to achieve this status during the Bill's Second Reading in another place. These amendments achieve what the concordat sought; that is, contravention of, or compliance with, the code will tend to establish whether or not an offence has been committed but will not be conclusive.<lb/>
Failure to comply with the code will not be an offence, as I think the amendment makes clear. However, it will be a relevant factor for the court to take into account in determining whether a price indication was misleading. If the court is satisfied that a misleading price indication has indeed been given, then the defences provided by the Bill may arise. The code may, in some circumstances, be relevant to some of these defences, in particular the due diligence defence provided by Clause 39.<lb/>
In these circumstances the amendment will also enable compliance with, or contravention of, the code to be taken into account by the court in determining whether or not the defence has been established. So a trader who complied with the code would not have a complete defence, but he would be very unlikely to be
<col>790</col>
convicted of an offence. I believe that it will only be in the very unusual circumstance that an enforcement authority will bring a prosecution against a trader who has complied with the code's relevant provisions.<lb/>
In the light of these considerations I believe that the status given by this amendment would give honest traders almost the degree of confidence that would have followed from the Government's own proposals. However, should, if I may use the expression, rogue traders find any loophole in the code, which can be exploited to give a misleading price indication, the courts will now have the opportunity to convict in appropriate circumstances. There will therefore be real incentives for traders to comply with the code, which I am sure we can all agree is the desirable outcome.<lb/>
Given the extent of support indicated for this alternative in both Houses and outside Parliament, and the nature of that support, coming as it does from those who will be most closely involved in operating the new legislation, I think that this amendment is the most appropriate way in which to proceed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03631">Moved, That this House do agree with the Commons in the said Amendments.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas of Chilworth.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03632"><member>Lord Williams of Elvel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister for explaining the reasons that the Government introduced this amendment in another place and why we are now being asked to consider these Commons amendments. Your Lordships will be aware, as the Minister says, that this was the object of considerable discussion in your Lordships' House at, I think, all stages of the Bill.<lb/>
I think that on Third Reading of the Bill in this House we moved an amendment in order to allow us proper time to discuss any amendments that the Government might put down in the other place because, as the noble Lord rightly explained, the Government felt that they were unable to reach a decision while the Bill was with your Lordships, and they felt that a proper decision would be taken after consultation and amendments moved in another place.<lb/>
When they took this decision I think that we on this side&#x2014;and I hope I can speak for noble Lords on all Benches on this side&#x2014;felt that our proper course of action was to make sure that we were able, by procedural means, to have a full discussion of what eventually came from the other place.<lb/>
I understand what the noble Lord is saying: that the Government have decided, after consultation, that the concordat is the right way to go about it, and I shall not quarrel with that. Nevertheless, failing a full discussion, which I was rather expecting had not external events intervened, I should like an assurance from the noble Lord that the code of practice referred to in Commons Amendment No. 3 will not be the code that we saw when we were discussing the matter in your Lordships' House at various stages of the Bill, but that it will be a code which is redrafted in order to achieve, first, clarity, and secondly, consistency with Amendment No. 3 before your Lordships at the moment. If the Minister can give us that assurance, I shall be happy not to oppose this amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03633"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister will remember that during our discussions on this point I took strong exception to the fact that this House was not able to discuss the matters which had been referred to the concordat, particularly in view of the fact that I think the Government have twice refused to accept the views put forward by the concordat, which they could have discussed in this House.<lb/>
As the Bill started in this House, I felt that it was the right of your Lordships, never mind the duty, to be able to discuss these matters relating both to the code of practice and the misleading prices. Although I am glad that apparently the Government have now accepted what the concordat has put forward, I should like to register once more my regret that this Hous was not able to play its full part in the deliberations, which it should have been able to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03634"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in acknowledging the noble Baroness's feelings on this matter, I must confess that I find it perhaps more profitable to look forward rather than backwards, accepting what the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, said, that here we have circumstances which greatly changed what might have been. However, we are in fact faced with that, and I think that the outcome is probably the same as regards the status.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked a particular question. I assure the noble Lord that the code will be considered again. It will be subject to further consultation procedure as set down in Clause 25. Indeed that is happening now. My feeling is that that which we saw some weeks ago now will be quite radically altered to take account of all the views that have been expressed and the consultations that are going on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03635"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister sits down perhaps I may ask him a question on the matter of the status of the code of practice. Does the noble Lord think that there will be any opportunity, if we so desired, to discuss this in your Lordships' House&#x2014;I was going to say in the forthcoming Session, but when we return&#x2014;so that we really could have the opportunity, which I think was assured us, of a full discussion on what has been agreed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03636"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I recall correctly, what was promised was that the discussions that were going to take place as a result of the concordat's proposals&#x2014;which were put before the Government some six or seven days before that part of the Bill was reached in your Lordships' House&#x2014;would take some time, and the outcome of those consultations would be reflected in amendments in another place.<lb/>
That indeed took place. I certainly added that therefore we would have the opportunity of discussing this at a later stage. As the noble Lord, Lord Williams, says, other events have taken place so that we are, in effect, denied the opportunity of discussing the status of the code in relation to this Bill. The code must be approved by order and that could be debated, but the status cannot.</membercontribution></p>

This issue was debated extensively during the passage of the Consumer Safety (Amendment) Act last year and also while this Bill was passing through its earlier stages in this House.<lb/>
We have listened carefully to the discussions on this subject and have given further consideration to the potential difficulties of enforcement. In the light of this, we accept that significant difficulties may arise where the 48-hour period encompasses a weekend or bank holiday. To overcome these difficulties, we propose that the period during which Customs and Excise may detain imported goods should be altered to two working days. This point was forcibly raised by either the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, or the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol. This will make no difference in the majority of cases. But it will allow enforcement authorities much greater flexibility in those cases where real difficulties may arise. I hope that the House will agree that this allows an adequate time for the limited purposes of this provision. I beg to move.</p>

Noble Lords will be aware that as Clause 46 stands it defines supplying goods to include hiring out or lending goods. The definition of supply is of course important for the purposes of Part I of the Bill, where a person who has not supplied the goods has a defence to liability under Part I, and a supplier can pass back that liability to earlier persons in the chain of distribution.<lb/>
Your Lordships will also be aware that complicated variations upon the theme of hiring out are common in the transport field. Ships, for example, can be chartered on a demise charter basis, or on a time or voyage charter basis. Aircraft are sometimes hired out,
<col>794</col>
but sometimes their services are made available by what are called wet lease arrangements. In these latter arrangements, and with time and voyage charters for ships, it is the services provided by the aircraft or ship that are truly supplied rather than the ship or aircraft itself, and to this end the ship or aircraft comes complete with its crew.<lb/>
Accordingly, this amendment makes it clear that such arrangements, where services are provided consisting in the carriage of goods or passengers in ships, aircraft or other vehicles, do not amount to a supply of the ship, aircraft or vehicle concerned. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

It may help the House if I outline very briefly the background to this amendment. The Trade Descriptions Act 1972 requires imported goods bearing a UK name or mark to be accompanied by an indication of the country of origin. It does not impose general origin marking requirements. It is intended to protect consumers against being misled by goods which are presented in certain potentially misleading ways. The Commission has indicated that it considers the Act to be incompatible with the Treaty of Rome and has taken the first step in infraction proceedings which would lead to a case in the European Court of Justice if we were not to repeal the Act.<lb/>
On the basis of the court's case law&#x2014;and in particular its adverse decision against the UK's 1981 origin marking order&#x2014;the Government considered that there was little prospect of winning such a case and decided, reluctantly to repeal it but at the same time to seek a successor regime which would provide broadly equivalent protection to consumers while being compatible with Community law.<lb/>
The Government were conscious that Members on all sides of both Houses feel strongly about the issue of origin marking and that many may feel that it would be wrong to settle important changes to the law in this area without an opportunity for fuller debate than the present situation allows. With this in mind, my honourable and learned friend tabled this amendment which provides that the commencement order giving effect to the repeal of the 1972 Act will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.<lb/>
This is somewhat unusual for a commencement order but I think that it meets the situtation in which we find ourselves today. It will relieve the forthcoming Parliament from the burden of repeating the primary legislative process while at the same time ensuring that the implications of repeal can be properly debated before it takes effect and by reference to proposals for successor arrangements.<lb/>
I think I ought also to inform your Lordships that our latest exchanges with the Commission lead us to believe that it is likely to be possible to introduce a successor regime acceptable in Community law. This would provide a valuable degree of continuing protection to consumers in the form of an obligation to provide an indication of origin in any case where goods are presented in such a way that they can reasonably be expected to create the impression in the mind of the consumer that they were manufactured or produced in a different place from that in which they were in fact manufactured or produced. It would then be the Government's intention to introduce such a regime by order under Section 8 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 after the due process of consultation required by that Act. It would also be the Government's intention that the entry into force of such an order would be synchronised with that of the commencement order providing for the repeal of the 1972 Act.<lb/>
That is a somewhat lengthy explanation but I think it is a point that aroused some concern and I hope that what I have said will satisfy noble Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03706"><member>Baroness Hooper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
This is a short but important Bill containing two provisions. First, it contains provisions to prevent
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0408"/>
<col>799</col>
authorities using advance and deferred purchase schemes to avoid the Government's capital expenditure controls and store up major financial liabilities for the future. Secondly, it makes minor adjustments to the arrangements for paying block grant relating to expenditure on further education.<lb/>
Advance and deferred purchase schemes have a long and reasonably respectable history, but recently they have been transmuted by a minority of authorities into creative accounting devices as a means of evading the Government's spending controls on a grand scale. In that guise such devices are just borrowing masquerading as expenditure.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced in another place last July that he would be bringing forward legislation to stop this abuse. These schemes make use of a bank or other intermediary to transfer expenditure artificially from the year when work is done and would normally be paid for in an earlier or later year. The interest is rolled up and the first payments deferred, usually for at least three years.<lb/>
If indulged in on any scale, as in some authorities, these devices store up massive problems for ratepayers, regardless of future election results. The Audit Commission Report on the management of London's authorities, published earlier this year, identified eight boroughs that have entered deferred purchase arrangements amounting to over &#x00A3;550 million.<lb/>
The Government deplore the use of any creative accounting device which leaves ratepayers facing huge bills in the future. No doubt some authorities are relying on an incoming Labour Government to bail them out of the financial consequences of using these devices. I feel I must say that I think they will have to wait a long time.<lb/>
This sort of device has to be curbed. To deal with this problem, Clause 1 and the schedule to the Bill define the time at which an authority will be treated as incurring expenditure against its spending ceiling by reference to the time at which works are carried out, regardless of when payments are actually made. The new provisions apply to all works carried out under arrangements to which an authority became or becomes committed after 22nd July 1986.<lb/>
Regulation-making powers will enable my right honourable friend to make exemptions from the provisions in the Bill, or to modify them in other ways, if that proves necessary. My right honourable friend promised an exemption to allow authorities to continue to use deferred purchase schemes prudently for their original purpose; that is to say, for an occasional, one-off project, which would be difficult to accommodate within their spending ceiling for a single year.<lb/>
My honourable friend, the Minister for Local Government announced details of the exemptions during Committee stage in another place. All authorities in England and Wales will be able to use deferred purchase schemes to finance one project each, up to &#x00A3;3 million in cost, beginning in any one period of five consecutive years. We shall make the necessary regulations as soon as possible after Parliament reassembles.<lb/>
<col>800</col>
Also, all authorities will be able to continue to carry out their "building under licence" and "improvement under licence" housing schemes. Without this exemption, a number of housing projects were likely to be prevented or at least delayed in the period before Royal Assent. For this reason, we decided that the exemption should be backdated to 23rd July 1986, the date on which these provisions of the Bill come into effect.<lb/>
During the Bill's consideration in another place, my honourable friend accepted Opposition amendments to improve the drafting of this part of the Bill. He was also able to agree that my right honourable friend should consult before making any directions about the method of calculating the value of works, should he choose to use his powers in the Bill to make such directions. The Opposition in another place argued that in such a complex and technical area consultation was desirable. We agree with that and the Bill has been amended accordingly.<lb/>
The remainder of the Bill deals with education pooling. There is a technical amendment to the provision which allows for an adjustment between England and Wales. Then there is a provision to allow my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science to recalculate allocations from the advanced further education pool for 1981&#x2013;82 in the manner originally intended. These provisions are uncontroversial and have the agreement of the local authority associations. Your Lordships asked during the consideration of the Education Act last year that an amendment on these lines be included, and I am happy to be able to bring a suitable provision before your Lordships' House today.<lb/>
As your Lordships know, the Government have decided in present circumstances not to proceed with the housing provisions which were originally in this Bill in the present Session of Parliament.<lb/>
However, we intend to reintroduce in the new Parliament provisions which will give local housing authorities an explicit new power to give financial assistance in connection with the provision of privately let housing. We also intend to reintroduce the provisions requiring the Secretary of State's consent for the exercise of this or any other power by local housing authorities or county councils to provide financial assistance or a gratuitous benefit in this connection except in the circumstances originally set out in this Bill. The need for consent will be made retrospective to 6th February 1987, as it was in the present Bill. The new Bill will also, as in this Bill, provide that any transaction entered into after 5th February in contravention of the requirement for the Secretary of State's consent will be void.<lb/>
Meanwhile, we intend to continue to issue general consents and special consents for individual projects submitted to us where appropriate. These consents will be issued as if the new Bill were in force. We shall ensure that general and special consents already issued continue in force. The Department of the Environment has written to all the authorities affected, drawing their attention to this announcement, in order to prevent any misunderstanding. Indeed, that is why I have explained the intentions of the provisions as clearly as possible now.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0409"/>
<col>801</col>
We have also withdrawn for the time being the provisions to improve the operation of the land registers system. Again, we shall return to the matter in the new Parliament.<lb/>
This is a short Bill, but it contains important provisions to protect the ratepayer. The Opposition in another place expressed the view that it was desirable for this Bill, in its abbreviated form, to reach the statute book before Parliament is dissolved. With that aim, I commend it to your Lordships.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03709"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for her explanation of the Bill. It is a very different Bill from the one that was proposed very much earlier in the year when all sorts of privatisation measures, contract compliance and so on were intended. It is also a very different Bill from the one that was introduced in February. I think that it is the forty-third piece of local government legislation in the last eight years and the third this year. But we are agreed that there has been a fairly satisfactory compromise reached.<lb/>
Of course there was a good deal of feeling about the deferred purchase clause&#x2014;Clause 1, and Schedule 1 that went with it&#x2014;but I know that my honourable friends in another place decided that, with the amendments that were agreed at Third Reading, which had been proposed by my honourable friends in Committee and to which the Minister agreed, it was probably sensible to accept Clause 1. Local authorities had been acting as if it were the law, and to remove uncertainty it was thought that it was probably wise to accept it in the circumstances.<lb/>
We are delighted that the clauses on the housing provisions and on the land registers have been removed. I think that all parties agreed that the pooling matters on education should be agreed. That was a clause that was accepted. With those comments, we shall agree to the passage of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03714">Brought from the Commons, and read a first time.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03716"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
The last time your Lordships' House debated the Parliamentary pension scheme was in 1984. My noble friend the Leader of the House said then that the
<col>802</col>
provisions of the Bill which was then being considered were of limited direct relevance to Members of your Lordships' House. The same is true of the Bill now before us.<lb/>
Its main purpose is to enable the complex legislation containing the Parliamentary pension scheme to be set out in regulations instead of in primary legislation. This will have the double advantage of ensuring that the rules of the scheme are easier to follow, since the intention is that they will be made available in consolidated form, and that the procedure for future amendments will be simplified.<lb/>
The most important point that I need to make this evening is that the Bill does not amend the scheme in any way. In debates in another place suggestions were made for improvements in the scheme but I should like to emphasise that the Government do not see this Bill as an opportunity to make such improvements. It has been the practice in the past for the scheme to be based on recommendations by an independent body, and the Government have agreed to refer the current parliamentary pension arrangements to the top salaries review body. Piecemeal changes to the scheme have in the past inevitably resulted in anomalies, and the TSRB will be asked to look especially at the effects of recent amendments.<lb/>
Clause 1 of the Bill reproduces the main provisions of the existing legislation. Clause 2 is the central provision of the Bill. It gives a power to the Leader of the House of Commons to make regulations providing for pensions for Members, Ministers and certain other office-holders. The principal matters that may be covered by the regulations are listed in Schedule 1.<lb/>
The second perhaps most important point about this Bill is that no regulations can be made that adversely affect the accrued pension rights of former Members of Parliament or office-holders no longer in service at the time of the making of the regulations, or their dependants, without their consent. The Leader of the House of Commons is obliged to consult the trustees of the fund and Members' representatives before making any regulations.<lb/>
During Committee stage in another place, the Government gave an undertaking that there would be a debate on an amendable motion in the House of Commons before regulations under Clause 2 of the Bill are made. The Bill was amended to provide that the trustees may report to the House of Commons on any proposals put forward by the Leader of the House, and this report may be made available for a debate. When the amended regulations subsequently came to both Houses they would then require the negative resolution procedure.<lb/>
Clause 3 provides for the continuation of the annual Exchequer contribution to the fund, which is based on the recommendation of the Government Actuary. He will continue to report on the fund every three years; but the Bill slightly amends present practice. In future the Government Actuary will be recommending a rate of contribution by the Exchequer for the years following publication of his report rather than the years following the valuation date, which may be some time before the report is published. This will avoid unexpected adjustments to the rate of contribution, which can upset the trustees' investment activities. My
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0410"/>
<col>803</col>
right honourable friend gave an undertaking in another place that the Government would always allow a debate in another place on the Government Actuary's report.<lb/>
Clause 4 gives authority for the payment of a pension to the widow of the late Lord Maybray-King, the former Speaker who died last year. When Mr. Speaker King retired in 1971, his pension arrangements were set out in a special Act of Parliament, as was the practice then. This provided for a pension to be paid to his then wife, who was named in the Act, in the event of his death. She died, however, and he remarried, but the Act did not provide a pension for his surviving widow. Clause 4 ensures that Lord Maybray-King's widow is not placed in a worse position than if he had simply remained a Member of Parliament by following established practice in applying the rules of the parliamentary scheme in her case.<lb/>
This short Bill is, as I hope your Lordships may agree, mainly a technical measure designed to make the present pension arrangements more transparent. Of course it is right that parliamentary pensions should be debated and scrutinised in public. This Bill preserves that principle, but simplifies the procedure for future amendments. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03718"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may thank the noble Lord for so concisely explaining the purport of this Bill. I can assure him that the 15 minutes shown on the face of the clock when he sat down was not the length of time for which he spoke. This is really a consolidation measure and, in so far as it is a consolidation measure, I have no comment on it. Inevitably at this time of political conflict the Bill is non-controversial and has not tried to tackle some of the anomalies in the present pension scheme. Obviously, if it had tried to tackle any of those anomalies, it would have become a contentious measure.<lb/>
Indeed I understand that discussion has gone on for some months, if not longer, to try to resolve some of the issues which are contentious, such as the different treatment of Members retiring immediately before and after their 65th birthday and also the hoary question as to why a retirement age of 60 should not be set universally within the pension scheme. I am sure, however, that noble Lords who were former Members of Parliament will be relieved to know that the Bill in no way affects their accrued pension rights.<lb/>
With regard to Clause 4, I am sure all noble Lords will agree that it is proper that a pension should be paid to the widow of the former Speaker, Lord Maybray-King, whose pension, if he had retired after the present arrangements had been made, would have been paid to his widow. It is only because the arrangements were made so long ago that it is necessary for these special arrangements to be made at this time. We support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Diplomatic and Consular Premises Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03721">8.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03722"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill, which was foreshadowed in the 1985 White Paper on diplomatic immunities and privileges, is about the control of diplomatic and consular premises in this country. I hope that when I have explained its purposes and outlined its contents your Lordships will agree that it is both a useful and a necessary Bill.<lb/>
At present, there are no legislative powers to prevent diplomatic missions from establishing their premises in any part of the capital, nor are there powers to acquire the title of former diplomatic premises which remain empty for long periods and cause environmental, health, security and other hazards.<lb/>
The problems which arise from the absence of legislative powers fall broadly into four categories. First, we cannot prevent diplomatic missions setting up their offices in sensitive parts of the capital; for example, near the Palace of Westminster or the Royal palaces. However blameless and friendly the mission, it is a fact of life that today any mission can attract crowds which are noisy or even, regrettably, violent. This would clearly be inappropriate in some parts of London.<lb/>
Secondly, there is no way of dealing with diplomatic premises which remain empty, sometimes for years, because the government which owns them cannot, or will not, dispose of them. I am thinking particularly of the former Cambodian premises in St. John's Wood which have been occupied since 1976 by squatters. Thirdly, at present we would be unable to remove diplomatic status from premises which were being misused. I have in mind here evidence over a long period of time that a mission was being used, for instance, in support of terrorist activity. Fourthly, at present we are unable to retaliate in kind if an overseas government insists that we move from existing premises or withholds consent for the acquisition of new premises.<lb/>
The Bill before the House would now provide the powers to meet the needs that I have described. It would enable the Foreign Secretary to require diplomatic missions to obtain his express consent before any office premises acquired by them could be regarded as diplomatic premises and therefore entitled under the Diplomatic Privileges Act to inviolability and rating relief. It provides that such consent could be withdrawn in respect of existing premises in certain circumstances with consequent loss of inviolability and rating relief. It also empowers him to acquire the title of premises formerly used for the purposes of a diplomatic mission which the government concerned
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0411"/>
<col>805</col>
refuses to dispose of. The Foreign Secretary would then sell the premises and remit the proceeds to the foreign government in question.<lb/>
Many countries, including the United States, already have in place powers of the kind I have described. The measure would simply bring us into line with them.<lb/>
In all cases the Foreign Secretary could only give or withdraw consent or acquire the title of any premises if he was satisfied that to do so was permissible under international law. I emphasise that the Government are fully aware of their obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and regard the powers in the Bill as fully consistent with them.<lb/>
I have tried to summarise as clearly and as briefly as possible the main provisions of this short, but important Bill, and I hope that the explanation will have been helpful. I commend the Bill to the House. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03723">Moved, that the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Baroness Young.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03724">8.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03725"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Baroness for introducing and explaining the Bill to the House. Although its objectives are simple, the Bill appears to be rather long and complex. That is because of its legal implications and the requirements of international law, in addition to our own statutory obligations.<lb/>
We cannot always predict when diplomatic relations will be severed, what the total consequences may be, or how long the breach may last. The Bill deals with one of the practical consequences of severance and the Government must, of course, deal with it. Therefore, we support the Bill and will facilitate its passage.<lb/>
We are no longer in diplomatic contact with a number of countries such as Cambodia, Iran, Libya and Syria. In each case we were fully justified in breaking off relations with them because of their conduct. We also have the obligations of a civilised country to ensure that their property is protected, as we would expect our own properties to be protected elsewhere in similar circumstances.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness has explained and as the Title of the Bill stipulates, the properties in question are diplomatic and consular premises which, under the law, includes land.<lb/>
Clause 1(4) is important because it will reassure foreign governments and underline Britain's observance of the Vienna Convention. Clause 1 as a whole contains a number of important practical provisions. For example, Clause 1(7) gives the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the sole power to certify as to facts. However, I should think that he will need the assistance of the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Home Secretary on some matters which are enumerated in Clause 1(5).<lb/>
Clause 2 is, of course, central to the whole Bill because it gives the Foreign Secretary the power to acquire the property and, in due course, to sell it for the best price and thereafter to invest that money and hold it and the interest which accrues for the state which owns the property. However, I assume that the
<col>806</col>
Government will also be able to deduct any expenses which have been incurred.<lb/>
We understand that the Government recognise the comparative difficulties which exist between the treatment of different countries. For example, we have no contact with Cambodia whatever, and, as the noble Baroness said, the Cambodian Embassy has been full of squatters for years. On the other hand, there is still a small skeleton staff in the Syrian Embassy. Those distinctions are recognised in the provisions of Clause 2 and I was interested to note them.<lb/>
For the purpose of clarification, will the noble Baroness confirm that the squatters in the Cambodian Embassy will be evicted after the Bill becomes law and that the property will be then sold? Will the proceeds then be held <i>sine die</i> by the Government&#x2014;that is, until in Cambodia some sensible government emerges from the ashes of that unhappy and unfortunate country and normal relations are resumed?<lb/>
I have one final question to ask on the contents of the embassies. There are instances in which they could be of immense value&#x2014;perhaps more valuable than the premises themselves if they contain pictures by famous artists and other artefacts. We know what price they fetch these days. Will those be dealt with in the same manner as the properties, or will they be put in storage and held for the state in question?<lb/>
I know that the countries concerned can rely on the British Government to deal with those matters in an honourable and efficient way. They are fortunate that that is the case. We give the Bill our full support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03726">8.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03727"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the support given by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos. As I have said, the Bill is short but useful. The noble Lord asked two questions which I hope I can answer.<lb/>
The first one concerned the case of the former Cambodian diplomatic premises and whether or not we can deduct expenses. That point is covered in Clause 3 and I can confirm that the expenses of the sale and of the repairs and security can be deducted from the proceeds of the sale.<lb/>
On the question of the eviction of the squatters, yes, they can be evicted. As regards timing, it is important that that should happen. If the Bill becomes law, we are confident that there will be enough time to acquire the title before the squatters possibly gain a better title through adverse possession.<lb/>
As regards the contents of the premises, once the premises are vested in the Secretary of State, he will enjoy the normal attributes of ownership of property. Accordingly, it would be a trespass for the former owner of the premises&#x2014;that is to say the foreign state&#x2014;to leave furniture in the premises. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would make every effort to persuade the foreign state to remove the furniture. We believe that in most cases the foreign state would see the good sense in doing that. If the foreign state were to refuse to remove the furniture, the Secretary of State would be entitled to remove it. Moreover, there are various legal provisions&#x2014;for example, the power of the courts to order a sale of the furniture&#x2014;which one could consider using against the state.<lb/>

<title>Sheep and Goats (Removal to Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03730">8.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03731"><member>Lord Belstead</member> rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 30th March be approved [<i>17th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03732">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Sheep and Goats (Removal to Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 1987 laid before the House on 30th March be approved. I apologise to your Lordships in that there is a typing error in the date on the Order Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03733">There are two main reasons for amending the 1983 regulations. First, to comply with the new Community obligations, the regulations need to be extended to include uncooked lamb products which are now subject to clawback. Community regulations which are directly applicable have made such products liable to a clawback charge when they are exported from Great Britain to other parts of the Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03734">Customs and Excise already operate the procedures and have the necessary powers to collect the clawback charge in relation to exports to other member states. However, Customs and Excise have no <i>locus</i> when products are exported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Our draft amending regulations therefore make uncooked lamb products subject to the administrative arrangements which already exist to ensure that clawback would be imposed on any sheep or sheep meat exported to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03735">Secondly, we see a need to extend the powers of the officers who enforce these regulations in Northern Ireland. The existing powers of the enforcement officers in relation to removals to Northern Ireland include powers of entry where there is a reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed. But there is no current power of entry for the purpose of actually ascertaining whether an offence has been committed. This means that the controls applicable are weaker than those exercised when sheep or their meat are exported to other member states where Customs and Excise operate comprehensive checks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03736">The amending regulations therefore seek to deal with this issue by granting powers of entry for the purpose of ascertaining whether the provisions of the principal regulations were or had been complied with. It must also be remembered that the regulations protect producers in Northern Ireland from supplies of sheep and sheep meat at prices which could undermine their market there, so providing them with the same protection as other producers in the Community who do not receive a variable premium. The regulations enable these controls to be exercised in Northern Ireland.</p>
<col>808</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03737">Having said all that, I must make it clear that the clawback arrangements on the Great Britain to Northern Ireland trade have never actually yet been applied. There has been no trade in sheep or sheep meat subject to clawback arrangements. At the outset in 1982 this was because Northern Ireland's special animal health status requirements effectively prevented trade, save for exports of pure-bred breeding animals, which do not fall within the clawback arrangements. But from September 1985, certain health requirements were relaxed in Northern Ireland and so trade in categories subject to clawback has now become at least a possibility. We therefore feel that these regulations are a sensible precaution. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03738">Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 30th March be approved. [<i>17th Report from the Joint Committee.</i>]&#x2014;<i>(Lord Belstead.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03739"><member>Lord Carter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is tempting at the time of a general election to make facetious remarks about anything involving sheep and goats. However, I shall avoid that temptation. I am advised that the regulations as amended will be helpful to farmers and ancillary industries in Northern Ireland. Therefore, I am glad to give these regulations our support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03740"><member>Lord Fitt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I first saw the Order Paper in the early days of this week, and noticed the rather sinister nomenclature of the Sheep and Goats (Removal to Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 1987, it brought back many unhappy memories. The thought that on the last day and in the dying hours of this Parliament the Government should try to press through such a controversial order is distressing. Why was it so necessary to do that on this day? There will be many people in Northern Ireland who will interpret the nomenclature of these regulations and their effect in an entirely different way from the meaning which is contained in the regulations.<lb/>
We have heard of exclusion orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and of people who will be excluded from coming to Britain from Northern Ireland under an order. It will cause much discontent. I am perforce put into the position of asking whether there are no depths to which the Government will not stoop to gain re-election.<lb/>
There are many people in Northern Ireland who will question the necessity for these regulations. Not living in Northern Ireland as I do, I have great reservations about the necessity and the urgency of these regulations. When we have heard of removals in previous Acts of Parliament, they required the sanction of the Home Secretary. I do not see that mentioned in these regulations. When we look at the nomenclature of these regulations, it is tantamount, as far as I am concerned, to an exclusion order.<lb/>
It may be said by the Minister that there is unanimity on both sides of the House in relation to these regulations. But those who are likely to be affected by the regulations have not been asked for their opinion in any way. It is arrogant to take a decision in relation to people who are liable to be affected without having ascertained their opinion.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0413"/>
<col>809</col>
Therefore. I do not think that we should rush these regulations through the House. I think that the Minister should be given an opportunity to explain the very serious ramifications of the regulations in relation to Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03741"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no one can accuse the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, of rushing when he addresses your Lordships' House, although it is always a great pleasure to debate with him. In just a moment, I shall attempt to reply briefly to the points which the noble Lord has made.<lb/>
Perhaps I may first congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on what I believe is the first speech he has made from the Opposition Front Bench. I also congratulate the noble Lord on, in a few well-chosen words, supporting the Government on this particular occasion&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03743"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may turn to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. Making uncooked lamb products subject to clawback has an element of exclusion. However, it is all in the cause of protecting the sheep meat trade and the producers and consumers of Northern Ireland. I assure the noble Lord of that.<lb/>
In addition, it gives Customs and Excise in Northern Ireland the responsibility of seeing that the new rules are being complied with by giving them powers of entry to make sure that the regulations are being complied with. They are regulations which I hope that the noble Lord, on reconsideration, may feel it right to support.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Home-Grown Cereals Authority Levy Scheme (Approval) Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03745">8.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03746"><member>Lord Belstead</member> rose to move, That the order laid before the House on 8th April be approved. [<i>18th Report from the Joint Committee.</i> ]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03747">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move. As your Lordships may be aware, the Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up in 1965 and given the general duty of improving the marketing of home-grown cereals. Since its establishment, the authority has become a well respected part of the cereals industry, providing the industry with in particular an authoritative market intelligence service. It also funds a limited range of research and development and acts as agent for the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce for the purchase, storage and sale of intervention grain and rapeseed. These latter activities are fully funded by IBAP, while its market intelligence and research and development activities are financed by an Exchequer contribution of &#x00A3;200,000, representing less than 50 per cent. of annual expenditure, and by a small levy paid by dealers in and processors of home-grown cereals. Last year this levy brought in some &#x00A3;500,000.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03748">In 1985 the Government announced that they would be looking to the agriculture industry generally to fund an increased proportion of agricultural research and development and that continued government funding of Food from Britain would be dependent on matching contributions from the
<col>810</col>
industry. At the same time there was considerable discussion within the cereals sector of the possibility of setting up a body to promote the export of British cereals. These various developments led to a round of discussions last year involving most parts of the industry, in which it was agreed that all these activities should be funded through an increased levy which would be split between growers, dealers and processors. It was also agreed that these different sectors of the industry should contribute in varying proportions to the new activities; research and development, Food from Britain and the new Cereals Export Development Committee. For example, growers alone would contribute to Food from Britain, and growers and dealers would contribute the new export committee, while all three sectors&#x2014;growers, dealers and processors&#x2014;would contribute to research and development work. So far as the growers were concerned, this agreement was endorsed by a poll of producers. Following that, further consultations ensued with the industry before the order which I am putting before your Lordships was laid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03749">Under this order, there will be three separate levies: a grower levy, a dealer levy and a processor levy. The dealer and processor levies will be collected separately. The grower levy will only be collected separately if a grower sells his grain into intervention; in other cases it will be included in the dealer levy and the dealer will be entitled to collect a contribution equal to the grower levy from the grower. Splitting the levy into these three separate elements will make it possible to share the cost of the new activities that the HGCA is to finance on the lines agreed by the industry last year. I have already referred to a second change, which is that in future sales into intervention will be subject to levy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03750">A third change is that the definitions of "dealers" and "processors" have been widened, to give a more comprehensive coverage of those who purchase cereals. In particular, those who process cereals for use in their own enterprises will now be subject to processor levy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03751">Fourthly, the new scheme covers a wider range of home-grown cereals, adding rye, maize, triticale and mixed corn to the wheat, barley and oats covered by the existing scheme. In general, therefore, the new scheme has a wider coverage than the existing one, and should ensure that the cost of the new activities which the industry has agreed to finance will be shared by all those involved in the industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03752">The order we are debating today does not set out the rates for the new levies introduced by this scheme. These will be proposed in a further order which will, if the present order receives the approval of Parliament, be laid before Parliament once the authority has submitted its estimates for the coming financial year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03753">As I have said, this new scheme is a more comprehensive coverage than the existing one and will affect a greater proportion of those involved in the cereals industry. In view of this, my right shonourable friend has been reviewing the representations of those involved in the industry on the authority. Currently, nine seats on the authority are allocated to representatives of dealers and processors. We have sought nominations for these appointments from the organisations representing the agricultural supply trade, the milling industry and the maltsters.</p>
<image src="S5LV0487P0I0414"/>
<col>811</col>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03754">My right honourable friend has now concluded that it will be appropriate to widen the number of organisations from whom nominations are sought. He has accordingly asked organisations representing the agricultural co-operative sector, the poultry industry and the grain shippers to nominate possible members of the authority. To make this possible, those organisations already providing members of the authority have been asked to accept fewer seats on the authority. The Government are most grateful to them for agreeing to these requests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03755">This new scheme has widespread support in the cereals industry and demonstrates the confidence that industry has in its future. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<title>Lord Chancellor's Salary Order 1987</title>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03760">8.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03761"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 29th April be approved. [<i>20th Report from the Joint Committee.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03762">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Lord Chancellor's Salary Order 1987, which was laid before the House on 29th April, be approved. This order is now an annual event and derives from the link between the salaries of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. The Top Salaries Review Body recommended in 1983 that, in recognition of his position as head of the judiciary and his responsibilities as a whole, the Lord Chancellor should be paid more than the Lord Chief Justice. The principle of this recommendation was accepted by the House in 1983 and has since been reaffirmed with the
<col>812</col>
successive approvals of the orders in the following years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03763">An annual order is necessary because the Lord Chief Justice's salary is set annually following recommendations from the Top Salaries Review Body. This year the Top Salaries Review Body recommended a salary of &#x00A3;81,000 per year for the Lord Chief Justice&#x2014;an increase of 4.7 per cent. The Government accepted this figure but, as for all salaries recommended this year by the Top Salaries Review Body, decided to restrict the increase paid from 1st April to 4&#x00B7;25 per cent. and to pay the balance from 1st October. This meant a salary for the Lord Chief Justice of &#x00A3;80,690 for the period 1st April to 30th September and &#x00A3;81,000 from 1st October.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03764">The Lord Chancellor's salary lead has been established at &#x00A3;2,000. This figure was accepted by the House in 1983 and has remained at that level since then. There is no need to change it, even though its real value has been eroded since it was first established. This lead is there because the Lord Chancellor's position as head of the judiciary makes it appropriate for him to be paid a little more than the Lord Chief Justice. A lead of &#x00A3;2,000 adequately fulfils that requirement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03765">The order, which is not restrospective, therefore establishes the Lord Chancellor's salary at &#x00A3;82,690 when it comes into force on 19th May until 30th September. From 1st October it is established at &#x00A3;83,000. These levels derive directly from the TSRB report and encapsulate a principle that was established four years ago and has now been accepted by the House on four separate occasions. I hope it will also commend itself to the House this year. I commend the order to the House.</p>

We support the maintenance of the differential between the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of this House and the Lord Chief Justice in regard to their salaries.<lb/>
The appointment of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, and of course of the Speaker of the House, is one that is subject to changes in political climate. In case by the harsh arbitrament of arithmetic the present Lord Chancellor were to be excluded after the election, I think it right if on behalf of the Opposition I express our personal thanks and appreciation of the services of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor during the time that my colleagues and I have been here. His asides, which are not always <i>sotto voce</i>, have been greatly appreciated. As I have said, in the event of the harsh arbitrament of arithmetic&#x2014;and who shall question the possibility or probability?&#x2014;proving adverse to his future occupation of the Woolsack, we wish him well.</membercontribution></p>

I think I am right in saying that this is the final piece of legislation that this Parliament will deal with.

We naturally accept this order, but there may well be difficulties if the Government are returned and they intend to carry out their proposal that the abolition of rates will also be imposed in England and Wales, as it soon will be in Scotland. What we are doing today will be a more permanent feature rather than a gradual elimination.<lb/>

<title>PROHIBITION OF FEMALE CIRCUMCISION ACT 1985: IMPLEMENTATION</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03836"><member>Baroness Jeger</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03837">Whether they are satisfied with the implementation of the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985; and how many prosecutions have been brought for contraventions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03838"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Baroness Trumpington)</member>: Yes. The Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act bans a potentially harmful, though rare in this country, practice. The Act came into force on 16th September 1985; no prosecutions were brought thereafter in 1985. Information on court proceedings for 1986 is not yet available. Grants (totalling &#x00A3;86,000 from 1985&#x2013;86 to 1987&#x2013;88) are being paid to voluntary organisations to fund schemes to promote an information and education campaign about the Act's implications and the health problems to which female circumcision may give rise.</p>

<title>DEFERRED PENSION VALUES</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03839"><member>Lord Mottistone</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03840">How long a man of 70, commencing to receive the state pension because of the earnings rule, would have to stay alive to enable the discounted value of his increased benefits to equal the pension he has forgone over the previous five years; and how this compares with his actuarial life expectancy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03841"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member>: The rate at which increments to retirement pensions are paid does not vary with sex, marital status or the length of period of deferment of pension. It is intended to give a result which is broadly fair across the population as a whole, rather than an actuarially-calculated return in individual cases. On average, men defer taking pension for only about five months, and in the 12-month period to September 1986, only about 2 per cent. of pensions awarded were to men receiving increments for deferment for four and a half to five years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03842">At current benefit rates, a single man aged 70 retiring this year would recover the cash value of pension forgone in 13.5 years, by way of the increment awarded. On the assumption that he had been able to invest the whole of the benefit forgone, it would
<col>820</col>
however require a period of 20 years to enable the discounted value of increased pension to match the sum forgone, assuming an investment return of 3&#x00B7;5 per cent. above prices and the uprating of pensions in line with prices. The calculation is critically sensitive to those assumptions. The current life expectancy of a man aged 70 is 10 years.</p>

<title>MILK QUOTAS</title>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03843"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03844">Whether they will make a statement about the transfer of milk quotas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03845"><member>Lord Belstead</member>: Concern has been expressed about the operation of certain aspects of the rules for the transfer of milk quota with land. A number of difficult legal and practical questions have been raised and the Government have concluded that it would be appropriate to examine these fully with all those concerned before deciding on any posssible solutions. A consultation paper will be issued this week discussing the issues involved and inviting comment from interested organisations. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<title>HORTICULTURAL NURSERIES APPROVAL<lb/>SCHEME</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03846"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03847">What progress has been made towards the introduction of an approval scheme for horticultural nurseries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03848"><member>Lord Belstead</member>: I am pleased to announce the introduction with effect from 1st July of a voluntary scheme under which nurseries which maintain high standards will be able to qualify for approval by the Ministry. The scheme is directed at enterprises which produce plants (other than vegetables) or bulbs for export. I hope that it can be developed so that approved premises would in future be subject to less intensive pre-export inspections. This would mean that lower charges would apply to the inspection of plants and bulbs grown on approved premises. The scope for reduced inspections will be considered in the late summer with a view to operating differential charges early in 1988 if the scheme proves practicable and effective.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03849">Approval will be given only to enterprises which meet very high standards of plant health, hygiene and management. The assessment of enterprises which apply for approval will cover pest and disease control, soil and crop management, facilities, management structure, tidiness and hygiene.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03850">A fee of &#x00A3;50 will be payable on application for approval under the scheme: the fee for growers registered in the Ministry's Plant Health Propagation Scheme will be &#x00A3;25.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03851">The Ministry's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors will shortly be in contact with all exporters of bulbs and plants and will provide a leaflet explaining how the new scheme will operate.</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03856"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the adjournment of the House I should like, with great sincerity,
<col>822</col>
to offer the customary good wishes from my noble friends and myself to noble Lords in all other parts of the House. In a time of intense political activity I think it would be inappropriate to wish them anything in the form of relaxation, except perhaps noble Lords on the Cross-Benches. I also think it would be inappropriate in the circumstances, however lightheartedly, to make anything in the form of a political statement.<lb/>
What we all can take pleasure in, however, is that all the members of the staff who look after us so well in every department at this end of the Palace of Westminster will be enjoying something of a bonus, if not a wholly unexpected one, in the way of a well-earned rest. All of us wish them the fullest benefit of that.</membercontribution></p>

We wish noble Lords a different period of relaxation during the next month or so.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that he would not make a political speech on this occasion. Neither shall I make a political speech on this occasion; but I am hopeful that when he next makes an announcement to the House it will be from this Dispatch Box.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03858"><member>Baroness Stedman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on these Benches should like to associate ourselves with the comments made by the two noble Lords. We express our good wishes and thanks to all members of staff in every department who have served this House so faithfully and so well.<lb/>
The Government Chief Whip suggested that the Cross-Benches might have a period of relaxation but that perhaps the rest of us will not. Without being too political, I should like to say to those who will not have a period of relaxation, "A change is as good as a rest, and happy hustings to you all."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03861">Whether Peers and Members of the House of Commons who take the oath are still exempted from surveillance by the security services, without the specific authority of the Prime Minister of the day, since the direction to that effect by Lord Wilson of Rievaulx when Prime Minister.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03862"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (The Earl of Caithness)</member>: There has been no change in the policy stated in 1966 by the then Prime Minister the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, and to which successive governments since then have adhered. In answer to questions in another place on 17th November 1966 (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, cols.

634&#x2013;41), he said that he had given instructions that there was to be no tapping of the telephones of Members of Parliament; that that remained the policy of the Government and that, if there were any development which required a change in the general policy, he would, at such moment as seen compatible with the security of the country, on his own initiative make a Statement in the House about it. In answer to a Question in your Lordships' House on 22nd November 1966 (<i>Official Report,</i> col. 122) the noble Earl, Lord Longford, indicated on behalf of the Government that the foregoing statement extended to your Lordships' House. The policy as stated by the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, when Prime Minister, has since been reaffirmed in answers to Questions in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 6th February 1980, cols. 244-245, and 10th December 1986, col. 161) and by my right honourable friend the then Home Secretary (<i>Official Report,</i> Commons 11th December 1984, cols. 405-406).</p>

<p id="S5LV0487P0-03867">What plans they have for implementing the proposed Fresh Start package in the light of the Prison Officers' Association ballot.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03868"><member>The Earl of Caithness</member>: We welcome the result of the recent Prison Officers' Association ballot on Fresh Start. In view of the overwhelming support which prison officers and prison governors have expressed by their votes, we believe that Fresh Start should be implemented as soon as possible. We have in mind a staged process of implementation over the next six months starting in June with the introduction of the pay structures for the new Grades I to V of the service. This would be followed by the implementation of monthly par for prison officers in early July. Subject to local agreement the new working arrangements would be introduced in establishments from early July for those prisons where the process of reviewing structure had been completed, and thereafter in individual establishments as and when the process was completed. The aim would be to complete implementation by October. The new rates of pay for Grades VI to VIII would apply in an establishment on the date it converted to Fresh Start working. We shall in the usual
<col>824</col>
way consult the prison service unions on the entire programme of implementation as it proceeds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0487P0-03869">The hope is that the introduction of this package of reforms will produce an atmosphere in which a closer and more constructive relationship between prison service management and the Prison Officers' Association can be built up so that the full benefits of what has been agreed can be obtained.</p>

Of these changes, only the switch in October 1982 from counting registrants at Jobcentres and careers offices to counting benefit claimants, following the introduction of voluntary registration at Jobcentres, could be regarded as a change in the definition of unemployment.
