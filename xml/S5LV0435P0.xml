<title>Capital Gains Tax</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00237"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the first Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government how they justify the fact that whereas a single person with an annual income of &#x00A3;6,500, of which &#x00A3;5,000 is derived from capital gains and &#x00A3;1,500 from earnings or investment income, pays no tax whatsoever, another single person whose identical annual income is all earned must pay a total of &#x00A3;2,050&#x00B7;42 in income tax and national insurance contributions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00238"><member>The Secretary of State for Trade (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has correctly illustrated the difference between the individual's capital gains tax threshold&#x2014;namely, &#x00A3;5,000&#x2014;and the single person's income tax allowance of &#x00A3;1,565. Unlike income accruing in a single year, the gain realised on the sale of an asset may have accrued over many years and represent no more than an inflationary gain. It is appropriate that differences of this kind should be reflected in the respective tax treatment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00239"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. Nevertheless, would he not agree that anyone with access to capital or to contacts should have little difficulty in making a fairly consistent &#x00A3;5,000 a year from short-term capital gains, by which I mean gains deriving from assets held for only a few
<col>2</col>
weeks or months? In view of this, should not personal allowances for wage and salary earners be raised to more or less the same level, bearing in mind that a marginal rate of tax and national insurance combined of 38&#x00BE; per cent. on every pound earned in excess of &#x00A3;31 a week for a single person is unusually high, both by historical standards, taking inflation into account, and by the standards of other industrialised nations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00240"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord clearly moves in different circles from the rest of your Lordships' House. A person who regularly makes &#x00A3;5,000 a year in short-term capital gains must be an unusual individual. Quite apart from that, the reason for the &#x00A3;5,000 exemption was to take out of the tax people showing small gains, many of which had accrued over a long period of time, and I should be surprised to find the noble Lord advocating that such people should be brought within the charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00241">2.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00242"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the second Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government how they justify the fact that an individual who paid &#x00A3;10,000 in January for a holiday cottage, the value of which has since remained static in real terms, will incur a capital gains tax liability of between &#x00A3;9,000 and &#x00A3;10,500 if he sells today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00243"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, holiday cottages are treated in the same way as other assets for capital gains tax purposes. We have now provided relief for future inflation and also increased the threshold to &#x00A3;5,000. These measures will over time make the tax fairer and less oppressive. We could not go back and provide what, in effect, would be retrospective relief for past inflation.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0010"/>
<col>3</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00244"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his reply and I appreciate the point that he is trying to make. But would he not agree that, while the capital gains tax concessions made in the 1982 Finance Act are fair and even generous in respect of assets acquired from 1982 onwards, particularly where short-term gains are concerned, they are of virtually no use to people who have held an asset for 10, 15 or 20 years? Is it not almost immoral to levy an extremely high tax upon bogus paper gains which may, in some cases, actually represent losses in real terms, purely because of the inflation of the past 12 years, for which Conservative Administrations have been almost as responsible as Labour ones?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00245"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will not be surprised if, once again, I do not find myself in agreement with him. The &#x00A3;5,000 exemption for capital gains tax purposes will be of benefit to all people with a modest amount of capital who have made gains, which may be inflationary or real gains, over many years past. One needs to look at the two measures together&#x2014;the &#x00A3;5,000 exemption and the future protection against inflation&#x2014;to get a true picture of what has been done. The cost of going back to 1965 and providing relief for inflation which occurred back to that date would be far too high to be tolerable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00246"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the noble Lord agree that it would be better to levy a higher rate on genuine gains&#x2014;shall we say 40 per cent.&#x2014;and provide indexation for all past gains? The two would surely balance out and the whole thing would be very much fairer than it is at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00247"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I understood the noble Lord aright, he was advocating a higher rate of tax on short-term gains. In fact, in the early days of the tax, gains made in less than 12 months were charged as ordinary income. This produced very little tax yield, the reason quite simply being that people hold the assets until the period of high charge has passed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00248"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not these exchanges indicate how fortunate the House is that it does not have to consider the details of Finance Bills?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00249"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his very wise intervention.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EEC: Duty Free Concession Withdrawal</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00250">2.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00251"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what reply they have sent to the EEC Commission in response to that body's purported instruction to remove duty free concessions on sales in aircraft and at airports of goods produced outside the EEC.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00252"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have agreed, in common with the Governments of the other member
<col>4</col>
states of the European Community, that with effect from 1st January. 1983, the relief from customs duty and agricultural levies hitherto given on goods intended to be landed by intra-Community travellers as personal allowances shall be withdrawn. The existing reliefs from excise duties and VAT, which account for most of the benefit on personal purchases, will continue to be given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00253"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that extremely informative reply. May I ask him whether the Government will continue to bear in mind, as from their decision they plainly have borne in mind, the fact that duty free sales contribute a major element to the finance of airlines, which are going through a period of great difficulty, and also make a major contribution to the finance of the British Airports Authority?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00254"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand entirely the point that my noble friend is making. Indeed, in the discussions which led up to the final decision we made the point very, very firmly indeed that the exemption from excise duties and VAT should continue. We received specific assurances on that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00255"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that some of us would shed few tears if the whole pantomime of duty free goods on aircraft disappeared altogether? Is the noble Lord aware that sometimes the duty free arrangements appear to be what is colloquially known as a rip-off, under which our wives are persuaded to buy things they do not want at prices far in excess of those for which they could have obtained the same goods in a cash-and-carry at home?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00256"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are always some people who deplore the minor advantages which give pleasure to other people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00257"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to follow up this Question from the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, is the noble Lord aware that the duty free sales contribute something like &#x00A3;100 million a year to keeping down fares both on aircraft and on ferries and that if they were abolished there would be a very substantial increase in fares? The noble Lord did assure the House that so far as Brussels is concerned there is not too much danger that they will be abolished, but can he also assure the House that there is no danger of the European Court ruling that the concessions are not entirely within the rules of the European Community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00258"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I clearly have no power to influence any decisions that may be taken by the European Court. We have no reason to believe that there is anything illegal in the exemption from VAT and the excise duties. This is a matter upon which we have taken a very firm line and we shall continue to do so. May I quote the words actually used in the European Parliament by Commissioner Tugendhat on 15th June. What he said was this:
<quote>"We certainly do not wish to go any further than we have done. The overwhelming bulk of sales in duty free shops, goods of Community origin, are quite unaffected by this. That is the Court's judgment."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0011"/>
<col>5</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00259"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could the Minister say whether any thought is being given to the possibility of passengers picking up their duty free goods at the port of arrival so that there is a great saving in the shuttling of bottles all around the world?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00260"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a suggestion which has been made on a number of occasions. It has been considered, and I gather that it would give rise to considerable difficulties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00261"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord whether it would be possible for the representations of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, to be taken on board by the Government and for representations along the lines which he has suggested to be adopted by the Government and made to the EEC?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00262"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have made it clear in the replies I have already given, and I understood that this had been accepted by my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that there is a very clear distinction between import duty&#x2014;customs duty&#x2014;and agricultural levies on the one side and excise duty and VAT on the other. It is only the first items which, so far as this country is concerned, are of very limited importance to intra-Community travellers. It is only in respect of those items that the ruling applies. So far as the other items are concerned, we propose maintaining our objection to any attempt to abolish the exemption.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00263"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I not right in saying that, as from 1st January next, a state of confusion may exist in a place like Terminal I at Heathrow, where passengers travelling from Terminal 1 to Mexico will be able to buy duty-free American cigarettes although passengers travelling to Brussels will have to pay a different price for the same goods?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00264"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question does not relate to travellers to Mexico, however desirable a destination that might be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00265"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my point is that travellers using the same terminal who are going to Brussels will not have the benefit of the concessions with regard to goods which are manufactured in America, like American cigarettes, which will accrue to passengers to Mexico who use the same terminal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00266"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the actual administrative arrangements for dealing with these matters have been discussed in detail with the operators of the duty free shops concerned. An arrangement has been arrived at under which the relevant duty will be collected from the operators, who will then pass it on in the price. I would doubt in these circumstances&#x2014;because the amounts involved are very small indeed and so most purchases are not affected at all&#x2014;whether difficulties of the kind which the noble Lord has in mind would arise; but I am very willing to have the matter looked at and will communicate with the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00267"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are the Government aware that a great many airline pilots do not much like carrying people with a lot of little fire-bombs all over
<col>6</col>
the world? There was recently an accident when a re-fuelling team on the ground managed to set fire to a British Airways aircraft and the only people who were hurt were those people who were hugging their duty free liquor to their bosoms as they jumped out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00268"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it might be valuable to draw the noble Lord's remarks to the attention of people intending travelling on airplanes hugging bottles of duty free liquor to their breasts.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Tractors: Design Speed</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00269">2.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00270"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they intend to press the Council of Ministers to adopt a maximum design speed of 33 km/h for wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors and to move as speedily as possible towards the implementation of the comprehensive tractor harmonisation programme within the Community, as recommended by the European Communities Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00271"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have already done so. We have urged, and are likely to secure, early agreement to the raising of the limit to 30 kilometres per hour. This will be of considerable benefit to United Kingdom tractor manufacturers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00272"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I am sure that companies engaged in tractor manufacturing&#x2014;in which this country is the biggest in Europe&#x2014;will be delighted at this, but could the noble Earl say what he means by "early"? It would be delightful for tractor manufacturers if they knew when; the noble Earl said "early" and I would like to know when "early" is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00273"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, early tends to be earlier rather than later. I can tell the noble Lord that the issue is likely to go to the Committee of Permanent Representatives on this basis later this month and thereafter, of course, it will go to the Council of Ministers.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00275"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, for that. I thought that he was going to castigate me for not going for 33 kilometres per hour, which was the figure in the noble Lord's Question. I can tell him that the Government did press for 33 kilometres per hour. In fact, the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0012"/>

agreement was for 30 kilometres per hour, but there is a tolerance of 10 per cent., which will permit manufacturers to design for 33 kilometres per hour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00276"><member>Lord Collison</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that there has been concern in some places with regard to the safety factor? Is he aware also that when Sub-Committee B dealt with this matter a copy of the proposals was sent to the National Union of Agricultural Workers (now a section of the Transport and General Workers' Union) and that they raised no objections to it; and that from the workers' point of view they seem to be quite happy and accept this proposal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00277"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Collison, for telling me once again that the National Union of Agricultural Workers which was, and which is now part of the Transport and General Workers' Union, has reacted in its characteristically helpful manner.</membercontribution></p>

Perhaps I can speak also to Amendment No. 331, to save time. By way of very short preface, the Marshalled List contains what at first glance would seem to be a formidable list of amendments. Perhaps I can reassure your Lordships by saying that a great many of the amendments fall quite conveniently into groupings. Therefore, with the leave of the House, I shall be able to move a great many of them <i>en bloc</i>. We can consider them in that manner although, of course, if at any moment any noble Lord wishes to break up the <i>bloc</i>, then that will be perfectly easy as well.<lb/>
Amendment No. 1 provides for a more effective safeguard against delay on the part of licensing authorities in taking decisions on applications to be included in Clause 3. While appeal against refusal of a licence is covered in the Bill, appeal against delay is not specifically mentioned and redress can only be obtained by lengthier and more costly procedures. Given the overriding need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible in the interests of the applicant's livelihood, licensing authorities should in normal circumstances be obliged to reach a decision on a licensing application within six months. The amendment seeks to strike an equitable balance between the rights of the applicant and the adminstrative needs of the local authority by giving the authority the right to petition the sheriff for an extension of the six-month period in specific cases where it has proved impossible to complete inquiries on an application within six months. Authorities should not delay decisions unnecessarily, but neither should they be forced to take over-hasty decisions&#x2014;and this clause as amended seeks to cover all reasonable eventualities.<lb/>
The sanction of failure to take a decision within six months is that where no decision has been taken the licence shall be deemed to have been granted or renewed unconditionally and shall immediately be made out and delivered to the applicant. However, since objectors will have no right of appeal against the grant of such a licence, and since it will not be possible for the licensing authority to impose operating conditions upon it, there must be safeguards against any possible abuse on the part of the licensee; accordingly, a licence granted under this clause remains in force for one year only, rather than the normal three. While it is in force, the licensing authority will be able to exercise its regulatory powers under Schedule 1 to vary or suspend the licence where a change in circumstances or misconduct render this desirable.<lb/>
Amendment No. 331 is a minor drafting and consequential amendment which inserts appropriate reference to Clause 3, as amended, into paragraph 9(4) of Schedule 1. I beg to move.<lb/>

I attended a well-known and important international seminar in Scotland last Wednesday, at Hampden

<col>9</col>
Park, and I am afraid that my voice is all the worse for that&#x2014;especially when Scotland scored the second goal. But this is quite an important amendment because, as things stand at the moment, district licensing authorities have to deal with each application and reach a final decision upon it without unreasonable delay. If one suggests to them that they can have six months and also, if they are hard pressed for time, that they can go to the sheriff and get a little longer, I do not believe it quite fits in with the original intention of your Lordships' House. I would like a little more explanation from the noble Earl the Minister about how he considers that six months, with a possible extension granted by the sheriff, meets with our wishes in the first instance. I do not know who prompted the Government to do this in another place&#x2014;it may have been a friend of mine; I do not know&#x2014;but I personally do not consider that this is a very good amendment. I am not going to press it but I would like some reasonable consideration of it.<lb/>
May I say to your Lordships that we have only 365 amendments, and let us not rush away with the feeling that our consideration of them will be overly quick because we have a completely new clause here, which necessitated the back-up of another schedule of about 20 pages, dealing with sex shops. We have another important new clause in relation to indecent photographs of children and how we should tackle that problem.<lb/>
There are now new clauses within this Bill that we have not seen before, and knowing how anxious your Lordships are to give due prominence and attention to important matters in Scotland I expect there will be many taking part in our debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00286"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will know that these provisions were intoduced in the other place on Report in response to a debate which took place in Committee, to the effect that there should be a more substantial safeguard against delay on the part of the licensing authority in taking a final decision on an application than the present provision that such decision must be reached without unreasonable delay. A cut-off date within which the district council must dispose of the application was suggested. Members accepted that an absolute cut-off point could present problems for the authority who would not, with the best will in the world, have been able to complete necessary inquiries on the application within the prescribed period. I think this came about as a result of the debate, perhaps as a compromise, and it seems to be reasonably logical in the circumstances.</membercontribution></p>

I wish also, in moving these amendments, to speak to Amendments Nos. 12 and 13.<lb/>
We come to Clause 5, which deals with powers of entry and inspection by an authorised officer of the licensing authority, the fire authority or a constable.<lb/>
The powers relate to any premises, vehicle or vessel in respect of which a licence is in force or has been applied for, but the purposes of these powers, referred to in paragraph 5(1), we felt was less than clear. Amendment No. 2 and the first part of Amendment No. 3 therefore clearly define the purposes for which the power of entry may be used.<lb/>
The second part of Amendment No. 3 and Amendments Nos. 4, 5, 8, 12 and 13 are primarily drafting amendments designed to move the offence provisions on obstructing an authorised officer from Clause 7 into Clauses 5 and 6, which contain the relevant powers of search and entry, <i>et cetera</i>. In doing this, they make two minor changes to the existing provisions. First, Amendment No. 4 requires a person
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0014"/>
<col>11</col>
to produce his licence "within 5 days" rather than "within a reasonable time", and secondly, by Amendment No. 13, a person convicted of this relatively minor offence will no longer be liable to have his licence revoked under Clause 7(8).<lb/>
Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are also primarily drafting amendments. Under subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 5, constables who are not in uniform and authorised officers of licensing or fire authorities must show their credentials before exercising the powers of entry and inspection conferred on them by subsection (1) of Clause 5. The person to whom the credentials must be shown, however, is currently referred to as the person in respect of whom the powers are being exercised, in the present tense rather than the future tense. The amendments are, therefore, purely drafting and are designed to make it clear that credentials must be shown before the powers are exercised. I beg to move.<lb/>

I do not suppose there is any application to the sheriff for an extension of those five days. Having heard of six months being reasonable in respect of something else, I should have thought that five days might not be a good figure, bearing in mind that a weekend might intervene and there might be some hold-ups. I am not going to oppose this, but I do not think there has been any very clear thinking in respect of these specific periods put in elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>

Amendment No. 9 increases the penalty for the offence under Clause 7(1), of doing anything for which a licence is required under Part II of the Bill without having a licence, from &#x00A3;200 to &#x00A3;500. The Government agreed to make this increase in response to arguments advanced by the Opposition on the basis that &#x00A3;200 was not a sufficient deterrent. The other amendments effect consequential changes in the penalties for various offences in Part II of the Bill, mainly dealing with dishonesty, and are designed to keep those penalties in step with the revised Clause 7(1) penalty. In addition, Amendment No. 151 removes the alternative penalty of a period of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days for the offence in Clause 35(3) of a metal dealer keeping false records, the Government having accepted the Opposition's arguments that imprisonment was not an appropriate sanction for this offence.<lb/>

At Committee and Report stage, the Government accepted Opposition views that "wilfully" could be dropped without affecting the drafting of the subsection. Amendment No. 10 achieves this removal of unnecessary wording. Amendment No. 14 is a drafting amendment also to remove unnecessary verbiage.<lb/>
Amendment No. 15 is a drafting amendment to remove the element of certification from the requirement by the clerk of court to advise the licensing authority of any conviction of a licence holder. At present clerks simply convey the details of conviction to the licensing authorities by copying the extract from their records. Certification, as the term suggests, calls for something more elaborate and, in the context, is unnecessary. Amendment No. 15 would ensure that the present simple procedure would remain in operation. Amendments Nos. 126, 155 and 158 are in identical terms. I beg to move.<lb/>

Concern was expressed during the Committee stage in another place, that there was no provision enabling a person disqualified by an order of the court to make an application to that court to have the disqualification removed. The Government undertook to draft such a provision and the second part of the amendment&#x2014;subsection (9B)&#x2014;achieves this. When considering the matter, it was also considered appropriate to make orders under subsection (8) subject to appeal and to permit courts to suspend orders pending any such appeal. The first part of the amendment&#x2014;subsection (9A)&#x2014;achieves this.<lb/>
When considering the proposed provision, regard was had to the provisions of the Road Traffic Act in relation to the lifting of disqualifications under that Act. That Act narrates the circumstances which the court may take into account, specifies a minimum period of one year, or one half of the period of disqualification (whichever is the longer) before the application can be made, and prohibits repeated applications within a specified period where the first application is unsuccessful. It was felt that such elaborate provisions were not required here. The court may take any relevant considerations into account: the period of a year's disqualification before application can be made to have the disqualification lifted seems sufficient, and common prudence would normally discourage any applicant from repeated early reapplications when the first application is refused. That is because the court would be unlikely to reverse its earlier decision until a reasonable time had elapsed. The costs of the repeated unsuccessful application would fall on the applicant.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00318"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their amendment. It may be for the convenience of the House if we debate together all the amendments to Schedule 1, which flows from this clause. If that is so, I shall speak to all of them at once. I shall be speaking to Amendments Nos. 307 to 330 inclusive, and 332 to 359.<lb/>
As can he seen, Schedule 1 was radically amended in the other place. It is, perhaps, a relief to know that the actual number of amendments is misleading because Schedule 1 is a complex inter-related whole and so it was often necessary to make a large number of amendments to achieve a single aim. The changes fall into six main groupings. I shall deal with these briefly but can expand if any noble Lord would like me to.<lb/>
In the first place, important changes to the procedure for applying for a licence were made by Amendments Nos. 307 to 313 and Amendments Nos. 318, 320, 322 and 337. Amendments Nos. 315, 336 and 338 to 344 alter the procedures for licensing authority consideration of possible grant, renewal or suspension of licences.<lb/>
Amendments 315, 340 and 346 within that group provided that the informal inquiries which licensing authorities may make in connection with such consideration may be given formal status in the decision-making procedure. In respect of the grant or renewal of a licence, Amendment 315 makes hearings discretionary rather than mandatory, and provides an alternative written mode of procedure where no hearing is to be held but the licensing authority none the less has objections or results of inquiries to take into account. The principal effect of this amendment&#x2014;suggested to us by COSLA&#x2014;will be to eliminate the need for a hearing in respect of unopposed applications. In relation to suspension Amendments 341 to 344 introduce a similar discretion in respect of hearings, though to safeguard the licence holder a hearing must be held before suspension is imposed. Amendment 344 simplifies the procedure for hearings on suspension, and Amendments 336, 338 and 339 bring the procedure for suspending licences into that for refusal by making it clear that the existence of grounds for suspension is a matter of a licensing authority's judgment.<lb/>
The third group of amendments, Amendments 316, 324 and 327 relate to decisions on licences. For example, Amendment 327 removes the chief constable and fire authority's power of veto over the granting of a temporary licence and Amendments 316 and 324 delete the power of Secretary of State to make by statutory instrument model licence conditions to be taken into account by licensing authorities. These latter amendments will no doubt be warmly welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Ross, who argued strongly that the then provisions were clumsy and unnecessarily formal.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0016"/>
<col>15</col>
The fourth group makes extensive amendment to the procedures to be followed by licensing authorities after taking any of the decisions which they take under Schedule 1. It is made clear on the face of the Bill by Amendments 321, 333, 334, 345 and 348 that the licensing authority must notify its decision in writing to interested parties within seven days.<lb/>
Paragraph 16B, as introduced by Amendment 351, draws together and clarifies provisions in respect of giving of reasons for decisions, providing that a request for such reasons may be lodged by a relevant interested party within 28 days of the date of the decision and provided within 10 days thereafter by the licensing authority. Previously, reasons had to be requested within 48 hours and provided thereafter within an unspecified period. This revised timetable gives longer for the request of reasons and eliminates any risk of local authority procrastination.<lb/>
Finally, I should also mention Amendments 322, 328 and 329 which make transfer and validity of licences easier in specified circumstances. As your Lordships may recall, when we considered this Bill in Committee we had a lengthy debate on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribing specifically for transfer of licences, during which the noble Lord, Lord Ross, made it clear that his main concern was with the lack of provision for automatic transfer of a licence in the event of a licence holder's death. I promised to reconsider this point, and the noble Lord may be pleased to see that in Amendment 329 the Government have now provided for the automatic transfer of a licence to an executor for a period of up to three months. Amendments 328, 329 and 322 make the provisions in respect of temporary and joint licences more flexible to avoid undue inconvenience and hardship to licence holders in specified circumstances.<lb/>
This brief account, of course, provides only an outline of the main effects of the amendments to Schedule 1. Many of them have been introduced in response to helpful Opposition comments and criticisms in both Houses and I believe that none is controversial. They all reflect what I took to be the feelings of the House when we last discussed the schedule. There was a concern that we should aim for a more straightforward and flexible pattern of procedures. The changes have, of course, also been welcomed by the convention.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00319"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not make any effort to go through the list of amendments. It would have been helpful to have known that the amendments were to be taken in that order. I received something a couple of hours ago as to how amendments were to be taken together, but capable as I am of going through the Bill I do not think two hours is quite sufficient. This particular batch was not included in that advice, and I think that makes matters more difficult.<lb/>
As to the purpose of the amendments, I think that the noble Earl will Appreciate the horror with which many of his friends in another place read this Bill and this whole matter relating to licensing. They saw being
<col>16</col>
built up a monstrosity of bureaucracy. I think that noble Lords on the noble Earl's side of the House had the same fears about it. Although what I believe to be a pretty monstrous provision in the Bill is still there, it is certainly now a little better than it was. I am very glad indeed that the noble Earl, who was prepared to rely on the good sense of licensing authorities in relation to granting time for executors acting for widows and for families, has now seen the light and decided that it is far better actually to have that in the Bill, to relieve people of the strain of worry that the loss of a husband might even mean the loss of a business.<lb/>
On the whole. I do not think that anyone can object at all to the amendments that have been made. The sad thing is that they were not made quickly enough. I think that many of them should have been made in this House. Having appreciated the good sense of the debates in this House, I hope that the Government and the Government Ministers will assert themselves a little more and not leave to another place what patently should be done.</membercontribution></p>

I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their amendments. During Committee stage debate in another place Members on both sides expressed their concern that the public entertainment provisions in Clause 44 were drafted so widely that almost any public entertainment activity could be caught, whether or not there was any public safety consideration. The Government accepted that the clause should be reconsidered and perhaps improved and eventually concluded that public entertainment should he an optional provision rather than a mandatory one, and Amendment No. 20 achieves just this.<lb/>
Because of the diversity of activities which are encompassed under the heading of public entertainments, it is considered that the licensing authority should be specific and identify those places or classes of places of public entertainment to be licensed in any resolution. Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 achieve this. This affords no absolute guarantee that any particular type of public entertainment will escape, but it has proved impossible to provide a definition of those types of entertainment which should be included, or those which should be excluded, which would ensure that those kinds of activities about which concern has been expressed would escape the Bill's requirements; nor is it feasible to compile an exhaustive list. The matter must, therefore, be left to the good sense of local authorities responding to local needs in light of consultation with those most immediately concerned; and of course the requirement that the relevant resolution shall specify the place, rather than the activity, will help to avoid some of the problems which were highlighted in debate. Amendment No. 23 is a drafting amendment to remove surplus verbiage. I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00337"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 24 to 27 <i>en bloc</i>. I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 32 to 34, 37 to 40, 42 to 44, 47, 51 to 54, 56, 57, 88, 89, 93, 95, 98 to 100, and 108 to 110. We now come to the question of taxis and private hire cars. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, is in his place. The essence of this group of amendments is contained in the definitions for taxis and private hire cars, which in fact are contained in Amendment No. 110. The other amendments are purely consequential on Amendment No. 110 with its revised definitions.<lb/>
These definitions are the product of discussions we have had with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the taxi and hire car trades. We aim to achieve the object summarised by the convention: that the definition should make it clear that:
<quote>"a taxi can do everything that a hire care can do, and in addition pick up passengers in public places&#x2014;streets, ranks, stations etc.".</quote>
In common parlance, the definition aims to ensure that the taxi can "ply for hire" and can be flagged down without prior arrangement in a street or other public place. Because of that its fares are controlled. By contrast the private hire car can be made available for personal conveyance with a view to profit at a freely negotiated price but cannot, like a taxi, be engaged by arrangements made in a public place between the potential passenger and its driver.<lb/>
In the proposed new Clause 22 defined in Amendment No. 110, subsection (2) introduces a general class of "hire car" and defines it as a motor vehicle with a driver other than a public service vehicle which is "with a view to profit" available for hire by personal conveyance. Subsection (1) first defines the taxi as being a special case of that "hire car" if it satisfies two further conditions: it must be engaged by arrangements made in a public place with the driver, and the journey for which it is engaged must begin "there and then"; in other words, there is no advance booking. Any other kind of "hire car" is reclassified as a "private hire car", and the purpose of Amendments Nos. 24 to 108 is to change the references to "hire car" in the Bill to "private hire car".<lb/>
In subsection (2) the general class of "hire car" to which both the taxi and the new style "private hire car" will belong is defined as a vehicle other than a public service vehicle which is let with its driver with a view to profit for hire by personal conveyance. The reference to "a view to profit" is necessary so as not to inadvertently catch a number of voluntary transport arrangements for disabled people where a small charge is made but which are run basically as a charitable activity. In subsection (3) the intention is to make it clear that once a vehicle is operated as a taxi then it will continue to be treated as a taxi for all the time that it is meeting the criterion in subsection (2). In other words, a taxi summoned by a radio booking through a central control point will still be subject to taxi regulation.<lb/>
Amendments 52 and 54 arise from convention suggestions that the holder of a taxi driver's licence need not apply for a separate private hire car driver's licence should he wish to drive a private hire car. This
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0018"/>
<col>19</col>
is sensible as a taxi can do all that a private hire car can do and a licensed taxi driver should be able to drive a licensed private hire car without having to seek a separate licence to do so. It will also reduce the administrative burden on the licensing authority.<lb/>
Amendment 109 closes a loophole in the exemption for vehicles which are used under contract for 24 hours or more. If a vehicle had a standing contract for a certain hire each day it could under the Bill as it left this House have been exempted for the whole span covered by the contract even though the hire lasted for a short time only each day and the vehicle was free to undertake other hirings. This amendment, by applying the exemption to exclusive use during 24 hour plus contractors, ensures that this loophole is closed.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00338"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister for his explanation and to the Government for their actions in this respect. The only thing I would suggest is that this Bill started out somewhere about 10 years ago. Then a few years ago we had a model Bill. Then we had the actual Bill which left this place in March. It is a pity there had not been a little more consultation with the people concerned, the local authorities, and with the Federation of Taxi Owners and the hire car organisations, although I gather that they more or less come into being with the Bill. They suddenly realised how important it was that their voice should be heard, so I cannot blame the Government for not consulting them.<lb/>
However, it means that we have such a mix-up that it is almost impossible to relate the old Bill to the new Bill. While the improvements are certainly there it would have been fairer on Members of this House if a little more consideration and consultation had taken place, and it would have probably cut down some of the debates that we had at that time. There are other important matters to come in relation to the actual regulations and in relation to the taxis and also signs on the vehicles, but we are grateful for the changes that have been made. It has certainly simplified and clarified the definition and lessened the possibility of confusion between hire cars and taxis which go around with a sign "For Hire" on top of them and yet they are not for hire at all in the same sense. Both the language as we have it now and the explanation by the Minister are a considerable improvement.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00345"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House&#x2014;I am not sure that it really ought to be given, and I am anxious that this should not become a Committee stage&#x2014;I assume that the noble Lord, Lord Davies, is referring to insurance and the third party cover which the operator, for want of a better expression, of a taxi or hire car has to take out. That is regulated, or can be regulated, by the licensing which operates in a particular licensing area. So far as the state is concerned, the owner or operator of a taxi has to conform to the Road Traffic Acts in the same way as anybody else. So far as the licensing authority is concerned it would be up to them to impose any further obligations as they see fit as a condition of the licence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00350"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 28 to 30. I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 55 and 58 to 60. Amendment No. 28 makes specific that before granting a licence the licensing authority must be satisfied that the vehicle is not only suitable as to design but also safe at the time. If the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, would look at Clause 10(2) of the Bill he will also see
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0019"/>
<col>21</col>
the provision there as to the duty of a local authority not to issue a licence unless they are satisfied that the Road Traffic Acts have been complied with so far as insurance is concerned.<lb/>
Amendment No. 29 is a drafting amendment to make it clear that as intended the policy of insurance which must be in force for a taxi or private hire car is one which complies with Part VI of the Road Traffic Act 1972. Amendment 30 empowers the licensing authority to limit the number of taxi licences. There has been considerable debate both here and in another place on the question of whether local authorities should have a power to limit the number of taxi licences. Noble Lords will recall our earlier debates in which the noble Lords, Lord Ross and Lord Underhill, played significant parts. I hope that both of them will welcome this particular amendment. The argument concerned factors unique to the taxi trade, for instance that their fares were controlled by a local authority and that existing operators under the present system of limitation who had bought their way in could suffer a capital loss if such limitation were removed.<lb/>
The trade have argued that absence of limitation powers could mean a reduction in the availability of services on a seven day week, 24 hours a day basis throughout the licensing authority's area, because full-time operators would he driven out of business and the remaining part-timers would concentrate on city centres at weekends, where the demand is highest, and that this could mean a reduction in the availability of services in the peripheral areas and at unsocial hours. Without being persuaded that that would inevitably be the effect, this amendment will allow a local authority to refuse a licence if it thought that it would indeed produce such adverse effects on availability.<lb/>
The amendment also refers to costs of providing the service, so that the authority will be able to take account of whether granting a licence would result in a decrease in the profitability of individual taxi operators who would then feel forced to press for higher cost. I doubt whether this is really likely&#x2014;it seems perverse for more competition to put up cost and prices&#x2014;but this amendment meets the trade's point and will allow the local authority to take account of such factors if they exist. The amendments have been agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the taxi trade and were welcomed when they were tabled on Report in another place. Amendment No. 55 removes a provision which the Committee in another place thought to be redundant on drafting grounds, though I should emphasise that the policy is unchanged.<lb/>
Amendment No. 58 arises from representations made by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that the reference to "fails such a test" is too precise a term which leaves discretion to the licensing authority. Amendment No. 58 therefore provides that a licencing authority may refuse a licence if they are not satisfied that an applicant has "adequate knowledge". Under Amendment No. 59, if a taxi or hire car driver's ordinary driver's licence was withdrawn or suspended under the Road Traffic Act 1972, the licensing authority may not know immediately that this has occurred and it may take time for them to revoke the licence. Amendment No. 59 was suggested by the convention and therefore provides that if a driver has his driving
<col>22</col>
licence taken away, then the taxi or hire car driver's licence automatically ceases to have effect.<lb/>
Amendment No. 60 removes a redundant provision and is similar in concept to Amendment No. 55.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00351"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am unstinting in my gratitude to the Minister for these amendments. In fact, listening to him, I could almost hear the kind of speeches which my noble friend Lord Ross and I made in this House.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00352"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret Amendment No. 30 because the matter could have been left to competition. I cannot see that a person can start up a business and destroy a good taxi service; he starts up only if there is a need. I shall not oppose it, but I regret that the Government have given way on the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00353"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad the Government have taken the action they have. The Minister will remember that we pointed out that this point was made in a report over 10 years ago. It was surprising to me that the Government rejected the advice given to them by that working party. Nevertheless, I am glad they have come round to this form of wording because I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, that it is competition in the accepted sense. It is often unfair competition. Part-timers will not give a service except at times when they think it proper to provide that service, and all they are doing at those times is reducing the facilities available by knocking out those whose whole livelihood is earned by providing a service to the public at all times. It results in a very patchy service because if you knock out a full-time man, the part-timer will not be there, say, in the morning or in the afternoon when there is not a lot of business about, so from the point of view of service to the public, which should be paramount, the Government have come eventually to the right decision, and I am grateful to them for that.<lb/>
As for Amendment No. 58, it is proposed to remove the word "fails such a test" and insert words to the effect that the local authority or licensing authority are not satisfied that they have sufficient knowledge. The provision says:
<quote>"A licensing authority may require an applicant for a taxi driver's licence to take a test".</quote>
Surely everyone understands what happens if he fails the test. Why the four words "fails such a test" should be wiped out and be replaced by a whole new phrase saying that the local authority is not satisfied with the knowledge I am at a loss to understand. I can only think that the Government suddenly gave way to their supporters in Committee when they agreed to the change, It may not make a great deal of difference, but it does not seem to make sense to say that when you order someone to take a test you dare not say that they have failed the test.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00354"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, shows the dichotomy which exists between those who believe in unfettered free enterprise and those who for one purpose or another, seek, as in this instance, to fetter it. I think any student of <i>Hansard</i> would know what the Government's original thinking was on this and how it has changed in the interim. Probably the clue lies in the fact that attitudes in the urban central belt of Scotland are rather different from those in that part of Scotland from where the noble Lord and I come, one at each end of what I call the raspberry belt, where rather different considerations and standards apply, and I would remind the noble Lord that there will be no necessity for either of our two local district councils to impose licensing at all on taxis if they do not want to.<lb/>
As for the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Ross, concerning Amendment No. 58, as I said, sometimes the Government can be criticised for trying to be over-precise and sometimes they can be criticised for making the wording of a statute imprecise. This matter was strongly pressed on us by the convention. Personally, I rather lean to the Ross outlook on this, but nevertheless the convention made its point felt as a matter of primary concern to them. We felt we should try to meet them over it and that is what we have done.<lb/>

I shall, with permission, speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 90 and 91. Amendments Nos. 31 and 90 arise from representations by the convention that Clauses 10 and 19 did not give the Secretary of State sufficient discretion to specify different types of vehicles for different areas. There was a danger that he could not differentiate between the needs of the city centres and those of the rest of the country, which may have quite different requirements. For example, it may be held that the so-called metropolitan cab is suitable for the major city centres, and it would not make sense to oblige the local authority to accept as suitable a type of vehicle which may be entirely suitable in more dispersed and rural areas, but not in a city centre.<lb/>
Amendment No. 91 arises from a convention comment that, while the Secretary of State's orders on conditions under Clause 19(1) should of course be subject to some form of parliamentary procedure, because they may in effect either substantially restrict the discretion of the local authorities or create criminal offences, the same considerations do not apply to orders on vehicle types which would merely provide that a vehicle of the specified type would have to be regarded by the local authority as acceptable in type, though it would still be able to refuse a licence if the vehicle was unsafe. The local authority however would still be free to grant a licence to other types of vehicle if it wished. However, the pace of change of vehicle design is such that it makes sense to have speedy

changes in the regulations if necessary without them being subject to negative resolution procedure.<lb/>
I should emphasise that this order-making power has been strongly pressed on us by the taxi trade, which believes that there is a case for some safeguard to ensure that local authorities do not impose&#x2014;though often for the best motives&#x2014;unreasonably high standards of vehicle design on the trade, with consequent high costs both to the trade and subsequently to the public. The power is a reserve power and I hope that it will not be necessary in that we can work out reasonable guidelines in joint discussions with the convention and the trade.<lb/>

Nothing in the Bill prohibits private hire cars from being fitted with taximeters, as these can be a useful aid to the private hire car trade. The amendments ensure however that, in circumstances where a taximeter is so fitted, the public are adequately protected. Amendment No. 41 amends Clause 11 to provide for the inspection of taximeters not only on taxis, but also where they may have been fitted on private hire cars. Amendment No. 102 provides that, if a private hire vehicle equipped with a taximeter undertook hirings, then the fare scales laid down by the district council for taxis would apply to the extent that the hire car could not charge higher fares without committing an offence. There is of course nothing to stop the hire car charging lower fares than those in the district council's fare scales. But the amendment removes an incentive for hire cars to pass themselves off as taxis, with meters, and then exploit the public by charging higher fares.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00386"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 45. The amendment reduces from two months to 28 days the period after which a vehicle licence is deemed to be suspended if a vehicle is put off the road by a constable or authorised officer for reasons of safety or accuracy of taximeter and he has not been satisfied within that time that the defect has been rectified. This deemed suspension is to allow the licenceholder the right of appeal.<lb/>
<col>26</col>
The two-month period was suggested by the trade as a maximum reasonable period to allow for the making good of major accident damage and possible delays in obtaining spares. The trade was previously concerned that a shorter period might result in automatic suspension under the provisions of paragraph 12 of the schedule, which could be lifted only on appeal to the sheriff. That might be unnecessarily cumbersome in the case of delays attributable only to delays in the arrival of the necessary spare parts. However, the schedule now provides&#x2014;under Amendment No. 340&#x2014;for a licensing authority to lift a suspension at any time. In view of that, a two-month period is no longer necessary, and the rights of the individual are probably better protected by the shorter period of 28 days. I understand that the taxi trade is content with the amendment.<lb/>

That was amended in the light of comments by the noble Lord, Lord Ross.<lb/>
Amendment No. 50 has the effect of excluding the costs of taxi stances (provided under Clause 18) from the administrative and other costs to be financed from licence fees.

Clause 14 makes it an offence to display certain signs on a vehicle other than a licensed taxi. This is in order to prevent pirate vehicles, or private hire cars, passing themselves off as legitimate licensed taxis. Amendment 61 extends this offence provision not only to such signs on the vehicles but also to such signs in the vehicle. It also makes it clear that this offence provision applies to private hire cars.<lb/>
So far as Amendment No. 62 is concerned, during the debate in another place concern was expressed that, as introduced, Clause 14(1)(<i>a</i>), which detailed words which cannot be used, could be too restrictive of legitimate advertising of the names of firms or services. It would also catch hire cars from unlicensed areas
<col>28</col>
legitimately entering a licensing area to deliver a passenger. Amendment 62 therefore deletes subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) of Clause 14, which dealt with specific words, and rests instead on the list of features previously contained in Clause 14 (1)(<i>b</i>), though it adds "word" to those features. It makes the intention clear that the offence is that of suggesting that the vehicle is for hire as a taxi. This amendment therefore will allow legitimate advertising and provides that vehicles merely passing through an area are not committing an offence simply because the name of a hire car firm is shown on them.<lb/>
Amendment 63 exempts from the offence provisions of this clause not only licence plates but any other means of identification which the licensing authority may require to be displayed on the vehicle. As the intention of this clause to apply to private hire cars is now made clear the redundant exemption for public service vehicles is deleted. I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00401"><member>Lord Ross of Marnoek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is interesting to note that the word which was so offensive in the original provision was the word "hire", and, of course, the offending vehicles are private "hire" cars. We can appreciate just how tricky it is to deal with private hire cars and say that they must not in any case use the word "hire" or "hires". Now we have a much more general definition, which I presume could include the word "hire", depending on how it is used and where it is placed. It shows just how tricky the whole thing is, which stems from the rather colloquial definitions of the two types of vehicle that provide a service, the one a taxi which goes round with the word "hire" on it and the other the private hire car, which originally we thought should never call itself or advertise itself as for hire.</membercontribution></p>

Amendment 64 corrects a drafting imprecision. Control is exercised by the licensing authority by means of licensing conditions under paragraph 5 of Schedule 1. Amendment 64 therefore replaces the general reference to control by a licensing authority over vehicles going to destinations covered by this clause outwith the licensing area by a specific reference to licensing conditions.<lb/>
The new clause introduced by Amendment 65 provides that licensed Scottish taxis and hire cars may pick up passengers in England, and arises from difficulties experienced by Scottish taxis picking up passengers in England, particularly at Berwick railway station. At present, this is illegal. The amendment will put licensed Scottish taxis on an equal footing to taxis licensed in England. This new clause amends the appropriate offence provisions of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, which applies in England and Wales, to provide that taxis and private hire cars licensed in Scotland may pick up passengers in England provided that the request for the hiring&#x2014;for example, in response to a telephone hooking&#x2014;was received in the area in which they are licensed.<lb/>
Amendment 97 amends Clause 20 of the Bill to provide reciprocity for English licensed vehicles which wish to pick up a pre-hooked passenger in Scotland. It is therefore the other side of Amendment 65. Amendment 97&#x2014;and, indeed, Amendment 96 is a paving amendment for it&#x2014;also amends Clause 20(2), which provides for the picking up of passengers in another licensed area, to make it clear that the request for such a hiring must be received by the driver either in the area for which he is licensed or while he is travelling from his own licensed area in the course of a hire, or is in the course of immediately returning to his own area on completion of a hire. This ensures that the blatant abuse of deliberately stationing vehicles in another licensed area so as to respond to radio calls sent from their headquarters can be dealt with appropriately. This amendment has been welcomed by the National Federation of Taxi Cab Associations and the convention. I beg to move.<lb/>

There is only one thing that I regret, and that is that an opportunity was missed in the tidying up. To take Amendment No. 67, we continue with the words,
<quote>"(whether proceeding upon a review under this section or not)".</quote>
I do not think these words mean anything at all. They certainly do not add anything to the sense of subsection (2): and, indeed, since they are unnecessary they will tend to confuse the person who reads them. It is too late now to do anything about it, but I regret that the department did not notice this and get rid of these words when they were clearing up other things.<lb/>

Perhaps I may speak also to Amendment No. 107. Amendment No. 104 is a paving amendment for No. 105. Amendment No. 105 introduces a new offence of operating or driving a taxi while knowing that the seal on its meter has been broken or that the meter is registering incorrectly. This is because the seal on the meter is to ensure that the meter has not been tampered with. In addition Amendent No. 105 deletes
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0025"/>
<col>33</col>
the offence of altering a taximeter to make it read incorrectly.<lb/>
During consideration in another place of this subsection, disquiet arose over the precise meaning of "incorrectly". On consideration, it did not prove possible to produce a satisfactory definition of "incorrect" which did not appear to risk confusion between calibration, on the one hand, and the approved fare scales on the other. The purpose of the references to a meter registering incorrectly was to prevent fraud, a matter already covered by common law. In view of the difficulties surrounding the reference to a meter registering incorrectly, Amendment No. 105 deletes the reference to the offence of the meter registering incorrectly. The offence therefore will rest on the common law of fraud.<lb/>
Amendment No. 107 deletes Clause 20(8). This subsection provided a defence for drivers of public service vehicles from the offence in Clause 20(6) of causing or permitting without reasonable excuse a vehicle other than a taxi to wait on a taxi stance. The defence would be to show that it was only by reason of obstruction to traffic or other compelling reason, or only so long as was reasonably necessary for taking up or setting down passengers. These defences are however already covered by the "reasonable excuse" defence in Clause 20(6) and subsection (8) is therefore redundant.<lb/>
Amendment No. 107 also deletes Clause 20(9) which provided that, for the purposes of proceedings under this Act, any vehicle with a taximeter is presumed to be a taxi unless the contrary is proved.<lb/>

As it presently stands. Clause 23 does not make it clear that a pawnbroker who also acts as a second-hand dealer requires a second-hand dealer's licence. The effect of the series of amendments is to identify the activities which are exempt from the second-hand dealing provisions rather than as at present the persons engaged in the activities, thereby improving the wording of the provisions.<lb/>
Amendment No. 111 is the paving amendment for Amendments Nos. 112, 113, 116, 117 and 121 which identify the businesses exempt from the second-hand dealing requirements. Amendments Nos. 114 and 115 widen the definition of wholesale dealer. The clause as drafted was based on the present Burgh Police (Scotland) Act but, since goods purchased from another dealer will already have been subject to the retention provisions of the Bill in the hands of that dealer, the police will already have had an opportunity for inspection and, where appropriate, retrieval. The intention behind the amendments is to avoid a further unnecessary retention in the hands of the wholesaler.<lb/>
Amendment No. 118 improves the drafting of subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) which was criticised at Committee stage in another place and Amendment No. 119 is consequential. These amendments meet the Government's undertaking to reconsider the drafting of Clause 23(2). Amendment No. 120 is a drafting amendment aimed at removing a possible ambiguity.<lb/>

The licensing provisions relating to second-hand dealing have been much criticised and during the Commons' Committee stage the Government undertook to ease the position, so as not to impose any unnecessarily onerous obligations on the trade. Consequently, the Government have accepted that second-hand dealing should be an optional provision so that licensing will be imposed only where there is a perceived need and after consultation with those principally concerned on a local basis.<lb/>
In the light of debate during Committee in another place it was agreed that the record-keeping requirements in Clause 24 were more appropriate to Clause 23 and the first paragraph of Amendment No. 122 achieves this. The Government also accepted that the provisions restricting pawnbroking in subsections (3) to (5) of Clause 23 were unnecessary in modern legislation, and consequently these provisions are deleted by the amendment. In their place have been included provisions requiring dealers in second-hand motor vehicles to record the mileage when they acquire vehicles. This met with general support in Commons Committee and is uncontentious. Having deleted the record-keeping requirements from Clause 24, the clause can be deleted and Amendment No. 123 does this.<lb/>

Amendments Nos. 129 and 130 are paving amendments for the new clause introduced by Amendment No. 132, and give effect to undertakings given by the Government at the Commons Second Reading to ensure that the mandatory licensing of metal dealers should be confined to those dealers with an annual turnover of not more than &#x00A3;100,000.<lb/>
The main reason for requiring mandatory licensing of metal dealers is for crime prevention purposes. However, the police and the trade are content that their ineterests will be sufficiently served if licensing controls are confined to those dealers a significant proportion of whose supplies are drawn from the man in the street. For the larger dealer, whose purchases are made from industrial or trade sources, the licensing provisions would serve little or no purpose either because the source of supply is such as to make very unlikely the inclusion of stolen goods or because, by the time the metal reaches the larger dealer, it has already been processed in any one or more of a variety of ways and individual items are no longer identifiable. The simplest and neatest way to distinguish the larger concern is by reference to annual turnover and the new clause is framed accordingly.<lb/>
Amendments Nos. 129 and 130 ensure that someone in the trade of scrap metal has either a licence to operate if his annual turnover is less than &#x00A3;100,000
<col>38</col>
or else an exemption warrant or temporary exemption warrant if his turnover exceeds 100,000. It is further provided that the provisions relating to metal dealers will not apply to the holder of an exemption warrant.<lb/>
As mentioned above, the main reason for the mandatory licensing of metal dealers is for crime prevention purposes. In the light of comments received from the trade, the Government have accepted that the kind of criminal activity we are seeking to guard against is unlikely to arise in the case of the garage operator whose supplies are drawn wholly or mainly from other dealers or large industrial concerns.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00469"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is one of the most important amendments in the Bill. I hope that the Government and the Scottish Office will have learned the lesson that when they come to consider licensing they should look at the practicalities and realities behind it, and that all scrap dealers are not people who just go about the streets buying up this and buying up that.<lb/>
If the Government had had the slightest consultation they would have realised that scrap metal is big business and it is big export business. To seek to regulate them by licence and to forbid them to do anything about their stocks over a period of a weekend or even longer than a weekend really was to strangle a business.<lb/>
Indications were given by the Minister that a promise was given at Second Reading in another place. But it was raised in this House on Second Reading, at Committee stage, Report stage and throughout. I think that the Government should have been much more readily willing to do something about it. I can assure the noble Earl that it caused considerable dismay with businessmen in the West of Scotland who raised the matter with me and others. It even terrified some English businessmen who thought, "Well, if they are going to do this in Scotland now, they are going to do it in England next".<lb/>
The Government have seen fit to make the change. I think the figure of &#x00A3;100,000 as the annual turnover is probably fair enough and, so far as I can gather, it has been accepted by the trade. So, congratulations to the Government but regrets that they could not see the importance of this amendment. I am sure that if the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, had been dealing with it he would have spotted it right away. This is something on which action should have been taken in this place and not elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>

I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 137 to 143, 145 to 147, and 150. This is a group of related amendments to provide for records to be kept either in book form or by modern computerised methods. In the latter case, the actual record may well be kept at a central point, away from the premises where the metal dealing activity is carried on. Amendment 133 therefore seeks to ensure that records must be kept in relation to each premises but not necessarily at the particular premises, where computerisation makes this impracticable.<lb/>
Amendment 137 meets an undertaking given by the Government to the trade to look again at the bookkeeping requirements in the light of modern bookkeeping techniques. The amendment brings computer recording within the bookkeeping framework, with suitable safeguards against fraud. Although only one book for acquisitions and one for disposals may be kept at any premises, a dealer would not he precluded from keeping duplicate records for other premises at his main premises. Amendments 138 to 143 are consequential drafting amendments to cover the addition of the concept of computerisation introduced by Amendment 137 with reference to "records" rather than "books".<lb/>
Amendment 145 seeks to remove an area of confusion which arose when noble Lords debated the itinerant metal dealing provisions relating to invoices. It was apparent that there was some confusion about the extent to which a seller of scrap metal was required to provide written documentation relating to the sale to an itinerant dealer. The intention has always been that the responsibility for obtaining receipts for sales of scrap and providing invoices of acquisitions of scrap metal by an itinerant metal dealer was his alone. This remains the intention but to make the position absolutely clear, "invoice" has been changed to "record". Amendments 146, 147 and 150 are consequentials. I beg to move.<lb/>

As presently drafted, an itinerant metal dealer is defined as a person who carries on a business buying and selling scrap metal by means of house-to-house collections. It is considered that this definition is too narrow and might not, for instance, cover purchases from farms or other commercial premises from which the itinerant may frequently draw his supplies. Amendment No. 159 widens the definition.<lb/>
The purpose of the 48-hour retention period in Clause 32 is to allow the police sufficient time to inspect stock for stolen goods. It is obvious that goods should be kept as nearly as possible in their original form. Modem scrap yards, with their sophisticated plant, reduce metal goods in such a way as to make their original form unrecognisable.<lb/>
As presently worded, the Bill prohibits "processing" but excludes "breaking up" from the definition of "processing". A dealer would, therefore, be free to break up goods immediately on receipt, thus negating the whole purpose of these provisions. This amendment removes the anomaly by removing the exclusion of dismantling or breaking up from the definition and ensuring that the goods are retained in as near as may be their original form for a period of 48 hours.

Amendment No. 162 is a drafting amendment to substitute a correct singular reference to an incorrect plural one.<lb/>
Amendment No. 163 exempts the sale of coal, coke or any solid fuel derived from coal or coke from the scope of the street trading licensing requirements. This is simply because such sales are already controlled by
<col>44</col>
orders made under Weights and Measures legislation. A merchant operating a vehicle for the sale and delivery of solid fuel is subject to Weights and Measures regulations which provide, among other matters, for the displaying of the name and address of the seller, weights notices for the sacks sold on the vehicle and the precise documentation governing the delivery and sale of such fuels. In view of the fact that the existing Weights and Measures legislation provides adequate safeguard for consumers, it is unnecessary to impose on the trade a requirement to have, in addition, a licence granted by a local authority.<lb/>
The effect of Amendments Nos. 164 and 165 is to remove the automatic exemption for anything done for charitable purposes, and in its place to provide an exemption for any activity which has been granted permission under Clause 121. One of the main reasons for the automatic exemption was to ensure that charitable bodies selling such items as poppies or flags would not be caught by the street trading provisions&#x2014;although of course they would be caught by the requirements of Clause 121 on control of charitable collections. It has become clear, however, that an automatic exemption is too widely drawn and would be difficult to enforce on the spot. As, however it is necessary to exempt the poppy and flag sellers from the provisions of the street trading clauses, Amendment No. 165 provides that the licensing requirements do not apply to any activity in respect of which permission has been granted under Clause 121 on the control of charitable collections.

These amendments clarify and, in one important respect, extend the scope of Clause 47. Amendment No. 169 is a drafting amendment making it clear beyond doubt that the Secretary of State's power under Clause 47 to designate further activities for licensing in accordance with the provisions of Part I includes power to regulate any, such activity by specific provisions in the order additional to the existing provisions in Part I and Schedule 1.<lb/>
Amendment No. 170 makes one major change in this clause, and a number of minor drafting improvements. The major change can be seen in subparagraph (2)(<i>c</i>). Whereas the clause as previously drafted provided only for activities not previously licensed at all to be drawn within the scope of the Civic Government Bill procedures, sub-paragraph (<i>c</i>) now provides that, in addition, an order under Clause 47 may repeal existing legislation in respect of a licensing function and include that function within the scope of this Bill's procedures, suitably modified as necessary. This mechanism for repeal and replacement reflects the gradual approach to standardisation which I advocated in Committee. Only when existing procedures under the Bill are seen to be operating smoothly in respect of activities already licensed will the Secretary of State consider cases for further standardisation. As
<col>46</col>
I also pointed out in Committee, of course, many activities are licensed on a Great Britain basis, some by statutory bodies set up for that purpose.<lb/>
An example is gaming licences granted by the Gaming Board for Great Britain. The scope for drawing further licensing activities within the specifically Scottish system of licensing by district councils set up in the Bill will, therefore, be limited. Nevertheless, this mechanism represents a useful first step towards longterm standarisation of local authority licensing activities, and, as such, I trust that it will be welcomed.

<quote>(3) The notice shall state the general effect of that Schedule").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00514">4.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00515"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 171, and I shall speak also to Amendment No. 360. We now come to the sex shop provisions, as they are called and the new clause and schedule fulfil the Government's commitment given by me at the Report stage of this Bill on 2nd March to introduce a licensing system which will enable district or islands councils to control the number and location of sex shops in their area. In essence, it will he an offence, punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to &#x00A3;10,000, for anyone to operate a sex shop without a licence in those areas where the local authority has adopted the scheme set out in the schedule. The provisions of the Schedule are the same in principle, although they differ on certain procedural matters, as the licensing scheme introduced in England and Wales by the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.<lb/>
As I indicated to the House, the Government fully share the general concern about the lack of local authority control over the opening of sex shops and we have, therefore, taken the opportunity of this Bill to introduce a licensing system for sex shops. I should stress that sex shops will continue to be subject to the full panoply of the criminal law and, in particular, the Indecent Displays (Scotland) Act 1981 and the provisions on the sale, distribution and so on of obscene material in Clause 52 of this Bill. Indeed, paragraph 1 of the new schedule makes it quite clear that nothing in the licensing scheme in any way affords a defence to
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0032"/>
<col>47</col>
any criminal charge. However, the criminal law can take effect only once a sex shop has opened: it does not enable a local authority to control the opening, number and location of sex shops.<lb/>
Turning to the new clause and schedule, we felt that it was appropriate to deal with sex shops in a separate schedule, rather than under Schedule 1, largely because&#x2014;and I suspect that this will be a widely shared view&#x2014;the control of sex shops is not on all fours with the licensing of the socially acceptable activities covered by Parts I and II and Schedule! to the Bill. Paragraph 4 is the key provision in the schedule. It provides that, in those areas where the schedule is in force, no one shall operate a sex shop without a licence and except in accordance with the terms of the licence. Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 deal with the application for the grant or renewal of a sex shop licence, the notification of such applications and objections and representations to the application.<lb/>
Paragraph 9 contains perhaps the most crucial provision in the whole schedule. Paragraph 9(1) makes it clear that a local authority can either grant or renew a licence unconditionally, or grant or renew a licence subject to conditions (for example, on opening hours, displays, advertisements and so on) or refuse to grant or renew a licence. Sub-paragraph (3) sets out various factual grounds on which a local authority must refuse a licence, including where the applicant is under 18, or already disqualified from holding a licence, or has been convicted of a sex shop licensing offence under the schedule, or who has not been resident in the United Kingdom throughout the previous six months. Paragraphs 9(4) and 9(5) state that a local authority shall also refuse an application if, in their opinion, the applicant is unsuitable by reason of having been convicted of an offence or for any other reason; that if the licence were granted the sex shop would be managed by or carried on for the benefit of another person who would himself have been refused a licence; that the number of sex shops in the relevant locality at the time the application is made is equal to or exceeds the number which the council consider appropriate for that locality; and that the grant or renewal of a licence would be inappropriate, having regard to the character of the relevant locality, the use to which any premises in the locality are put and the layout of the proposed sex shop.<lb/>
These last two grounds go to the heart of the matter. We believe it right that a local authority can decide that the appropriate number of sex shops in any relevant locality can be nil, and this is made quite clear in paragraph 9(6). It might be helpful if I expanded on this point. The purpose of the schedule is to enable local authorities to control the number and location of sex shops by a system of licensing: it would clearly not be appropriate to use a licensing scheme as a backdoor to imposing a total ban on sex shops on moral grounds. However, it is equally important that a local authority should be able to decide that there should he no sex shops at all in any particular locality. It should be stressed, however, that a local authority can only reach this decision in relation to each particular application and with regard to the relevant locality in that instance. Under the schedule, a local authority cannot resolve in advance of an application that they
<col>48</col>
will not have any sex shops in their area or any part of their area. Each application must be treated on its merits. However, a local authority may properly give some advance indication of their approach to the matter and the criteria they consider appropriate in determining whether or not a sex shop might be unacceptable in any particular locality.<lb/>
In conclusion, the Government believe that whether or not a sex shop should be opened in a particular locality is a matter which can only be decided at a local level, taking fully into account local circumstances and the views of the local population. The new clause and schedule will enable local authorities effectively to control the number and location of sex shops in their area and, I believe, will be widely welcomed by all concerned. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Mansfield</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00516"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Amendment No. 171 and the amendment dealing with the schedule which goes with it virtually introduce a new Bill. Many Bills have come before this House which were smaller than this one clause. There are 21 pages dealing with the licensing of sex shops. It is only fair to say that to handle the matter in this way, simply by commenting on a Commons amendment, does not reflect the importance of the subject. Certainly this subject is of importance to many people in Scotland. Admittedly there was full discussion in another place, but that cannot be said about this amendment.<lb/>
We on this side of the House raised the matter during the earlier stages of the Bill. We had a pledge from the Government then that by introducing a new clause, or a new schedule, the matter would be dealt with when the Bill went to the other place. I am very glad that the Government have done so. This was an opportunity to get something done, so why not do it? We have done it. But I should make it absolutely clear that Scotland has not been smitten with a plague of sex shops. That is just not true. I think there are six shops throughout the whole of Scotland. There are two in Glasgow and there is probably the same number in Dundee. Where, however, sex shops have been established considerable alarm has been aroused, and the feeling is that the Government should give power to local authorities to do something about it. Other establishments must be licensed, including off-licences, public houses and take-away food shops. Sex shops, so-called, are not quite so socially acceptable as these other establishments.<lb/>
To my mind, the Government have been more than slightly hypocritical about what they have done. I think there will have to be a political decision by a local authority to pass a resolution. They will be unable to regulate sex shops unless they formally pass a resolution giving them the power to do so. What will the argument be then? I am perfectly sure that the argument then will be that the licensing authority do not want sex shops anywhere in their area. But the Government say, "No, you must not do that. Every single application for a sex shop must be treated individually and decided individually".<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0033"/>
<col>49</col>
The Government say that the licensing authority can decide how many sex shops there will be in any particular locality. If a licensing authority say that there will be no sex shops in that locality and an application is made for the establishment of a sex shop in that locality, they will turn it down and say that they have decided already that nil is the number. There is no right of appeal. It would be unfair to give local authorities the power to pass a resolution and say that they are going to have no sex shops in the whole area and then to suggest that they were abiding by the principle that everybody must he treated fairly and that everything should he done in the right way. There is nothing to prevent a local authority from saying in the case of every locality that nil shall he the number. Then one virtually arrives at the point where there is a complete ban.<lb/>
Why did the Government not face up to this problem and give that power to local authorities? Instead, the Government start by giving to local authorties the discretion to introduce a resolution. I think that the Government should have been straightforward and have given them this other power as well. I have read the reply of the Minister in another place to an amendment which suggested that this should be done. That reply, from somebody dignified with the name of "Minister" in another place, was very naive indeed. Admittedly he was pretty inexperienced. I hope that the Minister does not repeat what was said in another place: that if a locality has no sex shops an application has got to he considered again, for it might be in a different area. If it is proposed to establish a sex shop in that locality, it would he in a locality where the licensing authority have already determined that there shall he no sex shops. It might be said that it is a different type of sex shop, but if it is a sex shop it requires a licence and they have already taken a decision that there shall be no sex shops in that locality.<lb/>
It is very naive to suggest that because it might he different in some way or another the licensing authority might arrive at a different answer. It will be a waste of time not only for the people who apply but also for the licensing authority and all connected with it. It will not only he a waste of time: it will he quite unnecessary because of the kind of reaction that is aroused when the suggestion is made that there shall be a sex shop in a particular town or in a particular part of that town.<lb/>
I am not entirely happy that we have everything right in relation to definition. I read with interest the definition of "sex article". It comes down to the core of definition because a sex shop is one that sells sex articles and then one defines sex articles. The definition is there for all to read. Someone suggested that the definition of a sex article could mean a double bed for a start because there could be no article more likely to be connected with sexual activity. There was also a suggestion that the definition could include many much advertised perfumes for men and women which seemed to imply sexual activity and some kind of sexual allure coming from them. The Government have set out their definition and I believe it will get them into a bit of trouble.<lb/>
After that, the Government leave it to the local licensing authority to determine matters. I am not going to quibble with much that is in this except that I wish the Government had been a bit more straight&#x2014;
<col>50</col>
forward and had given to each of those authorities who wanted to regulate sex shops the right to say, "We do not want them in our area.". Remember, these are democratically elected people. I think it would be quite wrong, therefore, to put forward the argument that they were being unreasonably arbitrary, as the Government might decide. They are responding to the feelings of the people in that area who have elected them, and they are the people who can also remove them. They are responsible to them. It was quite wrong for the Government to duck the political isssue. If there is anything we can do without in Scotland, it is this kind of thing. We are not saying that we should give the power to the local authorities, but we should give the local authorities the power to say "No" rather than achieve that same thing in a roundabout way with application after application in relation to a locality saying, "There shall be none in this locality." And if they take that decision it can be challenged, so why not be straightforward about it?<lb/>
I did not put down an amendment because it is far too late in the day. After all, we hope to end this Session of Parliament some time next week, and who am I, coming from another place and having proclaimed the governance of the other place, to lay down the law to them in here? The only thing I regret is that the other place had a full debate and we have not. It might have been very much better if your Lordships' House had been given the same opportunities in relation to debating and amending this Bill as were given to another place. I congratulate the Government for doing what they have done, although I believe they could have done it a bit better.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00518"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, that the Government in dealing with this matter would have been better advised to give complete discretion to local authorities in this context. Quite apart from that, it is most unfortunate&#x2014;to put it at its lowest&#x2014;that this matter in the Scottish context should have been dealt with in this way, and that these amendments should he going through without any opportunity for your Lordships' House to discuss this matter thoroughly. Something I do not at all accept&#x2014;and I believe I am not alone in this&#x2014;is that the only way to regulate this matter in the Scottish context is by a licensing arrangement such as that which is provided for here. I listened to much of the debate in the House on the comparable English provisions. I took no part in it for a number of reasons. For one thing, I felt that if the English felt they really wanted sex shops, who was I to interfere with that? But this way of governing Scotland is a microcosm of the kind of thing that creates Scottish nationalism. We seem to be taking up the tail of the English without any discussion at all in this House.<lb/>
I can enjoy the jokes, and I hope that no one imagines that I am inspired by any kind of prudery or puritanism. Perhaps it is not for me to say whether I am a prude or a puritan, but certainly the openess about sex which we have today is much more civilised than it was in Edwardian or Victorian days&#x2014;or even in the days when I was a boy. So do not let me mislead your Lordships&#x2014;hut I do think that these sex shops are utterly squalid. I wonder whether anyone except the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, or the noble Earl, Lord
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0034"/>
<col>51</col>
Longford, and myself have taken a look at one. I do not know, but I have spoken to a number of the Members of this House and asked whether they have taken a look at these shops. A significant number of them replied that they have not, because they would not like it if anyone saw them coming out of such a shop.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00519"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the sex shops in Scotland are half as bad as the sex shops in Soho, then they are awful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00520"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that I would dispute that, my Lords, but I have not seen any of these sex shops in Scotland. But they are squalid establishments and I do not see why the Government should encourage them in Scotland. I suppose there has been commercial exploitation of sex all through society, except perhaps in the more primitive societies. There has always been the whore and the pimp and all sorts of other developments from there. In modern times there are the editors of newspapers who print exciting pictures of women on page 3, and so on. There are the advertising men who exploit sex and all this sort of thing. They are all birds of a feather with the owners of these sex shops, but some birds are more tolerable than others. Is this not so? We ought to have discussed this thoroughly, and this House could have done so admirably, especially in the Scottish context. I keep emphasising that because they started, I imagine, in London.<lb/>
There are all sorts of arguments about this subject. Albeit that there is a great deal of the kind of exploitation of sex that the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, talked about when your Lordships were debating the English measure&#x2014;and I accept all that&#x2014;why must we be pulled into this sort of thing in this kind of way without your Lordships having been given a chance to consider alternatives? There could have been alternatives. I am not satisfied that the criminal law of Scotland as it stands could not have been used more effectively against illegal establishments. I am not critical of people's idiosyncrasies. I know that in that context, one man's idiosyncrasy is another man's fun. As I said, it is not on any of these grounds that I would question the wisdom of these provisions. It is because I think that it will not make the urban environment better&#x2014;it will tend to make it worse. It is not a good thing to encourage the commecial exploitation of sex and to increase it. That is all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00521"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Ross, gave a welcome to these amendments, although he chided the Government for not having the courage to give the licensing authorities power to have a blanket ban on these establishments in their areas if that is what they want to do. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, takes up a rather different point; he says he does not like the scheme at all and prefers the existing criminal law. I think so far as the latter point is concerned he may perhaps not entirely appreciate, so far as the criminal law is concerned, that until somebody opens their shop for business it is difficult to see that they are in any way committing a criminal offence because they are not
<col>52</col>
necessarily in breach of any planning law. Therefore, until the mischief is done it is impossible to control the activities of the sex shop keeper or owner.<lb/>
If I may go much nearer to what I might call the philosophical heart of this, somehow the community has got to decide as between the rights of the individual to carry on a trade&#x2014;which may not be very savoury; let me say that at once, and which is certainly, so far as the criminal law is concerned in Scotland, hedged about with all sorts of prohibitions, as the noble and learned Lord will know better than I, to do with the exposure for sale, for instance, of obscene articles. Nevertheless, the actual trade of a sex shop keeper is not in itself illegal. Therefore, one has to have some regard to the person who wishes to avail himself of the right to carry on a trade not in itself illegal. As against that there has to be balanced the rights and the overriding welfare of the public at large, and the way in which these amendments have been constructed is to enable the decisions to be taken by the local authority in effect. Whether he meant it or not, I think the noble Lord, Lord Ross, was muddled so far as areas and localities are concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00522"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00523"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: If he was not he was certainly using his language in a fairly imprecise manner. After all, under this legislation a local authority may decide, when considering any particular application for a licence, that the number of sex shops in the relevant locality, for instance, is already equal to or exceeds the number which they consider appropriate, and they may consider that for that particular locality the appropriate number is nil. They can also refuse an application for a licence by regard to the character of the relevant locality and the use to which any premises in the vicinity may be put: in other words, they can refuse a licence on the grounds for no other reason than that the proposed sex shop would be, for instance, near to a school. They can refuse, having regard to the layout of the sex shop as proposed. Therefore, the total of all this is that the local authority, having regard to each locality in their local government area, can make up their minds as to what they consider to be sufficient or indeed suitable for their own particular circumstances. Of course, it may well be that the character and area of localities changes very considerably from one end of the local authority district to another. That is a matter for them.<lb/>
Finally, I say to your Lordships that, as has been mentioned but perhaps not emphasised, there is no appeal from the proper exercise of their discretion, so that there is no question of a sheriff substituting himself for their judgment so far as the matters which I have mentioned are concerned. The discretion which these amendments give to a local authority I say is complete: that it is for the local citizens in effect to decide what they consider appropriate for their particular circumstances and for them to carry out their policy, but at the same time remembering the rights of the individual. Nobody is estopped from at least making an application. He may very well find that his application meets with no favours at all, or it may be that when he makes it the council in its wisdom decides that circumstances may have changed and that with it its policy should be adjusted. All that is a matter entirely for them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0035"/>
<col>53</col>
It is for that reason that the schedule which relates to this form of activity is drafted very differently from the first schedule to the Bill which deals with all the other activities to be licensed. So I reject any criticism of the Government, either that we have not properly thought the matter out, as I think the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Lanside, was saying, or that in some way we have been guilty of a lack of courage in not giving the local authorities, as it were, <i>carte blanche</i> to refuse any sex shops at any time in any part of their area.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00537"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 176.<lb/>
As your Lordships will see, this is a new clause which re-enacts in what we hope is modem form certain provisions in respect of danger, annoyance and nuisance caused by animals. These offences are currently contained in the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892 and also in certain local Acts.<lb/>
Of the wide range of offences relating to the behaviour of animals which these Acts cover, only two were recommended by the Working Party on Civic Government for retention; first, that of allowing a dangerous animal to be at large in a public place without proper control and, secondly, that of failing to comply with a court order for the elimination of nuisance caused by an animal in one's care to one's neighbours. Most of the other offences covered in the 1892 Act have subsequently been taken up in specific legislation such as the Cruelty to Animals Act or the recently consolidated Animal Health Act 1981. It was decided, not without a twinge of regret, that modem sensibilities were sufficiently hardened to permit the other offence of allowing a stallion or bull to be seen in public doing their duty serving a mare or cow at last to he repealed! This clause therefore implements the Working Party's recommendation. Unfortunately, its drafting was not sufficiently advanced to allow it to be included in the Bill as introduced and it was, therefore, added to the Bill during Committee stage in the other place.<lb/>
As your Lordships will see, subsection (1) makes it an offence for any person to allow a creature in his charge to endanger or injure any other person who is in a public place or give that person reasonable cause for alarm or annoyance. Where a court convicts a person of such an offence, it may also under subsection (6) make an order for the creature's disposal. Subsection (2) provides that on application duly made to it by any person a district court may conclude that a creature is causing reasonable annoyance to those residing near the place where it is kept and may order its owner to take steps to eliminate the nuisance caused. This latter provision is the first stage over a two-stage procedure. As your Lordships will see from subsections (4), (6) and (7), where an order under subsection (2) is not complied with a court may find the person responsible for the control of the creature guilty of an offence and may also make an order for the creature's disposal. Subsections (7) and (8) make it clear that, subject to the overriding provisions of conservation legislation, an order for a creature's disposal may be for its destruction, but that no creature disposed of shall be given or sold for the purposes of vivisection.<lb/>
In conclusion, adequate powers to maintain amenity and safety in respect of animals are a matter of some public concern, and we hope that this amendment provides a useful statutory underpinning of good neighbourly behaviour. As such it represents a modest contribution to the well-being of the
<col>56</col>
community, which I am sure your Lordships will welcome for that reason.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00540"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments. Nos. 177 and 178. Your Lordships will see that these two amendments refer to Clause 51, which contains the provisions on drunkenness.<lb/>
The first amendment deals with an airgun, crossbow or air rifle. Amendment 177 is designed to make it clear that, for the purposes of Clause 51(5) "firearm" includes an air rifle and a crossbow. As the Bill stood "firearm" was defined simply as including an airgun or an air pistol arid there was doubt as to whether this would cover what are known as air rifles. It was also agreed at Report stage in another place in response to an amendment tabled by the honourable Member for North Ayrshire and Bute, to add crossbows to the list. However, this addendum does not indicate that we are in any way still in the 15th century or predating the discovery of gunpowder in Scotland. We understand that crossbows are used in the form of a firearm and that is why we have added them to the definition.<lb/>
Amendment 178 deletes subsection (6) of Clause 51, which covers being drunk in charge of cattle and the like. Following the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Ross, and by various honourable Members in another place, we came to the conclusion that this provision is indeed unnecessary. The existing provision, in Section 70 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1903, is rarely used. The offence in Clause 51(1) of the Bill, of being drunk and incapable and not in the care or protection of a suitable person, will adequately cover the more serious cases of drunk in charge of a horse or cattle.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00542"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 179 and 180. At Committee stage in another place it was pointed out that there was an inconsistency between subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 52. Subsection (1) makes it an offence wilfully to display obscene material, while subsection (2) makes it an absolute offence to publish, sell, or distribute obscene material, subject to the due diligence defence in subsection (4). It was suggested that both offences should be governed by "wilfully". However, while the Government fully accept the need for consistency between subsections (1) and (2), we
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0037"/>
<col>57</col>
believe that the correct approach is to subject both to the diligence defence.<lb/>
If the alternative suggestion was adopted, the Crown would have to establish that the accused deliberately published, sold or distributed the obscene material. We believe that this is too severe an onus. Clause 52 concentrates on the more serious, obscene material rather than merely indecent material and, therefore, we believe that the correct approach is to make both display and sale, and so on, absolute offences subject to the defence that the accused had used all proper diligence to avoid committing the offence. Such a defence will provide a proper and appropriate safeguard for an accused. Therefore, these amendments bring subsection (1) into line with subsection (2) by making both absolute offences subject to a due diligence defence.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00545"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 <i>en bloc</i>. If I may, I shall speak to Amendment No. 365. The purpose of this new clause is to enact for Scotland the main provisions of the Protection of Children Act 1978: it is designed to catch persons who take, distribute, and so on, indecent photographs of children which fall short of being obscene and are therefore not covered by Clause 52 of the Bill. The clause will make it an offence for any person to take, or permit to be taken any indecent photograph of a child under 16; secondly, to distribute or to show such an indecent photograph: thirdly, to have in his possession such an indecent photograph with a view to its being distributed or shown by himself or others: and fourthly, to publish or cause to be published any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that the advertiser distributes or shows such an indecent photograph, or intends to do so.<lb/>
The recent and impending changes in the law on obscenity in Scotland&#x2014;the enactment of the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981, the repeal of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892 provisions, and the restriction of Clause 52 of the present Bill to obscene material&#x2014;make it desirable to extend the Protection of Children Act provisions to Scotland in order to make quite clear that the taking, distribution and so on of indecent photographs of children is an offence. Although it might still be possible to catch such cases using the common law on shameless indecency, it is advisable to put the position on a clear statutory basis and thus avoid any possible doubts.<lb/>
In essence, the new clause proscribes the taking, distributing, and so on, of indecent photographs of children under the age of 16 and provides suitably severe penalties for the various offences. By setting out the various provisions clearly in statute, the new clause will ensure that such activities are fully caught by the criminal law and mark the widespread abhorence of this particular kind of pornography, which, I am sure will he shared by all noble Lords. Amendment No. 365 makes the necessary amendment to the Long Title of the Bill, while Amendment No. 181 brings the definition of photograph in Clause 52 into line with that in this new clause. I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00546"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly wholeheartedly agree with what the Government are doing here. I think that it is absolutely essential that we should protect our children from this utterly appalling practice. It must be offensive to every right-thinking man and certainly to everyone except the most sickeningly abnormal. There are one or two who defend the right to do this kind of thing, but I do not think that anyone here would do so. I only hope that the Government have gone far enough.<lb/>
I notice that the fine is up to &#x00A3;1,000 and the punishment by imprisonment up to three months. I should not have thought that three months was strong enough in some particular cases. I should certainly have been prepared to support a greater penalty than that. Once again, we are faced with what is virtually a new Bill. I remember when this was very much a matter of controversy as regards Private Members' Bills when it was suggested to me that this was not needed in Scotland because it could be dealt with by the legislation that we already had there. But I was never quite satisfied with that. This is explicit and this is clear, and I think that it is absolutely essential.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00547"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am surprised that it is proposed to extend this ridiculous Protection of Children Act, which applies to England and Wales, to Scotland. I had always thought that in Scotland they had an enlightened approach to moral laws and that their own common sense and strength of character was quite enough by itself without legislative protection. The 1978 Act was a ridiculous piece of legislation: it was panic legislation: we were threatened with an avalanche of indecent material relating to children coming from the United States. It was all nonsense. I am surprised that Scotland swallows this Mary Whitehouse stuff and incorporates it in the last stages of this Bill. If the Government had any intention of doing this, they should have done it earlier, because it would have been salutary to have taken stock of the operation of this legislation in England before extending it to Scotland.<lb/>
So far as I am aware, there have not been more than two&#x2014;if two&#x2014;prosecutions in four years under the English Protection of Children Act. Indeed, at the time of the debates on this I referred to the law of Scotland which, as the Minister said a moment ago, enabled prosecutions to take place under the common law. They have something in Scotland which is called "lewd" and you can convict people of exhibiting "lewd" photographs. We call them "indecent". There is a definition of material but there is no definition of "obscenity". There is no definition of what is indecent. What is an indecent photograph?&#x2014;one merely showing certain parts of the body which are normally covered? Is that the indecency of it? It depends upon what kind of photograph it is. It depends to what use it is put.<lb/>
I cannot go over all the grounds of my objections to the Protection of Children Act 1978. I was one of the few Members of your Lordships' House who opposed it throughout: I still oppose it. Although it is not for me to dictate what should happen in Scotland&#x2014;Heaven alone knows, it is a strange country and it is entitled to its own law&#x2014;on the whole I thought that they were an enlightened race of people, but I am coming to the
<col>60</col>
conclusion that they are just as stuffy, just as prejudiced and still as narrow-minded as the English, which is saying quite a lot.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00548"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, condoned the sort of behaviour which is proscribed under this amendment or whether he merely thought that in Scotland we should rely on the common law and such statutory provision as we have and do our best to take care of this extremely nasty and all too prevelant offence. If it was the former, then I am afraid that I merely reject his contention, as a parent. If it is the latter&#x2014;and I bow of course to the noble and learned Lord. Lord Wilson of Langside&#x2014;I am advised that with the various changes in the law which have taken place, including judicial interpretation and definition, this particular amendment is desirable to tidy up, as it were, the law of Scotland and to make one or two matters absolutely plain by statute.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, complained that the penalties were perhaps not as sufficient as they might be and as he would like. I would remind him that in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) on conviction on indictment the accused can be sentenced:
<quote>"to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to a fine, or to both".</quote>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00552"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 183 to 187 <i>en bloc</i>. This concerns noise. At Committee stage in another place my honourable friend the Solicitor General pointed out that Clause 54, as drafted, was not satisfactory inasmuch as while it was primarily designed to catch noise emanating from or passing into a public place, it would also catch noise made between private households or gardens to the extent that for example front rooms were "adjacent to any public place". But other inter-household noise from back rooms would not be caught. This was clearly inconsistent and the committee's views were sought on whether the clause should be restricted to public place noise or exended to cover all inter-household noise. The committee clearly favoured the latter course and Amendment No. 184 is designed to achieve this by removing the words, "in or adjacent to a public place."<lb/>
There is no doubt that noise between households, particularly late at night, creates considerable annoyance. There may be difficulties in dealing with such noise as breach of the peace and the use of civil interdicts is not really a solution for most people. We therefore believe that the creation of this minor offence, with a fairly modest fine, will enable the police to deal effectively with such troublesome conduct. I do not believe that the enforcement will place an undue burden on the police: in many cases a request from a constable to desist in making the noise will suffice.<lb/>
Amendments Nos. 185 and 186 are designed to clarify the relationship between Clause 54 and Section 62 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Amendment No. 185 makes it clear that Clause 54 does not affect the offences of operating a loudspeaker in the streets at certain times contained in Section 62, and conversely even where the use of a loudspeaker is not an offence under Section 62 it will be caught under Clause 54 if it is giving reasonable cause for annoyance and the person refuses to desist. Amendment No. 186, which is in identical terms to Section 62(2) of the 1974 Act, exempts from Clause 54 the operation of loudspeakers for various public service purposes&#x2014;for example, fire, police and ambulance.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00555"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 188 and 189. During the Second Reading debate in another place various honourable Members queried whether all the provisions of the Bill, and particularly Part III of the Bill, were strictly necessary, either because they covered matters which were of a very trivial nature or because the activities involved could be adequately dealt with at common law. With this in
<col>62</col>
mind we have gone through the provisions of the Bill very carefully and, as regards Part III, we have come to the conclusion that some of the provisions can in fact be deleted.<lb/>
I have already dealt earlier with deleting Clause 51(4), which covered the case of conduct when drunk in charge of a horse or cattle. These amendments delete Clauses 56 and 57. Clause 56 makes it an offence to throw or otherwise propel any missile so as to cause or to be likely to cause danger to any other person or damage to property, or so as to give any person reasonable cause for alarm or annoyance. It is aimed at what I think we would all rightly accept to be an activity which can cause considerable danger or alarm. Such a provision was recommended by the Working Party on Civic Government. Nevertheless, we accept that the activities at which it is aimed can be adequately covered by various common law charges, for example reckless conduct, assault or even breach of the peace, and of course recklessly discharging a firearm to the danger of any person is well established at common law. Given the adequacy of the common law in this area, we agreed to delete Clause 56.<lb/>
We also came to the conclusion that Clause 57 is not strictly necessary. The activities involved, and I am thinking here particularly of making a slide on ice or snow, are too trivial to continue to be made criminal offences, and indeed I have been unable to unearth any prosecution for such activity in recent years. As far as the playing of games is concerned, in most cases it is, of course, children who are involved and the sanction of the criminal law would not be appropriate. We are also satisfied that in more serious cases involving dangerous games, a common law charge of reckless conduct or breach of the peace could be brought. I hope I have given with that brief explanation reasons for our belief why Clauses 56 and 57 should be deleted from the Bill.<lb/>

First, that it would require consent to be given for such small items as newspaper boards displayed outside shops, and secondly that the use of vehicles and hoards should not be a criminal offence.<lb/>
The Government consulted further on this matter with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and concluded that there is no need for formal control over moveable boards or placards. The question of a vehicle used to display advertisements will be examined in the context of the review of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (Scotland) Regulations 1961.

The intention of Amendments Nos. 192 to 196, which were tabled by the Opposition and accepted by the Government, is to delete the words "usually employed in theft" so that the offence would apply to the possession of any object, so long as it could reasonably he inferred from the possession of that object that the person intended to commit theft or had committed theft. The effect of these amendments is to set out more clearly the intention behind Clause 61(1). Normally, the object in question would be something like a jemmy, but clearly there are other objects which, although not normally associated with theft, may in fact be used for such activities. An example might be a plastic credit card, which can be used to open locks. The amendments
<col>64</col>
would make it quite clear that possession of a plastic credit card in circumstances where it may be reasonably inferred that a person intended to commit theft would be caught by Clause 61.<lb/>
Amendment No. 197 was also moved by the Opposition in Committee in another place. The Government accepted that subsection 3(<i>b</i>) of Clause 61 is unnecessary in that when a court orders any tool or other object to be forfeit, it already has sufficient power to make suitable arrangements for the destruction or other disposal of the said tools.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00569"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 198. Clause 61 makes it an offence for a person who has two or more convictions for theft to have in his possession burglar tools, from the possession of which it may reasonably be inferred that he intended to commit or has committed theft, provided that the person is unable to give a satisfactory explanation for his possession. Under Clause 4. "convictions" are defined in terms of Section 1(4) and Section 3 of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. During Committee stage in another place concern was expressed that under this definition, children under 16 who had been referred to a children's hearing on the grounds that the child had committed an offence, would fall within the ambit of the Clause 61 offence. I accept that this is clearly not appropriate and would be quite contrary to the philosophy of the children's hearing system. The amendment is, therefore, designed to ensure that only those persons over 16 with a conviction proper for theft fall within the scope of Clause 61. It does this by removing the reference to the extended definition of "conviction" in the 1974 Act and leaving "conviction" to be read in its normal sense. In short, the amendment means that only those who have two or more actual convictions for theft are liable to be subject to Clause 61. We believe that this is a proper limitation.<lb/>

Amendment 201 is a drafting simplification. By the substantive Amendment 202 and the consequential drafting adjustments, we have sought to meet the concern expressed by the Salvation Army that the Bill as drafted would have represented an erosion of the principle of freedom of religious expression by requiring notice, if local authorities saw fit to require this, of the Army's routine street activities. The amendments provide a general exemption from the notification requirements for processions commonly or customarily held, subject only to a reserve power under which a regional or islands council could require notice of such processions. The Salvation Army have expressed their satisfaction with the Bill as amended. Many of your Lordships expressed support for the Salvation Army's case at an earlier stage in the Bill's proceedings and I trust that these amendments will commend themselves to the House.<lb/>

been a long battle. The concern of the Salvation Army is shared by other organisations, and I have spoken at every stage of the Bill about my concern for the Boys' Brigade which, some may not be aware, will have their centenary next year. There will then be processions galore in every city, town and village of Scotland, and I should not like to have thought that they would be impeded by something we had done in this piece of well-meaning but bureaucratic legislation. I am grateful to the Government for having met the wishes of the Salvation Army. It never was, I hope, the intention of the Government that they would in any way frustrate the normal activities of such a worthwhile organisation. I am grateful to them for finding words which are satisfactory and which have a very distinct echo of a draft Bill which was drawn up before ever this Government came to office.

Amendments Nos. 206 and 207 ensure that the definition of "public place" for the purposes of Part IV of the Bill will be the same as that applying to the Public Order Act 1936. The need for this adjustment was drawn to our attention by both the convention and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.<lb/>
The second pair of amendments, Nos. 228 and 229, are straightforward drafting amendments, which seek to make the general effect of Clause 70 clearer. I am aware that there has been some support for the view, first expressed by the Working Party on Civic Government, that, when the new Civic Government Code is enacted, the provisions of the Public Order Act 1936 for the regulation of public processions should cease to have effect in Scotland. The Government have, thus far, taken the view that there is room for the Civic Government Code to operate in tandem with the 1936 Act provisions, which are relevant only to circumstances in which there is an expectation of serious public disorder. As noble Lords will be aware, however, the finishing touches are now being put to the review of the 1936 Act and related legislation upon which we embarked with the publication of our Green Paper in April 1980. There will therefore be future opportunities to consider the substantive question of the relationship between this Part of the Bill and the 1936 Act. But for the moment I hope that noble Lords will feel able, at this stage, to agree to these two drafting amendments.<lb/>

As initially drafted, the Bill
<col>68</col>
achieved the same result, but by an indirect route: if a council had not wished a "short notice" procession to take place, it could simply have refrained from dispensing with the normal time limits for notification. On reflection, however, it seemed preferable to adopt the suggestion made by Opposition Members in another place and to make it clear on the face of the Bill that the power to ban should be available in both the normal and the "short notice" case. Amendment No. 211 is a drafting correction. It is necessary to refer not to what the council proposes to do, but to what it decides.<lb/>

In the course of redrafting the opportunity has been taken to remove the reference to "interim orders" by the sheriff, which was somewhat confusing in a context where the so-called "interim order" would, in many cases, be the effective final disposal of a case heard at short notice.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00634"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 246 and 247. At the same time I should like to
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0045"/>
<col>73</col>
speak, if your Lordships would agree, to Amendments Nos. 258, 259 and 260, and also to Amendments Nos. 264 to 277 inclusive. This is a relatively large group of amendments. They make adjustments to certain of the functional clauses in Part VIII of the Bill, which deals with building matters, and to the related enforcement powers.<lb/>
Amendments Nos. 246, 258 and 259 amend the entry powers in Clauses 90 and 94 to make it quite clear that these can be exercised by anyone (including a sub-contractor or a workman who is not a direct employee) who is authorised by the local authority or, as the case may be, the person responsible for the installation of lights. These amendments make the powers of entry in these two clauses consistent with the main powers in Clause 102.<lb/>
Amendments Nos. 247 and 266 make it clear that where a local authority is entitled to recover expenses from more than one owner following repairs to common or joint property, they may apportion these expenses as they think fit. Previously, the apportionment was by rateable value. Representations received during the Bill's passage, however, made it clear that because of the different methods of conveyancing in different areas rateable value might not always be the most appropriate basis for that apportionment. It was therefore considered preferable to leave the precise method of apportionment to the discretion of the local authority in each case.<lb/>
Amendments Nos. 260, 265, 267 and 270 together provide that wherever expenses may be recovered under Part VIII they may be recovered with interest from the date on which a demand for them was served. These amendments simply remove inconsistencies previously to be found in this Part&#x2014;that is, Part VIII&#x2014;giving private owners the right to recover interest with expenses and making it clear that the local authority can recover interest on all expenses which it is entitled to recover.<lb/>
Amendment No. 264, which is in Clause 99, makes it clear that the powers of a district or islands council in respect of statues and monuments are without prejudice, not only to the controls over works affecting scheduled monuments but also to the provision in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 controlling works on listed buildings. Amendments Nos. 268 and 269 are drafting amendments which insert the necessary references to powers of entry exercisable under Clause 90(3), and by a private individual under Clause 94(1), into Clause 103, which provides for offences in respect of powers of entry.<lb/>
Finally, Amendments Nos. 271&#x2013;277&#x2014;the last seven amendments in this large group to which I am speaking&#x2014;clarify the provision for appeals under part VIII. Amendments Nos. 271&#x2013;276 make it clear that appeal is competent against any expenses claimed under this part, not merely against expenses claimed by a local authority, and that appeal against expenses includes an appeal against interest (including the rate of interest). Amendment No. 277 deletes provision for further appeal by stated case and substitutes a more usual form of appeal on a point of law in civil cases. My Lords, this has of necessity been a slightly detailed explanation. Nevertheless, I hope it has found some favour with your Lordships. Accordingly, I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00635"><member>Lord Hughes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask a question in reference to the apportionment of expense where there is multiple ownership. It has been the position for many years that the basis for the apportionment of such expenditure is the rateable value and, in fact, in the disposition of many of these tenement properties the title deeds will include a reference to the repairs, for instance, being apportioned on this basis. Would I understand, therefore, that if the authority found it necessary to depart from this basis there would be sound reason for doing so and that otherwise the apportionment according to rateable value would be the normal method of proceeding?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00636"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if by leave I may reply, I hope to give some satisfction to the noble Lord. I understand that these amendments that I have moved (particularly those in relation to the question raised by the noble Lord) give to the local authorities a general discretion to apportion in any way that they think fit expenses among the owners of the premises which were repaired. They give the local authority general powers. How they use the powers would be up to the local authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00637"><member>Lord Hughes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, then the answer to the question would be that we would normally proceed on that basis. I may mention that, by coincidence. I have just paid an account for &#x00A3;1.40 which is my share of the repair on a property. The bills vary from &#x00A3;11 to 90p depending upon the rateable value. If it had been divided equally then whoever was paying &#x00A3;11-odd would have been well off and I should have had to pay a little more than my &#x00A3;1.40.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00638"><member>Lord Swinfen</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend able to give any indication of on what sort of basis apportionment would he used if rateable value is not to be so used?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00639"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in reply to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, I understand that I can give him the brief answer, Yes, to his question. So far as my noble friend is concerned, I am afraid I am unable to do that without notice. If I may discover the answer to his question&#x2014;and there might be more than one method of apportionment apart from rateable value&#x2014;then perhaps I may write to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00640"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this is pertinent to what we are discussing. We should be very grateful if we all got a copy of that suggestion of how the apportionment is going to he made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00641"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, certainly. I shall write to my noble friend and see that the noble Lords, Lord Ross, and Lord Hughes, obtain a copy of the letter. The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, asked the question on apportionment and I am informed that, contrary to what the noble Lord said, not all apportionment is at present carried out on the basis of rateable value; it is not the universal method in Scotland. I am informed that in some cases apportionment can be on the basis of a title deed. For example, a tenant may have an
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0046"/>
<col>75</col>
obligation to pay one-half of the cost of, say, a roof repair but that obligation will be made quite clear in the title deed. Normally, we would expect the rateable value to be used but if there is something different in the title deed then the amount of the contribution from the common owner of the stair, or from the paver; would be defined by the obligation in the title deed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00642"><member>Lord Hughes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that, to a certain extent, that gives the answer to the question of another method of apportionment. I referred to the title deed because, obviously, if a repair which is carried out is, in the ordinary way, to be divided in a particular way according to the ownership of the property, then it will be equally reasonable if the local authority carried out work of that kind that they would follow that method. That is, obviously, one way of doing it. I would suggest that if there were a close examination of what is happening in all the local authorities in Scotland, one would find that apportionment by rateable value is by far the most common method; although I must accept the information that it is not done by all.</membercontribution></p>

will achieve the same purpose without depriving an affected proprietor of the right to be heard before warrant is granted if he chooses to enter the proceedings. Amendment No. 252 drops the provisions in subsection 3(<i>a</i>) of this clause allowing the sheriff to appoint an assessor to assist him in dealing with technical matters about pipes and drains.

Amendments Nos. 253 to 256 arise from the Government's undertaking to reconsider the need for local authority approval where roofs of permanent buildings are to be used for the erection of raised standing or seating accommodation. Local authorities have found alternatives to their existing powers under Section 31 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1903 and the amendments tabled will confine application of the clause to temporary structures only. Amendment No. 257 takes account of the administrative burden now placed on local authorities required to inspect temporary structures which do not attract a building warrant fee. It follows a suggestion from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and leaves the level of fee to the discretion of individual authorities, provided the total amount of fees is sufficient to meet the expenses incurred in discharging this function.<lb/>

The Government accepted this and moved Amendment No. 263 in consequence of the previous two amendments. The term "limewash" was originally included in the clause as several local authorities had indicated that they still required the limewashing of common stairs, as distinct from painting the stairs. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was of the opinion that the term was indeed archaic. The revised wording used is all-embracing and more suited to today. It still enables authorities to require limewashing if those local authorities so wish.<lb/>

Subsection 99(3) already provides that Clause 99 is without prejudice to Section 2 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which makes it an offence to carry out certain works on scheduled monuments. Many of the statues and monuments which may be affected by Clause 99 may be listed buildings within the meaning of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972. Listed buildings are protected by Section 53 of the 1972 Act, which provides that it is an offence to carry out works affecting listed buildings without authorisation by the local planning authority or the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 264, therefore, provides that the powers in Clause 99 are without prejudice to the overriding provisions of Section 53 of the 1972 Act for the protection of listed buildings.<lb/>

Amendments Nos. 282 and 283 <i>en bloc</i>. Amendment No. 283 provides that national charities exempted by order under subsection (10) from the need to obtain permission from a district or islands council to hold a public charitable collection must nonetheless (except where the Secretary of State otherwise directs) give such council at least three months' notice of the date of collection. Prior notification of the collection dates of exempt charities is clearly vital to the district council's task of assigning dates to non-exempt charities: failure to notify might prejudice both national and local charities which might find themselves collecting on the same day. It had originally been our intention to rely on administrative directions to all exempt charities to give adequate notification making it clear that, where such notification was not given, the Secretary of State could impose a formal condition of notification on the exemption or, in extreme cases, revoke it. Strong representations were, however, made by the Opposition in another place that this ultimate sanction of loss of exemption was not sufficient and that an immediate requirement to inform local authorities should be placed on exempt charities.<lb/>
At present, exempt charities are not statutorily required to notify unless such notification is one of the conditions attached to their exemption under the terms of subsection (10). Amendment No. 283 effectively reverses the onus of responsibility, providing that an exempt charity must give at least three months' notice of its intention to collect unless the Secretary of State specifically waives that requirement. This amendment does not of course give authorities a right to veto days chosen by the exempted charity. Since, however, it is in no one's interest for too many charities to collect on the same day in the same place, we would expect both national and local charities to exercise due flexibility in fixing suitable dates when there is (for example) overlap between a national flag day and the traditional collecting date of a local charity.<lb/>
Amendment No. 282 makes a numbering change in subsection (10) to bring it into line with the drafting of subsection (10A).<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00684"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 288. That amendment sets out the procedures to be followed by the district or islands council seeking to make by-laws in respect of the seashore, adjacent waters or inland waters. The new subsections (2B)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>a</i>) as read together, sought to ensure before making such by-laws the district or islands council should obtain the consent of all proprietors of land, waters or salmon fishing whose proprietary rights are likely to be affected.<lb/>
Unfortunately, as your Lordships can see, Amendment No. 288 contains a technical error. There is a reference in (2B)(<i>b</i>) to consent required under (2B)(<i>a</i>), but no such specific reference to consent appears in (2B)(<i>a</i>). The effect of that clause, as amended in the other place, is therefore unclear and a further amendment, which I am going to move formally, No. 288A, safeguards the rights of proprietors by placing beyond doubt that the person whose consent to the by-laws is required are those identified by the district or islands council under (2B)(<i>a</i>) as having a relevant proprietorial interest likely to be affected by the by-laws. That is the reason for my having to table an amendment at this embarrassingly late stage. I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00693"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 300. This amendment is in response to suggestions made by the convention. At present the Dogs Act 1906, which deals with seizure of stray dogs, is in terms of the dogs being seized on a highway or place of public resort. What is also required is a power for the police or a dog warden to seize a stray dog on private land or premises providing the owner of that land consents.<lb/>
This amendment therefore so provides. In practice, it will mean that if a stray dog is found in private property such as a garden, the owner or tenant will be able to telephone a dog warden, if one exists, or the police, who will be able to take it away under the terms of the 1906 Act&#x2014;without ensuring, as they have to now, that the dog is found on a "highway or place of public resort". I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00694"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no doubt noble Lords opposite were wondering what I was staying for. I do not dissent from the Commons amendment. Indeed, I think that, by the time we have agreed with the Commons in over 360 amendments, this Bill will be a model of painstaking legislation. It is quite extraordinary, really, how a Bill introduced into your Lordships' House, going through the careful and vigilant scrutiny of noble Lords on both sides of the House, should receive so much amendment in another place. It is a tribute, I think, to the way in which Parliament deals with legislation of this kind.<lb/>
Another remark I would make is that by the time we part with this Bill, Scotland will obviously be a very well behaved and pleasant place to live in. That, I think, is on the credit side of this Bill. When in this Bill (in, I believe, Clause 27) we have the Scots being fined
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0051"/>
<col>85</col>
up to &#x00A3;200 for picking over the contents of a dustbin, it just shows how much care has been taken to deal with every possible form of delinquent civic behaviour.<lb/>
But, on dogs, I point out that on the Local Government (Miscellaneous provisions) Bill dealing with England and Wales the Government resolutely resisted attempts to do what is now being done in Scotland. Moreover, they resolutely resisted proposals which are now being included in a completely new draft order for Northern Ireland. The draft order for Northern Ireland is a Bill in itself, but, of course, the procedures in connection with legislation in Northern Ireland are so simplified that the provisions of the draft order will not be considered in detail by either House. Yet that draft order will contain provisions which the Government would have nothing to do with when some of my noble friends and I wanted them introduced into the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.<lb/>
Clause 130 in the Bill, which is the subject of Amendment No. 300, does in Scotland what we wanted to be done in England; namely, to transfer powers now enjoyed by the police under the 1906 Act to wardens appointed by local authorities. The Government refused to do it. They would have no truck with proposed changes in the English Bill relating to dog control. There were sex shops galore&#x2014;yards of that, miles of that&#x2014;but when it came to dogs, no.<lb/>
This amendment carries Clause 130 a little further. As the noble Earl on the Government Front Bench has just explained, the power of seizure is extended beyond a highway and a place of public resort. It is extended to private property, provided that the owner or occupier gives consent. But this means that stray dogs in Scotland can be picked up from private land as well as from the highway, whereas in England the power of seizure will not be in the hands of the wardens to the same extent. It will be in the hands of the police, but not the wardens&#x2014;but not these powers in the hands of the police.<lb/>
I think that this is a legitimate source of criticism of the way in which the Government are dealing with dogs by negative action in England and Wales, by partial action in Scotland and by complete action in Northern Ireland. I do not expect the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite to offer any excuses for the Government. He may have no responsibility for the way in which the Government are dealing with the same sort of problems in these different ways in different parts of the United Kingdom. However, I think I am entitled to draw attention to this. The way the Government treated a Member of another place, Mr. Aspinwall, when he tried to introduce a Private Member's Bill to cover all these things for England and Wales was really quite shocking. They led him up the garden path and then deserted him when it came to the end of the proceedings in another place one Friday afternoon. So the Government's record on dogs is shocking, and I am drawing attention to the matter and hope that in our new Session we can make some progress in England and Wales.<lb/>
I do not know what it is that justifies the distinction between the powers given for dealing with stray dogs in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I
<col>86</col>
know that in the report of the working party six years ago special attention was drawn to the problems in Northern Ireland, which may justify the more radical approach to the whole subject which is about to be undertaken in the draft order. But, so far as I recall, the working party did not draw any attention to similar problems in Scotland, which are no different from the problems in the North of England and are probably no different from the problems of Wales, where a stray dog can be a particular threat to livestock. Anyhow, I have made my critical observations, I have paid a little tribute to the way in which Parliament does its work and I think that these comments are relevant to what we are doing now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00695"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that my noble friend has missed a lot of opportunities for barking about dogs over the years. I do not know whether it has escaped his knowledge that over the past three to four years I have been complaining about the unfortunate Minister on the other side coming forward to support private legislation applying to local authorities the powers that were given to the police in the 1906 Act, and giving the right to appoint dog wardens and to be active in respect of stray dogs. Every single district, one after the other, had to mount a separate piece of private legislation. Just imagine the cost of it, my Lords. Where was my noble friend when I sought to get general legislation? He was silent. He was not interested in the fact that we were doing good, bit by bit, in Scotland. Think of the speeches he could have made about the walls of England in respect of dogs&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00696"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend knows from our long and affectionate association how shy I am of putting my spoke into matters affecting Scotland. It is almost holy ground to me. It becomes a little less so only when the Government go in for the things that I criticised earlier on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00697"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Yes, My Lords, I appreciate that. I have noticed the difference in my noble friend since his translation from one part of Westminster to the other. This is all very good, but we have the legislation in relation to dogs scattered all over the place. I want to ask just one question. Shall we get for Scotland some measure of consolidation in relation to Dog Acts or, is it as I suspect, that we are not yet finished with the legislation and there is more to come? There could be very much more, since we made advances, even in Clause 130, after the Bill left here. We have something new put into it and it becomes all the more important that we have some consolidation, and look to see exactly what is still left in relation to the unsatisfactory position.<lb/>
I hope that my noble friend will feel with me how difficult it was, knowing that this Bill was printed when the Government still brought forward from certain districts of Scotland the necessary legislation which is now scrapped by Clause 130, which states:
<quote>"Any enactment in any local Act which amends section 3 of the said Act of 1906"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, all these things which we have done over the past three years&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00698"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suggest, as the legislation is now sensible, that we get on with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00699"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may respond to this extent. I fear that I have no ministerial responsibility for what goes on so far as dogs are concerned in England and Wales or, indeed, in Northern Ireland. However, under the doctrine of collective ministerial responsibility, probably the less I say about that subject the better. Suffice it to say that this small provision in Clause 130 will be useful because, as I have made clear, police or dog wardens can take possession of a stray on private land, providing the owner of the land or a lawful occupier so consents.<lb/>
So far as future legislation is concerned, I fear&#x2014;if that is the word&#x2014;that the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, is right. He will recollect that even now the Scottish Law Commission is preparing a comprehensive memorandum covering all the problems of civil liability in respect of animals. Whether or not this review will cover the question of dogs I do not know, but I strongly suspect that it will. I also imagine that this, or a successor Government, will want to legislate in due course in respect of that memorandum.<lb/>
For those reasons, therefore, I do not think that I can promise any consideration at the moment because, as I have said, one wants to be sure one has got to the end of a particular set of legislative proposals before employing the drafting resources (which are, as the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, well knows, limited) to draft a Consolidation Bill. The only useful thing which has come out of this debate is that those who claim that Scotland, legislatively speaking, is always dragged along on the coat-tails of England are quite wrong in many instances. There are plenty of examples of that, both in this Bill and other Bills which have become Acts during the course of this Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>("(2A) An order under subsection (2) above shall have the effect of further postponing from the end of 1984 the repeal of any local statutory provision to which subsection (6) of section 225 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 applies to the extent that the local statutory provision provides for any matter which is also provided for (whether consistently or not) by or under the provision of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts 1892 to 1911 the repeal of which is further postponed by the order; and a further postponement under this section shall be for the same period as the further postponement under subsection (2) above to which it relates.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00712"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 304.<lb/>
The Civic Government (Scotland) Bill does not cover provisions in the Burgh Police Acts and local Acts relating to roads and streets, since the continued need for such provisions is to be reviewed in the context of the forthcoming Roads (Scotland) Bill. As a failsafe against the possibility that this Bill will not have been enacted by the end of 1984, subsection (2) provides for the further postponement by order of the repeal of specified Burgh Police Act provisions relating to roads and streets.<lb/>
There are also a large number of provisions relating to roads and streets in local legislation which it is desirable to be able to extend beyond the end of 1984. Extension of such local statutory provisions is already possible under Section 225(6)(<i>a</i>) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, but an extension order under section 225 would require the provisions which are to be exempted from appeal to be specified individually.<lb/>
Since the task of identifying precisely sections or parts thereof whose repeal it was desired to postpone would impose a heavy administrative burden on local authorities, Amendment No. 304 provides for the extension of cognate local Act provisions to follow automatically from an order specifying Burgh Police Act provisions for extension under clause 135(2). I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00718"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 361. It is not very suitable for Commons Amendments Nos. 361 to 363 to be taken <i>en bloc</i>. Sections 17(2) and 18 of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that a person is guilty of an offence (punishable with a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine) if he has in his possession a firearm with intent to commit an offence specified in Schedule 2 to that Act or if at the time of his committing or being arrested for such an offence he has a firearm in his possession.<lb/>
Among the offences listed in Schedule 2 to the 1968 Act to which Sections 17(2) and 18 apply are offences against Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824 and against the third and fourth paragraphs of Section 7 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1871. Section 4 of the
<col>108</col>
1824 Act and Section 7 of the 1871 Act cover, <i>inter alia</i>, such offences as loitering with intent, being on enclosed premises with intent to commit theft, and so on. Both sections are being repealed by the Bill. The loitering with intent provision is not being replaced, but Clause 60 of the Bill re-enacts, in modern form, the offence of being on a building with intent to commit theft. We believe that Sections 17(2) and 18 of the 1968 Act should continue to apply to this offence and the amendment is therefore designed to delete the references to Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act and Section 7 of the Prevention of Crime Act in Schedule 2 to the Firearms Act and insert a reference to Clause 60 of the Bill.

This amendment extends the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 to cover puppy farms (so your Lordships will see why it was totally inappropriate to be taken with the last amendment); that is, premises where puppies bred elsewhere are bought in and reared for commercial sale. It closes the major loophole in the Breeding of Dogs Act identified by the Working Party on Dogs 1976 and was suggested to the Government by the convention as a possible minor amendment to this Bill. The clause will not, of course, apply to purely domestic breeding because it is tied specifically to premises where a "business" of rearing puppies is carried on. It thus ensures that they will be subject to the same powers of inspection as orthodox breeding establishments have been subject to since 1973.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00724"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 363. The amendment is designed to rectify an anomaly in the repairs grant scheme which has given cause for concern over a number of years and which has arisen as a result of minor differences in the definitions of the word "house" in existing legislation.<lb/>
At present while local authorities are empowered to require proprietors of both residential and non-residential premises within a tenement building which is considered to be in a state of serious disrepair to carry out such repair work as they consider necessary, only the proprietors of the residential premises are eligible for consideration for grant assistance towards their shares of the cost of the work. Representations against the absence of powers in relation to the payment of grant to commercial proprietors led to the commissioning towards the end of last year of a research project designed to establish the extent of the problem. The consultants' report, which carries a clear recommendation for grants to be made available to these proprietors, was published on 5th October.<lb/>
In moving this amendment I should draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that the amendment is incorrectly printed. The words "or houses" at the beginning of the fifth line in the new subsection (6)(<i>a</i>) (as printed in the list of amendments) are redundant and have been introduced by a printer's error. I would therefore ask your Lordships when agreeing to this amendment to agree to it without these intrusive words. I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00739"><member>Lord Boardman</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00740">What are the current estimates for:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) constructing the proposed new roads linking the M1 and the A1 between Catthorpe in Leicestershire and Thrapston in Northamptonshire;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) extending the A45 from Wellingborough to Thrapston as an alternative to the proposed new road;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) improving the A427 and the A61 16 between the M1 and Thrapston as an alternative to the proposed new road.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00741"><member>The Earl of Avon</member>: The estimated costs at November 1981 prices are as follows:
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) constructing M1&#x2013;A1 Link road between Catthorpe and Thrapston&#x2014;&#x00A3;70 million;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) completing the planned A45 improvements to Thrapston&#x2014;&#x00A3;27 million: and</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) improving A427 and A6116&#x2014;&#x00A3;23 million.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00742">However, even if these improvements of the A45, A427 and A6116 were carried out&#x2014;and there are no plans for improving the A427&#x2014;they would not do all that the M1&#x2013;A1 Link Road is planned to do. They would not provide a fast, direct route between the Midlands and the East Coast ports, nor would they relieve Kettering of heavy volumes of through traffic on the A6 and A43 trunk roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00743">WILDFOWLING: BANS</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00744"><member>Lord Chelwood</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00745">Whether they will summarise the proposed new arrangements for bans on wildfowling in severe weather; by which organisations the review was carried out; whether the proposals were favoured unanimously; what reservations, if any, the Government have; how a ban would be publicised; and whether they will give an assurance that they would not again call off a ban without consulting the Nature Conservancy Council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00746"><member>The Earl of Avon</member>: The Government have received the report of the Working Group on shooting bans in severe weather and are considering its findings and recommendations. The group consisted of representatives of the Nature Conservancy Council, Wildfowl
<col>112</col>
Trust, British Association for Shooting and Conservation, British Trust for Ornithology, British Field Sports Society, the Game Conservancy, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and University of Durham, who have produced a unanimous report. The Government have never called off a ban without consulting the NCC and do not intend to do so in the future. I will write to my noble friend giving him a summary of the proposals, including the procedure for publicity, as soon as the Government have reached a decision on the recommendations.</p>

<title>THE WESTERN ISLES: INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00747"><member>Lord Chelwood</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) whether they have now set in motion an urgent study of the need for an imaginative and wider-based strategy for rural development, as recommended in the First Report from the House of Commons Agriculture Committee of 23rd July 1982, with particular reference to the integrated development programme for the Western isles as a forerunner of others;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) whether they share the Committee's view that &#x00A3;60,000 for environmental protection in the integrated development programme for the Western Isles would be too small a sum for an adequate policy to be implemented and how much they intend to set aside for such measures;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) whether they intend to appoint a Minister of State for Rural Affairs as recommended in this report.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00748"><member>Earl Ferrers</member>: The Government's response to the House of Commons Agriculture Committee's First Report will be sent to the Committee in the near future.

<title>OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS BOARD REPORT</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00752"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00753">When they expect to publish the report of the Occupational Pensions Board on the greater security for occupational pension rights and expectations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00754"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: The Occupational Pensions Board has sent my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Services its report on <i>Greater Security for the Rights and Expectations of Members of Occupational Pension Schemes:</i> its report is being published today</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00755">We would like to take this opportunity of thanking the hoard for what is clearly a very thorough examination of the issues. In particular my right honourable friend would like to express his appreciation to the former chairman of the hoard, Lord Brimelow, for his achievement in securing the delivery of this valuable report to us before he retired, within the time limit originally envisaged for the report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00756">The Government welcome the recommendations in the board's report, in particular those concerning the disclosure of information to members. This is one of the most important ways of helping pension scheme members themselves to ensure that their schemes are managed in their best interests&#x2014;a matter to which the Government attach the utmost importance. The Government therefore accept in principle the need for legislation to regulate this aspect of pension scheme management, and my right honourable friend will be consulting interested parties about the content of such legislation. In addition, a working party of officials is being set up to examine the law and conventions governing the content of pension funds. The Government will welcome representations from the public and from any organisation with an interest in the matters mentioned above and discussed fully in the hoard's report. It would be helpful if representations could he sent to my department by the end of December 1982.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00757">I would like to take this opportunity to say something about the Government's view on the previous board report on early leavers. We have had a considerable number of representations and comments, for which we are most grateful. There is a clear recognition, which the Government share, that the rules of private sector occupational pension schemes do not always give a fair deal to early leavers, who suffer in comparison with the pension rights available for those who stay in a single pensionable employment up to pension age. To legislate so as to compel employers to improve provision for early leavers would however inevitably impose extra cost on industry, and&#x2014;as the OPB recognised&#x2014;the crucial question is how and to what extent this extra burden could reasonably be imposed. We must bear in mind that there will be wide differences in the abilities of different companies to afford improvements in their pension schemes. On balance, therefore, my right honourable friend does not propose to introduce immediate legislation to compel such improvements, but he will continue to keep the proposal of legislation under review.</p>
<col>114</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00758">The Government are nevertheless most anxious that pension schemes should introduce improvements for early leavers whenever they can. We therefore urge employers to include, in any consultations they may have on further changes in their pension scheme provisions, the possibility of achieving some such improvements. Leavers tend not to have any say in the running of the pension schemes they have left, and their interests are only too easily overlooked. In the interests of equity, and indeed also in the interest of improving job mobility, the Government will be looking initially to the pensions movement to secure improvements without legislation. I recognise that other members of occupational pension schemes, in particular existing pensioners, also have a claim for a fair deal, and indeed in its report on security and solvency the board itself expresses the hope that any improvements in the revaluation given to early leavers' rights will also be made available to existing pensioners. These constraints are fully understood; but the Government still look to employers to make progress.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00759">My right honourable friend will be inviting the joint working group on occupational pensions to meet with him from time to time to review progress and he will be carefully watching the progress achieved in considering the introduction of legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00760">The CBI has recently issued guidelines to employers, urging them to remember the rights and expectations of early leavers when they are able to introduce improvements, and to explore ways of achieving this with their advisers and scheme members. The Government welcome this encouragement to go ahead with such improvements wherever possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00761">The Government will be seeking a discussion with the NEDC later this year, to see how best we can still further encourage improvements in this particular field.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00762">There is one recommendation in the OPB's report which my right honourable friend can implement without primary legislation, but by regulations. This is its recommendation to prohibit the practice, known as "franking" whereby some schemes implement the limited measure of revaluation required by the contracting-out requirements by simply allowing a corresponding erosion of those occupational pension rights which exceed the contracted-out guaranteed minimum pension. He will be putting to the Occupational Pensions Board draft regulations to prohibit this practice in relation to pension rights accruing in the future, and I hope that, in the light of the board's report to him on those regulations, my right honourable friend will he able to introduce them in the first half of next year. We announce this now as an indication of the Government's desire to secure a fairer deal for early leavers and of our anxiety that employers should consider with utmost care how they can help.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00770"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00771">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00772">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of the necessity for an overall ministerial decision upon the area of military airspace affecting the deviation of passenger air routes, they have been able to refer to the Council of Ministers the detailed suggestions from IATA concerning 10 routes within the European Economic Community which could produce considerable savings for airlines and passengers in finance, fares and fuel.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00773"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a special European conference of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has asked its European Air Navigation Planning Group to look into IATA's specific suggestions, and this group is in the process of holding four meetings to consider the IATA proposals. We believe that this line of approach is more likely to achieve results than raising the matter in the Council of Ministers, particularly as many other nations, as well as the members of the Community, are involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00774"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord the Minister for that reply, may I ask whether he is aware how indebted I am to the director of the National Air Traffic Services and his colleagues for the time that they gave me during the Recess and from whom I learned a great deal? Is he aware, also, that I appreciated the details sent to me by the Secretary of State only this week following the action taken by him when he requested his officials at the Department of Trade to look into the whole question of air traffic control aspects of fuel saving? Finally, may I ask the noble Lord whether, as he has already indicated, the House will not be glad to learn from the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, and I quote:

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00778"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following that catalogue of acknowledgements, may I ask the Minister whether he is aware that the Secretary of State did say that he would continue to press this matter? Could the Minister give an indication when the time seems suitable for putting down a follow-up Question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00779"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we never bet on a hypothesis.

<title>Lorries: Regulation</title>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00784">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00785">To ask Her Majesty's Government when they expect to announce their proposals for goods vehicles with particular reference to maximum weights and axle arrangements.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00786"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have put forward a comprehensive and improved package of measures to reduce the environmental damage caused by lorries and to make our road freight industry, as well as the firms who depend on it, more efficient. These proposals cover road construction; grants to encourage the transfer of freight from road to rail or waterway; lorry re-routeing and control; lorry action areas to alleviate the effects of heavy traffic; new noise and safety requirements; changes in operator licensing: limits on lorry dimensions; and a new taxation system. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport hopes shortly to announce detailed proposals on lorry weights and axle arrangements, and to bring forward the necessary regulations.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00787"><member>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that most interesting Answer, may I say that it does not quite answer the Question? Therefore, I would like to ask him two supplementary questions. First, is he aware that the heavy goods manufacturing industry and related ancillary support industries are suffering from what is in effect a planning blight by the lack of decision in this matter? Is he further aware that the European competition is growing and suffers no such disadvantage, and is in fact making inroads into an area of activity which has formerly been dominated largely by domestic manufacturers? Secondly, may I ask my noble friend if he remembers that in June this year, in answer to a Written Question, he stated that an announcement would be made very shortly? What does that now mean? In the light of the imminent decline of this very important industry, would he not agree that a decision and an announcement is really very essential?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00788"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are indeed aware of the considerations my noble friend has put to the House this afternoon. The Government are still determined to press on with the package. We believe that at the moment there is more general acceptance by the public of this package, of which increased weights are a logical part. My noble friend asked me to comment on the expression "very shortly". I find it a little dangerous in this House to comment on dates, but I still think it will take place very shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00789"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that the Armitage Report, of which I hold a copy in my hand, expressed uncertainty as to how axles actually damage roads and expressed the view that there was insufficient knowledge on certain aspects; for instance, the effect of lorries on bridges, on underground pipes and on pavements and also the vibration effect on buildings? It expressed the view that there should be more research into these matters. Can we have an assurance that before heavier weights for lorries are introduced this research will be completed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00790"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his comments. Of course, he is totally correct: the research is going on all the time. As far as bridge damage is concerned, our objectives are to take remedial action to repair damage caused by existing traffic. As he says, we are continuing to experiment with road weights.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00791"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Earl, since he mentioned the Goverment's very welcome measures to transfer traffic from the roads to rail and waterway, will comment on the fact that the dock labour boards are in fact blacking any effort to transfer cargo to waterways while not blacking any effort to transfer it to road, on the grounds that it is the equivalent of dock labour?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00792"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot confirm what the noble Viscount has said, but it is an interesting comment and I will indeed check up on it. We have

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00794"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00795">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00796">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are satisfied that they have at their disposal sufficient expert knowledge of olive oil and other Mediterranean products to enable them to participate effectively in discussion of issues relating to these products in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00797"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have at their disposal all the information which is currently available on olive oil and other Mediterranean products. The information, on olive oil in particular, is not as complete as we would wish. We can participate in discussion of these issues in the Council of Ministers as effectively and as knowledgeably as other member states, who are in receipt of the same information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00798"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply, which implies, as I expected, a feeling of a state of uncertainty about olive oil. While I do not know of many olive growers in Anglesey or Sussex, or even Inverness-shire, it is very important to this country in view of the contribution and the surplus which might occur. Have Her Majesty's Government any plans which might simplify the problems in front of us? For example, in Italy, I understand, twice as much money is paid out in a production subsidy as is paid in a sales subsidy, which indicates quite a gap. Perhaps it indicates that the same view of love of the state and adherence to its rules does not apply there as might apply in some northern climes. Have the Government any simpler plans for supporting this quite important industry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00799"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, raises wide issues, and of course they will be to a considerable extent exacerbated on the proposed enlargement of the Community. I think perhaps in this context the noble Lord will permit me to examine what Her Majesty's Government have in mind, because increase in production and no fall in consumption is likely to take place. We believe, therefore, that the Community should seek to contain production and to limit the possibility of surpluses. With this in mind, we believe that aid based on a flat rate per olive tree would reduce the returns to be obtained by any increase in production.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00800"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister personally count the olive trees?</membercontribution></p>

<col>121</col>
investigations almost on the line of the Seveso disaster, to which I called attention first, some eight or nine years ago, when it was run down? Is he aware that those concerned have not yet been able fully to trace how the adulterated oil gets mixed in the cheap olive oils which are being sold on the streets of Italy today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00802"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will welcome the noble Lord, Lord Hale, back to his rightful place and will he much interested in the time he has spent in examining this interesting but disastrous story of the adulteration of products simulating olive oil. I fear this goes rather wider than the Question as drafted and perhaps the noble Lord will put before your Lordships a suitable Question at a later date.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00803"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I underline what my noble friend Lord Mackie of Benshie said. In view of the accession of Greece and the probable accession of Spain and Portugal, do the Government appreciate that there is likely to be a substantial increase in the surpluses of Mediterranean products, especially olive oil? If that takes place it will have a bad effect on the Community budget. Therefore, is it not very important that Her Majesty's Government find out quickly as much as they can about the production and marketing of olive oil so that this country will he in a position to play a full part in the future consideration of what may be a very big problem in due course?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00804"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, will he very well aware that your Lordships' House is taking a great interest in this matter through the medium of Sub-Committee D of your Lordships' Committee on European Communities. Her Majesty's Government are very much aware that expenditure on price support for Mediterranean products, of which olive oil is one of the most important, has been one of the fastest growing in the Community's agricultural budget. It raises issues in this regard to which the Government will pay the closest attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00805"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister press for a quick count of the olive trees, which matter, I understand, has been hanging fire for some years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00806"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right. There is indeed a particular issue here. A register is being made, known as the olive oil register. Unhappily, progress on compiling it has been slow, although our colleagues in the Community and the Council of Ministers are very anxious to see it pursued with all dispatch.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00807"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will Her Majesty's Government be prepared to instruct their agricultural attaches in the embassies in Athens, Rome and Madrid&#x2014;if they have not already done so&#x2014;to make a special study of this olive oil problem so that Her Majesty's Government, and particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, are as well informed as possible of all the facts in this complicated matter? That will enable them to play a full part in the discussions in Brussels.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00808"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Walston, is right.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00814">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether their plans for funding the universities through the University Grants Committee include acceptance of a triennial financial plan, given the abandonment in 1978 of the quinquennial system of funding: and what their policy is for the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00815"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government intend to continue the present triennial arrangements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00816"><member>Lord Hunter of Newington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in thanking the Minister for his short reply, may I ask what the Government's view is about the future of the University Grants Committee? Will it he academic, advisory or executive? If executive, will that have any effect on the freedom and autonomy of the universities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00817"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have no plans to change the broad role and function of the University Grants Committee. Nor do Ministers seek to influence academic decisions between courses and universities. However, we believe that it may well be appropriate for Ministers to have, to a modest extent, a little more influence over broad shifts of emphasis upon which they could be questioned, such as that at present taking place towards science and technology and away from arts and social sciences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00818"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in their funding plans, do the Government aim to bring the University Grants Committee into closer relationship with the structures now being set up to deal with higher education in the public sector?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00819"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said at the opening of my answer to the previous supplementary question, we have no plans to change the broad role and function of the University Grants Committee. There are no detailed structural changes immediately in mind that I know of.</membercontribution></p>

<col>123</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00820"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that some universities are going through an extraordinarily difficult time, including the University of Wales with which my noble and learned friend and I are closely associated? Does his reply about a triennium mean that there will not be any further cuts on universities, at least for the next three years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00821"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: We certainly recognise that the universities have been going through a very difficult period and we should recognise the very able and flexible way in which the universities have coped. We are now approaching the floor, as it were, of the cutback, and it is hoped that the level of funding will he maintained at the same level for the subsequent year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00822"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the Minister for coming back to this point, but he has not replied specifically to my question. He said that the principle of a triennium will now he in operation. Can he clearly say that that means that no university in the United Kingdom will be subjected to cuts by the Government, through the University Grants Committee, for the next three years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00823"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will not expect me to give detailed forecasts&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00824"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: Why not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00825"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: Because one does not anticipate budgets over a period. The question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hunter, was about a triennium. The advantage of the present system is that one is given a firm figure for the immediately ensuing year and figures of increasing flexibility over subsequent years which enable one to plan ahead and also meet contingencies as they arise. I am sure that is the right balance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00826"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, speaking as a governor of one of the colleges of London University, I must press the Minister further. When we are given a triennial figure in ordinary English that would make us feel assured for three years. The Minister now appears to be saying that that is not the case. Is he aware that it is impossible for people who are involved in university planning to work on such a basis?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00827"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it is of help to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness perhaps I can be slightly more precise. We intend that 1983&#x2013;84 should complete the planned period of contraction and we hope that the level of grant provision then reached can be maintained in 1984&#x2013;85. However, your Lordships will know that one cannot tie oneself to precise volume figures at a time of uncertain inflation rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00828"><member>Lord Alport</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that it is impossible for any vice-chancellor or senate of university to plan ahead if they only know for certain what amount of money will be available to them for one year? The noble Lord indicated that for the two subsequent years it may change in a way in which they cannot possibly anticipate. Is he aware that that may throw out all the plans made for the subsequent two years?</membercontribution></p>
<col>124</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00829"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would he very nice for all of us if we could always count on the money in our pockets buying what we want it to buy. Unfortunately, in real life we can only count on the amount of money in our pockets. The noble Lord would like that to be more precisely defined. He will see from the letter which my right honourable friend wrote to Dr. Parkes on 14th July, which was published, that figures were given in approximate terms for the years 1983&#x2013;84 and 1984&#x2013;85. Those are planning figures and my noble friend would be the last to complain if contingencies were such that they had to be varied downwards and not upwards. Flexibility must be available in both directions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00830"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not be prepared to say that the Government really mean to stick to the figure? I am a director of Dundee University, and I know about the trauma that they have gone through in arranging a 15 per cent. cut over three years. Every department has taken part and they have succeeded in achieving immense cuts. If the noble Lord is to stand there&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00831"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: Question!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00832"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a question. If the Minister is to stand there and say that there are contingencies that might alter downwards the money available, that would be a blow to the confidence of the universities which are following the Government's plan.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00834"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I could have an answer to my question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00835"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect, the noble Lord has not asked me a sentence which ends with an interrogation mark. I do not know what the question is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00836"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister is quite wrong. I said, does he really mean to stand there and say that he cannot even say that he will try to keep the money up?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00837"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have already stood here and done better. I have said what we intend to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00838"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware of the success of Stirling University&#x2014;one of the universities most severely affected by the cuts&#x2014;in attracting industrial development to the campus of the university in the form of an investment by a large United States computer company? Could he encourage other universities to follow similar initiatives?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00839"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what the noble Lord has described sounded admirable, but obviously I cannot comment without notice on specific cases. However. I shall look at what the noble Lord has said and if it is as admirable as he describes it, I shall bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00840"><member>Lord Fletcher</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister make it clear one way or the other whether or not universities and colleges can lie in the financial provisions made in the triennial plan?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00841"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I repeat that we intend that 1983&#x2013;84 should complete the planned period of contraction and hope that the level of grant provision then reached can be maintained in 1984&#x2013;85. If the noble Lord reads that tomorrow morning at his breakfast, I think he will find that it comes to as clear an indication of our intentions and the direction of our expenditure plans as it is fair to give at that distance of time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00842"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that more than half the higher educational sector now lies outside the universities, mainly in the polytechnics? Is he aware that they are suffering from the most appalling difficulties, and that the local authorities, which normally help them, are unable to do so any further because of constraints on their spending? Could the noble Lord give a similar assurance about the funding of the polytechnics to the one that he has given about the universities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00843"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Question has gone on a long time. The Question is about universities, and the noble Lord asked me about polytechnics.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00844"><member>Lord Hunter of Newington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, now that we have a triennium, can the Minister say whether local authority rates, pay settlements and matters of that kind, which, under a quinquennial system, were subject to an additional grant, will be the subject of additional grants in the new triennial system?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00845"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I should take advice on the answer to that question. I shall write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Western Isles Integrated Development Programme (Scotland) Regulations 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00847">3.14 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00848"><member>Lord Melchett</member> rose to move, That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the Western Isles Integrated Development Programme (Scotland) Regulations 1982 [SI 1982 No. 996], laid before the House on 21st July 1982, be annulled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00849"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing it my name on the Order Paper. First, in moving this Motion, may I stress that I broadly welcome the aims of the Western Isles Integrated Development Programme, and I have tabled this Motion today to give us an opportunity in Parliament
<col>126</col>
to debate the programme. I have no intention at the end of the debate, however unsatisfactory the Minister's reply might be, of asking the House to divide against the programme or to threaten it in any other way.<lb/>
However, I think that it is worthy of debate, and that view seems to be confirmed by the number of noble Lords who have put down their names to speak. As I say, I very warmly welcome the concept of integrated development programmes and, indeed, I welcome 95 per cent. of this integrated development programme&#x2014;the programme for the Western Isles. However, I have very great concern about one part of the programme. It is a narrow concern, but it affects extremely important issues. It is my primary reason for wishing to have a debate on the subject.<lb/>
Very briefly, to describe the programme, the IDP is funded jointly by the EEC and the British Government on a 60-40 basis. It contains a wide variety of measures to improve and assist local craft industries, tourism, construction of roads, piers and related infrastructures, the improvement of agriculture and support for forestry and fisheries. In all. &#x00A3;56.6 million will be spent over five years. At present, however, only the agricultural, fisheries and forestry measures are guaranteed support and it is those measures&#x2014;amounting to &#x00A3;20 million&#x2014;which are the subject of this statutory instrument before your Lordships today.<lb/>
Of the &#x00A3;20 million available for agriculture, it is only a small part of that, which is itself less than half the total expenditure on the IDP&#x2014;&#x00A3;3.4 million to be precise&#x2014;which will be spent on land improvements, which causes me and a number of other people great concern. Our concern is yet more limited because there are many areas in the Western Isles where land improvements could be carried out without there being any conflict with other interests. But there is a very severe risk&#x2014;indeed, a certainty&#x2014;of conflict with conservation interests if land improvement is carried out in certain parts of the Western Isles.<lb/>
As I understand it, the areas most likely to be affected by the &#x00A3;3.4 million to be spent on land improvement are 10,000 hectares of commons grazings, 13,000 hectares of inbye land, and in particular 1,000 hectares of machair. That 1,000 hectares of machair is the area that is by far the most important from a nature conservation point of view, and it is very restricted. It occurs on only three islands&#x2014;North and South Uist and Benbecula&#x2014;and, on those islands, only on the west, Atlantic, side of the main north-south road that runs along the islands.<lb/>
The nature conservation importance of the machair is really outstanding. To give your Lordships an idea&#x2014;and I am sure that other noble Lords will touch on this&#x2014;you could take the whole of the Somerset Levels, about which there has been enormous public concern&#x2014;Ministers have visited them, there have been numerous meetings with NFU and CLA representatives, conservationists and conservation bodies have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds buying land there, and so on&#x2014;and in 100 acres of the best land in the Western Isles you would find more breeding birds.<lb/>
Therefore, the area that we are talking about in the Western Isles is of quite exceptional nature conser-
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0072"/>
<col>127</col>
vation importance. Indeed, it is probably the most important area for birds and wild plants in the whole of the United Kingdom. It is, indeed, the only area in the United Kingdom which is of international significance. In international terms, this country is not all that well endowed with wild birds, wild plants and so on; but the Western Isles, and this particular part of them, certainly is of international importance and is recognised as such by naturalists all over the world. It is one of the few areas in this country which we have an international responsibility for safeguarding.<lb/>
If the area of nature conservation significance is so restricted and if it is so important in international terms, the question must arise: how could an integrated programme possibly give rise to any conflict in this area? The unfortunate fact of the matter is that these wetter areas of inbye land and wet machair have been singled out as the most promising by the DAFS for land improvement expenditure. It is the very same areas that have been singled out for expenditure on land improvement which are of maximum importance for nature conservation.<lb/>
The next question which a number of your Lordships might reasonably ask is, if a conflict of this sort is inevitable why does not the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on which your Lordships spent some time recently, provide a sensible solution? The answer to that is that the Wildlife and Countryside Act only provides a means of resolving conflicts of this sort on sites of special scientific interest; but the system of designating sites of special scientific interest is widely recognised as being defective nationally and particularly so in the Western Isles. This is mainly because shortage of staff in the Nature Conservancy Council has meant that a lot of areas which are of SSSI status and which are normally called proposed SSSIs have not been officially designated. To give your Lordships an example, in the Western Isles the best areas for breeding corncrakes, which is one of the very rare birds which abound in this area, and the outstanding area for ringed plovers which also breed in the Western Isles, and other waders, have not been designated as SSSIs.<lb/>
The other reason for believing that it was worth having a debate on this subject in your Lordships' House was to put the record straight. It is unfortunately a fact that the Government have persistently misrepresented the case that conservationists have made about the IDP since it first became public. First of all, to the European Community. The Government have apparently told the EEC officials concerned that their statutory advisers on nature conservation, the Nature Conservancy Council, are happy with the IDP and see no problems with it. That has been confirmed by officials in the Community who have said that that is the message they received from the British Government.<lb/>
After that message had been conveyed I had a letter from the chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council, Sir Ralph Verney, which said, amongst other things.
<quote>"this IDP is integrated in name alone".</quote>
He said that the failure to provide funds for project environmental appraisal,
<col>128</col>
<quote>"is a serious problem, and in our view infringes important principles of EEC environmental policy".</quote>
He went on to say:
<quote>"I must say we have been disappointed by the lack of opportunity to obtain true integration within their programme so that nature conservation would have featured in its own right".</quote>
The Government have also misrepresented the conservationists' case in responding to concern raised at international level about the IDP. An official at the Scottish Office in writing to the International Council for Bird Preservation said, first of all, that he assumed that the concern which the International Council for Bird Preservation had raised was,
<quote>"presumably based on the impression that there will be large-scale drainage of ecologically valuable wet lands with a view to introducing the sort of intensive arable farming associated with certain parts of the mainland".</quote>
The letter went on:
<quote>"Nothing could be further from the truth".</quote>
What could actually not be further from the truth is that any conservationist had suggested that there was going to be intensive arable farming in the Western Isles. It would have to be somebody pretty stupid, with respect to the Minister's private secretary. I think it was, who signed this letter, who was going to suggest that the sort of arable farming which I and others go in for in East Anglia was really going to be suitable as an agricultural practice in the Western Isles. It really seems to me to do no good to the Government case to attempt to set up some ridiculous supposition of this sort and pretend that it is the conservationists' case against the IDP and then proceed, not surprisingly, fairly easily to demolish it.<lb/>
The Government&#x2014;and I regret to have to say this&#x2014;have also just been downright rude about the conservationists who have raised the question of the IDP and its problems with them. The noble Earl the Minister who is to reply to the debate said in Scotland, in September, to a local paper:
<quote>"A great many of the people who are expressing anxiety have never been to the Western Isles, know nothing of the Western Isles, or the difficulties of those who live in the Western Isles. These people who are expressing anxiety have never bothered to find out for themselves what the IDP is, or means, or the sort of help it is going to give the people in this part of the world".</quote>
I do not know whether the Minister had me in mind when he made those remarks. I had just spent, a few weeks before, over an hour with him and his officials having him describe the IDP to me, and I can only say that if I did not understand after that I cannot help feeling that some of the blame should be attributed to him and his colleagues.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00850"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (The Earl of Mansfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord asks a rhetorical question and not strictly rhetorically, perhaps I may answer it here and now. Of course I did not mean the noble Lord. But equally he will acknowledge that he does keep some pretty strange company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00851"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not acknowledge that for a moment, because the organisation which has been in the forefront of raising this issue, and which has raised it with the Minister and his officials, is the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They first drew this to public attention, and they responded to requests for information from a number of politicians
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0073"/>
<col>129</col>
about the IDP. Incidentally, first from myself in the hope that I could show that the IDP was what the Ministry of Agriculture in England and Wales should be pushing as a sensible means of agricultural improvement and development in other areas of the United Kingdom. It was greatly to my disappointment to discover that there was this major flaw in the programme.<lb/>
I had thought, and still believe, that IDPs have tremendous potential for supporting communities not just in the Western Isles but in many other areas of the United Kingdom. I do not think that the RSPB really warrant the sort of rude remarks which the Minister made. They have, for example, visited the Western Isles annually since 1950. Their staff have made four visits there so far this year. They have employed somebody there for the last 15 years. Since April they have had six meetings with the Minister's officials at DAFS. They have had meetings with the North of Scotland Agricultural College, with the Nature Conservancy Council in Scotland, and so on. To suggest that these are people who really do not know what is going on there, have never been there, and do not know what they are talking about is, with great respect to the Minister, a quite unwarranted criticism.<lb/>
Apart from the RSPB there are a great many botanists, many of whom I have spoken to, who have been on field trips to the Western Isles over many years, and I would suggest much more frequently and consistently than anybody from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Scotland. To suggest that conservationists do not know the case they are making is unfair. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a rather more constructive reply to the debate today.<lb/>
So far the Government have been totally unbending on this. This is a very small area. Even when it became clear, as it has done, that the Government are determined to press ahead with development even in this thousand hectares which is of outstanding importance, and very minor suggestions have been made as to the way in which the damage can be minimised, the response from DAFS has been unyielding and unbending. To give your Lordships two examples, there is very little silage making in the Western Isles at the moment, but the IDP aims to increase this to increase the amount of fodder available for winter feed. Silage cutting will threaten nesting corncrakes. It is likely to chew up adult birds, destroy the nests, and so on. Conservationists have asked DAFS whether it would be possible to ensure that silage cutting takes place after 21st July and not before. The response to that was, No.<lb/>
Ragwort is going to be killed because it is a noxious weed, as noble Lords will know. An assurance was asked for that, because these areas are botanically so important, a non-broad spectrum herbicide should be used to kill the ragwort; and there are a number which, while they may not be specific to ragwort, are a great deal more specific than others. Again DAFS refused to give any assurance of that sort.<lb/>
The agricultural objective of the scheme, this part of it at least, is primarily to increase winter fodder by increasing the amount of silage that is made and indeed by improving summer grazing by increasing grass production. The question arises, why will that
<col>130</col>
cause any dangers? One suggestion has been that all this area was drained in the past and it is simply going to revert to previous agricultural practice. It is true that there are old drainage ditches, some of which are blocked, in the area. But I would suggest that anybody who knows anything about modern farming and drainage will know that clearing out ditches with modern machinery, with Hymacs, and so on, bears absolutely no relation whatsoever to the sort of ditching done 100 years ago by people working with spades.<lb/>
In addition, 100 years ago broad spectrum herbicides were not used to spray the wild flowers and other things growing in the fields, and there was no question of fields being reseeded with modern strains, for example, of rye grass, or whatever, to improve grass production. So the kind of agricultural improvement which DAFS have in mind in this area is not, and bears no relationship to, traditional crofting practice, and the effects of this and other steps&#x2014;for example, removing iris and nettle beds, which are important early cover for corncrakes in the spring&#x2014;will undoubtedly lead to major losses, first of flowers, which seems quite unarguable, and it may be that the Minister has not taken that point on board sufficiently so far, but also to the nesting and breeding birds in the islands.<lb/>
The next challenge, as it were, from the Government is, "How do you know this? None of this has started yet. The IDP has not begun, so how can you tell this will happen?" There has been some land drainage and improvement work done in the Western Isles, in particular about 100 acres on Benbecula have been drained and reseeded. Experts who visited that area this spring have made it perfectly clear to me that it has had a drastic and bad effect on the wild life, both plants and birds, of the area, so it is quite clear that what is intended will be very damaging indeed.<lb/>
This raises one other defence which the Minister has put to myself and others, and that is that everything which will be done under the IDP was possible in the past and that all that is being done is to raise the rate of grant slightly. It seems difficult for the Government on the one hand to announce this as a major new development which will have major benefits for the islands, while on the other to say, "It is really nothing new. All of it would have happened anyhow". That is clearly not true. The rates of grant are much higher under the IDP and there will be a number of staff going round making sure the grants are taken up and developments take place. Therefore it is not possible to argue&#x2014;indeed, it is a little silly for the Government to try to argue&#x2014;that the IDP will make no difference.<lb/>
I stress that I am not against public money going to the islands. As I said before, and want to reiterate&#x2014;because this has been constantly misrepresented&#x2014;I warmly welcome the integrated development programme. I am extremely concerned that about &#x00A3;36 million of it has not yet been guaranteed by the Government, and I hope the Minister will be pressed by others on that point. Nor am I against, I wish to stress, money going to the crofting community in the Western Isles. I recognise clearly the importance of local people living off the natural produce of the islands, including agriculture and fisheries, where, incidentally, I think there is probably
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0074"/>
<col>131</col>
a much stronger case for more expenditure than the IDP actually allows, and that has been confirmed to me by people in the Western Isles who know a great deal about the fisheries case.<lb/>
Certainly some very trenchant criticisms are made, not least by the Government's own agricultural advisory service, the North of Scotland Agricultural College&#x2014;the equivalent of ADAS in the South&#x2014;about the agricultural justification of the scheme, and I have no doubt that other noble Lords will comment on that.<lb/>
But there are alternative ways of spending the money and alternative ways of creating many more jobs at much less cost than this particular part of the agricultural package. For example, the Highlands and Islands Development Board reckons that the cost per new job created ranges from about &#x00A3;4,000 for marine engineering, &#x00A3;1,700 for crafts and &#x00A3;8,200 for tourism up to &#x00A3;10,000 for agriculture. I welcome the fact that the IDP gives money to many of these areas, and that is one of the reasons I strongly support it, and I feel I should comment on the question of tourism. Noble Lords may not think that the Western Isles are what most people would see as a tourist paradise, but that is a mistaken view. Obviously it will not be a major factor in the economy. I do not pretend it is, or will be, nor do I think it should be, but it is a factor. For example, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have a reserve on the Western Isles. Annually, about 1,500 people sign the visitors' book in a bothy on the reserve. There is no doubt that many more people visit the reserve than sign the book, but that will give your Lordships an idea of the number of visitors which the wildlife on the islands can attract.<lb/>
I have a catalogue of an American tour firm which takes in a number of places in the United Kingdom including Windsor Castle, the North Norfolk coast for birds. York and York Minster, Hadrian's Wall, Edinburgh, the New Forest and Snowdonia, but it includes two days in the Western Isles. I suggest that if Hadrian's Wall, York Minster or Windsor Castle were threatened by the integrated development programme, people interested in tourist development in this country would have something to say about it. It is interesting to note that all of those places are visited for a shorter time than these visitors spend in the Western Islands; they spend two days there as opposed to one day visiting almost everywhere else I have mentioned. The tourist season for people watching birds and going to look a flowering plants is rather earlier and longer than traditional holiday-making tourism, so it has some economic usefulness. It seems absolutely ridiculous that in what is called an integrated programme, such a small part of it should threaten that tourist potential to the extent I believe it does.<lb/>
The Government have said repeatedly in discussions with conservationists about the IDP that if conservationists make a fuss about it, they will set up what has been referred to by Ministers as a birds versus people argument. They have used that phrase rather than conservationists and it seems to me have been very much in the category of a self-fulfilling prophecy; the Government said often enough that if there was a bird versus people argument, some people would be
<col>132</col>
misled into believing that that was what the argument was about. It is not. In so far as it is, I believe it is a conflict entirely and exclusively of the Government's making. I say that because as a result of this problem in the programme&#x2014;this small part of it which will give rise to such enormous conflict over a number of years, I believe, unless the Government give the sort of assurances that conservationists have asked for&#x2014;I can see only two possible routes down which this integrated development programme will go.<lb/>
The first is that the Government will ignore the conservation case&#x2014;incidentally, in the process breaking various international obligations which they have entered into about the protection of these very rare birds&#x2014;and that will, of course, guarantee the controversy I have mentioned. It will guarantee it continues and that there is an international row, a row not just in Europe or in this country but internationally about the destruction of wildlife in the Western Isles. It seems to me that as a result it will jeopardise the possibility of a future integrated development programme, which is widely talked about for the Western Highlands and which again, as I say, given my support for the concept of IDPs. I would warmly welcome. Thus, the Government, by taking a narrow and unyielding view of this IDP, will cut the throats of a large number of other farmers in the Western Highlands and crofters who would have benefited from another IDP there.<lb/>
The other possibility is that the Government will actually listen to the conservationists' objections in these areas. They have, incredibly, devised the IDP to guarantee conflict in a way that no conservationist supports because, unlike any other farmer or crofter in the United Kingdom, if a crofter under the IDP is refused an agricultural development grant on conservation grounds, they will not have to be offered a management agreement by the Nature Conservancy Council or anybody else to compensate them for the loss of agricultural potential and development which the IDP would have brought them. That is singling out the crofter for special discriminatory and unfair treatment outside all other farmers in the whole of Great Britain. It seems totally unjustified and I have not heard a single argument from the Government to justify such treatment.<lb/>
Of course, the reason is that they know perfectly well that for it to be an integrated programme, funds to help crofters who keep their land managed in traditional ways should be available in the programme itself. That is what an integrated programme means: that you integrate payments for nature conservation, tourism, fisheries, forestry and agricultural development all within a single programme. That is what the Government have refused to do and that is why I fear that the IDP will cause conflict which, as I say, I very much regret. I still hope that at this late stage the Government will see the error of their ways in respect of this particular part of the programme and will change their course before it is too late. My Lords, I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the Western Isles Integrated Development Programme (Scotland) Regulations 1982 [S.I. 1982 No. 996], laid before the House on 21st July 1982, be annulled.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Melchett</i>.)</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00853"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, put his case with vigour and a certain amount of passion. He was wise enough to say that he does not want the Western Isles to be turned into a Norfolk or East Anglia and that he wants to see the development programme go forward. I say at the outset quite unashamedly that, as a farmer, I am on the side of the farmers and crofters and that, while the birds are important, the 30,000 people in the Western Isles are much more important.<lb/>
About 8,000 or 9,000 live in Stornoway, but the bulk of the people live in townships all over the 300,000 hectares of the Western Isles; and that is a lot of space&#x2014;more space than anywhere else in Europe. They are people who have a passion for the land.<lb/>
Part of the conservationists' case has been the production of a paper by an individual member of the North of Scotland College of Agriculture, with which my family has had a long connection, and it is not the policy of the North of Scotland College of Agriculture to play down the importance of agriculture. Individual members produce papers which stimulate discussion. But in fact the figure is &#x00A3;4 million in cash, as near as can he calculated, going into the Western Isles and the 30,000 people who live there. It is a lot of money. I doubt whether the tourism connected with seeing the birds, which I agree are important, is all that important.<lb/>
I believe that the feeling of the people of the Western Isles is enormously important. Lord Leverhulme, who was a man of immense energy and vision, spent millions of his money in the Western Isles trying to set up a fishing industry, and he was beaten by the passion of the people for the land. That is what beat him. It was not that the idea was wrong, or anything else like that. But they would not co-operate. What they wanted was the land and to live and work on the land, and that feeling is deeply engrained in those who are left in Lewis and Harris and the rest of the Western Isles. That must be taken into account more than any other single factor.<lb/>
Other things have been tried in the Western Isles. The Highlands and Islands Development Board has just had to close down a fish exporting factory at a loss of millions of pounds. But agriculture goes on, and I believe that any development scheme that ignores agriculture and does not do something to promote it and to make it more efficient and more attractive for the part-time crofters&#x2014;any scheme which does not acknowledge that&#x2014;is bound to fail.<lb/>
In my view the scheme that we are now considering cannot do the harm that the conservationists are claiming. We are talking of an area of 300,000 hectares. We are talking of the machair. The machair was the most important part in the old days. They used to nourish it with seaweed, and they grew crops. They took off not only hay; they grew oats as well.<lb/>
I understand that the corncrake population is declining. Some of my ornithologist friends tell me that the lack of cultivation may in fact be one of the causes of the decline in the numbers of corncrake. I cannot believe that taking 1,000 hectares and improving it can do anything that would really damage the extremely valuable wildlife and birdlife that we have there. But I know that, if one does not
<col>134</col>
encourage the improvement of agriculture, if one does not give these people a little more coming in, and better stock to look at and nourish, as well as a better opinion of their stock and their agriculture, they will not be retained on the land.<lb/>
I should like to put to the House a very simple proposition. I do not wish to hold up the House, since many other people wish to speak. The importance of improving the grazing, of improving the stock in the Western Isles, is extremely vital towards improving the confidence of the people and the crofters. I cannot believe that the modest programme set out can do anything but good for both the wildlife and the human life, which is the important thing there.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00855"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with considerable interest to the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, as well as the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie. I cannot follow the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, in saying that sufficient consultation has not been undertaken over the programme. The programme, which comes into effect now, has been worked out with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, the Crofters' Commission, the Western Isles island councils, the North of Scotland College of Agriculture, and the Nature Conservancy Council.<lb/>
The Nature Conservancy Council, for which undoubtedly the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, was speaking up, has had officials at every committee meeting that has been engaged in the plan. It has had a special representative on the main committee. It has had officials attending the working groups set up to advise on the land improvement schemes which, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, has said, will be a great asset not only to the agricultural side, but also in regard to the question of the preservation of the birds and so on. It is perfectly clear that the consultation covered every interest, and agreement was reached by everybody. Everyone agreed on the scheme.<lb/>
Of course there have been a few extremists, who have been carrying on a kind of war against the whole scheme, but they are in a minority. As I understand it, they are not people who are supported even by the Nature Conservancy Council, because that council has been in on all the discussions and all the plans.<lb/>
There are arrangements whereby safeguards for the environment exist and will continue to exist, and these kind of safeguards already operate in a great many other areas, too. So to do what it proposed is nothing new; it is something that will help the whole community. The interests which are being consulted, and which will benefit, are very widespread. There are included in the areas covered improvements for agriculture and for the crofters' farming which are as the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, said, absolutely vital to the particular area.<lb/>
There is to he assistance for transport, and this, too, is vital. Anyone who has been to the area will know how difficult it is to get about and how important it would be to improve the transport. Then there is the question of the social activities, such as help with the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0076"/>
<col>135</col>
tourist industry, and additional small industries will all benefit everybody and will do no harm to birds, flowers, or anything else. Then there will be help with marketing, as well as co-operative production, which is also extremely important, since the area where the agricultural units are is very small and on the whole crofters are part-time workers. Therefore it is necessary to have marketing schemes which will help everybody and in which all car participate.<lb/>
Furthermore, unless a scheme of this kind is carried out in the Western Isles, the deterioration which has begun will continue and the conservationists who are against the scheme will expose the whole population to not receiving grants and help which the EEC and the Government are prepared to give.<lb/>
I have recently returned from a short trip. Some of us on the agriculture committee of your Lordships' House were invited to go to see what are called the less advantaged areas of southern Italy, some parts of Bavaria&#x2014;hill land and smallholdings&#x2014;and some areas of the South of France. If one goes to such areas, it is perfectly obvious that while they have valuable agricultural products&#x2014;olives, vines, and so on&#x2014;they cannot live entirely on those holdings, and they receive tremendous help from what I believe are called social-economic developments, which in the main involve tourism and things which arise for tourists. The areas that we visited reminded me very much of the Western Highlands and the Western Isles. In the areas that we visited there are being provided employment and trade which otherwise would not be able to continue. I think that anyone who saw these areas would realise that what really helps them is to have (as it were) two types of employment, and to be able to get assistance to set up the structure which is required for these matters.<lb/>
The scheme for the Western Isles is bringing in EEC money and help to an area which has not been included before. Help on this scale has been going to other places&#x2014;to Ireland, for instance&#x2014;and there are two other schemes, one in France, in the Lozere, and the other in Belgium, in the Luxembourg Province. The EEC has given great assistance to those areas. I was enormously encouraged by the fact that in the case of this particular scheme and these areas we, too, now, for the first time, are going to benefit from the EEC and are going to get a considerable amount of assistance from them.<lb/>
This scheme will bring to Scotland assistance which will be of the greatest use to the crofters of the islands and to their social and economic development, which is as vital to the population as is agriculture. All through this the Nature Conservancy Council has been consulted and has agreed. This plan, which includes conservation as well as development, will increase the possibilities of development in those areas, and this will be to the benefit of everybody.<lb/>
I think it would be nothing short of tragic if now, in the case of a very small area and as a result of a very small amount of protest, so to speak, this scheme were held up. While I understand and appreciate that Lord Melchett is speaking for a small number of people who have these strong views, I think they are wrong. I think all the people who are operating this scheme have just as strong views on using the scheme to develop all that
<col>136</col>
we are talking about and on the conservation that is required for this very small area.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships that if you let land just go hack to bog, if you let land rot, what will happen is that it will be overrun by a great many vermin, like mink, rabbits and so on, and that will not help the bird life, either. In fact, it will be extremely dangerous, because we know that mink are a great danger to bird life, as well as in other ways. So I think it would be nothing short of tragic for this scheme, now agreed by everybody, now worked out, now about to begin, not to go ahead with the strong support of everyone in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00856">3.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00857"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am pleased that there are some in the House, like the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, who are concerned about conservation and wildlife protection; but I cannot help feeling that I have been round this course before, when I was chairman of the Forestry Commission. Whenever we endeavoured to plant up some new area in the Scottish Highlands, we had the regular pressures from so-called conservationists, whose only concern was that the countryside which they knew and recognised, and in which they were brought up, should not be changed. In a sense, they were conservationists but they were conservatives in the extreme.<lb/>
I have always believed that the appearance of the countryside is not diminished, and is probably enhanced, by its ability to support traditional industry; and there is nothing more pleasant for me than to go to the Highlands and the Western Isles on occasion and see that some people have the opportunity to earn their living in a place where they want to live. If you look at the statistics of employment in the area you will see that the Western Isles is a sad place. While the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, has obviously visited the Western Isles and knows them, I suspect that many of his supporters have not visited the Western Isles and seen the sad spectacle of the deserted and brokendown crofts, where people who have been unable to earn their living in traditional industry have had to leave the countryside in order to find employment elsewhere.<lb/>
There was massive depopulation in the Western Isles following the clearances, and that story has been well told. But looking at the period from 1921 until today, the population in the Western Isles in the areas concerned in this IDP was 44,000 in 1921 and is now 29,000. The number of cattle has decreased from 4,700 in 1967 to 3,800 in 1980. As a Scot who loves the Western Isles, I am concerned about these human statistics, and I am concerned that there should be opportunities for people to earn their living in the Western Isles. It is not only a matter of population statistics: these are widely-spread areas. So what happens when the population declines, as I have outlined? It means that schools are closed and post offices are closed; and it means that the whole infrastructure breaks down. The general amenities of living in the Western Isles must decline if you permit a continued reduction in the number of people who can earn their living in these places.<lb/>
So I hope that the Prayer that is submitted to your Lordships' House will he rejected. This is an
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0077"/>
<col>137</col>
imaginative scheme. It is funded substantially from the EEC, and it is part of their support to improve agricultural structures in the less favoured areas of Europe. I am delighted that these funds are being applied on this experimental basis in the Western Isles of Scotland, and I shall be very interested in the results.<lb/>
The argument is made by the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, that this is disturbing the wildlife and the bird life of the Western Isles, but he does less than justice to the Department of Agriculture in Scotland and to the government in Scotland, and to the Highlands and Islands Development Board. Let me assure Lord Melchett that there are many people in Scotland who are just as concerned as he is with the wildlife and with the protection of birds in the Western Isles, and that the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and the Highlands and Islands Development Board consult in the case of any agricultural programme in the Highlands and in the Islands with the local nature conservancy officers; and so far as I can gather from a message received from the HIDB only this morning, there has been no serious conflict between them and the local official of the nature conservancy in the case of any of the agricultural schemes which they have produced.<lb/>
Surely the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, will accept that it is possible for people in Scotland to be concerned about the same things as he is concerned with, but to ally that concern with an even deeper concern for the creation of a reasonable economic structure in the Highlands and Islands. The HIDB was set up because the Highlands and Islands had special problems&#x2014;economic problems, deep-seated problems. The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, says that there are alternative uses for subsidies, that marine engineering will create more jobs. Let him study the transport costs by McBraine taking marine engineering parts from the outlying islands to sell to the shipyards or to wherever they build fishing vessels or other ships on the mainland or in the south.<lb/>

The noble Lord is dreaming dreams which have no reality, and he is creating a monster which has no substance. We are concerned about bird life; we are concerned about conserving the beauty and the wildlife of the Western Isles; but we are also concerned with giving people the opportunity to earn their living, and this is an imaginative scheme which will stimulate that. My Lords, 80 per cent. of the people who live in these areas have some involvement in agriculture. All of them are crofters, some of them part-time crofters, and there is no other scheme or no other form of economic investment which has more importance for the population than this scheme. Consequently, I would ask your Lordships to approve it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00858">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00859"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the Prayer of my noble friend Lord Melchett. I had hoped very much that the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, could have been here today, but important business has detained him elsewhere. As your Lordships will know, he is chairman of the sub-Committee of the European Communities Committee which deals with environmental matters and which has taken some evidence on the matter before the House this afternoon. However, that Committee has
<col>138</col>
not yet drawn up a report, so one cannot say that one is speaking on behalf of the committee. Nevertheless, as this is likely to be the last occasion on which I myself shall address your Lordships as chairman of the main Select Committee on European Communities, I am glad that it is a matter on which I take a strong personal interest myself.<lb/>
I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Walston, is hoping to speak later in the debate. I am delighted that he found time to visit the Western Isles for a day during the Recess. I have noted the brief report which he has submitted to the agricultural sub-committee of the European Communities Committee. Clearly, he had a most enjoyable time but, if he will forgive my saying so, I found his report what I can only describe as rather sugary. His hosts were, plainly, not wishing to cloud his day with any awkward problems. I myself was not able to journey so far, but as a guest of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, I have in the past been to both Lewis and Harris, though not to the other islands.<lb/>
However, during this Recess, I did get as far as Edinburgh and some three weeks ago I spent an afternoon at the Nature Conservancy Council office there, where their version of the story was different in emphasis from that given to the noble Lord, Lord Walston. I have since had some discussions with the appropriate NCC officers in London. I have, of course, seen a copy of the letter which the chairman of the NCC sent some time ago to Lord Melchett and I have also spoken to senior officers in the Environment Directorate of the European Commission in Brussels, who were equally concerned and dissatisfied with the present situation. I have also been in touch with the European Environment Bureau in Brussels. Finally, needless to say, I have read the integrated five-year development programme. So I have conscientiously tried to do my homework.<lb/>
My Lords, I stress this, not out of any self-righteousness, but because of the remarks already quoted by my noble friend Lord Melchett which came from the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, during the time that I was in Scotland. I, too, quote from the <i>Stornoway Gazette</i>. Some of us, after all, have done our very best to study this matter in as objective a way as possible. It states in the <i>Stornoway Gazette</i>:
<quote>"Lord Mansfield said it was quite wrong to say that the [proposed] IDP schemes would mean a new threat to the environment".</quote>
He went on to emphasise that much of the aid is similar to what was given in previous years. It is only the scale of help that is new.<lb/>
Of course, my Lords, the scale is part of the problem. One cannot spend &#x00A3;56 million mostly, though not exclusively, on physical changes of some kind in the area concerned, without having some major physical effects&#x2014;many of which must have environmental significance even in areas which are not formally designated as of special importance.<lb/>
I would, of course, emphasise, as did my noble friend Lord Melchett, one's complete support for the integrated programme. There is no doubt whatever in one's mind that this is a most desirable scheme, and no one who has ever crossed the Minch could doubt it. So there should be no misunderstanding about that. What we are discussing is really something which is marginal but nevertheless of considerable importance
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0078"/>
<col>139</col>
internationally as well as for our own reputation in this country. No one should underestimate&#x2014;and we certainly do not&#x2014;the need for special help to sustain the population and to improve the economy of the Western Isles. To anyone who says that spending &#x00A3;56 million sterling over five years for the benefit of slightly fewer than 30,000 people (in addition to the money which has been put in already over the years by the Crofting Commission and the Highlands and Islands Development Board) is perhaps spending rather a lot of money, even though a substantial contribution will be coming from EEC, I would reply that one should accept it as necessary new money with the hope that it will achieve the desired result.<lb/>
To suggest that something on this scale is, in effect, irrelevant to the environment&#x2014;which is what the noble Earl is suggesting&#x2014;is not, in my view, sustainable. One recognises that direct work on land reclamation and development is only a small part of the total proposed scheme&#x2014;considerably less than 10 per cent., as my noble friend Lord Melchett indicated. But that argument cuts both ways. If the proportion is so small and if the main thrust of the programme is towards non-agricultural employment and social and physical infrastructure, then I would suggest that some desirable modifications of the land development proposals could involve no great sacrifice. As Mr. Bill Lawson, director of the project team on the islands, wrote in the <i>Guardian</i> of 30th September last:
<quote>"Agriculture in the Western Isles is unlikely to provide full-time employment for more than a few".</quote>
Part-time employment is, of course, the basis of the crofting system anyway. He went on to say:
<quote>"the land improvement proposals in the IDP are only a little more attractive than the existing grants under the Crofting Acts".</quote>
If that is so, then their effect, surely, must be marginal.<lb/>
One can then, I think, intelligently respond by asking the question: if it is as marginal as is suggested by the Minister himself and by the team leader, then does one really need to apply such marginal sums in the really relatively few areas where there is still a very real concern about the effect on wildlife and natural resources of all kinds? In other words, need one go in for treating the relatively small percentage of existing machair which one understands is to be part of the scheme? Would it not be possible to compromise on that while carrying out no doubt entirely desirable agricultural improvements in other areas which are less sensitive?<lb/>
I will leave this argument now in the interests of brevity. We appreciate that the noble Earl is trying to get to Inverness at some time tonight. I will leave the argument simply pointing out that one cannot have it both ways. The real problem in this so-called integrated scheme is that there is lip service to environmental values but very little to sustain it. In the last part of the "General Background" section of the official programme, the international ranking of the islands is fairly indicated. I quote:
<quote>"The islands are internationally important for wildlife, including large seabird colonies. On the west coasts are found some of the finest examples of machair in Scotland and there are extensive wetland and moorland habitats. The four National Nature Reserves, two of which are"&#x2014;</quote>
<col>140</col>
on the international list of particularly important and sensitive areas&#x2014;
<quote>"and thirty-five Sites of Special Scientific Interest &#x2026; emphasise this biological importance &#x2026; the Western Isles is part of a priority biogeographical province &#x2026; requiring extra protection on account of its global ecological importance in relation to existing measures of protection".</quote>
My Lords, we have an international obligation, both legally under the EEC directive on bird protection, and in other international organisations in which we are members and to which we are a party. We should not suggest that this is something which we can just put on one side. The situation is that while &#x00A3;56 million in all is to be spent, there are no additional funds of any kind to be available either from Her Majesty's Government or from the European Communities for environmental improvement or protection. It seems to me that it is quite absurd that no additional money should so far have been offered in a scheme of this magnitude in relation to this relatively small area.<lb/>
The Nature Conservancy Council are, as we well know, much concerned about the situation in which they feel that they have been placed. They were indeed brought into the working party but only as observers and not, I am informed, as full members. Should they wish to advise that grants be withheld under the IDP scheme, even though the position, as the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, has made clear, is not legally quite the same as under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, they will feel under very considerable moral pressure. They regard it, so they inform me, as being quite inequitable that under one scheme compensation grants should he inequitable that under the other one they should not. At present if they wish to undertake either additional work or to offer any kind of compensatory grants on environmental grounds they are to be expected to do it from their existing budget.<lb/>
However, it is quite obvious to anybody that if you are going to spend the money of the order that I have suggested in this relatively small area and on a relatively small number of people, there must be additional work involved. There should be adequate additional work to appraise the various developments, not only in the designated areas. This is bound to put extra work on the NCC staff, and I repeat that so far Her Majesty's Government have offered them no extra sustenance whatever but simply an indication that they might spend out of their existing budget, which is likely to be under considerable stress, under the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act if that is properly implemented.<lb/>
The European Communities' position is even worse because they, after all, are the instigators of the integrated development programmes. But the funds that they make available, generous as they are in many respects, are very strictly confined to agricultural structures and socio-economic functions. They have indicated quite clearly that so far as the Integrated Development Programme is concerned there is no money whatever available for environmental protection or improvement under the terms of the programme, in spite of the programme's references to the obligations to consider these factors. The environment directorate, DG XI, in Brussels in this particular sphere has no real influence over the agricultural directorate, DG VI. There is no EEC environment fund on which to draw as there is a regional fund and
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0079"/>
<col>141</col>
a social fund. A pilot scheme to monitor results of this programme <i>ex post facto</i>, is all that DG XI, the environment directorate, can offer. It is not quite "thank you for nothing", but it is very near to it.<lb/>
So, as chairman of the Select Committee appointed by your Lordships to scrutinise Community action, I conclude by saying as emphatically as I can that the United Kingdom representatives in Brussels should actively seek to remove the legalistic hindrances in this scheme and help to ensure that proper provision is made for some reasonable environmental input into these otherwise desirable integrated programmes. At present the scales are tilted quite unfairly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00860">4.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00861"><member>Lord Craigton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I put my name down to speak in this debate but unfortunately, by a clerical error, it was not included. I have asked to speak in this debate early because I have to go to another very longstanding appointment and I am speaking, with your Lordships' leave, by courtesy of my noble friend Lord Onslow. I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, in what he said. The noble Baroness, Lady White, referred to the Integrated Development Programme and quoted from it. It seems to me the merits of Lord Melchett's case are expressed in the plan in this way:
<quote>"&#x2026; the Western Isles is part of a priority biogeographical province (the Scottish Highlands and Islands) requiring extra protection on account of its global ecological importance in relation to existing measures of protection."</quote>
In harmony with that clear statement from the Minister is EEC Regulation Article 3.1 which requires the Government to ensure that the IDP is compatible with the protection of the environment.<lb/>
What does the IDP, the instrument, say, about carrying out the policy of Her Majesty's Government and the EEC Regulation? The IDP is silent&#x2014;it is quite incredible!&#x2014;on the need so vital here to protect the environment. It gives 85 per cent. grant. What for, my Lords? Re-seeding, drainage and fertilisers. But the 85 per cent. might well be for damaging the scientific interest of the area, for threatening the corncrakes and the waders dependent on wet pastures. This is, to say the least, misleading for the potential customers for grant because a quite vital consideration in receiving grant is that referred to in the Minister's own document. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said, many occupiers, if they knew the danger, would, I am sure, have too much regard for Scotland's interests to apply for particular grants. But are they given any guidance at all here? The answer is, no. Ought they to be? The answer is, they should have been.<lb/>
There is one other point. Chapter 10 of the programme raises another important point and I should like the assurance of the Government that we will get their co-operation. Paragraph 10(3) emphasises that the assessment of environmental needs should be considered early&#x2014;and I underline "early" and not,
<quote>"at an advanced stage in the planning process".</quote>
It refers in paragraph 10(7) to the machair as,
<quote>"a unique, fragile biologically important ecosystem",</quote>
and that a need for change should be carefully considered to be sure,
<col>142</col>
<quote>"that severe or irreversible damage to the machair is not being exchanged for a mere ephemeral or short-term benefit".</quote>
That is the Minister's own statement.<lb/>
My Lords, what are we discussing? It is putting money&#x2014;some of the taxpayers' money&#x2014;into possibly some of the poorest farming land in Britain, and that at the risk of endangering an area that is a unique wildlife sanctuary that already brings visitors. Properly nurtured it would bring more visitors and, if properly looked after, in a few years' time would be a source of pride and prosperity to Scotland. I believe the NCC is short of money to carry out the obligations placed on it by Parliament, but is it really necessary for we conservationists to let this vital protection be endangered because we are sorry for the NCC? Should we not say to the Government of this country, "We will not stand for this particular risk being taken"? That is all I am talking about&#x2014;the risk being taken. It is up to you to ensure that this is not done. This is going to cost money. To pay for the essential pregrant-making investigation&#x2014;and this is all we are asking for&#x2014;in Chapter 10 the programme requires &#x00A3;50,000 for the NCC in a five-year period. I may be wrong, but I understand that the Secretary of State and the Department of the Environment have increased this sum to &#x00A3;60,000. I doubt whether that is enough, but all I would ask the Minister to do is to give the House an assurance now that if this amount for preinvestigation is insufficient to do the job properly, as recommended in his own proposals, more money will be provided.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00863"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of the benefits of joining the EEC was the multinational approach to the deprived social regions of the member states, of which the Western Isles are a perfect example. Therefore I hope it is not too presumptuous for a lowland Englishman to congratulate the Scottish Office on 95 per cent. of their achievement. But of course there are <i>caveats</i>. The first is the historical one; lots of people from the clearance Dukes of Sutherland, through Lord Leverhulme, to the Highland and Islands Development Board have chucked money at the Highlands and have seen not one penny (or very little of it) returned. Sometimes great hopes have been raised, jobs have been created; and then industries and schemes have gone bust, with the equivalent disappointments involved. The other <i>caveat</i> obviously concerns the environment, and I think this is really what we are all talking about today. The environment fear concerns the SSSIs and the bird population and the general appearance of the countryside.<lb/>
Various factors, land holding among them, have resulted in traditional farming methods being carried on on the machair and on the inlies. The turf, which supports a wide selection of wild flowers, is still much in evidence. Are we sure that ploughing it and planting it with modern grasses and making silage will be really profitable either to the crofters themselves or to the community, if by so doing their income from tourism is decreased because of a decline of our much talked about friend, the corncrake, which, some of your Lordships may he aware, has practically gone from the mainland of Britain? Perhaps the Scottish Office would find it more beneficial to subsidise the ferries, both air and sea, to a much greater extent than at
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0080"/>
<col>143</col>
present. Therefore the net price obtainable for crofters' beasts&#x2014;admittedly they sell in the autumn&#x2014;would he much better for them than the increased price and also the increased numbers obtained by silage, <i>et cetera</i>, and still very expensive ferry to the mainland.<lb/>
The worry that some of us have concerns the &#x00A3;3.4 million to he spent on land improvement. This will result, as I have said, in the reseeding and the removal of iris beds and the lowering of water tables, resulting in a reduction in the size of the lochans, and the consequential threat to the large wader nesting sites, improvement of the dry machair so that the traditional pattern of fallow and small field pattern is lost.<lb/>
The IDP envisages the improvement of 20 per cent. of the machair and 50 per cent. of the inbye land. This does clash a little with ministerial statements that no "large-scale improvements" will he brought about. The sum of several small-scale improvements adds up, I suggest, to a large-scale improvement. I realise that it is difficult to criticise from a lowland farm Government efforts which are essentially correct, generous-minded and socially just; but as the Government, in paragraph 10.7 of the ID programme, say themselves:
<quote>"The conservation of this unique, fragile&#x2014;"</quote>
and the reason I am quoting this following what the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, said, is that I want to emphasise the word "fragile"&#x2014;
<quote>"and biologically important ecosystem depends upon sympathetic management".</quote>
These <i>caveats</i> must he aired. Article 4 of the EEC Directive 79/409 on birds requires habitat protection measures to be taken for certain rare species, including the 15 found in the Western Islands. No mention is made of this in the IDP.<lb/>
A cost-benefit analysis of the improvements has not been carried out because Ministers are aware they would not be cost-beneficial. As I said earlier, it is for social reasons that the money is to he provided, and we all recognise that social reasons are very important in this context. We all recognise, as did the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, how essential it is for a man to have the standing to be able to work and earn his living in the home and in the place where he was born and reared. It is hard for us here to criticise anything that is going to produce money for that, even though I think it is possible to suggest that some of that money could he spent in better ways.<lb/>
Can the Minister confirm that Section 32 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act requires landowners whose grant has been withheld after a rejection by the NCC to the improvement of an SSSI to be offered a management agreement and that section is being waived on the grounds that because it is not a grant given as a Ministry grant but one given under the European scheme, therefore the obligation to offer a management agreement is not still on the NCC? If that is the case, all the arguments several of us had during the passage of the Wildlife and Countryside Act for changing "shall" to "may" in Section 32 will now be stood on their heads by the Ministers who themselves argued against them. It will be quite amusing and interesting in terms of political semantics to see whether that is the case.</membercontribution></p>
<col>144</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00864"><member>Lord Stanley of Alderley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to intervene. Is he saying that he wants "shall" rather than "may" now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00865"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: No, My Lords, I did not say that. I said that is what the law says. If Ministers are then going to say: "We agreed that 'shall' should be the case last year but now, just because it is convenient to us we are not going to give enough money to the NCC to allow them to offer management agreements", that is exactly what we said would happen, and we are now being proved right even earlier than we thought would be the case. There is nothing more smugly satisfying than to he able to say, "I told you so". It is also quite probably the most irritating thing for the people to whom you are saving it.<lb/>
Furthermore, if this is the case, what will be most unfair is that the islanders themselves will feel prejudiced against. Now we have got the "shall" argument, "shall" it shall he and "may" it may not be. Surely if the cost-benefit is so definitely not in favour of this improvement, then the money could just as well he used for management agreements, together with the improvement of piers and roads envisaged in the IDP and further subsidies to both air and sea ferries, and the social gain which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, rightly talked about would be achieved and the environmental damage would be limited. After all, a recent paper by Mr. Dalton, published by the North of Scotland College of Agriculture concludes:
<quote>"It is highly unlikely that the crofting sector can absorb a great deal more capital profitably either from the viewpoint of the whole economy or of the individual crofter".</quote>
Therefore I would suggest that the net return to a crofter will be increased more by management agreements and cheaper ferries than by too much improvement, and at a greater benefit to the fragile environment and its enormously high nesting density of waders&#x2014;all these corncrakes and all the habitat, which I suggest is not only the heritage of the Western Islands but the heritage of us all, which is so important.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00867"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is much to respect in the ideas of my noble friend Lord Melchett, although many of them I disagree with; but I think we are all very grateful to him for raising this topic today because I think your Lordships will agree that it has developed slightly wider than he probably thought. I think that is a good thing because this is a subject of great importance, particularly to the West of Scotland and the Western Isles themselves.<lb/>
We all know how beautiful the Western Isles are, but I think that that beauty is marred when one looks at the derelict crofts and the derelict areas of land where people lived, worked and made their living in the past. These areas have now, in many cases&#x2014;we are talking about tens of thousands of acres&#x2014;almost gone back to nature again and are useless agriculturally, which spoils the environment more than anything else. The noble Baroness, Lady Elliot, mentioned the trip we had together in Bavaria and southern Italy, and the improvement in the housing and the buildings there. I thought of what such an improvement could do to western Scotland and the Western Isles. Drainage,
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0081"/>
<col>145</col>
lining <i>et cetera</i> can improve the pastures and after all, it is a pasture area&#x2014;although some crops can be grown&#x2014;producing store sheep and store cattle. If that were done, it would help the environment and would certainly not hinder it. The noble Lord, Lord Craigton, said that there was no mention of the environment in the brochure, but I should like to correct him, because on the second last page of this brochure, at the bottom, is mentioned the environment and its importance. So I think that he made a mistake in saying that it was not mentioned&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00868"><member>Lord Craigton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I referred to the IDP itself&#x2014;the official document, not the brochure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00869"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this document is what is going out to the people in question and it is mentioned there. In the general picture of people who are very environmentally orientated, there is always this term, "destroy the environment". But you do not destroy the environment by schemes such as this: you change the environment. I should like to emphasise that. In my opinion, a scheme such as this for the Western Isles will change the environment only for the better. But using this term "destroy the environment" is all wrong.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady White, quoted the <i>Stornoway Gazette</i>. I should like to quote what I think is a much better paper for the Highlands&#x2014;the <i>West Highlands Free Press</i>. I know that there is a bias against some of your Lordships who live there, and that it is left-wing orientated, but it is widely read and I think that many lairds in the Highlands read it with great avidity. I get it regularly and it keeps me in touch with that area. I should like to quote from an article by Mr. Charles Pickup. It is a very good article on the subject and it is headed "Defusing the 'conservation vs. IDP' row". I should like to quote one paragraph and ask the noble Baroness to think about it:
<quote>My own research has shown that inbye reseeding treatment can enrich the wildlife of the moorland grazings. Similarly a resucitation of croftland between the machair and the moors could be of benefit to the birds. In many areas land which once was cultivated has degenerated into rushy sheep pasture which is of little use agriculturally and of little interest to the conservationist. With more arable cultivation and grass production for hay or silage in this zone a greater variety of wildlife habitats will be created.</quote>
<quote>"A visit to any of the offshore islands around North Uist will show that where arable cultivation has ceased the diversity of birds and flowers is reduced. A revival of cultivation in similar derelict areas will undoubtedly benefit some of the specialities of the machair wildlife".</quote>
He goes on:
<quote>"The corncrake is a case in point."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00870"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have read this article as well and, equally, am fond of the <i>Western Highlands Free Press</i>, no doubt for much the same reasons as my noble friend. We have enemies in common with them. But that article which he quoted explicitly excludes the area that I am concerned about, which is the wet machair. It, talked about the moorland and derelict inbye land, but I made a great deal of play in what I had to say about the fact that it is the 1,000 hectares of wet machair which is the major concern of nature conservationists. What my noble friend has read out does not impinge on that at all.</membercontribution></p>
<col>146</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00871"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to start to quote again, but the last sentence states:
<quote>"A revival of cultivation in similar derelict areas will undoubtedly benefit some of the specialities of the machair wildlife".</quote>
So the author does mention that area and, as I said, he says that the corncrake is a case in point. I know there is great regret at the passing of the corncrake in most areas of the United Kingdom, although my wife assures me that she heard one in Essex last summer. I am not sure how accurate that may be, but that is what she said. So I make that point that Mr. Pickup makes.<lb/>
There is the same experience in forestry. When new forests have been planted all over Britain, the wildlife is far in excess of what it was before. This has been proved time and time again, but most people refuse to believe it. As most people know, private forestry owners and the Forestry Commission have wildlife people looking after enormous varieties of wildlife that have come into the forests because of the change in the environment. There has been a lot of detailed criticism of some schemes, particularly of the cleaning of ditches and the redraining of the 1,000 hectares of machair land. This is only 20 per cent. of the total machair land. No doubt it is quite a large area, since it is 1,000 hectares, but I cannot help thinking that the article which I have just read out is right and that helping this land to be better agriculturally will help not only agriculture, but the wildlife as well.<lb/>
I know that one point that is made about draining this land is that you lower the water table, but I think that they have had only one drought year, which is this one. The Western Highlands is not well-known for its droughts. But in these flat areas, with new drains, the water table can be controlled with sluices <i>et cetera</i>, and I see no objection to that. One thing that is certain is that you will not grow crops of good grass or anything else on wet land that has to be drained.<lb/>
There has been criticism that the Nature Conservancy Council will not be paid for their assessment work out of the funds that are to come from elsewhere. I think that this principle has been agreed before. The NCC has work to do and it has to get it from the Department of the Environment and not from the Ministry of Agriculture. My noble friend laughs, but that is the case, and he will need to press the Secretary of State for the Environment if he wants the money for an assessment service, which is quite important.<lb/>
Another point&#x2014;and I am very surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot, did not raise it&#x2014;is that, if environmental considerations are given precedence over agricultural ones, there will be a deal of frustration in getting schemes completed. There is nothing worse in planning a scheme than having an NCC officer breathing down your neck all the time. I have had to do with many schemes where people have just given up, saying: "I can't be bothered if this is what is going on". So one has to be very careful in pressing the environmental lobby too hard on agriculturalists, if you are going in for these schemes.<lb/>
Finally&#x2014;and I am going fairly wide now&#x2014;why, in this era of surpluses,' particularly in Europe, should we produce more food under expensive and difficult conditions, as there are in the Highlands? Last week, we had a short debate on the question of bringing 89,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter to a surplus butter area in this country. The point was made very
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0082"/>
<col>147</col>
strongly that the help which New Zealand gave us in two world wars warranted seeing that they had precedence over the surplus in this country. But I understand that, man for man, the West of Scotland and the Highlands of Scotland provided more men in the two world wars than any other part of the country. So if precedence is being given to New Zealand on that basis, then why should the Western Highlands of Scotland not produce what they can produce, which it can be argued is also in surplus&#x2014;sheepmeat and, to a certain extent, beef? I understand that, in some areas of Scotland, store cattle are scarce this year and are likely to be more scarce, because the beef herd has been going down year after year. So I do not think that there is a surplus.<lb/>
But that is not all. I do not know how many noble Lords listen to "Thought for the Day". This morning a very nice, much travelled vicar quoted the World Bank as saying that 700 million people are badly fed, that there is malnutrition among them and that probably half of them are starving. He said the World Bank had made a conservative estimate and that probably 1,000 million people rather than 700 million are starving. If that is the case, there is no surplus of food in the world. There is a lack of will and knowhow in getting food to these people. I do not think that the argument about food being expensive to produce in these areas should carry any weight at all.<lb/>
I said earlier that what are important are people, the land and the environment. Therefore I suggest that this scheme should go on. Do not hinder it by putting forward environmental considerations. Although they must be taken into account, do not hinder the scheme.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00873"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join other speakers in my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, for enabling this debate to take place. He is not proposing that there should be a vote to reject the regulations, but this debate gives us an opportunity to discuss them. I think there is anxiety throughout the country&#x2014;there certainly is in Scotland&#x2014;about this plan. As it is an integrated development programme which might be the precursor of others, it is important that we should look at it carefully.<lb/>
It brings a very large contribution from the EEC. For the &#x00A3;20 million over five years to be spent on agriculture, forestry and fishing there is a 40 per cent. contribution from the Community. That part of the programme which is of concern to those who are worried about damage to the environment is the land improvement part. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has been taking the lead because of the threat which it sees to birds. But to the Royal Society and to others it is less than 10 per cent. of this programme which is of concern.<lb/>
At the outset, I should like to make clear my own views on the present situation. I believe that to stop or seriously delay the IDP would be folly. I believe that the Western Isles have the highest unemployment in the country. It is over 30 per cent. The resources there are few and the opportunities are limited because of their remoteness. Of the possibly endangered species in the area, the most important is the Hebridean crofter. In other words, I would remind the most ardent conservationists&#x2014;I hope I shall not be taking
<col>148</col>
my life in my hands by saying this&#x2014;that people are more important than birds. Provided that this IDP is not rejected or discarded, there need not be a conflict. There need be no conflict between people and birds. But if the IDP were to be rejected or very seriously delayed, I believe that people would suffer.<lb/>
So far as the Government are concerned, they cannot afford to ignore safeguards for flora and fauna. Any administration which was responsible for the extinction or the near extinction of a rare bird would have a lot to answer for to the electorate of this country. Under the EEC scheme, the Government have to give an assurance that the IDP will not damage the environment. It is not clear, however, that they have taken the steps necessary to protect the environment. The area of concern is a strip running down the West Coast of the Isles. It consists of that unusual land surface, the machair. It is only to be found in a few other places in the United Kingdom. It is, of course, formed by shell sand being blown over sand dunes and spread over peat. Also, in the language of crofting tenure, there is the "inbye" land, mostly adjoining the machair. Together they form a habitat for particular birds and for rare and interesting flowers and plants. It is accepted in the IDP, on the subject of the scientific importance of machair, that:
<quote>"The conservation of this unique, fragile and biologically important eco-system depends upon sympathetic management".</quote>
Unless my noble friend can explain them today, there appear to be no visibly dependable provisions for monitoring, for safeguarding particular sites, or for compensation if it is clear that a crofter should not carry out work under the IDP for essential reasons of conservation. The machair and the inbye land support a high percentage of the total United Kingdom populations of certain waders and the corncrake. If care is taken and if special measures are adopted, the IDP need not decimate them. I hope that it is not too late to include the provisions needed.<lb/>
I have had a little experience of such situations. I am known to be, and have been since a teenager, a birdman in Northern Scotland, but I have also had to deal with similar situations as a Minister. About 10 years ago there were the planning applications for platform building sites at Nigg Bay and Ardersier, which cover a large area of shore and which were immediately recognised by all those concerned with birds as a threat to certain shore birds. There was understandable anxiety, but it was also important to avoid the necessity of public inquiries. I am glad to say that not only in those two cases but also in the case of Flotta, which has become a terminal in Orkney, those who had put forward reasoned objections were satisfied when we were able to provide suggestions by which the threatened species would be able to continue without disturbance. Otherwise, the first oil flow from the Forties Field would have been up to two years later. Also, the Piper Field would have been much delayed as a result of a Flotta public inquiry, had there been one.<lb/>
I understand that there is some rigidity in the financial boundaries between the funds which can be spent on agriculture and the funds available for protecting the environment. That is not only in this country but also in the EEC schemes. I should like to ask my noble friend Lord Mansfield when he comes to reply to
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0083"/>
<col>149</col>
say whether it is correct that money for the protection of the environment cannot be produced from the agricultural funds of the EEC and that only agricultural funds are available&#x2014;this &#x00A3;20 million to be spent over five years. I understand also that the Nature Conservancy Council have been attending the meetings on this programme. May I ask my noble friend whether it is true that the NCC are prepared to offer a management agreement where any farm capital grant is rejected on conservation grounds, and that such an offer would be made to any crofter in that area who was in that situation. For this purpose, is an IDP grant a farm capital grant? If there is not some scheme like that to which the Nature Conservancy Council are committed, it seems that any crofters in that situation would be treated less favourably than farmers anywhere else in the country. That surely cannot be the intention of the Government.<lb/>
I wrote to my noble friend at the beginning of this month and raised some of these points. I hope that this evening he can give us the assurances which are needed, or tell us that action is being taken to cover these points. The IDP should go ahead. I do not think anybody has spoken against it, but the essential safeguards for the survival and maintenance of certain species must be seen to be accompanying it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00875"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is rash for an East Anglian farmer, albeit one who has a lifelong interest in the rural scene and in conservation, to enter into a discussion which is so very close to the hearts of those living in the North-West of Scotland. I do so only because, towards the end of July, I attended a meeting chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, where the dangers posed to wildlife by this particular project under discussion were raised. It struck me then that a very strong case had been made out for some drastic alteration in the proposals. Therefore, when I was in that part of the world, I made a special expedition to Lewis and Harris in order to find out in a short while what I could about the scheme. I was very fortunate in being able to spend a whole day with the man responsible for the project and his assistant and the latter part of the day with a representative of the Nature Conservancy Council.<lb/>
It was as a result of that that I prepared the report to which the noble Baroness, Lady White (I am sorry she is not in her place now) referred as being somewhat "sugary". I am not quite sure what she meant by that. I gathered she thought that the report did not emphasise the conflicts that appear so apparent to us in this Chamber listening to this debate. I did not emphasise them, because in my opinion they were not there. I would much rather have a small amount of natural sugar on the report than a rather larger amount of synthetic salt rubbed into wounds which exist only at some distance from those islands which are directly concerned in this project. While I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, there is a danger that harm can be done to this enormously important, valuable and imaginative project by giving the impression by what is said here and in other places south of the border that there is a head-on conflict between those who are interested in agriculture, those who are interested in wildlife, those who are interested in
<col>150</col>
people, and those who are interested in birds. I do not believe that any of your Lordships who went to those islands today would feel that was the case at all.<lb/>
Let me quote, in the first instance, from the pamphlet that has been produced for the information of crofters by the Integrated Development Programme.<lb/>
In one paragraph it states:
<quote>"The islands are of international importance to wildlife, flora and fauna. In drawing up plans for projects, proper consideration must be given to the need to protect the environment."</quote>
Elsewhere it states:
<quote>"Many parts of the Islands have been declared SSSIs and any scheme affecting an SSSI requires prior consultation with the Nature Conservancy Council."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00876"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00877"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: May I just finish the quotation, my Lords? It goes on:
<quote>"The project team will be able to advise you whether this applies to your scheme and if so, to arrange discussions with the NCC for you."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00878"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the second time that the actual leaflet describing the IDP for the people concerned has been quoted. It does seem a shame that the noble Lord did not read from the whole of the pamphlet; he jumped from the pamphlet to another piece of paper.<lb/>
The paragraph in the pamphlet goes on to say:
<quote>"For developments within national nature reserves of SSSIs the Nature Conservancy Council must be consulted."</quote>
One of the criticisms I have is this is far too restrictive. As I and others have made clear, the nature conservation interests in the Western Isles goes beyond the NNRs and SSSIs. It is misleading, as far as this country's international obligations to wild birds have been concerned, to say that it is only in those restricted areas that the NCC should be consulted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00879"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would have continued and will continue to deal with the point which the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, has just raised. I quoted those two sentences only to show that those responsible for the IDP are fully aware of the environmental implications of the scheme and that they are not simply tough agriculturalists interested only in producing more and better grass, higher quality silage, and better beef and sheep. They are people who are aware of the total implications of the environment and of the enormous importance to the other isles of the flora and fauna which exist today.<lb/>
In fact, the agricultural side of the organisation said to me personally that their objective was to improve the total life of the islands. They fully realise that tourism in its widest sense was an important part; the tourists not being the conventional type of Brighton or Blackpool tourist, but tourists who went there to enjoy and sometimes study the wildlife. Anything which detracted from that would be defeating the purposes which they had in mind. I assure your Lordships that they are very much aware of this.<lb/>
Furthermore, the personal relationships between them and the NCC appear to me to be extremely close. They both assured me, in the presence of each other, that they had no doubt that they could reach happy
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0084"/>
<col>151</col>
agreement on at least 95 per cent. of the projects which were likely to be proposed, and that the only sources of conflict might be a maximum of 5 per cent. I think the noble Lord agrees with me there. Let me reiterate the point that there is close collaboration and understanding between the agricultural side and the nature conservancy side in the islands itself. Any idea of confrontation between them is extremely misleading.<lb/>
In passing. I would like to make two points&#x2014;both of which, in a manner of speaking, have already been raised. One concerns the corncrakes, which I was assured were diminishing up there because of the diminution in the animal acreage. If this scheme, as seems probable, is going to enable a rather greater acreage of oats to be grown; it would have an advantageous effect on the corncrake. As the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, so rightly pointed out, one must not look at any change in agricultural practice as being the destruction of the environment; it will be a change, and sometimes a change may be better from the environmental point of view.<lb/>
The other slightly less serious point I would direct to the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, concerns the point he made about the correct time for cutting silage and the desirability of persuading crofters to cut their silage after certain birds have nested and hatched. I would remind the noble Lord that one of the causes of the French Revolution was the fact that the <i>Seigneur</i> forbade his peasants to cut the hay when it was at its best, because it would disturb the nesting partridges; the peasants had to wait until the partridges hatched and flew away before they were allowed to cut their hay, when it was far past its prime. This was not the basic, original or main cause of the French Revolution, but it was undoubtedly a contributory cause and it would be unfortunate if anything of that sort were to operate&#x2014;even in the remote Western Isles.<lb/>
There is nothing much that I can add to what has already been said. The scheme is an admirable one. It is an extremely expensive one and it could be queried on the grounds, possibly, that &#x00A3;55 million or &#x00A3;56 million for the benefit of a relatively small number of people is not the most efficient use of funds&#x2014;but that is not what we are discussing today. I am delighted that it is to be done because I believe that the contribution which the Western Isles can make in a whole range of respects, including the provision of a very fine group of people, is something on which we cannot turn our backs.<lb/>
I agree with those noble Lords who have urged upon the Goverment&#x2014;and I hope our voices will have some effect on the Government&#x2014;that where, in some of those 5 per cent. of cases to which I have referred, there is going to he a prohibition on the implementation of the agricultural side of the plan, money will be made available to the NCC in order to implement the management agreements. It will not be a very large sum; it will probably be little, if any, more than the actual amount that would have been spent on the capital improvements. So the amount of money involved is minimal, the benefit to be obtained, from the environmental point of view and the goodwill point of view, is enormous. I hope the noble Earl will be able to give us some encouragement in this respect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00881"><member>Lord Sandford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome this debate, and I welcome very much the decision of the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, not to press his Prayer against this project. I welcome the project itself; in fact I was welcoming it over three years ago when the concept first appeared from Brussels and at the time I was chairing a sub-committee of your Lordships' Select Committee on European Affairs, on rural policy. But I have to say that, whereas then we held out high hopes of this project. I must express my disappointment that we have not achieved more. My disappointment arises from three causes: first of all, that the EEC Commission in Brussels have still not found a way of assigning funds from the Social Fund or the Regional Development Fund, still less from the Environmental Fund, in order to balance the funds that are assigned from agriculture, without which balance it is not really reasonable to call this an integrated development project. My disappointment also arises from the fact that the conservation element has not been adequately built into the project as a whole, and we have heard enough about that already this afternoon. There is recognition in Chapter 8 that, because no one can reasonably he expected to earn a comparable income&#x2014;to use the EEC term&#x2014;from agriculture alone, it is necessary to create other enterprises associated with or outside agriculture. But this whole matter has been most cursorily dealt with&#x2014;there are just a few platitudes in Chapter 8 and no more; without those being properly developed we really are not justified in calling this more than a major piece of agricultural extension, but of course it is welcome for that alone.<lb/>
If the EEC and the Scottish agencies listed in the project are not able to do better than this after three years. I think we have to look elsewhere in order to make progress in this whole important business of integrated rural development. I believe we can find some hope of making some progress from two or three sources. First of all, the EEC themselves have decided that in order to make more progress in this field it will he necessary to have some more research done into how integrated rural development is being tackled throughout the Community. I am glad to say that they invited proposals for such research at the end of 1980 and 10 or 20 such projects, four of them this country, are now proceeding. I have here the results of one of them carried out by the Rural Planning Research Trust in the district of Radnor in mid-Wales, in the less favoured areas, which is illuminating, but it shows that the funding going to that area through the Less Favoured Areas Directive is extremely wastefully, inefficiently and extravagantly applied, and that we are still throwing money at this problem and not really dealing with it.<lb/>
The other area which we can look to now for some prospect of an improvement is the policy which Parliament approved in, I think it was, July or October of 1980, some two years ago: the new system for administering farm capital grants in sensitive areas such as national parks and sites of special scientific interest. I would, if I may, read an extract on this topic from the annual report of the Dartmoor National Park which has just come to my hands. Your Lordships will recall that the arrangement come to in July 1980 in the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0085"/>
<col>153</col>
statutory instrument that brought this new system into force was that in these areas individual farmers had to take such of their proposals as they hoped to get grant for to the national park authority to see that they matched and corresponded with the conservation policies in force in the area.<lb/>
Reviewing that process over the past year, I read as follows from the report of the National Park Authority for Dartmoor:
<quote>"Agricultural grant notifications are rapidly becoming the most time-consuming as well as the most important single operation within the Department".</quote>
Then it goes on:
<quote>"Over the whole year decisions were made on 248 notifications. Most of these involved several agricultural operations and many were for very substantial proposals. The value of the system lies not just in the opportunity which it affords the National Park Authority to object to damaging proposals and possibly prevent their execution &#x2026;"&#x2014;</quote>
and this is the important point
<quote>"in fact over the whole year there were only two outright objections to the 240 proposals put in".</quote>
That is 99 per cent., not 95 per cent. as the noble Lord, Lord Walston, was suggesting there would be.
<quote>"More it lies in the creation of an opportunity for negotiation. A large number of submitted proposals from farmers are modified prior to the National Park Authority giving its decision. Thirteen were approved subject to agreed conditions. Most important of all is the basis which it provides for contact and for discussion".</quote>
This strongly reinforces what the noble Lord, Lord Walston, was just saying. Then,
<quote>"National park staff begin to understand farming operations and farmers' values and aspirations, and farmers in turn come to associate the national park with a face rather than a bureacracy, hopefully with a face which is willing to listen and to understand and which also puts forward a supportable case for conservation which the farmer can respect and act upon".</quote>
There, I think, lies some hope for more satisfactorily reconciling the conflicts which are being apprehended.<lb/>
Since then, we have the Wildlife and Countryside Act, with Section 41 thereof&#x2014;alias the Sandford amendment&#x2014;in which on top of that requirement we have the statutory duty for ADAS and the Scottish equivalent to give advice to farmers on the conservation and enhancement of the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside, and&#x2014;and this is the second leg&#x2014;
<quote>"to advise such persons on diversification into other enterprises of benefit to the rural economy".</quote>
With the kind of process that I have just quoted to you from one of our national parks&#x2014;but I could quote the same thing from many other sensitive rural areas&#x2014;plus the additional responsibility of ADAS and the Scottish equivalent to give advice both on conservation and on diversification into other enterprises besides agriculture, I do think we see a way forward. I am disappointed that a policy and a large-scale development project such as the one we are debating has proved so relatively unsuccessful in achieving this integration. It will be a good project nevertheless. In the light of the last three years' experience, my hope is that we will look to progress, and particularly to ADAS to make progress by putting itself more firmly in a position to give advice to farmers on diversification and on conservation. That will enable the process I have just described for Dartmoor to become the norm and the common practice throughout our countryside.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00883"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I found the noble Lord's speech very encouraging. One or two noble Lords have been encouraging. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, eventually said that he thought that this would be all right and that he hoped the Government would take some small action, and so did my noble friend Lord Walston.<lb/>
We need not despair. The arguments in favour of doing something were put with the greatest clarity by the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, and he was supported in a great deal of detail by Lady White and others. I shall not go through those points again. I shall quickly take up one or two of the points that have been made and which I think should not be allowed to pass.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, surprised me by saying that he did not believe that ploughing up or re-seeding the machair would do any harm. I am sorry to disagree. I was president of the RSPB for five years and, although there may be a few fringe characters who are not altogether easy to deal with, basically it is a most serious body. The noble Earl on the Government Front Bench raised &#x00A3;1 million, so it is not a body to be ashamed of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00884"><member>Lord Home of the Hirsel</member><membercontribution>: Not as a noble Earl, I am afraid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00885"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry, I am out of date. It is a body of the most intensely active, accurate and careful workers. May I say to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, that if the RSPB experts suggest that something will do harm I would not be too quick to say that it will not.<lb/>
While we are on machairs generally, Lord John-Mackie made a comment which interested me. He said that one does not destroy the environment, one changes it. That is true. However, one does destroy a habitat. That is the point we are talking about. The habitat of the machair is 20 per cent. of all the machair available anywhere&#x2014;certainly round about&#x2014;and the 1,000 hectares which the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, particularly asked to be saved form a very large part of the total available environment for certain birds, of which the corncrake, we heard, is a very important one.<lb/>
The whole problem&#x2014;we spent hours in the Wildlife and Countryside Act discussing this&#x2014;of the environment against profitable farming is a very tricky one. There are many cases where one has to put up with the destruction of the environment or with damage to the environment for economic and personal reasons of the people concerned. This most desirable scheme will help people who have needed help for years and years. The crofters have always been, as far as I can see, left outside any reasonable assistance, although a great deal has been done in the past 30 years. Before that it was very bad indeed. They have always wanted help. They have only lived through help. It is entirely desirable that this scheme should go forward and do something about this area where, as my noble friend Lord Taylor said, there are fewer people all the time.<lb/>
As a population dies or diminishes, so conditions get worse. All that is true. The trouble with Lord Taylor's speech is that I agree with every word he said except his conclusions. He said that it is most important to see
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0086"/>
<col>155</col>
that the help gets there. Of course it is. But it is not most important that the last 2 or 3 per cent. of the &#x00A3;50 million talked about should get there. The position is that the approximate &#x00A3;50 million is the whole scheme, of which &#x00A3;20 million is agricultural, &#x00A3;3.4 million of it for machair and inbye land&#x2014;mostly the inbye land. The 1.000 hectares, by my reckoning and without doing an accurate calculation, would get under &#x00A3;500,000 or between &#x00A3;500,000 and &#x00A3;l million out of the &#x00A3;50 million.<lb/>
We are not saying that in every case where there is a conservation issue one must decide in favour of the birds or the deer or whatever it may be. We are saying that in this case, where a very good job is being done, if one does not do a very small part of it, one would go a long way towards saving a very important part of a rare and important habitat for birds.<lb/>
That seems to me quite different from what has been suggested. The conservationists want to stop the whole scheme. The noble Lords who have spoken on this side say they do not, and they want the schemes to go forward. However, it did not stop one or two people suggesting that they were against the whole scheme.<lb/>
That is as far as I want to go. I want the noble Earl on the Government Front Bench to say that if he cannot agree to help us over &#x00A3;3&#x00BD; million worth of the plan, which is for the inbye land and the machair land, that he will at least see what can be done about the 1,000 hectares. It is a very small concession for the conservationists of the world but it can easily be done. It would be inexpensive. There are money difficulties which the noble Lord, Lord Sandford, and others raised and I do not know how they will be met, but the amounts are small. However, it is an important point and I hope that we can obtain that small concession from this interesting debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00886">5.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00887"><member>Lord Home of the Hirsel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for not putting my name on the list of speakers, but I was not sure that I could be here. Perhaps I may make a comment or two.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, and I might both be accurately described as bird men. We would go a long way to preserve the corncrake, which is one of the most delightful of birds. I am not sure that I come to quite the same conclusions as he does, but we can see that later on. Perhaps the most valuable of the EEC's contributions to Scotland and the activities in Scotland has been the injection of additional capital into marginal land. Both my noble friend Baroness Elliot of Harwood and I have had first hand experience of this. The capital contributions from Europe have undoubtedly enabled us to hold the population on the hill land which would otherwise have left. That has been a prime objective of all Governments for as long as I can remember, but we have not been very successful up till now in arresting the depopulation of the hill lands. For the crofters of the Western Isles to lose &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;4 millions of cash, applied to a comparatively small area, would be a pretty grave loss. For the reasons given, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, I find myself unable to go along with Lord Melchett's Prayer&#x2014;cogently as he argued the case.<lb/>
<col>156</col>
There are certainly rare birds on the machair land and also rare plants. Perhaps the plants are almost more interesting than the birds. But the trouble with too many of these environmental cases is that, at any rate at the start, the conservationists ask for too much and the owners of the land concede too little. This is a case in which I seem to remember the noble Baroness, Lady White, said that we could not get the best of both worlds. But I think that we can. That is exactly what I believe we can do. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Walston, that we are apt to underestimate the common purpose of the Department of Agriculture, the local authorities and the farming community, including the crofters.<lb/>
Therefore, although I would like to hear the answers to the points raised in particular by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy about the possibility of safeguards and, for example, management arrangements, nevertheless I could not support the Prayer which is immediately before the House. However, as I say, I hope that this is one of the cases in which compromise and common sense will prevail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00888">5.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00889"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first I should like to congratulate my noble friend Lord Melchett on having raised this subject. It has enlightened many of your Lordships about the Western Isles. We do not have very many debates about the Western Isles and I hope that in future much more sympathetic attention will be paid to the needs of the Western Isles.<lb/>
My noble friend has raised an important point, and he has probably raised it at the right time. I think that it was the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who congratulated the Government on their achievement. Quite frankly, we have not achieved anything yet. The noble Lord, Lord Sandford&#x2014;if I can have his attention&#x2014;suggested that this was a failure. With all due respect, it is no failure because it has hardly begun&#x2014;indeed, it has not begun. That is why it is important to raise it now.<lb/>
There is no doubt at all that if there is any area in Britain that requires special treatment, it is the Western Isles. May I say to the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, that it is a place not where the population is declining, but where it was declining, and that decline was stopped by the efforts of the Scottish Office and the activities of Secretaries of State, among whom I was one. I set up the Highlands and Islands Development Board just because of the special conditions of that area, which has a proud past and which has proud people. They never call themselves poor; they are rich in many things. But if there is one thing in which they are rich, it is probably scepticism about what Governments say, about what Members of Parliament say and about what Members of this House say about their concern for them, about retaining the life there and then opposing something that may appear to be for their benefit.<lb/>
Let us look at the problem. People have said that they are quite happy about 95 per cent. of the programme, but not about 5 per cent., and that 5 per cent. comes down to &#x00A3;3.4 million in relation to land development. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, appreciates what has been done in recent years. We gave the crofters, for the first time, the statutory right to buy their crops, and that included the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0087"/>
<col>157</col>
inbye land. I think that there is probably more hope now of getting improvement because the crofters feel that they have a greater stake in it than they ever had before. But if you do not develop the inbye land, you will not be able to improve the stockholding capacity of the land, whether it be sheep, cattle or anything else. Therefore, it is not good enough to say, "We are concerned. Please do not do anything about the 10,000 hectares of inbye land"&#x2014;the noble Lord's argument is false there&#x2014;and then belittle the problem, saying that it is only this.<lb/>
There must be an assurance by the United Kingdom Government&#x2014;and in this case, of course, it is the Scottish Office&#x2014;that the actions envisaged are compatible with the protection of the environment. That surely must not give an absolute veto to conservationists. I do not think that they would expect to have it. But it gives them a voice to ensure that the administrative routines are adequate for this to he carried out and for, say, the NCC to do the job that it is set up to do. I have a feeling that, if the NCC had been the SNCC and they had all come under the Secretary of State, this debate would never have arisen, because when they all come under the one Minister I can assure your Lordships that there is a possibility of welding them together and getting the routines right.<lb/>
As regards the SSSIs&#x2014;I think that there are 35 of them&#x2014;as I understand it, it has been agreed that three months' notice will he given, and they are reasonably satisfied with that. They are not satisfied about the other areas which might he important but which are unscheduled. The point is that no project has yet started. Therefore, what my noble friend Lord Melchett has been putting forward are fears that arise because they are not satisfied with the administrative routines in the first instance and, in the second instance, as was emphasised by my noble friend Lady White, the actual funding in respect of one aspect of it from the point of view of the protection of the environment.<lb/>
I want the Minister to tell us what are the administrative routines, because we have not had a project yet, nothing has failed yet and nothing has yet been tried. We must be satisfied because, to a certain extent, I think that the fears may well be justified. I shall not say that all conservationists are reasonable men, but I do not want this scheme to fall down either through the deficiencies of the Scottish Office or the obsessions of certain people in the conservation area. Let the House know just exactly what this is.<lb/>
There is a suggestion in respect of outside the SSSIs that there will be two weeks' discussion. That might well not be enough. I want to see this programme go ahead. One of the difficulties about it&#x2014;and to this extent the noble Lord, Lord Sandford, was right&#x2014;is that we are not seeing the whole scheme. In fact, there is not a quarter of the scheme in what we are debating today. Anyone who spoke about great schemes for arable redevelopment and what will happen in the Western Isles should have read the regulations before us. In paragraph 4(<i>d</i>) under the heading "Comprehensive agricultural improvement" it is stated:
<quote>"the grant payable under this regulation shall not exceed the least of&#x2014;"</quote>
and then there is (i), (ii) and (iii); and (iii) is &#x00A3;3,000. We are dealing with small projects for small people and for
<col>158</col>
people who need help. Quite frankly&#x2014;and I see that the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, has gone; everyone who speaks in these debates seems to disappear very quickly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00890"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will give way, I have been asked to apologise on my noble friend's behalf, who omitted to give his apologies in advance that he could not attend the rest of the debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00891"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord will convey to his noble friend Lord Mackie my apologies for having mentioned his name, not knowing that he was going to apologise. He is always there, so I turned round with confidence thinking he would he there. The fears may well be real, and I think they can be dissipated.<lb/>
There is going to be disturbance of the ecology. I began to feel like a criminal when my noble friend was speaking. I can remember&#x2014;and I daresay that the same applies to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, as it would to the noble Lord, Lord Glenkinglas, if he had been here&#x2014;going to the Butt of Lewis and going through winding roads that I hope are going to be brought up to date as a result of this, and having pointed out to me with pride by the leader of a township a field on a hillside that had been reseeded. That emerald green stuck out from the stark darkness of the rest of that hillside. They were proud of it. Who did it? They did it themselves. Certainly they got money.<lb/>
I do not know what the confusion was. I was horrified to hear that a civil servant had been classified by my noble friend as rude. Then he went on to say that the civil servant had said that it had been done before. Of course, it had been done before. I had been doing it before; encouraging people to reseed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00892"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord give way?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00893"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I want to finish this very good story. Having got there and seen this and admired it, and seen the trouble there was to get it done, and learning it was the co-operation of the people of the township that had done it, I said; "Mr. Macleod, how did you do it?". He held up the biggest fist I had ever seen and said, "By persuasion!" Sometimes I think we need that kind of thing in this House. I hope our persuasion will be such that our fears, although they may be real, if we take the right action&#x2014;and that can come from the answer we get from the Scottish Office&#x2014;can be relatively groundless. We will change the ecology. But I think on balance we can change it for the better. There can be benefits from it. It is neglect that has produced some of the habitat, and you are not going to persuade me that we must continue to neglect people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00894"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I simply wanted to put the record straight. I would not have dreamt of criticising a civil servant in your Lordships' House for being rude or anything else. I was in fact criticising the Minister on the Front Bench opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0088"/>
<col>159</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00895"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Well, My Lords, I have not always said that he was the most gracious of Ministers, but the instance he quoted was about a civil servant saving to him that it had been done in the past, and I am saying that of course it had been done in the past. It is being done today under the less-favoured-area grants and under reseeding grants, and schemes like that.<lb/>
This is an important point because I want to ask the Minister how much money is being spent a year on these things that are being attacked today. Secondly, is this &#x00A3;3.4 million in respect of land development new money, or is just the 40 per cent. from the EEC new money, and in other words we are going to be doing not so very much more than we have been doing before?<lb/>
The third matter is the important point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady White. It is quite wrong, if you have got the best of routines for alerting people that there might be difficulty in respect of a highly difficult area from the conservation point of view, if the people who are supposed to be looking after protecting that and giving their advice on it have not got the staff to do it. It is one Government staffing the Scottish Office and also staffing the NCC. Therefore, it is up to them, having given them the task within the Wildlife and Countryside Bill and then given the pledge in Article 3 of the IDP, to ensure that they can do that job. That is important.<lb/>
Secondly, the question arises out of the compensation available for those who are refused development under the Wildlife and Countryside Bill. They get their compensation, and I understand it has been suggested that the decision has been taken at ministerial level that no compensation will be paid to a crofter. I think it is wrong. Mind you, who is going to pay the compensation? It is the British Government, through an agency to whom they are probably denying the money. We are in this cleft stick. That has nothing to do with the IDP; these are the consequences of the IDP, and the Government have to face up to them. I congratulate the noble Lord for having raised this important debate&#x2014;and given me a chance of being hoarse for the rest of the week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00896">5.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00897"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had an important debate about a matter of considerable interest to the Members of your Lordships' House, and it is also of vital concern to the people of the Western Isles. I have listened carefully to everything that has been said. I do not agree with it all, but nevertheless much valuable ground has been covered. I shall try to answer as many of the points as I can now, but if I do not or cannot then I shall write to those noble Lords to whom I am not able to respond on this occasion.<lb/>
The integrated development programme represents a determined attempt to improve the economy of one of the most remote and disadvantaged communities in Britain; that is to say, the Western Islands of Scotland. As my noble friend Lady Elliot said, this IDP is one of three pilot programmes which were authorised by the European Commission. As she again said, the others are in the Loz&#x00E8;re province of France and in the Luxembourg province of Belgium. The three areas obviously differ in many ways, but they show an important feature. The backbone of their economy is
<col>160</col>
agriculture, but agriculture alone cannot provide the population with a decent standard of living.<lb/>
The very name integrated development programme has been the cause of a number of misconceptions and misunderstandings, and certainly the programme which has eventually emerged with the blessing of the Council of Ministers is very different in character from the original integrated development programme which emanated from the Commission. The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, quoted Sir Ralph Verney as saying that the programme is integrated in name only. I do not altogether agree with that although I understand Sir Ralph's reasons for holding the view that he does, or did.<lb/>
The programme covers a huge range of matters from such things as water and sewage treatment which we have not discussed this afternoon, to the production of Harris tweed, which I do not think we have covered either; and of course it is true that, as some people have said, the &#x00A3;36 million which is to be spent on the infrastructure as opposed to the agricultural part of this, or the tourism and those parts, would have been spent eventually anyway. I suppose a lot of the work would have been done, some of it most certainly would not, but the important part of the programme is the bringing together of all this vast range of measures into one programme.<lb/>
This will, and indeed already has, given the islanders a great new hope and encouragement. The noble Lord, Lord Ross, said that you cannot say it is a success or a failure yet because nothing has happened. But in fact the project team has been appointed. The people engaged on it have been giving lectures all over the Western Isles to tell people how they can take advantage of the scheme, and a great deal of enthusiasm has already arisen and a measure of hope has been raised. One must not lose sight of the serious economic condition of the people to whom this programme is directed, and it will be of enormous benefit.<lb/>
We have heard about the very poor quality of the land, most of which is rock and hog. Only a tiny proportion is fit for any form of arable treatment. The entire amount of land which can grow cereals&#x2014;I do not say this as a debating point but as a point of realism&#x2014;is less than one large East Anglian, or indeed East Scottish, farm. The people have an ageing population. There are under 30,000 of them, and at the same time they have one of the highest unemployment rates in the United Kingdom, of over 30 per cent. They have among the highest food prices, a very restricted range of activities and an even more restricted range of opportunities. One must admit that they have in many places a complete absence of the sort of amenities we take for granted in the more favoured parts of the United Kingdom. I have visited the islands on a number of occasions in the last three and a half years, particularly recently in connection with the IDP. I have seen the difficult conditions there and spoken to a wide range of people interested in or involved with the IDP.<lb/>
I have been attacked&#x2014;whether the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, attacked the officials of my department is no doubt a matter we shall learn in <i>Hansard</i> when we read it&#x2014;for being insensitive, obdurate and even downright rude, I think that word was used. At any rate, the Government agreed to produce an integrated development programme and I
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0089"/>
<col>161</col>
shall relate my part in it because I decided that it must concentrate, first, on measures likely to give the maximum benefit to the islanders; secondly, it must, so far as possible, build on what the crofters are already doing, which is farming and fishing; and thirdly, the effects of the environment must be taken into account. To those noble Lords who perhaps do not believe that the Government have been alive to environmental considerations, I refute that absolutely. We were alive to them from day one.<lb/>
In any event, I appointed a group of officials to work out the details of the IDP and all their meetings were attended by representatives of the Nature Conservancy Council. I attended one or two myself. The inclusion of NCC officials shows that we were aware right from the outset of the need to take conservation into account. Eventually, in the spring of this year, we submitted, for submission to Brussels, a programme which encompasses about &#x00A3;56 million of public expenditure over five years, of which &#x00A3;20 million is for agriculture and fisheries, as stipulated by the regulation.<lb/>
I shall not detain the House by rehearsing the details of the programme, copies of which are available in the Library, and a few noble Lords have in their possession the actual pamphlet which the customers, if that is the right word, can obtain. But I wish to make a few points about it. First, in many of the schemes, as has been correctly pointed out, the rates of support on offer are generally higher than at present. This exceptional level of Government assistance&#x2014;which will, of course, be available in the Western Isles only during the life of the programme&#x2014;is a clear indication of the importance we attach to it.<lb/>
Secondly, none of the land development and livestock improvement schemes is totally new; they are in fact improved versions of those which have been available under existing legislation for many years. It is some of the technical details that are different, and that is why the regulations which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made on 19th July are needed. The livestock and land improvement measures dependent on these regulations account for only about &#x00A3;6 million of the total package, but this part of the programme is one of the most important because although investment in agriculture alone will not solve the problems of the Western Isles, it would be nonsense to try to do so without improving the livestock and nutritional value of the land on which they depend.<lb/>
If Lord Melchett's Prayer were successful, in the sense that these regulations were annulled, the integrated development programme would, of course, be frustrated, but it would not prevent the local people from undertaking exactly the same operations, with rather less help from the public Exchequer, under existing grant schemes. However, I hope to show that if that were to happen, from a conservation point of view the outcome would be much less welcome, because the work would no longer be subject to scrutiny by the assessment service which we have set up.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, asked me about what I might call the way in which the scheme will operate. By arrangement with the local NCC staff, all projects which fall within certain categories (which have
<col>162</col>
themselves been selected by the NCC) will be referred by local Department of Agriculture for Scotland staff to the local NCC staff for their observations. The fortnight referred to by the noble Lord should be enough for all but the most complex cases. As he remarked, the vast majority of these schemes, certainly where individuals are promoting them, will be very small in scope. But if there is a complex case and it requires further consideration, more time will then he given. Therefore, there is no question of the proposals which an individual crofter may have for the amelioration of his particular farming conditions, as it were, slipping through without anybody who is either knowledgeable or interested in conservation matters, having the opportunity to comment.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy, if I heard him right&#x2014;if I did not, no doubt he will correct me&#x2014;said in effect that there was no system written into the scheme. But he will have looked at Chapter 10, and particularly at paragraph 4, and will have seen the very great care which is taken there so far as conservation is concerned. We come to the arguments which have been put up, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, against the scheme. I understand all too well his concern that land improvement can damage what I think can be described as a fragile eco-system. I cannot foretell the future. I cannot guarantee that on no occasion will it happen&#x2014;obviously I could give that guarantee&#x2014;but I think it is most unlikely because of the checks and balances we have put into the whole system.<lb/>
The statistics I have given show that there is no agricultural revolution which is about to happen in the Western Isles. In many cases, the programme seeks merely to restore traditional farming practices. I think we shall be content if the programme encourages crofters to work the machair land, formerly in productive agricultural use, but currently neglected, with choked drains and infestations of undesirable weeds. I do not think it would be right, even if we had the resources, to pay large sums to crofters in Lewis and the Uists not to farm their crofts. They should be encouraged, rather, to take advantage of the pump-priming which this programme offers so that they can help themselves in effect to combat their difficulties.<lb/>
I am very glad that even those who are concerned about the impact of the programme have not rejected its general aims. I have heard no credible economic or political alternative to it. The Scottish director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has made it quite clear that while his organisation has reservations about the land improvement measures on the machair land, it welcomes the objectives of the programme; and that was confirmed today by the noble Lord, Lord Melchett. I am sorry that previous debates outside this House have generated a great deal more heat than light. If he will forgive me for saying so, even the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, had a change of heart. When he gave evidence to the Agriculture Committee of another place on 20th May, he described the programme as "a complete disaster", before going on and answering a question from Mr. Miles and saying that he had never been to the Western Isles.<lb/>
I think that perhaps many people have moderated their view, because they have learnt about the area and in some cases have even visited it. I hope that the noble
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0090"/>
<col>163</col>
Lord will agree with me that in the Western Isles the link between man and his environment is particularly close.<lb/>
It has been said that the Integrated Development Programme will encourage in the Western Isles intensified agriculture of what has been described as the East Anglian type. I have never accused either the noble Lord, nor indeed the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, or any other of the bodies, of making such claims; and indeed the noble Lord has not made those charges. But very many people have written to me over the last few months. They have suggested that modern farming techniques, leading to what they describe as the East Anglian type cereal production, would be encouraged by the IDP. Anybody with even only the smallest knowledge of the area and of those who live in it will know that that is nonsense, and I was very pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, in effect to say words such as that this afternoon. However, crofting agriculture is one of the reasons why, ecologically speaking, the Western Isles is such an interesting place. The present character of the machair land in particular is partly due to the generations of crofters who have worked it. The programme will help them to continue to do so.<lb/>
I want to come back to the Nature Conservancy Council. As I have explained, I look to the Nature Conservancy Council for advice. I have heard it suggested that the council is unhappy about the environmental aspects of the programme, but that is simply not so. One of the 11 chapters is entitled "Protection of the Environment", and that was written by the NCC. The council proposed an environmental assessment service which will operate, and which I have described. The NCC will be consulted about any proposed development which might constitute a significant threat to wildlife or their habitats, and I have described the processes by which we can identify such cases in time and try to secure a compromise between the needs of the local people and their environment. I believe that those arrangements will provide a greater safeguard for the environment than applies at present, or indeed will apply outside the Western Isles.<lb/>
Of course I understand that the council is concerned about the additional burden that the assessment service will place on its resources. The council itself estimated that it would cost about &#x00A3;60,000 over five years, and it would like that to be paid for either by my department or by the European Community. I am sorry to have to say that, try as we could to find it I am satisfied that there is no legal way in which the Farm Fund&#x2014;in other words, FEOGA, the only European fund to earmark money specifically for these programmes&#x2014;can pay for the environmental assessment service; and I do not think that it would be right for my department to do so.<lb/>
The main activities of the council are funded by a grant-in-aid, currently about &#x00A3;10 million a year, which is fixed by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. He and I take the view that the additional modest burden on the Nature Conservancy Council should be funded in precisely the same way as its other management work. But I can tell your Lordships that my right honourable
<col>164</col>
friend has said that he will take the extra burden into account in fixing the council's grant-in-aid.<lb/>
Some people are uneasy about the character of some of the land improvement proposals which may come forward during the programme's life&#x2014;and I have dealt with some of the more bizarre criticisms. I accept that we shall get awkward cases, but I believe that the main interest will be in repairing or improving existing drains, fencing, and grazing. There is plenty of scope here before anyone need think of large projects to drain new parts of the ecologically important wetlands.<lb/>
However, there is a danger&#x2014;I think other noble Lords will agree, since they have touched on it&#x2014;that because of the feeling of "birds versus people", which has been generated by some of the remarks quoted in the press, the needs of the crofters are to he disregarded, as compared with the needs of wildlife. But that is certainly not the case.<lb/>
It has been said, though not this afternoon in your Lordships' House, in effect that. "If the Dutch can use European funds to pay farmers to preserve the environment, why don't we?" The facts of the matter are that the Dutch cannot use EEC funds for this purpose, any more than we can. They do make payments to some farmers in a few areas to restrict certain agricultural activities, but they use their own national funds; and so can we. Our counterpart of the Dutch arrangements are the management agreements between the Nature Conservancy Council and farmers on national nature reserves and sites of special scientific interest, provided for under Section 32 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. I can confirm that the Government and the NCC will apply the Section 32 provision to both IDP and existing crofter grant schemes where a person has been refused a capital grant.<lb/>

I acknowledge that the importance of the eco-system is set out there very clearly. But to my mind it is in general terms, and what I believe I and others have been seeking are what I described as visibly dependable measures to carry out what is there described as necessary and desirable. I am grateful for the answers that my noble friend has given, including the one given just now about the NCC. I am also grateful for his confirming in reply to my question that the EEC does not have funds for the protection of the environment that can he provided from the agricultural source.

What I have said is that my right honourable friend is aware of the situation, is aware that the Integrated Development Programme will put new burdens upon it, and will take such into account when he fixes his grant in aid. Beyond that, I do not think I can go.<lb/>
My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady White, using the full authority of her chairmanship of your Lordships' Committee, said that it had heard evidence about this matter and that (if I may paraphrase her remarks) the IDP had been weighed in the balance and had been found wanting. What she did not say was that I had offered to the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook&#x2014;perhaps I could finish my sentence before I give way to the noble Baroness&#x2014;to give evidence on the other side, and the noble Baroness might agree that it might be better to suspend judicial decision-making in this case until both sides have been heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00903"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought I made it entirely clear in my opening remarks that I was not in a position to speak on behalf of the Committee, for the reason that they had not yet reported.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00904"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Baroness for correcting me in so far as I needed such correction.<lb/>
My Lords, I have, I think, answered the point about the SSSIs and national nature reserves. I want, if I can, finally, to answer the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, about his 1,000 hectares of wet machair, for that really is the nub of the whole argument&#x2014;and I see him nodding in agreement. This 1,000 hectares is the maximum uptake for the whole machair scheme. Much of what the noble Lord referred to as wet machair is in fact the cultivated machair which has been allowed to decline in recent years&#x2014;I may say, years in which the corncrake has also declined.<lb/>
<col>166</col>
I am coming now to the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, who unfortunately is not in his place, because he cannot receive my strictures for shooting my fox. I, too, read the <i>West Highland Free Press</i>, although I think that, politically speaking, it is much nearer his side of the House than mine. Nevertheless, I agree with what the environmental correspondent of that much-read journal has said, and I agree that he has taken a broad view of the situation. What is important is that some knowledgeable people believe that the bird population in that part of the world has declined in recent years partly because of the decline in the standard of crofting agriculture. Much of the now-neglected crofting land is of as little interest to conservationists as it is of use to the crofting economy. A variety of different habitats in a small area tends to enrich the wildlife, and crofting can maintain such a mosaic environment. I go so far as to say that the IDP may therefore extend, rather than reduce, the range of wildlife habitats.<lb/>
But other environmentalists&#x2014;and some of them with local knowledge&#x2014;have been making precisely the point that I have made and which was made rather more elegantly by the environmental correspondent of then <i>West Highland Free Press</i>; namely, that there is no reason to suppose that the land improvement measures that we are proposing will destroy the unique natural environment of the Western Isles. We need a balanced approach to the large number of economic and social problems in this remote area. We must help the crofters to build on what is already there, and that must include land and livestock improvements. But with the safeguards that I have mentioned and the procedures that we have laid down, I hope the House will agree that the balance of priorities is just about right. It is in that sense that I commend the regulations to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00905">6.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00906"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank everybody who has taken part in what I think is generally agreed to have been an extremely valuable debate, and I think that one or two of the things that the Minister has just said will have themselves made the debate worthwhile. Some were positive and some were possibly negative, but, nevertheless, he did go further than the Government have gone before, particularly in giving an assurance that crofters and people refused grant under the IDP as a result of conservation objections would be eligible for management agreements in the same way as people refused normal capital grant aid. I think that will be widely welcomed, not only by conservationists but I have no doubt to an even greater extent by the crofters who are likely to be affected; and if that is the only thing to have come out of this debate in your Lordships' House, it will have made it worthwhile.<lb/>
I make just two or three quick points. First, to my noble friend Lord Ross, he need not feel a criminal. The sort of re-seeding which he described on the side of a hill is something to which no conservationist would have any objection. It may be that one or two of the grouse-shooters will object to moorland being reclaimed in that way, but certainly not, I think, conservationists. Indeed, one of the thrusts of the conservation argument in this is that there are huge
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0092"/>
<col>167</col>
areas which are quite capable of being improved for agriculture in the Western Isles and elsewhere in Scotland where there is no conflict with conservation.<lb/>
It is, as the noble Earl himself said, on the 1,000 hectares of wet machair that we get to the nub of the point; and just as he said he was going to get to the nub of the point and tell me about this, he went off on to something completely different&#x2014;the dry machair, the area which is under some arable cropping, where there are oats and crops of that sort grown. I quite agree with him it is possible that if that is extended on the dry machair it will improve the wildlife interests of the area, and that is why I quite deliberately left out any reference to the dry machair areas in opening the debate. It is quite possible, as long as this is done in small areas with a fair degree of variety, as he says, on the dry machair, things will actually be improved, and certainly not necessarily made any worse. But when we get to the 1,000 hectares of wet machair we come up against the problem, and it was at that point that the noble Earl scooted off sideways; and that, I am afraid, is one of the things which still worries me.<lb/>
The noble Earl gave a very forthright and welcome assurance that damage was most unlikely. If he had stopped there I would have had nothing but praise for the Government's (as I would have seen it) change of heart. But unfortunately he then went on to say that he did not believe it was right to pay people not to farm their crofts rather than to encourage them to farm. Of course, that could he taken as a coded way of saying that the Government do not believe in the management agreements which they have just agreed to extend to people refused grant aid under the IDP; so with the same breath as he said something very welcome I am afraid he really took it away again. Because it will he necessary under management agreements to pay crofters, not to refrain from farming crofts, but to continue to farm them as they are now, rather than encouraging them to develop them in the way that the IDP will encourage. So I am afraid that the conflict that has been evident in the debate between different speakers is still there.<lb/>
I also find it very difficult to deal with the shifting sands of the arguments against the conservation case, and we have heard them during the debate today. On the one hand, this scheme is going to do nothing new and what is the conservationist concerned about? On the other hand, it is vital for the economic development of the islands, it will make dramatic changes and therefore we should not oppose it. The analogy which two noble Lords used of the blanket afforestation of the Highlands with alien conifers I would have thought was hardly likely to endear the scheme either to conservationists or, indeed, to crofters themselves. It seemed to me to be an extraordinary analogy to draw. It really did seem to me that that was not a very sensible argument to be put by those who support the scheme.<lb/>
Finally, may I make this point to the noble Earl? I entirely agree with him that it is for the Nature Conservancy Council to make a case to the Secretary of State for the Environment about the resources it needs. It did that last year and is currently doing it for the next financial year. Last year, it went into a great deal of effort, time and trouble to make a case for the
<col>168</col>
resources that it needed, or thought that it would need, in the light of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. It put in a bid, and the Government gave the NCC half the extra money that it asked for; as a result, the NCC seems to have run out of funds for certain major aspects of its work this year and is delaying procedures under the Wildlife and Countryside Act not by 12 months but by a full 18 months. If the noble Earl will support whatever bid the NCC put to DoE this year and will make sure that they get all that they ask for, including any sums that they need under the IDP, then, again, the debate will have been worthwhile. But I have to tell him that I think it very unlikely that that will happen, and halfway through next year we will be in exactly the same position with the NCC running out of money. Then there will be some serious conflicts in the Western Isles as a result of the Government failing to provide the funds that are needed.<lb/>
I should like to say that I was delighted that nobody opposed the IDP. I stand by my view that it should go ahead, although I think it is disastrous that the Government have not grasped this nettle of integrating conservation into the programme. The noble Earl seemed to say that the answer to that was that it was called the wrong thing; but an integrated rural development programme is what everybody interested in agriculture and the countryside has been asking for for years&#x2014;and not least the noble Lord, Lord Sandford, as he said. He deserves a great deal of credit for the effort that he has put into this. It is a pity, when he finally gets an integrated programme, that the Government turn round and say that it is misnamed. What it ought to be is properly integrated.<lb/>
I think that the debate has been worthwhile and, as I say, not least for the assurance that the noble Earl has been able to give about management agreements. I hope that it will also serve the purpose (as my noble friend Lord Ross has said) that although actual projects under the IDP have not yet started, the fact that so many noble Lords are as keenly interested as they are in what is going to happen will. I hope, be borne in mind by the project team, by local NCC staff and others. I very much hope that some of the gloomy predictions that a number of us have felt moved to make will not he borne out.<lb/>
The fact is that we will be able to count the birds and flowers on the Western Isles in a year, two years or three years and will know what effect the scheme has. It will he judged by its results; and the possibility of future integration programmes for the Western Highlands of Scotland or elsewhere will also be judged, I believe, by the results of this scheme&#x2014;and that places a heavy duty on the project team. Having said that, may I reiterate my thanks to noble Lords for what I believe has been a constructive debate. I beg leave to withdraw my Motion.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00908">Read a third time, with the amendments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00909">Clause 14 [<i>Exclusion of security of tenure in case of premises used for vehicle testing business</i>]:</p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0093"/>
<col>169</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00910"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Lord Bellwin)</member> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00911">Page 16, line 38, at end insert&#x2014;
<quote>("(3) In this section "tenancy" has the same meaning as in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, and the reference in subsection (1) above to a tenancy granted by the Secretary of State shall be construed accordingly.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00912">The noble Lord said: My Lords, you will recall I have already made it clear that I think it most unlikely we will ever need the provisions of this clause, given the Government's intention to transfer testing to an independent non-profit-making body&#x2014;LRVTA. But I am sure noble Lords will agree that it is right to provide a proper framework for control of the new testing system; and Clause 14 is part of that framework. It disapplies the security-of-tenure provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 which would otherwise apply to premises used for a vehicle-testing business, as defined in this Bill. It thus ensures that the Secretary of State would be able to regain possession of testing stations quickly and without fuss if an approved testing authority were to be in breach of the provisions of its lease; or, at the end of the lease, if the Secretary of State then wished to appoint a new authority to carry out the work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00913">That is the aim of the clause. We have found, however, that the clause as drafted may not wholly achieve that aim. It would disapply the provisions of the 1954 Act in relation to a tenancy granted by the Secretary of State, but not in relation to a sub-tenancy where the Secretary of State is a lessee himself and has granted a sub-tenancy to an approved testing authority. This is a matter of some practical importance, because there are number of test stations where the Secretary of State is the lessee and could only grant a sub-tenancy. To ensure these stations are covered by Clause 14 an amendment is needed. We propose to do this by including in Clause 14 the same definition of a tenancy as is contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act. This makes it clear that "tenancy" also means "sub-tenancy". I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00914">On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00915">Clause 29 [<i>Further provisions with respect to fixed penalty allences and notices</i>.]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00916"><member>Lord Underhill</member> moved Amendment No. 2:
<quote>Page 30, line 41, after ("Act") insert ("and may so provide for any offence in Schedule 2 to this Act to become a fixed penalty offence in England and Wales").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00917">The noble Lord said: My Lords, at the Report stage, I proposed an amendment, supported by my noble friend Lord Mishcon, which aimed at giving motorists in England and Wales precisely the same fixed penalty options as would apply in Scotland. That particular amendment proposed that chief officers of police in England and Wales should be enabled to issue fixed penalty notices for the offences mentioned in Schedule 2 which, of course, are confined to Scotland. The arguments which the noble Earl, Lord Avon, used against that was that this would turn chief officers into procurators-fiscal, that there would be no merit in splitting off from the mainstream of fixed penalty offences, some of which must not be dealt with at the roadside; and the noble Earl also explained the reasons for the selection of the particular offences listed for Scotland in Schedule 2.</p>
<col>170</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00918">I think it will be agreed that my noble friend Lord Mishcon somewhat demolished that part of the argument about the selection of the offences in Schedule 2; and all the points that he made are clearly set out in cols. 936 and 937 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 14th October last. Those which he quoted were examples of offences which could be just as competently dealt with by a constable at the roadside in England and Wales as by a constable in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00919">Clause 29(2) provides that the Secretary of State may by order make changes in the list of fixed penalty offences. The amendment provides that, in pursuance of that subsection, the Secretary of State may provide for any of the offences mentioned in Schedule 2 to become a fixed penalty offence in England and Wales. It will he noted that the argument I am putting forward does not instruct the Secretary of State; the matter is left solely for him to determine. Neither does the amendment specify any particular offences mentioned in Schedule 2 which should be transferred to Schedule 1.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00920">There seems to be no reason why the Government should not accept this modest amendment. Its purposes would be to enable appropriate offences to be added to those which a constable in England and Wales may consider at the roadside in the same way as could a constable in Scotland. That would assist in saving court time, which has been stressed by many noble Lords in the House. If the Minister should say that the meaning of subsection (2) is that the Secretary of State would have this power, then I would say, "Why not add this amendment so as to make it quite clear that Parliament is willing that the Secretary of State shall have this power to move any offence that he thinks fit from Schedule 2 to Schedule 1, so that this would be applicable in England and Wales?". I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00921">6.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00922"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has put both sides of the coin to such an extent that there is little that I have to say. I should say first of all that this amendment adds nothing to the powers contained in Clause 29. Subsection (2) would already allow the Secretary of State to make an order to provide for most of the offences in Schedule 2 to become fixed penalty offences in England and Wales. I say "most", because he could not, of course, make offences under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1970 apply in England and Wales. Therefore, I have to say that the amendment is defective in this second issue.<lb/>
But may I say why we have not included these penalties which the noble Lord wants. I know that the noble Lord believes that the fixed penalty option should be available to motorists in England and Wales in respect of Schedule 2; but I think we need to look at why they were not originally recommended for inclusion in Schedule 1. This schedule was drawn up after considerable thought, looking at the individual merits of each offence. The noble Lord has said himself that some of the offences are of a nature where a decision should not be made by a police constable at the roadside because of the varying circumstances in which they can occur. In addition, there are some which are so infrequently prosecuted that there would be no impact at all on the burden of the courts, the

reduction of which is one of the main objectives of these provisions. There are others which would not be appropriate; for instance, if failure to produce a document is involved.<lb/>
Dealing with such an offence by fixed penalty could mean that the document remains unproduced, which clearly is not desirable. Nevertheless, there are a few, including those which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, pointed out during our debate last week, which may at first sight seem suitable for fixed penalty treatment. But, as I have said, there is nothing in this Bill which rules them out of the fixed penalty system in England and Wales if a future Secretary of State, having gained experience of the present system, considered it appropriate to make an order to include one of them.<lb/>
As I have said, there has been considerable thought into the drawing up of Schedule 1 and I very much hope, after what I have said, that the noble Lord will let it ride as it is at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00923"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would be most appropriate in a Transport Bill to let anything ride that wants to. But, I must say this: although the noble Earl has been as clear, lucid and eloquent as he always is&#x2014;and certainly as courteous as he always is&#x2014;I do not follow his argument and I do not think your Lordships will, either.<lb/>
Two schedules have been drawn up. One schedule is applicable to the United Kingdom apart from Scotland and Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland has to have a separate order of its own. The second schedule applies to Scotland. The noble Lord, on the last occasion, made it perfectly clear that the reason for the difference between Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 was that the procurator fiscal sits there in all his glory in Scotland and, with all the facilities that he has available and all the skill that undoubtedly he has at his command, he sifts out those serious offences from the not so serious which are contained in Schedule 2 and decides in his wisdom whether or not to issue a penalty notice.<lb/>
I expected, as no doubt your Lordships did, that when looking at Schedule 2, I would find very good reason why England and Wales, and eventually Northern Ireland, will not have the benefit of these offences being available readily under this Bill, without waiting for any further order, as offences which can be dealt with by the penalty notice. If there is not a case for that, then of course the tidy way of dealing with this matter is to see to it that these offences, which can easily and most usefully be dealt with by a police officer on the spot, are in Schedule 1 available immediately for this experiment which is to be carried out. The noble Lord referred to it as an experiment, but I thought quite honestly that it was part of permanent legislation and was intended to be such.<lb/>
At the risk of wearying your Lordships at a late hour&#x2014;as six o'clock undoubtedly is for a Third Reading of a Bill&#x2014;may I repeat some of the offences that I have dealt with. My noble friend and I could have moved everyone of these for translation from Schedule 2 into Schedule 1. We thought if we did your Lordships would he so angry with us that it was far better to deal with it as a general proposition. We hoped optimistically that the noble Earl the Minister
<col>172</col>
would say, "Right, I will translate, and thank you for giving us the power to do that right away without troubling anybody with an order". However, unfortunately, the Government are not so amenable this evening.<lb/>
Perhaps I may quote a few of these cases. The first one is the unlawful carrying of passengers on a bicycle. Who better than a police constable, there by the roadside, to see whether first of all there is an unlawful carrying of passengers on a bicycle; and, secondly, whether it is a serious unlawful carrying of passengers on a bicycle? Secondly, failure by pedestrians to comply with directions of a constable regulating vehicular traffic. He is there on the spot, he sees the pedestrians, he has waved his arms to stop them and they have not stopped. Who better than the police constable to decide there and then whether it is proper to issue a penalty notice?<lb/>
Thirdly, holding or getting on to a moving vehicle to be carried. Who better than the police officer on the spot to decide whether somebody is holding on to a vehicle when he should not do so, whether it is serious and whether a penalty notice should be issued? Precisely the same remarks would apply to holding on to a moving vehicle to be towed.<lb/>
My <i>pi&#x00E8;ce de r&#x00E9;esistance&#x2014;my crowning point&#x2014;is the last offence</i>, which is causing or permitting a dog to be on a designated road without a lead. If that really needs the vigilant eye of the procurator fiscal in order to read the folder which deals with this very serious matter&#x2014;well, it has been decided that in regard to Scotland, he has to do it, but nevertheless he can issue the penalty notice. My Lords, is it seriously argued that this offence should not be translated right away without the necessity and the delay of' an order into Schedule 1?<lb/>
My noble friends and I have not put down every one of these offences where there could have been a debate on each. What we have done is to say: "Do not worry about an order. Enough time and expense is taken on Government administration as it is. Let us do something simple and in this Act give the power to the Minister not without an order to find a new offence to be put into Schedule 1 which is not in Schedule 2; but if Scotland has it in Schedule 2 and a penalty notice can be issued, let the Minister, if it is in Schedule 1 translate it to Schedule 1 in an appropriate case"&#x2014;I have tried to give six examples&#x2014;"without having to go to the bother of an order". That is what the amendment means, that is what it says, and that is the amendment, if I may respectfully say so, that the Government should in reason, logic and common sense accept.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00924"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we too would like to support the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. I believe that the Government have changed their argument. I was quite convinced when the noble Earl put forward the case about the procurator fiscal during Report stage; and I am slightly confused now as to what is the reason for the noble Earl's answer of not accepting the basic argument by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. I have possibly misunderstood and stand to be corrected, but it seems to me that there has been a slight change of view. Perhaps the noble Earl will correct me.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00925"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I should have said at the Report stage what I said earlier on at this stage. This is a basic point. This amendment adds nothing to the powers contained in Clause 29(2). This would already allow the Secretary of State to make an order to provide for most of the offences in Schedule 2 to become fixed penalty offences in England and Wales. So this amendment adds nothing to Clause 29(2), and that is really the long and the short of it. There is already the power of the Secretary of State to do what the noble Lord wants. If the noble Lord has not these specific offences down in his amendment, then all we do at the moment is get rid of the order-making power.</membercontribution></p>

I know that he wants to be fair. This amendment enables the Secretary of State to make this transfer from Schedule 2 to Schedule 1 without an order. Therefore he can do it simply, without the expense of it and without the trouble of it, when it is in Schedule 2 and he wants to move it over to Schedule 1.

There is commonsense in the amendment and if the inclusion of one or two words makes it unacceptable, as we are discussing a clause put in by the Government therefore it becomes a Lords amendment, I believe there is still time and opportunity for the Government to take a look at this when the Lords' amendments go to the other place. I would hope they will take a careful look at what has been said by my noble friend and see whether they cannot put in this commonsense addition when the amendment goes to the other place.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00936">6.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00937"><member>Lord Underhill</member> moved Amendment No. 4:
<quote>Page 60, line 28, at end insert ("with the objective so far as possible of working towards uniformity").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00938">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the absence of uniformity in operating the fixed penalty system. This question of uniformity in operating the system in the various police forces has been discussed in some detail both at Committee and Report stages in your Lordships' House. The noble Earl, Lord Avon, might be very pleased to know that what he describes as "sending up the football results" will not be given again this evening; but I would remind your Lordships that all the facts and figures which I gave both at the Committee and Report stages were taken from the official Government statistics, showing the complete inconsistency and disparities in the treatment of fixed penalty notices in the different police forces.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00939">At the Report stage the Government moved some way towards meeting the criticism which was brought forward at the Committee stage, but that is not satisfactory because the clause provides that guidance should be given to chief officers in respect of the operation of Part III of the Act. There is need&#x2014;and this is what the amendment seeks to do&#x2014;to specify quite clearly what is the objective of the guidance; and that is what is proposed in this amendment. At the Committee stage the amendment was criticised because it contained the phrase:
<quote>"on the same basis and in respect of the same fixed penalty offences".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00940">At the Report stage we amended it so that it read:
<quote>"with the objective of ensuring uniform police practice".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00941">That was still considered as tying down the position far too much, but the noble Earl, Lord Avon, said, in column 940 on 14th October 1982:
<quote>"The guidance to chief officers will be directed to drawing their attention to the need as far as possible to work towards uniformity".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00942">That is not in the Government's new clause. The amendment meets this deficiency and seeks to add at the end of the clause:
<quote>"with the objective so far as possible of working towards uniformity".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00943">We gave very careful consideration to the wording to be added, and we thought we could do no better than use the actual words used by the Minister in your Lordships' House. Therefore, the addition of these words would leave no doubt whatever as to the purpose of the guidance, and as they are the words that the Minister used I shall be most surprised if the Government do not accept them on this occasion.

uniformity's sake. It was to produce what the noble Lord the Minister, in his very kindly correspondence with me, said was an important matter from the Government's point of view. We were told that many motorists had failed to pay their penalties under the penalty notices which at present exist because they had not understood the complexity of the language used in the form. Therefore, the point was advanced in support of the Government's case, even though we felt that was a very merciful view to take of motorists' failure to pay their penalties. Nevertheless, we wanted to advance the case for uniformity with the Government, for the very reason they gave&#x2014;in order that the simplicity of language so far as possible should be uniformly used. Therefore, I would add this further point to those put by my noble friend in the hope that the Government can accept this amendment now.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00946">On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00947">Clause 53 [<i>Immobilisation of vehicles illegally parked</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00948"><member>Lord Underhill</member> moved Amendment No. 5:
<quote>Page 63, line 4, after ("approved") insert ("in regulations made").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00949">The noble Lord said: My Lords, first may I thank the noble Earl and the Government for accepting the previous amendment. I hope we may have similar accord on other amendments which will come later. In moving this amendment, with the leave of the House, I should like to speak to Amendment No. 12. This amendment deals with the clause making provision for immobilisation devices which, in common parlance, I will call wheel clamps. On Report, a similar amendment was tabled and on that occasion the noble Earl explained the Government's intentions. In column 966 on 14th October, he said:
<quote>"The approval order would be a formal document issued on the authority of the Secretary of State. It would not he subject to parliamentary proceedings".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00950">In withdrawing the amendment on that occasion, I said I would consider what the noble Earl had said, with a view possibly to returning to the matter on Third Reading. I recognise that there are differences in your Lordships' House on the whole question of wheel clamps. There are those who want to have them. There are those&#x2014;my noble friend is one&#x2014;who say, "We do not want them". Others, like myself, were, I think, in the majority and the Government have gone a long way towards accepting our view that we were prepared to experiment and try out wheel clamps and the Government have made suitable amendments at the Report stage. Therefore, it is important that we should carry the maximum number of people in the change proposed for the exercise of these immobilisation devices.</p>
<col>176</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00951">The definition given in subsection (9) does not explain what would be the real nature of any device. It could be many things and I could think of items which I would not support if they were to be introduced as wheel clamps. All we seek in this amendment is that Parliament shall be given the opportunity, if it so desired, of considering the devices that may be approved by the Secretary of State. On this occasion the amendment does not ask for the affirmative procedure. I would point out that the consequential Amendment No. 12 would provide for the order to be by statutory instrument, and that may be annulled under the negative procedure. This seems to be a simple opportunity for the Government to accede. If Parliament so wishes, let it discuss a regulation setting out the nature of the device approved by the Secretary of State, so that the matter may have parliamentary scrutiny. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00952"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, said, this is a small tidying-up point to Clause 53. The amendments would require the ministerial approval of immobilisation devices to be expressed in regulations, subject to parliamentary approval, as the noble Lord said. The procedure for approval as the Bill stands, without these amendments, is that before any type of device can be used, it must be assessed and approved by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. That approval will be given in an order printed by Her Majesty's Stationery Office and made available to the public. The procedure is the same as the one used for breath testing equipment for many years.<lb/>
In considering immobilisation devices for approval, the most important considerations will be to see that the device is safe from the point of view of the motorist and passers by, and that it will not damage the vehicle. I do not believe that it is necessary to require regulations approved by Parliament to ensure that. Nor is it necessary to have regulations in order to inform the public that a particular device has been approved.<lb/>
I think it most unlikely that the police would have considered the use of unsafe equipment, or risked damaging vehicles with unsuitable equipment. As a double safeguard, we have agreed that there should be a ministerial check on the equipment to be used. To introduce a further parliamentary check would, we believe, serve no useful purpose and create a possibility of delay and frustration, if a new device became available which was a self-evident improvement on earlier models, but could not be brought into use until time had been found to draft regulations and submit them to Parliament. These devices are likely to be very simple in design, and it would. I believe, be unnecessarily cumbersome to tie their approval to this procedure. That is the way I would like to see it. I think that the noble Lord will disagree with me, but that is our point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00953"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down. I agree from these Benches that these devices are the modern equivalent of the stocks and we feel that they must be used by the law. I would ask the noble Earl whether these regulations will make it possible for British manufacturers to be able to submit designs and manufactures of these devices, which I
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0097"/>
<col>177</col>
understand are of an imported nature with foreign patents. So I hope that if these devices are to become part of our lives, they will, at least, be the British modern equivalent of the stocks, rather than a foreign modern equivalent of the stocks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00954"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the police are looking at a number of different devices, some manufactured in the United Kingdom and others manufactured abroad.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00956"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that we went through these issues in an earlier debate. As this is now Third Reading, I think that we should stay on the narrow issue.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 64, line 37, leave out ("reference in subsection (2)(c)") and insert ("references in subsiction (2)")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00960">The noble Earl said: My Lords, perhaps I may speak to Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 and move them together at the end. The need for these amendments arises from a possibility raised by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, on report. The noble Lord asked whether
<quote>"an immediate clamping device could be put on a vehicle "&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/10/82; col. 971.]</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00961">when a motorist finds that there is spare time, paid for by some other person, on the meter when he parks. I was able to reassure the noble Lord that there is no question of immediate clamping in such cases, as the vehicle would not be illegally parked and would not be within the scope of Clause 53(1).</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00962">However, the noble Lord's intervention has caused us to think further about the precise point at which such a motorist's exemption from clamping runs out. His case cannot be said to fall within Clause 54(2)(<i>b</i>). If there was no obligation to pay an initial charge at the time of parking, and if he did not himself pay an initial charge the two hours cannot be measured from a nonexistent starting point. The words which this amendment adds to Clause 54(2)(<i>d</i>) will make it clear that in such cases the two hour exemption runs from the expiry of the charge previously paid in respect of another vehicle, which was available on the parking meter when the second motorist arrived. If he decides he is likely to need rather more time than is available on the meter, he is, of course, entitled to put money in, and the two hour exemption will then run from the expiry of the extra time he has purchased. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, for raising the query

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00965">Clause 61 [<i>Speed limits</i>.]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00966"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member> moved Amendment No. 8:
<quote>Page 73, line 39, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() After 1st November 1982, wherever a trunk or principal road is provided with such a system of lighting as is mentioned in subsection (1) above the details shall he recorded in a central registry under the control of the Secretary of State.")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00967">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment follows on Amendment No. 34BB at a previous stage of the Bill. May I remind your Lordships that that amendment concerned Clause 54, as it was then, dealing with speed limits on a number of roads which may be altered by virtue of lighting engineering works and lighting installations. Despite a number of amendments to clarify the position, my noble friend has always maintained that any amendment allowing for the clarification of future problems&#x2014;that is, problems that may occur up to and including this month&#x2014;would leave the way open for very similar problems to those that have occurred in the past to accrue in the next 20 or so years. It is the intention of this amendment, therefore, to ensure that the Government's wish to draw a line as at the enactment of this Bill on all past regulations, and those speed limits which obtain currently, whether they are 30, 40, 50, 60 or indeed 70 m.p.h. on certain categories of roads which may be lit or unlit now, shall not be prejudiced by its enactment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00968">In order that there should he a clear definition of when the change occurs, I have suggested that a register be kept, either locally or centrally, which will establish when lighting alterations occur that may affect the speed limits on roads upon which such lighting installations take place in the future. Then there can be no argument as to what was the intention of the law, in the unhappy event of a prosecution. This would, therefore, simplify the matter, enabling everybody concerned to understand the position that they might then find themselves in. My Lords, I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00969"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fully appreciate the concern expressed by my noble friend that Clause 61 will mean that any trunk or classified road, other than a motorway, will become restricted automatically when street lighting is installed. However, this will not, in practice, be the position in every case and, indeed, the number of roads where this might occur is likely to be quite small. First, so far as trunk roads are concerned, these are the responsibility of the Secretary of State and I can repeat the assurance that I have already given to your Lordships that he will comply with his own criteria for setting speed limits to ensure that appropriate limits are in operation when lighting is
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0098"/>
<col>179</col>
installed. Other roads are the responsibility of individual local highway authorities, but not all these will attract automatically the 30 m.p.h. limit when street lighting is installed. An unlit road which has a local speed limit imposed by order&#x2014;say 40 or 50 mph&#x2014;will not attract the 30 m.p.h. limit automatically if street lighting is installed, because the speed limit imposed by the order will prevail.<lb/>
This, then, leaves only the unlit roads which are subject to the national limit only&#x2014;60 m.p.h. on single carriageways and 70 m.p.h. on dual carriageways, If these had lighting installed&#x2014;and the new lighting programme is such that their numbers are not large&#x2014;they would become subject to the 30 m.p.h. limit, unless the highway authority took action to raise that limit.<lb/>
I cannot of course give the same absolute assurance in respect of local authority roads as I could for trunk roads, that the necessary adjustments to speed limits will always be made on those roads when lighting is installed. However, we shall be issuing advice to local authorities about the effects of Clause 61. This will include a recommendation that wherever new lighting is to be installed on a road, the consequences in relation to the appropriatness of the speed limit which will apply after lighting should always be carefully examined and the limit adjusted as necessary in the light of that review. In cases where a national limit-60 or 70 m.p.h.&#x2014;would be replaced by the 30 m.p.h. limit, the presumption should be that the former limit would be retained unless there were some positive reason why a lower limit should be imposed. In other cases, where an intermediate limit imposed by order would prevent the 30 m.p.h. limit being imposed automatically, authorities will still be advised to consider whether that limit would remain appropriate after lighting.<lb/>
As to the practicalities of my noble friend's amendment, I think its wider implications rather than its potential effect make us hesitate. The setting up and keeping of a register of street lighting installations for the purpose of establishing the restricted or nonrestricted status of trunk and principal roads would involve the use of additional resources by both central and local government. At first, such a register might be a fairly simple thing to keep, but in time it would inevitably grow in complexity, because of the need to record the de-trunking or de-principalling of roads when that occurs, and retrospectively the dates of lighting installations on roads which are later categorised as trunk or principal roads. The justification for setting up such a register as is suggested here would need to be very strong&#x2014;stronger, in fact, than we can appreciate at the moment, particularly in face of the probable demand it would make on public expenditure.<lb/>
I acknowledge that the success of what the Government are trying to achieve through this clause depends to some extent on the performance of local authorities. We are relying on them, when street lighting attracts, or would attract, restricted road status, to take the necessary steps to ensure that appropriate speed limits are in force after lighting. We do so at present of course in relation to unclassified roads and we are now extending this to non-trunk classified roads. The
<col>180</col>

number of roads affected currently is not large and the task should be well within the capability of all authorities. We have no reason to suppose that they will not, in conjunction with lighting operations, take such steps as are necessary to adjust the speed limits on those roads. Nevertheless, we intend to keep a careful eye on the way in which the restricted roads provision, as amended by Clause 61, works in practice. If it is seen not to be satisfactory, we shall certainly look again at the problem and consider what further measures might be taken, including, if necessary, further legislative amendment. We shall of course keep in mind my noble friend's idea of a register. I hope what I have said and the assurance I have given will persuade my noble friend not to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>

I am also happy to accept the Government's assurance with regard to those matters which lie totally in their hands&#x2014;in other words, the trunk roads. I have some hesitation, however, about placing reliance upon my noble friend's hope that other local highway authorities will follow the same practice. I hope, therefore, that the advice which will be given is written in such terms as to prevent highway authorities from falling into the ever-present trap of succumbing to the demand of local pressure groups to reduce speed limits. It has been proved by the department that they are not effective so far as road safety is concerned.<lb/>
I say without any malice to my noble friend that the Government might have thought about this matter when Clause 44, as it was then, of the Bill was first drafted. Although a great number of roads may not be involved, there is a loophole which I think should have been plugged at an earlier stage. I take note of what my noble friend says with regard to keeping an eye on the matter. Even though events may not prove the need for further legislation, the gap which exists in the Bill will I hope be demonstrated to be sufficient for further powers to be taken in future legislation, so closing the gap. With those remarks, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

ment's clause sets out words to he inserted in Section 78A of the 1967 Act. However, our reading of the situation is that that section, with subsequent amendments, excludes special roads&#x2014;that is, motorways. In our view, this Government provision in Clause 62 should apply to all roads and to all speeding offences where this type of equipment is used as evidence. The amendment deals with this point by providing that instead of the Government's provision, which later on we hope to amend, being inserted in Section 78A, there should be a separate subsection after Section 78A. This means that the exclusion of special roads such as motorways would not apply. In other words, this provision would then apply to all roads and to all speeding offences where radar equipment is used. I think that our facts are correct. If not, the noble Lord the Minister will no doubt tell me. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-00979">6.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00980"><member>Lord Underhill</member> moved Amendment No. 10:
<quote>Page 74, line 9, at end insert ("in regulations conforming to a performance standard specified in those regulations").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00981">The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are doing exceptionally well tonight. I am hoping we may succeed a third time by the amendment which I am now going to move. Amendment No. 10 deals with the main point of the Government amendment which was introduced at the Report stage. The Government, as I frankly acknowledged and for which both I and other noble Lords expressed gratitude, moved considerably between their attitude at the Committee stage and the Report stage. The very detailed amendment which my noble friend and I submitted at Report was criticised on various counts. One was that every time a design changed and a new procedure was approved new regulations would be required. That criticism is completely avoided by Amendment No. 10 which is now before the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00982">The Government amendment, Clause 62, is inadequate. I must ask the noble Lord what is meant by "a type approved by the Secretary of State". At col. 992 of the Report stage the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said:
<quote>"What we propose is that the branch"&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00983">that is, the Scientific and Research Development Branch of the Home Office,
<quote>"will examine all the radar devices currently in use and advise the Secretary of State as to the appropriateness of approving the equipment; the need to issue guidance on operating procedures and training will also be considered".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00984">Therefore, one could have the situation that this could lead to approval of all the radar measuring devices at
<col>182</col>

present in use, despite the widespread criticism there is of some equipment; criticism made not only by motoring organisations but made also by the decisions of various courts and by noble Lords in all parts of your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00985">I am not going to quote what the noble Lord said in the last debate, at Report stage, but most speakers in that debate (and remember, we were not taking party lines on these road safety measures) wanted a more detailed definition of what precisely is to be approved. The general tenor seemed to be in line with the spirit of my detailed amendment (which many thought was too detailed), which was that there must be a standard to which equipment should conform. The present amendment before your Lordships avoids the criticism made of the amendment at Report stage&#x2014;that it spelt out too much detail. It simply asks for additional words to be added so that the important phrase will read,
<quote>"of a type approved by the Secretary of State in regulations conforming to a performance standard specified in those regulations."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00986">The amendment would do two things. First, whatever is approved by the Secretary of State must be set out in regulations so that, if desired, there could be parliamentary consideration. Secondly, that there must be laid down a performance standard to which this type of equipment must conform. On this occasion the amendment is not attempting to lay down whether the standards should be prepared by Home Office scientists, the TRRL or the British Standards Institution. That is a matter left solely for consideration and decision by the Secretary of State. What it does say quite clearly is that there must be a performance standard. The wording of the amendment is such that there will be no necessity to have new regulations from time to time, because the regulations will lay down a standard. That is the important thing&#x2014;it will not name any particular equipment. It will lay down a standard to which different equipment which it is desired to use must conform.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00987">Should it be argued that it is difficult to produce a standard&#x2014;and I do not wish to thrust any particular standard on the House&#x2014;I my hand a document laying down proposed police traffic radar performance standards for the state of Florida. The introduction to this document states that these specifications and performance standards are based on a modified version of the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's performance standards for speed-measuring radar, which was published in the United States' Federal Register in January 1981. I gather that it was prepared by a body which is equivalent to our own BSI. We all know that the BSI has produced documents (and I mentioned this in our last debate) on the various types of standards and how they can be prepared. Therefore all the information is available if one wants it. There should be no doubt whatever in preparing a standard.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00988">I would like to make one or two points absolutely clear, because this was stressed by noble Lords at Report stage. I believe the whole House is united in wanting to help the police. As I said at Report stage, the police must have the best possible equipment. The amendment is directed to three heads: (1) helping the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0100"/>
<col>183</col>
police to have the best equipment; (2) ensuring that there is equitable and fair treatment of motorists; (3) a very important point, avoiding strain between police and motorists because of widespread doubts as to the effectiveness and accuracy of the equipment now in use.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00989">I have no wish to question&#x2014;and would challenge anyone who endeavoured to do so&#x2014;the integrity of the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Elton. But as he said on Report, he has to work on advice given to him. Similarly, I have to work on advice given to me. The advice on which I am working has been given by persons very experienced in this field and by the engineers of the motoring organisations. On that evidence, one would not accept all the statements made in your Lordships' House justifying the present equipment. It was said that the prospect of achieving a design breakthrough banning interference altogether is remote. Yet I have here documents of which I have read the appropriate parts, (I am not going to claim I have read them all and would be challenged if I dared to say so) again from the United States of America; from the National Bureau of Standards, the Law Enforcement Standards Laboratory, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the Federal Communications Commission&#x2014;which I am told is equivalent to our own Home Office in these matters. These documents make it quite clear that as far back as 1977 there was available equipment which was not susceptible to radio interference. I must just accept the evidence given to me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00990">Often, because of their absence of technical knowledge, many motorists are not in a position to challenge evidence about equipment when they are caught for speeding offences. Where technical knowledge has been available to the defence, in a large number of cases the prosecutions have been dismissed or withdrawn. It was mentioned in our debate at Report stage that there is not a large list, but there is a substantial list where prosecutions have been dismissed or have been withdrawn. For instance, I know that a substantial number of cases in Avon, Somerset and Nottinghamshire were withdrawn on those grounds. I am sure everyone will agree that this is most unsatisfactory. We want to have thorough reliance on any equipment, and we want to have the best equipment for the police to use.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00991">At Report stage I referred to the awareness of certain documents of which I requested confirmation. One was said to be a memo from the Association of Chief Police Officers which stated that the Home Office quite clearly wanted to bring pressure on the police to adopt a British standard. I hope that is correct because the amendment I am moving proposes this; that there should be a performance standard. I hope that your Lordships will appreciate that this amendment is put forward not as carping criticism and not from any campaigning outlook. We want the police to have the best equipment. We want it to be effective equipment&#x2014;and it must be equipment upon which everyone in the country can place some reliance. Therefore, we want the simple words added at the end of the Government's own clause:
<quote>"in regulations conforming to a performance standard specified in those regulations."</quote></p>
<col>184</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00992">This is such an important matter, involving only a few important words, that I hope the Government will make it a hat trick and accept this amendment. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00993">7.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00994"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has led us with great elegance on to fairly well-trodden ground on which both his footprints and mine are already clearly marked. I fear therefore that I may have to repeat a little of what I said before. The amendment falls into two halves. First, there is the reference to a performance standard; secondly, there is the link with regulations. As I understand it, although "performance standard" is a term of the art understood by engineers, it has no legal meaning as such. It is, presumably, derived from the references to the British Standards Institution which were included in the noble Lord's previous amendment. Having persuaded him to drop that reference, I fear that I may seem to he ungrateful if I point out that without the reference to a performance standard, the amendment makes no sense. It would mean that a standard would have to be defined, and its items listed. Then, if we were to follow the noble Lord's wishes, we would have to turn this list into regulations, and I have two fundamental doubts about this.<lb/>
First, if and when the scientists decided that the performance standards needed to be changed and, say, certain minimum standards raised, we would have to allow time to make regulations before passing on to the public the benefits of that conclusion. That seems to me to be an unnecessary use of parliamentary time.<lb/>
Secondly, we do have a perfectly good system already which was introduced with the advent of the breath testing equipment which we use. Because of public interest in the equipment and the innovation in the law which it represented when it was introduced, it was felt necessary to have the Home Secretary approve it. The equipment and the change in law was extremely controversial at the time. Yet Parliament did not think it necessary then to have the approval done by regulations. The system has worked perfectly well ever since. Our scientists evaluate the equipment put to them by manufacturers and advise the Secretary of State on its suitability. I think I should say that the work of our scientists in this field is of a very high order and held in great esteem abroad as well as in this country. It is upon their evaluation and advice that the Secretary of State bases his approval, or, as the case may be, his refusal to approve, items of equipment, and if he does decide on their advice that approval should be given he signs an order known as an approval order; this is printed by Her Majesty's Stationery Office and available on sale to the public. The latest one put out costs 20p.<lb/>
In any case where a driver wishes to be sure that the equipment he was tested on was approved by the Secretary of State or where he suspects that it was not, he can require the prosecution to give evidence to that effect, which it will do by producing the approval order for that equipment. This system has worked perfectly well since 1968. It is flexible, but it gives the required degree of oversight. No helpful innovation is slowed down by it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0101"/>
<col>185</col>
As to the innovations in Florida, I regret that my knowledge of what has been proposed there is not up to that of the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, but if it is of service to him I will be happy to see that it is put before the scientists who will be doing these evaluations. Their advice, I think, is as valid as any given to the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, and indeed it is British. I would strongly urge that what is rightly regarded as an appropriate procedure for the extremely complex breath testing equipment, which I think has gone through six marks since it was developed, should also be accepted as appropriate for this equipment. I must ask your Lordships to resist this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00995"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will have listened, as it always does, with the greatest of care to what the noble Lord the Minister has said. In addition to being, I hope, courteous, I wish I could follow with an expression of confidence in what he has said. First of all, to make a comparison with the breath testing equipment is really not to provide a correct analogy at all. One knows perfectly well that that breath testing equipment, first of all, is a colour changing equipment and therafter is a measurement of content of alcohol if an analysis is taken. That does not need the same absolute precision that corroborative evidence in regard to speeding offences requires.<lb/>
If your Lordships would look at the very words of the present Bill to which my noble friend referred you would find that all that is provided for here is that the instrument in question shall be "of a type" which is specified. So when the noble Lord says this is going to satisfy everybody because if objection is taken on behalf of any defendant all the prosecution has to do is to produce an order of the Home Secretary&#x2014;I think it is the Secretary of State for Transport not the Secretary of State for Home Affairs&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00996"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord is asking who would authorise, I understand it would be the Home Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00997"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged; I was right the first time. It could only be evidence brought before the court that it was of a type. It would not be the evidence which I think this House requires, which is that it shall be of a standard which has been approved by the Secretary of State. This is merely of a type which has been approved.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Minister said by way of objection to the present amendment that there is no language known to the law which can define the words used in this amendment with precision. If that be an argument of the Government, may I say that there is no precise definition known to the law of the word "type". Indeed, I cannot think of a more general, vague term to cast before any court at all.<lb/>
So this amendment seeks to do something which must be sensible. The noble Lord the Minister, in language which was so well chosen, spoke about walking down a road which has been well trodden. May I invite him to walk a little further down that road, which is all that is required of him in order to meet the valid point that this amendment makes. It is this: do not just have it as a "type" but as a "standard" which is set down in regulations. That standard, one
<col>186</col>
imagines, will be there for a very long time before it requires to be altered by any subsequent regulation. That was the only other objection the Minister had to this amendment.<lb/>
It is a question of principle which is involved. It is a question of whether this House in doing its duty really tries to solve the problem that has been thrown up in the courts and with motoring associations and with the police, too. Are we going to try and solve it properly by laying down a standard, or are we going to play with it by merely talking about approval of a type of instrument by the Secretary of State. I invite the House, as does my noble friend, to grasp the nettle and see that this problem is solved now that we have another Transport Bill before us. The number of Transport Bills we have had is such that one rather imagines that a Government in drawing up future legislative programmes are going to require a lot of persuasion before we have a chance of legislating on this important matter again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00998"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, in moving this amendment has given so much trouble and research to it that I am quite persuaded that the term "performance standard" is a reassurance to a motorist who will be convicted by this equipment. I give just one example. Will this equipment show the same speed in all weather conditions? Electronics are particularly susceptible to weather conditions. A performance standard of the kind mentioned in the amendment would be a reassurance to a motorist that the device used is going to register the same numbers regardless of the time of year or the weather.<lb/>
I do not go along with the Minister in comparing this with the very stringent laboratory tests that have no doubt been taken with the breathalyser. This is a different type of equipment; it is used out of doors, having to work in much more difficult conditions electronically, and having to provide a much more difficult answer than would chemical analysis. I do not think that argument can hold up a lot of reassurance for motorists who are going to be penalised under this Bill. I am very happy with what the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, said, and I believe the terms of this amendment are constructive and reassuring to motorists who are perhaps going to be penalised under this clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-00999"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I might say to my noble friend that I am a little unhappy about the word "type". In the Navy, for example, radio transmitters are called types. We used to talk about the type 691; they probably have more modern ones now. The type 691 was approved as a type for introduction into the naval service. I had a small hand in that happening. But it did not mean to say that every type 691 radio transmitter was effective all the time; they broke down and had to be repaired. Therefore, the use of the word "type", as I believe the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, indicated, is not wholly satisfactory in meeting the requirement that the particular equipment in use at the time should be effective and, as proposed in the amendment, up to the standard required.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0102"/>
<col>187</col>
As we are talking about a clause which was a Government amendment and which is, therefore, able to be amended further in another place, as I understand the rules, I hope that the Government might give thought, even if they do not like this amendment, to proceeding further with a slightly better wording than exists at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01000">7.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01001"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to make a few comments. During previous stages of the Bill I have expressed doubts about this method of testing speed. With the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, I share certain misgivings. However, I do not feel that those misgivings will disappear by accepting the amendment. I would be very reluctant to have the detailed regulations put before Parliament to be discussed by parliamentarians who, with the greatest respect to all of them, might have scant knowledge of the technical matters put before them.<lb/>
I rest very solidly on the work done by Home Office laboratories. I have mentioned this fact before in your Lordships' House, in particular with regard to those instruments developed for breath and for other analysis. I know exactly what I mean by a performance standard. I think it is more an engineering term than a legal term. My noble friend should accept that it is better that Home Office scientists should prescribe what the instrument shall do and then work towards it rather than&#x2014;I shall he a little frivolous, if I may&#x2014;scan the <i>Exchange &#x0026; Mart</i> for a few odd instruments of a like type and say: "We shall check these to see if they meet the criteria". That would be the wrong way to go about it. If my noble friend says that "performance standard" has no lawful form, I think he will at least understand what all of us mean by "lawful form".<lb/>
There is one other matter that worries me and that is the "type". It also worries the noble Lord, Lord Underhill. If the objections voiced by the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Mishcon and, indeed, my noble friend Lord Mottistone, have value&#x2014;I think they have&#x2014;the easiest course for the Government is to remove some of the words from line 8 on page 74 when the Bill goes to another place. The words at present read:
<quote>"unless the device is of a type approved by the Secretary of State".</quote>
If we remove the words,
<quote>"of a type",</quote>
we rest with,
<quote>"unless the device is approved by the Secretary of State".</quote>
That is quite simple and narrows everything down. We end up with instruments that are approved, not just some loose fringe area of them.<lb/>
I believe that developments in fields of this nature are so fast that Parliament could not keep up with the changes that would be required if we had regulations. My noble friend the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the major criticisms. The general debate that has followed should appraise police forces of Parliament's doubts and fears. If they cannot take a hint from that, I doubt very much whether we could ever write anything in any Bill which would achieve that object. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, will not press the matter further on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<col>188</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01002"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord does press the amendment, I shall vote with the Government, but I hope that the Government will heed the arguments that have been put forward. I am not at all impressed with the matter being left to the Home office experts without guidance on a scale that might be envisaged in the words of the amendment. I shall explain why I am not entirely happy. The example I am about to give is not completely analogous but it is enough to disturb one's confidence. I remember a situation where application was made to erect a building that had to house inflammable materials. In one area it was left in the hands of the local people without the sort of guidance that ought to have been coming from the top. The answer was given that the building should have a concrete roof of a certain thickness, that the doors and shelving must be made of steel. That advice seemed very logical and sound. The plans were prepared and the building erected according to that general guidance.<lb/>
A short time later a similar building had to be erected in an area not more than nine or 10 miles away. When the plans were submitted showing a concrete roof, steel doors and shelves the applicants were told, "No, the building must have a very flimsy roof with shelves made of wood and the doors of ordinary asbestos". It was considered less dangerous to allow any possible explosion to disperse rather than seek to contain it in a rigid fashion.<lb/>
I do not know which was right, but I do know that it is difficult to follow exactly where one stands. The same thing could apply to motorists. They are disturbed at this modern way of one man being able to use a piece of electronic equipment. If the words that the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Mishcon have in mind are intended to give a clearer guidance on what is wanted and are likely to give a little more satisfaction to people who will be victims, I should have thought it would be worth having another look at the wording, and if not accept the amendment, at least go some way towards meeting the spirit behind the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01003"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, expressed reservations about the amendment on the ground that he had, in turn, reservations about the possibility of matters coming before your Lordships' House and the other place on which parliamentarians would not have a full understanding. The noble Lord shakes his head. Perhaps I misunderstood him and, if so, it is my fault. I was merely about to say that if that were the consequence of this amendment being accepted it would not be the first time that such a situation had arisen: where we had to reach a judgment with such advice&#x2014;technical and otherwise&#x2014;as might come to us. As has already been said, although it is not necessary to repeat it, there is no comparison between the situation under this clause and that of drunken driving or driving with an excessive amount of alcohol in one's blood and the use of the breathalyser. For my part, having listened to the debate, I would certainly hope that the Government would accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01005"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not usual for a Minister to speak twice on Third Reading, but I have had many challenges thrown down, many questions asked and the Opposition Front Bench have contrived to have two speeches already, so your Lordships may think it fair to allow me to speak again.<lb/>
I start with the question of the breath-testing machine to get that out of the way. First, it is of course already referred to in the Transport Act. The breath-testing equipment to which I refer is not the simple device to which I think the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, refers, but the very sophisticated evidential machinery which is highly accurate, scientifically complex and satisfactorily supervised by our scientists, who, I think, stand second to none in the world.<lb/>
To return to the more central matter of type approval, I fear that I may not have explained sufficiently to my noble friends and others what is implicit in this. I believe that it achieves what my noble friends what to achieve, because each individual instrument will be issued with a certificate of conformity to the type and the type&#x2014;that is, the platonic ideal, which, if you like, all these have to match&#x2014;will be that approved to perform in the way which is regarded as satisfactory&#x2014;in other words, to the standards which we regard as satisfactory. So the effect of the word "type" and the effect of the word "standard" in this context are identical.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01006"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend turns to another matter, perhaps I can ask him one question. He said that each piece of equipment will have a certificate. Who will issue the certificate? Will it be given by my noble friend's scientists? Will they look at all the equipment? Or will it be given by the makers and so be taken for granted that it will go on working properly?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01007"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the individual pieces of equipment will be tested by the scientists and they will then have a certificate of conformity to the type which is regarded as satisfactory by the Home Secretary because that piece of equipment performs to a standard which your Lordships would accept. That standard is that it will tell with a degree of accuracy and with a lack of deviation which would be satisfactory for a court.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, who has spent many years in a moister clime, is afraid that on a really wet day the equipment might not work. My scientists&#x2014;if I may so call them without any degree of anything, except pride&#x2014;are aware that it rains very heavily sometimes and that policemen go out in the rain to check the speed of vehicles. In addition to that, every instrument already has its calibration checked every day before it is used and any time that it may be put in doubt. I would expect that to be one of the things that would be required under the method that I propose.<lb/>
I turn now to the question of the parliamentary process. With the greatest respect to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, even if we go along with him in all that he said about the expertise of parliamentarians and its effect, the fact

remains that if it was suddenly discovered that regulations were required not to approve but to withdraw approval from a device, that also would have to go through the parliamentary process and there would be a very awkward time when a mistake could not be rectified and the machinery in use would be in question. That is what we all want to avoid. We also want to avoid diversity of standards. We want to be certain that everything is sufficient to testify or not to the judgment of a constable as to the speed of a vehicle.<lb/>
I can assure my noble friend Lord Harmar-Nicholls that whatever the vagaries of the case he mentioned&#x2014;and I shall be interested to hear of them afterwards because of my own interest in fire services as well, but I do not want to broaden the debate&#x2014;we shall not have a situation when one gets into Northamptonshire on the MI and be able to say "Let us put our foot down because they are using variety <i>X</i> of speed-testing equipment and that has a 25 per cent. accuracy deviation". I believe that what I propose is workable and practical. I am sorry if the terminology that I have used has confused your Lordships. I believe that we have the right solution and I hope that your Lordships will give it a whirl and not accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01008"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, other noble Lords and I have stated that the Minister has gone a long way from his original stance on this matter, and that is very much appreciated. I am grateful to other noble Lords who have supported the spirit of the amendment. On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, I have seen regulations on constuction and use as regards motor-cars which, believe me, are very complicated. Yet these are available for the procedure of annulment. Therefore, I have no doubt that if Members of this House and of the other place can cope with that, they could cope with a regulation of this kind.<lb/>
The Minister has elaborated some additional words. I am certain that it will be very helpful if those additional words were looked at and added to the Government's own clause. I shall not say what the words should be; I think that one has to think about this. Frankly, this is not the sort of issue on which I would wish to divide the House. I should like to think that the Government would recognise that they still have one other opportunity, because the Government's clause is an amendment to the Bill when it left the other place. Therefore, the Lords amendments have to be considered in the other place and it is possible, from my understanding of procedure, that it can be amended in the other place.<lb/>
Not one noble Lord has said that the Government's words are absolutely satisfactory. It may be that there is a defect in the amendment which I have proposed, but I would like to think that the Government would say, "We agree that it is not the sort of thing upon which we ought to vote because many people outside have not listened to a single word that we have said". It is a non-party issue. Heaven knows which way they would vote because there are no Whips on. Therefore, I would much prefer the Government to say that many views have been expressed by people who want something different.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0104"/>
<col>191</col>
At the end of his remarks the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said that a piece of equipment would be approved. This is something that noble Lords and I want to avoid. We want a performance standard to be laid down so that any piece of equipment should conform to it. The equipment is then set against that standard. That seems to me to be the sensible thing to do. On Report a number of noble Lords emphasised this far better than I am. This is what our amendment would try to achieve.<lb/>
I am prepared to accept that the words in my amendment may not have proper meaning, but other noble Lords have said that the Government need to have some elaboration. It would be very helpful to the House if the Minister&#x2014;and I am not asking him to make a commitment&#x2014;could take this last opportunity before the Lords' amendments go to the Commons to look at what has been said by various noble Lords today. I believe that that would be very helpful. I hope that that will be the attitude taken because, despite my unwillingness to test the House, a principle is involved here in that we want to have a proper understanding between the motorist who is booked for a speeding offence and the police. At the moment, there is considerable dissatisfaction with the equipment being used. It may be that the equipment is all right. But there is a feeling among the public that this equipment is not properly evaluated.<lb/>
That is the principle here and I hope the Government will feel that they can accept my suggestion. I make it quite clear. We ask that they do it without any commitment; that they have an open mind, with no commitment to make a change. Let them look at it to see whether it is possible to make a change. Before I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, I should like the Government to make that statement.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 74, line 9, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("() The device shall be operated in accordance with an operating standard specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01014">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is the third amendment dealing with Clause 62 and the radar speed equipment. This amendment does not rest upon what happened to the previous amendment, because there has been so much criticism about the need for the proper operation of equipment. At the Committee stage the Minister emphasised that in one of the court cases to which I referred the judge had stressed that the equipment has to he properly operated. I readily accept that we not only want a proper standard for the equipment but it has to be properly operated.</p>
<col>192</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01015">Therefore, this amendment asks that in dealing with prosecutions the device must be such that it is operated in accordance with an operating standard again specified in regulations made by the Secreary of State. This again would seem to be simple. Everybody agrees that there must be good operating standards. The Minister has said that careful attention is being given to this, and the simple thing to do would be to put this subsection in to supplement the Government's own clause. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01016"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I come in at this juncture to speak to this amendment. It also gives me the opportunity to assure the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, that I meant no discourtesy whatsoever to eminent scientists. What I was worried about was that if we go too far down the road of requiring so much to be brought before Parliament we might he in danger of getting a technical specification written into regulations which so few of us would he able to deal with in a parliamentary process. That is all I meant.<lb/>
So far as this amendment is concerned, again because I have in previous stages expressed sympathy for the general tenor of what is included here, I have to say that in general terms I accept the principle behind Lord Underhill's amendment, but for exactly the same reasons as I suggested when we discussed his previous amendment I do not think this is wholly practicable. Certainly if we get as far as the Home Office approving a piece of equipment, it follows that the method of operation will also be included in such certification, and I suppose it would be up to a defendant to prove that the equipment was not operated in conformity with the manufacturer's standard.<lb/>
I cannot see that setting out an operating procedure in a regulation is necessarily going to ensure that the regulation is carried out. I have greater faith than my noble friend Lord Harmar-Nicholls in the work done by the Home Office laboratories. Certainly in connection with the new screening device, prior to the use of an evidential breath-testing device in the instructions given to the police as to the operation of that instrument, how often it should be checked, tested, and so on, they even went so far as to say that unless the screening device is used regularly the equipment would have to be withdrawn from service because it would not fall within the bands acceptable. In certain areas of the country that device is not used because it does not conform to the standards. I think much the same could he said with regard to the operating instructions.<lb/>
I feel that we ought now to accept what has been proposed as a fairly major step towards removing the doubts most of us have had at one time and to see what transpires over the next two or three years. I should not like to go further with this particular amendment at this stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01017"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too do not really support this amendment. I would hope that my noble friend would be able to assure me that when the device is of a type approved by the Secretary of State that will automatically include operating instructions going with it, because one would imagine that they are
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0105"/>
<col>193</col>
always supplied. In any case, the key point in this amendment is that they shall be operated correctly. My concern is that the operator himself may not be properly trained in the use of the equipment, and I should like to have seen something about training of the police in this amendment if I were to support it. It has not got that, and therefore I do not support it. But I should like a bit of reassurance from my noble friend about the operating procedure automatically being of a type that is approved, and about proper arrangements to train the police to use them as part of the way in which he would hope to handle it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01018"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I repeat a small section of my earlier argument your Lordships will forgive me if I do so briefly. It is simply to draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that we again have the term "operating standard" standing free, as it were, of British Standards which makes the amendment in that sense weaker than the noble Lord would wish.<lb/>
What in general terms we propose to do would be to consider the best operating practice while we are studying the equipment and recommend that best practice to the police in our guidance. This is very simple, and above all flexible. Consider if you will the position that would arise if the performance standard were defined in regulations as the noble Lord wishes, and our scientists discovered that a particular procedure in the standard was in fact producing misleading results. If the standard is defined in regulations it can only be changed by regulations. We could not instruct the police informally to change a particular procedure, because although this would be in the public interest any test carried out in this manner would be unlawful. This would mean that a person checked in the "reformed" manner, if I can call it that, could claim to a court that the check was not properly carried out, and the evidence would therefore fall. This is exactly the kind of legal morass which we have only just taken steps to pull ourselves out of in the context of drunken driving.<lb/>
I do not think we want to get into it again with radar. To avoid this situation the police would have to stop using the equipment until the new regulation was made. I cannot see that this would be in the public interest. By contrast, using our own approval method, any change in recommended practice would be communicated to the police immediately by telex and followed by Home Office circular without any legal complications or delay ensuing.<lb/>
Exactly where the instructions that might be issued with the equipment when it was first taken into service would fit into that I cannot exactly tell my noble friend Lord Mottistone, but I have the point about instructions with equipment firmly on board from the last stage, and I shall have it very much in mind when we are devising the way in which this is to be done. I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, is trying to serve the public by proposing regulations for operating procedures, but I fear that what in fact would result would have the opposite effect. Therefore, regretfully but firmly, I must ask your Lordships not to support this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01019"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has given some cogent reasons why this particular amendment

<col>195</col>
Transport Bill I have brought before this House. His persistence and persuasiveness is always tempered with courtesy. A challenge it may be, but it is never less than a pleasure to debate with him. Once more he has been ably and, if I may say so, as always, eloquently supported by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, a dynamic duo indeed. His advocacy is invariably formidable and impressive and he too is very hard to deny&#x2014;but we did our best! May I also mention my noble friend Lord Lucas, who has again demonstrated his considerable expertise in the transport sector. The more I have him on my side, the better I feel. Needless to say, I am grateful to the many other noble Lords who have made valuable contributions.<lb/>
It has been some little time since we considered Part I of the Bill which paves the way for the introduction of private capital into the National Bus Company's express and coach holiday businesses, and into certain property developments and improvements. It is part of the Government's continuing programme for involving the private sector in the activities of the nationalised industries.<lb/>
National Express is already the market leader in the provision of scheduled inter-city coach services. It is a commercial business, which the Government believe could and should flourish in the private sector, drawing on market finance and not on the taxpayer for its investment capital. The same is true of the smaller coach tour business, National Holidays. As regards property, the NBC has particularly welcomed the opportunities which privatisation will give them to upgrade their passenger facilities and realise the full potential of their property assets.<lb/>
I understand very well that the Opposition have a basic philosophical difficulty with the policy underlying Part I. Nonetheless, we have had some useful debates. I recall particularly the wise contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Byers; and, on a variety of practical matters, from my noble friend Lord Teviot. Your Lordships have shown that even where there are such fundamental differences in approach, it is possible in this House to have a sensible exchange of views.<lb/>
I know from our very useful debates on Part II of the Bill that there is very little between the Government and noble Lords opposite. The overriding concern of us all has been to ensure that under any new private sector testing scheme, the testing of lorries and buses is carried out safely and impartially. The clauses which make up Part II of the Bill set out to ensure that a private sector testing scheme will operate with the consistency, smoothness and high standards which are so valued in the present testing system. These are the aims we have in mind and I know that they are shared by noble Lords on all sides of the House.<lb/>
As your Lordships will recall, we have announced our intention of transferring the testing system to Lloyds Register Vehicle Testing Authority. LRVTA will be able to maintain the high safety standards and impartiality to which the industry and everyone in this House rightly attaches importance; they will also be well placed to develop the system and offer an improved service to the vehicle operators.<lb/>
Noble Lords will appreciate that there is a mass of detail concerning the day to day running of the system
<col>196</col>
that needs to be agreed with Lloyds Register before we can conclude a final agreement. Work is proceeding, however, and I hope to be able to come to the House with further news before long. I know that a number of noble Lords&#x2014;I have in mind particularly the noble Lords, Lord Mishcon and Lord Underhill, and my noble friend Lord Lucas, felt that as the Government had decided the best course would be to transfer testing to a single non-profit-making organisation, then the Bill should be amended to rule out any other option.<lb/>
The Government are confident that our negotiations with Lloyds Register will prove successful and that the resulting testing system will be an excellent one; but that is not to say the path we have chosen is the only possible route available. It would be short-sighted indeed to decide now on one particular solution and embody this in legislation which would leave no room in the future for flexibility, development natural growth and change. The House will be aware, however, that the Government are not asking for a <i>carte blanche</i> here; the appointment of the testing authority, whether it be LRVTA or any other body, is subject to the approval of Parliament.<lb/>
There has also been some feeling that a ban on any connection between the body appointed to carry out testing and the motor trade should be written into the legislation. The proposal that LRVTA should take over testing, of course, meets the substance of this point. They will have no connection with the manufacture, sale or repair of commercial vehicles. Nevertheless, it is the Government's view that it would be wrong to rule out for ever and a day any possibility of the involvement of any body with commercial interests. The Bill has been specifically designed to provide a structure within which any commercial interests can be safely controlled. If it were decided that some commercial interest could safely be allowed&#x2014;I stress again that Parliament itself will take that decision&#x2014;there are powers in Clause 8 to impose conditions on the way in which the testing business was managed.<lb/>
As I said earlier, there has never been much between us on this part of the Bill. I am only sorry that our customary generosity did not allow us to accept some amendments of noble Lords opposite, and, for that matter, of my noble friends. The Government believe the future of the testing of buses and lorries lies firmly in the private sector. The clauses in Part II of the Bill seek to achieve this by providing a basis for introducing new management and new approaches, which the Government believe will improve the system and benefit the industry. But they go further and also provide for proper controls on how the new powers may be used. And I repeat again, the final say rests with Parliament itself.<lb/>
The proposals in Part III of the Bill to improve and extend the fixed penalty system for road traffic offences are not a party issue. Our objectives&#x2014;to achieve an efficient system which will save police and court time and also be acceptable to the motorist&#x2014;are, I am sure, shared on all sides of the House, although it would be fair to say that there has not always been agreement that what the Government are proposing is the best way of achieving them. However, the Government were able to respond positively to suggestions in
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0107"/>
<col>197</col>
another place and in your Lordships' House itself, and I hope that it will be felt that we have proceeded in a way that tried to meet the point of achieving the very best.<lb/>
Finally, I turn to what in the event has proved to be the topic provoking perhaps most interest or discussion; that is, the introduction for an experimental period of immobilisation devices or wheel clamps. Here, too, we have had very constructive debate and helpful suggestions. As a result we have been able to improve the clause, I believe to the satisfaction of the whole House, for which I thank all who have contributed their views to our discussion, not least the noble Baroness, Lady Denington. It made a pleasant change to have her as a supporter on this point.<lb/>
We have also introduced a number of new items into the Bill. I should mention my noble friend Lord Mottistone, at whose initiative we have included a provision on motorcycle visors, and the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, for the measure relating to builders' skips. I think that the Bill will bring worthwhile improvements on a number of important fronts across the transport sector. It is not a Bill that we seek to defend in terms of party dogma, but rather as a series of sound, practical measures, which I hope will be welcomed by everyone with a genuine interest in the subject of transport. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01035">8.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01036"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, I should like to echo the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, and say how much on this side of the House we have appreciated the able, effective and very courteous way in which the team of Ministers have handled the Bill in all its stages. As the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, has said, this is the third occasion on which he and I&#x2014;I was going to say during the short period of office of the Government&#x2014;have handled transport Bills. We understand that another one is threatened for next year, so presumably we shall go through this kind of procedure again.<lb/>
I am very grateful to the noble Lord for the always courteous way in which he handled affairs, and I am grateful, too, to the team of Ministers who so ably assisted him. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate have emulated the courteous way in which the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, handled matters. So long as it does not hurt his position, I should also like to echo what has been said about the noble Earl, Lord Avon, who had to bear part of the brunt of the Bill when the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, was not here, and we are grateful to the noble Earl for that. I should also like to thank my own colleague Lord Mishcon for his splendid help and unstinting co-operation at all stages of the Bill.<lb/>
The Government have acted somewhat like Jekyll and Hyde over the Bill. In Parts I and II they acted as hard politicians, not deviating one jot, but in regard to the other Parts they showed that they were prepared to listen and so have greatly improved the Bill. I shall like first to say a few words about the unhappy Part. As the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, has said, Part I of the Bill could provide for the eventual disposal of all the subsidiaries of the National Bus Company, because the powers are there. The Government have said that
<col>198</col>
they intend to confine the use of the powers to National Express Coaches, National Holidays, and the property company; but the powers are there if it is wished to use them in the future.<lb/>
It might be asked, why did we not put down any amendments at today's Third Reading? The reason is very simple. At Committee and Report stages we put forward amendments of every possible version to try to improve Part I of the Bill. We wanted to leave out National Express; we wanted to ensure that the National Bus Company would retain 50 per cent. minimum holding, or alternatively, a 26 per cent. holding, which would give it considerable control. We made efforts to try to secure that nothing would be done to impair the integration of services available to the travelling public. All those things we tried to do, but they were swept aside, as were amendments that endeavoured to limit the very sweeping powers of the Secretary of State in giving instructions to the National Bus Company. The National Bus Company is a very successful undertaking, so is National Express Coaches, and it is significant that when a company in public ownership is successful that is when the Government want to mutilate it and destroy it; and that has happened in this case.<lb/>
Part II of the Bill deals with the transfer of the testing of heavy goods vehicles and passenger service vehicles to the private sector. Again, we put forward no amendments today because we had exhausted all possibilities. We tried in every way possible either to improve the Government's proposals, or to safeguard the future. Naturally, we hope that the transfer to Lloyd's will be efficient, but if it is not, there is nothing in the Bill to guarantee that there will be one, single organisation to take over the testing, which is what we wanted. I say "we" wanted, but I point out that on that occasion the Opposition were speaking not on behalf of, but with the full support of, the operators in the industry, who wanted to continue with the present system. I do not at this hour want to go through the whole history of the matter.<lb/>
The Government say that they introduced this particular part of the Bill in order to achieve flexibility. But why was it necessary to have complicated machinery of eight clauses to deal with the testing of heavy goods vehicles and public service vehicles, with which all the operators are already thoroughly satisfied? The Government are destroying the system which the operators wish to continue.<lb/>
So in Parts I and II of the Bill the Government are clearly carrying out their doctrinaire policy, and I point out that no one will find a word about it in the Tory election manifesto. They had no mandate at all from the electors for either or both of these measures. Now perhaps I may turn to happier times, because in regard to Parts III and IV of the Bill the Government showed that they were willing to listen, and considerable improvements were made. For that we are very grateful to the Ministers. I believe that with regard to Parts III and IV the Bill will go back to the other place a far better Bill than it was when it came to your Lordships House. Valuable contributions were made not only from the Opposition, but from all parts of the House. That, if as a relatively new Member I may say so, showed the House of Lords at its best, discussing
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0108"/>
<col>199</col>
matters of great importance, but prepared to give and take.<lb/>
Where there were Divisions, it was interesting to see how the House divided. Sometimes it did not divide, it split in all directions. On one occasion we proved our openness on an issue, with my noble friend Lord Mishcon and I disagreeing from the Opposition Front Bench, putting forward two different viewpoints, showing that these were matters on which there was no party Whip at all, but matters which we wished the House to consider.<lb/>
I am grateful&#x2014;I shall not say for the concessions, because that would sound wrong. I am grateful that the Ministers have seen that a number of matters needed improving and have accepted comments that were made to them. I believe that Parts III and IV of the Bill have been greatly improved to everyone's benefit.<lb/>
Before closing I should like to refer to three matters. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate said that he would look at the possibility of giving guidance to the courts, so that a Scots motorist who did not have his licence when in England and Wales would not face a penalty larger than would be the case had a constable been able to issue a fixed penalty notice at the roadside. Another matter&#x2014;and I understand from the noble Earl, Lord Avon, that this has already been set in motion&#x2014;concerns consultation with the Metropolitan Police in particular with regard to the use of police records when dealing with persistent offenders and using wheel clamps, which I think is what everybody desires.<lb/>
My last point is on fixed penalties. Here again I am asking for another concession from the Government. We have reached a hat trick today; it has been very comforting. In view of the strong representations made by noble Lords from all parts of the House concerning various aspects of fixed penalties procedure, I wonder whether the Minister can give an assurance that there will be undertaken or can promise to consider, a careful review of the operation of the procedure, say within a period of two or three years. If something could be extended in this regard, it would be very helpful. I believe that your Lordships have made many improvements, but it would be comforting to know that after a certain period the whole procedure would be reviewed. Having said that, I should like to add finally that I think we have had useful debates on the Bill. It is a pity that we were not given concessions in regard to Parts I and II to match the very happy atmosphere that there was in relation to Parts III and IV.</membercontribution></p>

but I think that perhaps there is a chance that the Government will improve on it in their next Transport Bill. I hope that the cyclist will be given a better run for his money. If there are to be miscellaneous provisions in a future Bill, as I hope there will be, I look forward&#x2014;this is a new era&#x2014;to seeing their intentions in this respect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01040"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on reaching this stage of the Bill may I thank all four of my noble friends who have piloted this Bill through your Lordships' House for their very great help, and where I have not previously expressed personal thanks for the discussions and conversations which have taken place I do so now. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, I welcome very much Part I of this Bill and look forward to an expansion of the National Bus Company's operation. So far as Part II is concerned, I must confess to having some few reservations, and I shall look forward to seeing the complete plans of the Lloyd's authority in due course. I hope that the industry which the testing system serves&#x2014;it is not in fact the other way round&#x2014;will indeed be satisfied and share the Government's confidence.<lb/>
Much of Parts III and IV of the Bill has been concerned with (if perhaps I may so describe them) the more mundane matters, which involve relationships between the officers of the law and the motorist. I still wonder whether in fact we are not piling too much responsibility on the police in an area which, to say the least, is most delicate. When one hears from all sides of the House the number of cases which go before magistrates' courts which arise from motoring offences, one becomes extremely worried, and to add further responsibilities seems to me to be something of a pity.<lb/>
I am particularly sorry&#x2014;and your Lordships will appreciate it&#x2014;that Clause 42 has been removed from the Bill. During the short time Clause 42 was part of the Bill it received wide publicity and acceptance. I therefore hope that the Government will take note of the views of your Lordships' House and of the public, and will take the earliest opportunity to review the fixed penalty system as regards speeding offences. Because, if I may remind the House, there has been no argument that speeding falls into a number of groups. There are those speeding offences which are very serious, those which are serious and those which are certainly less serious; and yet no provision has been made.<lb/>
How the Magistrates' Association can contend that the inclusion of the then Clause 42 would have added to their work is beyond me. Indeed, if one looks at the table of offences and at the number of offences for speeding one sees that there are, I think it is, 348,000 alone that might have been dealt with by a fixed penalty and which therefore might never have gone to court, so the magistrates would have been relieved of that burden. Having said that, the Secretary of State has powers under Clause 29 to review, and whether my noble friend Lord Avon describes the present time as being premature for the fining of the law, I suggest that he and his colleagues keep very much before them the opportunity of fining the law particularly in that respect.<lb/>

<col>201</col>
I thought there was to be no Transport Bill next year. I recall coming back in 1981 from a summer holiday to deal with the most contentious of subjects, such as road humps. This year it has been clamping devices. I thought that next year we were to have a sabbatical. I shall look forward to hearing from my noble friend just what is proposed for next year. I hope that we shall get it a little earlier in the Session, so that we do not have the enormous rush and the great burden that we have had this summer, and the unhappy business of having a Summer Recess and then having to pick up the threads of the very important parts of this Bill right at the end of the Session, which has not made the work of your Lordships' House or, indeed, of my noble friends any easier.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GATT Ministerial Meeting</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01042">8.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01043"><member>Lord Greenhill of Harrow</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what are their objectives for the GATT Ministerial Meeting in November 1982. The noble Lord said: My Lords, when I put my Question down for debate I did not anticipate that it would come to this House at this rather unsocial hour, and I am sorry that your Lordships' day has been prolonged for this discussion. But these are matters of some moment, and I think that at the present time it is very useful to have a short discussion on the coming GATT Ministerial Meeting. It is 10 years since such a meeting took place, and it is, I think your Lordships will agree, long overdue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01044">I think one could be easily cynical about a meeting where 70 or more Ministers arrive with complex briefs, but I believe that this coming meeting is one in which Ministers may be able to achieve what officials have been unable to achieve. Although some interesting ministerial statements have been made on this subject, particularly by the Minister for Trade, Mr. Rees, we cannot ignore the inestimable advantage of having the responsible Minister in this House, and we know we can rely upon him for lucid exposition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01045">The present state of international trade must be a matter of the greatest concern to all of us, and what is profoundly disturbing is the spectacle of deeply bitter conflicts between countries we normally regard as our friends and to whom we customarily look for cooperation in the solution of current problems. I see by Reuter's "ticker" that there have been fighting words this afternoon in the other place about our quarrels with the United States, and these are very unhealthy symptoms. The GATT was designed to minimise these conflicts and to try to resolve them by the operation of mutually accepted rules. The present situation should not be permitted to continue, and we must look expectantly to the coming meeting.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01046">It is obvious that discussions will be exceedingly difficult, and, of course, I shall not be asking the Minister to anticipate positions which he will reveal in the course of the conference. But I think the House would like to hear some general observations in response to a series of questions which I should like to
<col>202</col>
put to him. The first is: What are the future prospects of the GATT? The whole system is by no means universally accepted. The developing countries are latecomers, and in many cases understandably show varying degrees of hostility towards it. But the founder members and the traditional supporters in the present difficult trading conditions also show scant respect for the rules. I assume that Her Majesty's Government will reaffirm the aims of GATT but will seek also to improve the existing organisation rather than explore alternatives to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01047">The second question I want to put is: Is the Minister satisfied that in the forthcoming negotiations we shall be able to take advantage of the collective strength of the EEC? If I remember correctly, in our debates on the Tokyo Round two years ago we concluded that the United Kingdom in fact benefited from its membership of the EEC. Will this be true again? I understand that the EEC is to be represented not, as one might expect, by one delegation; but by Ministers from all member countries plus the relevant commissioners. This may well be inevitable, but it will be very unfortunate if the full potential of the EEC is not going to be collectively employed in the discussions. What has the Minister to say on the prospects of this?</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01048">Thirdly, there is a justifiable view that the GATT has been ineffective in the matter of agriculture. It has tended to rely upon outdated agreements and, moreover, the EEC are here very much on the defensive with a rather unconvincing case that somehow these agricultural matters are internal to the Community and not within the scope of GATT responsibility. Is there not a need to negotiate new understandings that treat agricultural trade more like trade in manufactures? Not for the first time, the agricultural industry has a privileged position to the detriment of good international relations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01049">Fourthly, the Department of Trade representatives who gave evidence to our sub-committee rightly reminded us that the GATT has a twin purpose. It is an instrument for the liberalisation of world trade in goods and in services and also a policing instrument. In both these functions, the present situation is far from satisfactory. While the majority of Governments loudly proclaim the virtues of an open trading system, they all quietly intervene to expand their regulatory roles. There is therefore an increasing grey area between the white of the open trade system and the black of full protectionism. I wonder whether this is necessarily wrong. I am inclined to think not. Must we not in the present situation accept selective protectionism on an increasing scale, acting both as a nation and as a Community? A resounding call at the ministerial meeting to roll back the wave of protectionism which is advocated by some is surely inappropriate. One of the tasks of the ministerial meeting should be to clarify the safeguard procedure and I should like to hear the Minister's view of the possibility of this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01050">Fifthly, may I make a special reference to the liberalisation of services? This is a matter of increasing importance to this country, bearing in mind that the private sector trade in services, including return on overseas investment, accounts for around one-third of the total United Kingdom foreign earnings; and our service trades encounter many obstacles overseas.</p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0110"/>
<col>203</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01051">I would draw the Minister's attention to a report that he will be receiving, or may have received, on this subject from a sub-committee of the Committee on Invisible Exports. It merits careful study and I hope will become the basis of Her Majesty's Government's policy. In his speech to which I referred earlier, Mr. Rees referred to inching forward on these matters. Maybe that is a correct and realistic view of these difficult problems and the speed with which they can be tackled; but I hope that the Minister will have something more optimistic to say.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01052">8.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01053"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, both for raising this Unstarred Question this evening and for the way in which he has done so. I think I am right in saying that the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, has already set out some of the Government's aims in a speech last month, and we look forward to hearing him elaborating on that and perhaps filling in some of the details which may not have appeared in the British press.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, pointed out, this ministerial meeting next month is crucially important. As he reminded us, some 80 trade Ministers will be meeting together for what is the first meeting of its kind since 1973; and they meet at a very critical time. I think that the world has to choose&#x2014;and perhaps in this I take a slightly different line from that of the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill&#x2014;broadly speaking, between the multilateral trading system and the system of managed trade through bilateral deals. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, said, the nations continue to proclaim their faith in the first while they keep moving towards the second. We on these Benches have no hesitation in stating once again our belief in the free multilateral trading system.<lb/>
At a meeting last month of world business leaders and economists, Mr. Kenneth Durham, who is the chairman of Unilever, warned that there would be enormous unemployment unless countries abandoned their "beggar-my-neighbour" policy aimed at keeping out imports. During the 10 years prior to OPEC, 1963 to 1973, the volume of trade increased by 8&#x00BD; per cent. per annum and the volume of trade in manufactures by 11 per cent. In the following eight years both figures were halved, and last year there was no increase at all.<lb/>
In spite of the attention given to them in the Tokyo Round, non-tariff barriers have been taking over from tariffs as the principal obstacles to trade. There is a complex system of so-called voluntary restraints, orderly marketing arrangements, quantitative restrictions, surveillance of imports and administrative barriers to trade. As I said earlier, and as the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, said, the world has been moving away from the multilateral system to a system of managed trade.<lb/>
Article 19 of the GATT provides for action against the imports of a particular commodity from all the sources, from all the countries supplying it, where there is a sudden surge of imports. Increasingly, however, this provision is not used; but countries make the selective arrangements to which the noble Lord referred with particular countries outside the
<col>204</col>
GATT. The rate of imports affected by these selective arrangements outside the GATT in 1980 was 13 times the value of imports affected by the implementation of Article 19. I should like to join in asking the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, what are to be the Government's proposals with regard to the future of Article 19? Would they amend it in any way? Can he give any indication at this stage of what their safeguard policy is?<lb/>
My Lords, we all sympathise with the position of declining industries or distressed industries and understand their problems. The Multifibre Agreement is an attempt to deal with one such industry, but it cannot be denied that it is a serious source of friction with the developing world. Again, it operates outside the GATT and it has been described in the <i>Economist</i> magazine as a figleaf for protection. Are the Government in favour of that difficult subject being on the GATT agenda? It would seem that it should be.<lb/>
Another distressed industry is steel. I believe that an agreement on that between the EEC and the United States is imminent. One would be glad to see the matter solved for the moment, an agreement reached and trade war limited. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, has said, it is highly unsatisfactory that there should be this degree of trade hostility between allies. On the other hand, I think that I would have very strong reservations about this particular type of solution, even if we are forced into it in the meantime, because it is another example of voluntary restraint outside GATT.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, referred to agriculture, which is virtually outside the GATT, and he raised the question whether it should be brought more fully within it. Again, we find that the United States is at odds with the EEC over agricultural exports. The present United States Government, though proclaiming its faith in multilateral trade, is, as a recent report to the European Parliament has pointed out, less prepared to oppose protectionist trends in the United States than its predecessors.<lb/>
The United States Government complains about the common agricultural policy. They object to the subsidisation of exports. Yet the United States Government of the day specifically accepted the common agricultural policy during the Tokyo Round discussions, with its import levies and its export refunds, and the common agricultural policy is accepted by the GATT. The Community is the biggest net importer of agricultural products in the world. However, the inconsistencies of United States policy are no reason why the EEC agricultural policy should not be exposed to GATT scrutiny, particularly its effect on third world countries&#x2014;and agriculture is of enormous importance to the third world. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, will tell us that the British Government favour the inclusion of agriculture on the agenda. I believe that there is a proposal from Australia for a cease-fire on all protectionist measures. I wonder whether the noble Lord is in a position to say exactly what is meant by that and whether he can give some indication of the Government's reaction to it.<lb/>
The world recession has greatly strengthened protectionist trends. As someone said: "Recession has proved the mother of protectionist invention". The deflationary policies adopted voluntarily by some
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0111"/>
<col>205</col>
nations and at the behest of the International Monetary Fund by others have deepened the recession and increased protectionist pressure. The recent Brandt Report dealing with North-South relations was staunchly in favour of multilateral free trade, but it also advocated the maintenance of a high level of world demand. It seems to us on these Benches that it is in the context of what we might well call this global Keynesianism that protection is most likely to be defeated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01054">8.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01055"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should start by telling your Lordships that I am advised on what I have to say by the Food and Drink Industries Council; and, furthermore, I declare an interest in that I work for two of the trade associations that form part of that council, the Cocoa, Chocolate and Confectionary Alliance and the Cake and Biscuit Alliance. My main remarks will be concerned with the problems of the food and drink manufacturing industries which of course have a very special interest in these discussions and in their results.<lb/>
First of all, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, very much for introducing this subject. It offers to us an opportunity to give it an airing and more especially to hear my noble friend the Secretary of State tell us his views on it. I agreed broadly with what the noble Lords, Lord Greenhill and Lord Banks, had to say about agriculture in general.<lb/>
Regarding food and agricultural trade matters, I understand that the GATT secretariat have identified three principal areas of concern: market access, competition and the impact of national farm support measures. I should like very briefly to mention those points within those three headings that I think your Lordships may find interesting and on which in certain cases I hope my noble friend the Secretary of State can give us some guidance.<lb/>
First, market access. There is a need to focus attention on the worst obstacles. An example of such an obstacle is that import restrictions remain in force in the United States as a result of the United States waiver on agriculture which allows the United States Government to ignore GATT rules whenever domestic policy dictates.<lb/>
Another area is quantitative restrictions, and technical barriers in other major markets such as Japan and many of the more advanced developing countries are still a major problem for our exporters. Market access is also affected by measures such as voluntary restraint agreements&#x2014;export limitation: for example, manioc from Thailand&#x2014;variable levies permitted under Article XXIV (which allows the establishment of free trade areas) and state trading, none of which is regulated by GATT. We would welcome the proposed annual review of state trading where greater transparency would obviously be an advantage. Voluntary restraint agreements, on the other hand, are best left as bilateral instruments and not brought under GATT, since their eventual replacement by other measures could lead to greater protectionism. Variable levies form part of the common agricultural policy and are allowed by GATT in principle. I shall have more to say about that in a minute. But for certain products these variable
<col>206</col>
levies give rise to a degree of overprotection, thus adding to processors' costs. This is specially the case for products not available within the EEC in sufficient quantity or quality. I also hope that greater efforts are made to reduce substantially the tariff barriers for all types of product.<lb/>
I turn now to competition. This is the section that concerns the food and drinks industries most. Work should start on clarifying existing rules and on throwing light on the agreement struck between the United States and the EEC in the Tokyo Round on export subsidies. The major preoccupation of exporters is that export refunds on processed products could be placed in jeopardy. Exporters of processed food and drink products do not regard the refund as a subsidy. The function it performs is not to confer an advantage but to cancel out a disadvantage, namely, the high levels of EEC raw material prices arising from CAP support regimes. There is no doubt that without the refund EEC processed food and drink exporters would not be able to compete in world markets and would cease to function.<lb/>
I should add that this is particularly important not only for this country but for the other countries in the Community, because food and drink processing is the third highest industry in this country and I believe the fifth highest industry in terms of investment in the EEC as a whole. So it is a major industry for us and it is extremely important that it is not hampered as a result of a misconception about what the refunds are for.<lb/>
In March 1955 GATT passed resolutions on the disposal of surpluses and the liquidation of stocks which have become deadletters. GATT has now proposed to revive them and to set up consultation and notification procedures. This could act as a further discipline to restrict the EEC's use of large export refunds to dispose of surpluses of agricultural commodities resulting from overproduction at high cost. I emphasise that we make a distinction between refunds on surplus basic products and refunds on processed goods containing those basic products as ingredients.<lb/>
It is important, as I hope your Lordships will agree, that this distinction should be made. Export credit sales, aid and long-term supply contracts are measures giving competitive advantage to certain countries. One of the hidden ways in which the United States, for example, can compete unfairly vis-&#x00E0;-vis the EEC is through sales to developing countries which include favourable credit and other aids. Credit and aid tied to specific commercial transactions should be subject to international discussion and discipline.<lb/>
I now turn to the national agricultural policies. GATT is likely to agree proposals that there should be a new framework for co-operation among the main agricultural producers on domestic farm price and income support policies. If that were to happen, the trade effects on domestic policies would be examined and a formal notification procedure covering such policies would be introduced, making them available for scrutiny and challenge.<lb/>
A further possibility is that the major food trading nations, principally the EEC and the United States of America, would reach tacit agreement on world market prices and exports of the main commodities.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0112"/>
<col>207</col>
This could result for some products in an increase in the level of world prices and a reduction of the level of EEC prices, thus narrowing the gap between the two. This latter possibility is not one that our industries would support as a long-term policy. It would be potentially disadvantageous to third world countries. It could reduce the apparent cost of surplus production without reducing its real cost. What the food processing industry wants is freer markets and less Government intervention in the markets, not more.<lb/>
Finally, the ministerial meeting should set in train a work programme devoted to greater international cooperation on farm support policies, on export policy, including especially the unregulated areas, and on the removal of waivers and other non-tariff barriers which are no longer strictly justified. I would hope that my noble friend the Secretary of State can give me an assurance that the three points I am about to mention would be ones that he would be able to support in the discussions. These are the key factors that we pick out as being of special concern to the food and drink processing industries.<lb/>
First, no concession must be yielded by the EEC in respect of import refunds on processed products. Without them our industries could not compete on world markets. Secondly, greater access to third world country markets in the United States, Japan and other countries would be secured by the removal of non-tariff barriers to those markets, coupled with a substantial reduction in tariff harriers in countries like Japan. Thirdly, advantage should be taken of every opportunity to reduce the level of import protection on products not available in adequate quantity or quality within the European Community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01056">8.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01057"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for putting down this Unstarred Question. It will afford the noble Lord opposite an opportunity, which I am sure he will welcome, of defining with his customary precision the objectives that the Government have in mind when this conference takes place. The noble Lord himself, I think, would be the first to lay down that it really is no good talking of objectives in general terms, because they can get so woolly at the edges that at the end of the generalised statement one is left with a feeling that perhaps there is more of an element of wishful thinking and hope than a specific series of objectives.<lb/>
I have no doubt that the noble Lord will seek to comply with that and will say with the utmost precision just what the Government's objectives are. There was a preview of them in the document issued by the Department of Trade in July, where the memorandum said that it looked as though the issues would be grouped under three broad headings: (<i>a</i>) a political declaration; (<i>b</i>) decisions&#x2014;and I underline the word "decisions"&#x2014;to be taken by Ministers; (<i>c</i>) a residual "sweep-up" of the problems which it is agreed that GATT should study. I always like that last "sweep-up" clause on objectives. It is very often done at party conferences. Questions are remitted to the executive for further consideration&#x2014;which means, of course, that they will be shelved more or less
<col>208</col>
indefinitely for the future. I look forward, as others of your Lordships will, to the <i>d&#x00E9;nouement</i> that the noble Lord will seek to lay before the House as to just what the objectives are.<lb/>
I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, made his six points very well, and I will not take up the time of the House in repeating them. He asked a general question as to what is the future of GATT. That seemed to me to indicate a certain lack of conviction as to its general utility; and indeed, if one goes to the proceedings of the Select Committee on this and turns to the examination of the witnesses, one finds that this degree of pessimism has a certain echo in the evidence that has been given by the witnesses, and particularly, if I may refer to him by name, by Mr. John Meadway. I am referring now to page 3 of the evidence. To quote what he says, he comes to the world-shaking conclusion, when asked about the progress of GATT:
<quote>"I would say that since the Tokyo Round it has probably been slightly on the ascendant."</quote>
These are not exactly sentiments of any great confidence in progress. I am not reproaching the noble Lord with that. They are made with the sole object of reminding him, if indeed he needs reminding, that the problem is going to be a very big one and he starts off with the disadvantage, in effect, of having very little to show for the GATT situation as it now is or for any progress that has been made by GATT since the Tokyo Round.<lb/>
The reasons are not far to seek. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Banks, as the House may think, gave a very good analysis of the basic problem when he said that the cries and the moves towards liberalisation of trade always progress much more satisfactorily and are pursued with greater enthusiasm during a period of expansion; in other words, when the economies of the world are working at, or near, practicable capacity. And, of course, no country can work to full capacity&#x2014;few factories can. When the productive apparatus of the industrial nations is working smoothly, when output is going up and when things are expanding, it is more easy to achieve liberalisation of trade and to work with others to achieve that end. That is because they are all expanding, though perhaps unevenly, and it is in everybody's best interests that the maximum number of outlets should be obtained for the great variety and quantity of goods and services that have been produced.<lb/>
But we do not have that now. We have massive deflation, in which Her Majesty's Government have played a leading part. They refer from time to time to world recession and the effects that world recession is having on trade. What they do not say, with an appropriate degree of modesty, is that they have been the principal architects and cause of the recession itself. They have led the world into the recession. But this is not the time to reproach them with that; there are other occasions.<lb/>
It is very difficult indeed, however, to seek a further liberalisation of trade when the industrial countries are suffering, in many cases, from mass unemployment, when production and output figures are depressingly down and when, consequently, the battle for the diminishing markets, in terms of effective consumer demand, gets stronger and stronger and produces
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0113"/>
<col>209</col>
internal antagonisms as well as external ones. As witness&#x2014;and noble Lords have referred to it&#x2014;there is the attitude taken at the present time by the United States in regard to steel imports. The decline of the steel industry in the United States as reflected in the unemployment in the steel industry and its diminishing profitability, has undoubtedly brought stresses within the United States. These have, in turn, sought their political expression and have impressed themselves on the Government; and, as the noble Lords, Lord Banks and Lord Mottistone, reminded us, Governments tend to break the rules when it suits them.<lb/>
I am hopeful that the noble Lord will feel constrained to indicate to the House just how far other countries, however friendly, are allowed to go in breaking the rules before we ourselves call a halt and say, "Well, if you aren't going to be bound by the rules, then nor are we." I know the feeling of noble Lords opposite concerning unilateral disarmament in the military sphere. I venture to suggest that, if the argument is applicable there, it is applicable in double force on questions of trade, which are, after all, of a more peaceable nature. But what we do not want is unilateral disarmament in the field of international trade agreements and the GATT. We do not want a situation in which we feel constrained to obey all the rules ourselves, if other states insist on disobeying them or getting round them.<lb/>
I believe that one of the objects of the meeting is to review Article 19 of the original treaty, which deals with emergency action on imports of particular products. We should like to know what is the attitude of the Government to the further clarification of Article 19 of the original agreements. Do they think that it ought to be more closely defined? Are they prepared to discuss with other Governments a means of giving it a greater degree of particularisation? And, if they cannot, are they prepared to take more advantage of it? Clearly, these are matters of national concern.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, mentioned the association of the EEC in these talks, and we are given to understand that the EEC team of commissioners, or part of them, will be in session, together with the Ministers from the various countries. May we have some clarification as to the differentiation of the roles? I do not know whether the noble Lord himself will be there. One devoutedly hopes that he will be. He showed an excellent spirit in regard to the unilateral action by the United States concerning the pipeline, which showed that he himself may be a man of steel.<lb/>
Therefore, I hope that when it comes to dealing with such illustrious characters as Herr Haferkampf, who give one confidence, he will find himself adequate to deal with any points made by the commissioners that have an adverse effect on British interests. We shall be delighted to hear, in enunciating his objectives, how he proposes to deal with these objectives, if he finds them at any point in conflict with those put forward by Herr Haferkampf or Herr Vredeling. Or are we to take a more insular attitude?<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Banks, has already said, and as I have sought to emphasise, the existing conditions of deflation make it very unlikely that this new meeting of Ministers will make any substantial
<col>210</col>
progress, and the reasons are very clear. If Ministers, as such, can speak and can direct their own country's affairs and exercise an influence upon its trade, it is possible, nation by nation, to reach some kind of negotiated settlement on many of these matters. But, of course, the fact is that Ministers are not masters in their own houses, because they do not speak for labour and capital combined. Labour in all the countries, aside from a marginal emigration or immigration, is immobile. It has to make its contribution to the production of goods and services within the geographical boundaries of the nation states in which people live and in which they have their families.<lb/>
Capital has no such constraint. It can transfer itself across boundaries in a matter of seconds, from one side of the world to the other. And the very movement of capital and its investment, whether it be short term, medium term, long term or permanent, can itself have a profound effect on the importing and exporting capabilities of the countries wherein it moves. So a large part of the whole movement of trade is outside their hands. It is a matter of complete caprice. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, said in a speech on a different subject altogether, when referring to the whole question of the production apparatus of the country and its progress: "There is little Governments can do."<lb/>
I do not know what Mr. Joseph Chamberlain would have said had he been alive at the time because Mr. Joseph Chamberlain moved in what was at one time, I believe, the good old Tory tradition which seems to have been deserted by the party opposite these many years. They believed that when the national interest, both capital and labour working together, demanded it, protectionism was quite in order and there could be bilateral agreements between states. What the GATT system is doing in the existing circumstances is to propound a multilateralism in trade, or to facilitate a multilateralism in trade which, in terms of its national impact, is bound to be distorted by the mass movements of capital to which I have referred.<lb/>
It may be that I have anticipated the noble Lord. The noble Lord is, after all, in the best traditions of the late Joseph Chamberlain. It may be that he will tell the House that after giving the matter very careful consideration the Government are bent on securing the maximum flexibility under Article 19 of the original treaty. If he does so, he will receive the utmost support from this side of the House and we shall be greatly indebted to him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01059"><member>The Secretary of State for Trade (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House will be most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, for the efforts that he and the Select Committee have made to illuminate the issues that will arise in the course of the GATT Ministerial Meeting next month. I shall certainly study what he has said with very great interest&#x2014;and also the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Banks, my noble friend Lord Mottistone and the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington.<lb/>
I do not propose trying to answer in detail the specific questions which have been put on individual points. I think the right thing for me to do would be to review the field and give an indication of what the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0114"/>
<col>211</col>
Government's approach to these problems is. What actually emerges at the GATT Ministerial Meeting will be the result of a process of discussion, consultation, agreement and possibly even disagreement among the 87 nations who will be represented on that occasion. I propose, therefore, to start by setting out some of the basic facts and pressures which determine the United Kingdom Government's policy towards these matters. The fundamental soundness of the open multilateral approach to international trade is well demonstrated by the experience of the 1950s and the 1960s. Then the dismantling of the high tariffs and severe quantitative restrictions left over from the prewar era was undoubtedly one of the factors contributing to economic growth round the world.<lb/>
This does not mean that the Government should blindly and unthinkingly follow a liberal trade policy for all sectors and in all circumstances. Our necessarily tough policy on textile and clothing imports is as clear a demonstration as possible that within the general framework of a liberal trade policy we must protect the interests of our own country and of our own people.<lb/>
The policy questions for Governments become more difficult as major departures from open trading, or fears of such departures, increase. The economic history of the 1930s shows that once a major participant in an interdependent trade system shifts to a protectionist policy, others will follow suit. Access to its home market is the main negotiating lever a trading power has to secure access for its exporters to foreign markets. It is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect that any major trading country will continue to keep its own markets open to exports from another country if its exporters are shut out of that country's domestic market.<lb/>
It is for this reason that the world is watching, with interest and real concern, how the United States Administration is coping with strong pressure in the United States Congress, fuelled by the recession, for new United States trade legislation. That could easily, in the guise of "reciprocity" or in the guise of "domestic content", bring the United States into conflict with its mutilateral trading obligations in the GATT. These fears are much accentuated by the behaviour of the American Administration in relation to steel and the pipeline.<lb/>
A development of this kind&#x2014;that is, a movement on the part of the United States in a protectionist direction&#x2014;would be one of the biggest blows a great market economy could deliver to the open international trading system. For the same reason it is a complete delusion to imagine that universal import controls of the kind advocated in some quarters in this country can be indulged in without major damage to our own exporting industries. The noble Lord, Lord Banks, made this point very forcefully in his thoughtful speech. It is, thus, indisputably in the interests of the United Kingdom and of other trading nations that the GATT open trading system, which is one of the Bretton Woods institutions that has served the world so well, should be preserved. If it crumbles, and higher or, indeed, much higher barriers to trade go up round the world, we shall be all much worse off, whether as producers or as consumers. This, I think, is the answer to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce
<col>212</col>
of Donington, about the future of GATT. It is an essential part of our international trading structure but, of course, it may well need adaptation, modernisation and development.<lb/>
There is much consensus therefore that the GATT Ministerial Meeting needs to succeed. But when we look at what the various countries to be represented in Geneva feel that the content of that consensus for success should be, the real difficulties of the operation become clearer. Different countries and different groupings of countries have very different patterns of trade.<lb/>
It is natural, therefore, that they should want to push the GATT system in different directions. These differences of approach mattered less in the 1950s and 1960s when rapidly growing world trade enabled pressures to be accommodated relatively easily. But when there is little or no growth the process becomes much more difficult and each country in turn may feel that changes to meet the priorities of others can only be at their own expense.<lb/>
Agricultural trade&#x2014;and this point was raised by every noble Lord who spoke&#x2014;is a key issue for countries heavily dependent on agricultural exports, such as Australia and New Zealand, and also for the United States. By and large, protection has been higher in trade in agricultural products than for industrial goods. Correspondingly, the process of liberalisation of trade in non-agricultural goods has gone further and faster than for agricultural products. Regulation of agricultural markets, both domestically and internationally, is very deeply entrenched and the agricultural lobbies are very powerful.<lb/>
It is unrealistic to imagine that great changes can be made overnight. But there is a range of practical problems and grievances about the operation of international trade in agriculture which have not been recently addressed to any significant extent in the GATT; and it could be useful for the ministerial meeting to set in hand a thorough programme of work which will look at the areas where the various parties feel improvements are needed and see what practical solutions can be devised.<lb/>
May I turn now to textiles. Textiles and clothing is another sector of great sensitivity as these industries remain large and important employers in developed countries. They are also sectors which developing countries can move into at an early stage of their industrialisation and compete very successfully on world markets. In order to limit the pace of change to socially tolerable levels, sectoral arrangements, of which the Multi-Fibre Arrangement III is only the latest, have been negotiated in the GATT for the past 20 years. The ministerial meeting is likely to fall at a very sensitive stage in the negotiations under MFA II of bilateral agreements between the Community and some of its main suppliers. It is too early therefore to say what forward-looking work GATT Ministers as a whole may wish to put in hand.<lb/>
I turn now to safeguards and voluntary restraint arrangements&#x2014;another subject which featured largely in the contributions which were made to the debate. "Safeguards" is the term used for a group of issues which arise regarding the escape clause&#x2014;Article XIX, to which the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, referred&#x2014;which comes into operation when imports
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0115"/>
<col>213</col>
rise so sharply as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic industry. Sharp surges of imports of particular products are capable of causing serious damage to our industries, and evoke correspondingly strong pressures for protective action. This is particularly so when such imports, whether from Japan or other newly-industrialised countries or, indeed, from the United States, are encouraged by distorting domestic policies. Arrangements to deal with import surges are, understandably, also of great concern to poorer developing countries which may become, or may hope to become, competitive in limited areas.<lb/>
Not surprisingly, there is a large area of disagreement between those countries who are, or hope to become, aggressive exporters, and those who have mature industries which are under threat. The controversial questions include the criteria and disciplines that might be adopted to limit the invocation of Article XIX to genuinely serious cases of injury.<lb/>
Then there is the issue of selectivity: the question whether emergency action under Article XIX has to be taken against all suppliers or can be taken selectively against those suppliers whose imports are causing the disruption. Differences of attitude and interest on this issue are so great that finding a comprehensive agreement defeated the negotiators in the Tokyo Round, and appears also to be causing great difficulty this year in the efforts made in the preparatory process for the ministerial meeting.<lb/>
A particularly controversial facet of the safeguards question has been that of grey area measures. This term covers measures not involving the formal invocation of Article XIX, but having a similar effect. The basic point is that the levels of imports are negotiated rather than imposed as in a formal Article XIX action. Grey area measures are undoubtedly more widespread than they used to be. To show how central they have come to be I need only cite two examples of measures that fall in the grey area.<lb/>
An agreement between the Community and the United States regarding EEC steel exports to the United States would be a classic example of such a grey area agreement, and however much one may dislike the circumstances which have given rise to such an agreement if one is negotiated, nevertheless the importance of reaching a successful agreement is of immense importance both to the countries concerned and to the survival of GATT itself.<lb/>
Another example of grey area measures are the agreements on sheepmeat imports into the European Community negotiated a couple of years ago. It has been argued&#x2014;both the noble Lord, Lord Banks, and the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill of Harrow, put this point&#x2014;that the proliferation of grey area measures is a major cause of danger to the GATT open trading system, and that it is imperative at the forthcoming ministerial meeting to bring this process to a stop. I do not think that in the real world this is a well-founded argument. Grey area measures have been adopted not inadvisedly or lightly, but almost always in circumstances where recourse to Article XIX could have been justified. They represent progress by agreement rather than by litigation. The opponents of grey area measures may believe that if this option had not been available free and unrestricted open trade would have prevailed. I do not believe this.<lb/>
<col>214</col>
If you look at a list of the products concerned, they are ones where economically or politically the rate of change raises very sensitive issues which Government could not stand aside from&#x2014;steel, automobiles, sheepmeat are all examples of this. If the option of grey areas measures had not been available the alternative would almost certainly have been much greater formal invocation of Article XIX and more friction and conflict all round.<lb/>
So I do not accept the analysis that the proliferation of grey area measures is one of the main causes of difficulties the world trade system finds itself in. Rather it is a practical solution devised to minimise trade friction and prevent worse damage being done.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, himself said, such measures are not necessarily wrong. If there are to be substantial changes in the rules and practices of international trade from the position as it was left in 1979 at the end of the Tokyo Round, the Government intend to ensure that they are not detrimental to the position and negotiating strength of the United Kingdom. A prohibition on new grey area measures is unnecessary and undesirable and would be unhelpful to the GATT system. Those measures have made a significant and helpful contribution to handling in a difficult situation import problems not only in the United Kingdom but in several member states in the Community.<lb/>
If we were to accept modification or restriction in this area, it would be essential that it should be accompanied by significant progress in those areas of other people's trading policy which cause us difficulties or about which we have reservations. This would certainly have to include the import policy of some newly industrialised countries which seem to us no longer to reflect their economic contribution and what they can legitimately be expected to do in the development of a more up to date set of international trading rules.<lb/>
There is a range of issues involving developing countries that can conveniently be looked at together. In particular, the developing countries tend to argue that the GATT open trading system, as it has developed, operates unfairly from the point of view of relatively poor countries heavily dependent on primary products. Consistent themes of this kind are pressure from developing countries to receive more favourable import treatment for distinctively tropical products, which are mostly agricultural; and for action to diminish tariff escalation, a feature which provides a certain level of protection for processing industries in developed countries. These are issues which require consideration, but the scope for progress is limited.<lb/>
On the other side of the coin are the trade problems created by newly industialised countries. As developing countries, they are in principle entitled to benefit from looser GATT obligations than industrialised countries, and they have also benefited from valuable preferences given by developed countries under GSP schemes.<lb/>
But as individual newly industrialised countries&#x2014;or NICs as they are known&#x2014;develop industries to the point where they are competitive on equal terms with the production of industrialised countries on world markets, their special privileges become increasingly inappropriate. In particular some NICs have
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0116"/>
<col>215</col>
continued to use these special GATT provisions to enable them to maintain very high tariffs and other severe restrictions to keep our own manufactured products out of their growing home markets. This is not a situation that we or other developed countries generally think tolerable. The need to improve this imbalance is a major theme which I and my ministerial colleagues stress in our travels round the world advancing British trade interests.<lb/>
It is too soon to say how these various strands may be brought together in the GATT Ministerial Meeting. The United States has made specific proposals about bilateral negotiations, but their ideas have so far been widely opposed by developing countries. I recognise that it can be argued that, in a world recession, it is difficult to mount negotiations designed to bring about a greater application of GATT rules by the NICs. Be that as it may, there is a perceived inequity in many developed countries in the application of GATT rules, and in my view it would be better to rectify the imbalance by negotiation rather than by unilateral actions. The danger of this is real. The EC has proposed that there should be a major feasibility study and perhaps this will be a practical way forward. But the problem is urgent and something more than a leisurely study is needed.<lb/>
Perhaps I might now refer to the question of trade in services to which the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill, referred. May I say that I made my own maiden speech in your Lordships' House on the question of our invisible exports and this is a matter of increasing importance to this country. Approximately three out of every five workers in this country are now employed in public or private service activities. The total export earnings of the private sector services industries rose to a record &#x00A3;.17 billion in 1981; our trading surplus on services is second only to that of the United States of America. This is a tribute to the energy and imagination of those who have seen the opportunities in this sector and have worked towards their fulfilment.<lb/>
We have pressed very hard indeed inside the EEC for liberalisation of trade in services. This is a question that I have raised with other European countries that I have visited. The issue is likely to be important in the GATT meeting as well. I welcome the work done in this field by the Sub-Committee on Invisible Exports known as the LOTIS Committee; that is, the Committee on the Liberalisation of Trade in Services. We will support any movement at the GATT Ministerial Meeting to set up a study programme under GATT auspices, to develop the OECD work of identifying the barriers to trade in services with which the OECD has been concerned to consider possible solutions.<lb/>
I now come to the question of ensuring that the collective strength of the European Community is employed to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the GATT discussions. This was a point stressed by the noble Lord, Lord Greenhill. I have few anxieties on this point. Ministers from all Community countries will, of course, attend and have the opportunity to speak. What they say will naturally reflect their own particular priorities and concerns, but this will be within the general framework of a Community position agreed beforehand. In the preparatory process
<col>216</col>
the Commission has been the Community's spokesman. While I do not underestimate the complexities of co-ordination, I do not doubt that our membership of a major trading <i>bloc</i> can only benefit the United Kingdom in the preparations for this meeting.<lb/>
It is important that the GATT Ministerial should make progress and be seen to make progress. But it is no good just bewailing the emergence of protectionist measures. They would not have emerged unless there was good reason for them. Their removal or diminution will come only if the causes which led to their appearance are identified and dealt with. The world has changed a great deal in the 30 years or so that the GATT has been in existence. There are countries which enjoy privileges which were justified in earlier years but may no longer be justified now. There are other areas where privileged treatment may no longer be appropriate; where what were entrenched rights may now need to be modified or surrendered.<lb/>
This is, of course, a much wider canvas than it falls to the lot of the forthcoming GATT Ministerial to tackle. But it needs a clear recognition of these issues if progress is to be made at the GATT Ministerial itself. The benefits of a liberal trading system are very great. The promotion of such a system requires much more than the removal of barnacles and excrescences. It needs a move towards convergence of trading policies and practices world wide. If my home market is open to you: your home market ought to be open to me on equal terms. The November GATT meeting has the opportunity of taking an important if limited step in that direction. I hope it succeeds in so doing.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HMSO PUBLICATIONS: PRICING POLICY</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01070"><member>Lord Killearn</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01071">Why a Lords Paper of three paragraphs, on one side of one sheet of paper, is priced at 35p (No. 200 of 1981&#x2013;82); why a Treasury Minute of 19 paragraphs printed for the Stationery Office by an outside printer on four sides out of a total of eight (i.e. four sheets) is priced at &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;25 (Cmnd. 8620); and whether Her Majesty's Government will put in hand a thorough investigation into the printing costs of all Parliamentary and Government publications, on the lines of the recent inquiry by the European Parliament into the printing costs of Community Institutions (Working Document 1-452/82), as a result of which remarkable economies are proposed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01072"><member>Lord Cockfield</member>: The pricing policy for Her Majesty's Stationery Office publications was in fact thoroughly reviewed last year when the following statement was made in another place by the then Minister of State at the Civil Service Department on 29th April:
<quote>"A review has recently been completed. It has endorsed Her Majesty's Stationery Office's present policy of pricing their publications so as to recover&#x2014;apart from <i>Hansard</i>, for which there is a special Government grant&#x2014;all the costs of producing, publishing and selling them, and to achieve the financial target set for Her Majesty's Stationery Office trading fund. The alternative would be for the taxpayer to meet the costs of underpricing. Recent steep increases in some areas are the consequence primarily of recovery from past underpricing and the identification for the first time of full costs. Within this overall policy, however, the prices now being charged by Her Majesty's Stationery Office for most one or two page publications will be held at their present level for at least 18 months and more flexible arrangements will be introduced for settling the prices of important publications."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01073">The procedures criticised in the report by the European Parliament have little relevance to the position in the United Kingdom, where Her Majesty's Stationery Office has now been set up as a Government Trading Fund with a modern management
<col>218</col>
accounting system and a clear commercial remit. About 70 per cent. of its printing requirements are already contracted out to the trade, which is more than the figure for the European Communities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01074">Both the House of Lords Paper (No. 200 of 1981&#x2013;82) and Cmnd. 8620 were priced against a series of standard pricing scales that relate price to page content and format. In accordance with Her Majesty's Stationery Office's remit as a Trading Fund, these scales are designed to recover not only the cost of printing and paper, but also the costs involved in publishing, stocking, distribution and selling, which are usually several times greater than the cost of production alone, especially for items containing very few pages.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01075">In the case of Cmnd. 8620, the title page and contents could not be accommodated within 4 pages. The use of 8 pages instead of 6 is more economical in that the potential saving in paper costs is more than offset by the extra cost of producing a 6-page publication with a trimmed and inserted leaf.</p>

on water; and, if not, for what geographically defined population groups and in what exceptional circumstances the intend to seek exemption.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01084"><member>The Earl of Avon</member>: The United Kingdom intends to comply with EC Directive 80/778/EEC concerning the quality of water for human consumption within the 5-year period permitted. However, under Article 9, the directive allows derogations when situations arise from the nature and structure of the ground; and under Article 20, a request may be submitted for a longer period to meet the directive's values for exceptional cases and for geographically defined population groups.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01085">Some acidic and highly coloured waters and some groundwaters contain iron, manganese and other substances at concentrations above the directive's values; these substances are not considered dangerous to health and the United Kingdom will make applications for a limited number of derogations or delays. There may also be a limited number of other requests for delays, mainly in the application of the directive to small private water supplies. The geographical definition of the groups and extent or scope of the delays have not yet been determined. Relevant studies are in hand.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01088"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member>: The Fifth Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Settlements was held in Nairobi in May. This is one of a series of annual meetings which are concerned with the planned growth and management of human settlements, both urban and rural.

<title>THE BRITISH DEAF ASSOCIATION MANIFESTO</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01090"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01091">What is their response to the Manifesto of the British Deaf Association.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01092"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member>: I set out below our response to the important points raised in this manifesto.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01093">1. We recognise the importance of British sign language to deaf people and appreciate its significance as an aid to communication for many of them. Nevertheless, there are several other means of communication which are important to people with a hearing impairment and others with speech disorders. The Government will continue to encourage, and support where possible, schemes to improve communication for all hearing impaired people so as to promote their integration into the community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01094">2. Sign language is not banned in schools but nor is it used in all schools for the hearing impaired. Over 90 per cent. of deaf children come from hearing homes and all live in a hearing world. We agree that they are best helped by a flexible approach based on their individual needs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01095">3. In making appointments to teaching posts education authorities and others need to satisfy themselves as to the medical fitness of candidates among other factors. This will normally have been determined when the candidate is accepted for teacher training. After qualifying, and provided that there has been no deterioration, any teacher, including the hearing impaired, may apply for any advertised post.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01096">4. It is not expected that the 1981 Education Act will result in the closure of many special schools. There will always be a need for some special schools for the hearing impaired, although fewer will be necessary as the numbers of those children decline and schools become non-viable. The potential role of special schools as resource centres is recognised.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01097">5. The British Deaf Association's recent application for finance to implement a national programme to train British sign language interpreters is at present under consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01098">6. (a) There has in fact been increasing provision for hard of hearing people over the past few years and this policy will continue. Also the broadcasting authorities are committed to continuing the extension of the Teletext facility which is of great benefit to deaf people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01099">(b) The expansion of cable systems is currently under consideration by the Government in the light of the Hunt Report. Cable has certainly the potential for providing the sort of specialist services which can benefit deaf people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01100">7. The Fit for Work Campaign, which was launched in 1979 by the Manpower Services Commission and has the full support of the Government, the Confederation of British Industry
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0119"/>
<col>221</col>
and the Trades Union Congress, continues to seek to promote the employment interests of all disabled people including those with a hearing impairment. Use by disabled people of the services available at Jobcentres, including the specialist services, is also encouraged.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01101">8. Charges made to telephone subscribers are a responsibility of British Telecom but the special problems of some deaf people are recognised and the Minister for the Disabled is getting in touch with British Telecom about the charges made to those who use special equipment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01121">What acreage of woodland has been sold by the Forestry Commission since August 1981 and what was the price received: and how many acres of new planting have been carried out (a) by the Forestry Commission and (b) by private forestry since August 1981.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01122"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member>: From the beginning of August 1981 until 21st September 1982, 10,560 acres (4,273 hectares) of forestry land and plantations were sold by the Forestry Commission for the sum of &#x00A3;3.2 million.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01123">The latest available statistics for new planting are for the year ended 31st March 1982. During that year the Forestry Commission planted 27,127 acres (10,978 hectares). In the same period, grants were paid for 30,794 acres (12,462 hectares) of new planting by the private sector, and it is estimated that some 490 acres (200 hectares) were planted without grants.</p>

<title>Argentina: Compensation</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01126"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are proposing to claim reparations against the Argentine in respect of the damage and loss suffered as a result of the Argentine aggression against British territory and ships in and around the Falkland Islands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01127"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as was stated by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in another place on 30th July, we reserve the right to claim compensation from Argentina.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01128"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that not wholly informative reply, may I ask him when the Government intend to announce their decision? And will my noble friend confirm that it is in accordance with international law and precedent that, when aggression is committed by one power on the territory of another, it is normal for that power, when the aggression has been repelled, to make reparations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01129"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we were wronged by the Argentines in their aggression and would certainly be entitled to claim compensation, as my noble friend says. However, there would be formidable practical difficulties in our securing payment. Our objective throughout the conflict was to restore the rights of the islanders. While we reserve the right to claim compensation, we do not believe that it would serve any useful purpose at this stage to put in such a claim.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01130"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would there have been any practical difficulty in requiring the Argentinian forces to clear up the land mines which they had strewn around before they left the islands?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01131"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: We seem to have got beyond that point, my Lords, because there are no Argentine forces on the Falklands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01132"><member>Lord Kaldor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is there not a danger that any claim made against the Argentines for their aggression might hasten the collapse of the international banking system?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01133"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps that is a little wide of this Question.</membercontribution></p>
<col>224</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01134"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, give an assurance that British information services throughout the world are making every effort to draw public attention world-wide to the gross violations of the Geneva Convention by Argentina, including the deliberate desecration of islanders' homes and, above all, the laying of unmarked minefields, to which the noble Lord, Lord Beswick, has just drawn attention?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01135"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I am well aware of the point which the noble Lord has made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01136"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, considering that a very remarkable victory has led, or has foreseeably led, only to our behaving as though we had been defeated, what was the point of going there at all?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01137"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is absolutely no question of our behaving as though we had been defeated. What matters in all this is the rights and future lives of the islanders. Whatever we do and whatever policies we pursue, we will put them in the forefront of our minds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01138"><member>Lord Elystan-Morgan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has said that a claim is in the process of contemplation; that is what I understand him to have said. If that be the case, will he confirm that at some stage a claim will be made; and, if so, with what authoritative body will that claim be filed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01139"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, misunderstood me. I certainly did not say a claim was in the process of being consulted upon in London or anywhere else; and I am not prepared to speculate on when and whether such a claim may or may not be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01140"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, did my noble friend's first supplementary answer to me and the supplementary answer he has just given suggest that in the view of Her Majesty's Government it would be more economical to commit aggression if one was a bankrupt state?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01141"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, they suggested nothing of the sort.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Disarmament Proposals</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01142">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01143"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are aware of the joint statement by the Soviet Peace Committee and the World Disarmament Campaign proposing among other things a move towards the dismantling of both the Warsaw Pact and NATO, the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones and the prohibition of chemical biological and radiological weapons; and whether they welcome this development.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0121"/>
<col>225</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01144"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are aware of this statement, which contains a number of well-worn Soviet proposals. My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Hurd) met members of the British delegation on 11th March and discussed their visit to the Soviet Union. We hope that the proclaimed interest of the Soviet Union in peace will be reflected in a constructive response to the fresh proposals made by the West for reductions in conventional and nuclear forces.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01145"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, but may I ask the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, two further questions. First, is it not the case that the Soviet Peace Committee seldom does or says anything that is not approved by the Soviet Government and therefore that anything in a statement entered into by the Soviet Peace Committee and the World Disarmament Campaign may be taken as an official statement by the Soviet Government, and will the British Government look at it in that light? Secondly, in a Written Answer that the noble Lord was kind enough to give me he said that the Government expected to have an opportunity in the near future to make known to the Russians the Government's views on their initiatives for a nuclear freeze and for a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Is the noble Lord now in a position to say what those views are?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01146"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the noble Lord's second supplementary question, these views are still under discussion and I am not yet in a position to give the noble Lord the information he wants. As far as the Soviet Peace Committee is concerned, I agree with the noble Lord that it is a loose organ of the state but I cannot draw from that the same conclusions that he does because there are other peace movements which are under what I can only describe as subjection in the Soviet Union at the moment. For example, the noble Lord will know well the case of Mr. Sakharov, whose dissenting views are certainly not tolerated. There is also the fact mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich in his letter to <i>The Times</i> today&#x2014;and I quote:
<quote>"The 15 brave Russians who tried to form an equivalent of a CND movement in Moscow earlier this year were immediately imprisoned".</quote>
So I cannot subscribe to the theory that the views of the Soviet Peace Committee represent the views of the Russian people, although on occasions they may well represent the views of the state.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01147"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming my noble friend's statement, may I ask him whether it is intended to impress upon the Soviet Government that success in this matter depends upon multilateral disarmament and <i>bona fide</i> reciprocity?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01148"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, most certainly that is the intention of Her Majesty's Government; and further, we are absolutely determined to seek an agreement on the very difficult problem of verification, which will still take a long time to clear up, I am afraid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01149"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the great and noble words of the Soviet Union be of infinite value if only they bore some relation to what they do?</membercontribution></p>
<col>226</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01150"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have a lot of sympathy with that view, because I noticed that, in Mr. Gromyko's recent speech to the United Nations, he said:
<quote>"The urge to give orders to other countries and to dominate the world must not be allowed to overshadow the experience of the past or muffle the voice of reason".</quote>
From that noble Lords can draw their own conclusion, as I have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01151"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has referred to proposals of the Soviet Government being in this document. Is he aware that it was not a device of the Soviet Peace Committee? Is he aware that I proposed it and I drafted the terms of the agreement with only slight amendments, and that the agreement proposes endorsement of the recommendations of the United Nations Special Assembly four years ago and makes a series of progressive proposals ending with the demilitarisation of both the Warsaw Pact and NATO? Are not those proposals worthy of the support of the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01152"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not aware of the noble Lord's involvement in all this, although of course I did know that he was a member of the delegation to the Soviet Peace Committee. However, I accept that there is good reason for looking at the proposals very carefully. I hope that some progress can be made on at least some parts of them. But I quite definitely do not think that the inference that all is sweetness and light can be drawn from these particular proposals. I think they ought to be looked at with a great deal of care.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01153"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend not agree that it is really rather strange that there is no mention of Soviet nuclear disarmament in the Question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01154"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are not responsible for Questions on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01155"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not agree that, if these proposals are to be taken seriously, perhaps the British Government, along with our allies, would make a fair challenge to the Soviet Government as to what are their views upon them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01156"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that very helpful supplementary question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01157"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the dependence of the Soviet economy on the imports of American wheat, and on the supply of European technology, to sustain their economy, is not this the right moment to press the Soviet Government for new initiatives in this direction of securing a greater degree of multilateral disarmament?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01158"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I am not prepared to commit myself on whether this is the right moment, but certainly the current multilateral negotiations going on between the EEC&#x2014;both as a collective organisation and as individual
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0122"/>
<col>227</col>
members&#x2014;and the United States have this object partly in view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01159"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, did my noble friend notice the possibly Freudian slip of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, when he said that the Soviet Peace Committee was an organ of the Soviet Government? Does it not debase the value of the world disarmament campaign if it gets into bed with such odd fellows, who seem to be part of the same Government which went into Afghanistan?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01160"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was a little thrown by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins' supplementary question, in that I would have thought it was an argument against proposals coming from the Peace Committee rather than for them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01161"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the fact that the proposals were originally drafted by my noble friend, and were subsequently endorsed by the Peace Committee in the presence of a Soviet Minister, indicates that the Soviet Government and my noble friend are in accord? It only remains for the Government to get into accord with my noble friend and then the Government could find themselves in the search for peace with the Soviet Union. Is not that something devoutly to be wished? Is it not desirable that the Government should find itself, if it can, on common ground with the Soviet Union, so that the world becomes a more peaceful place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01162"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to make the world a more peaceful place is, quite definitely, the objective of us all, wherever we sit and wherever we may reside. However, the information imparted to the House by the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, on his drafting of the original communiqu&#x00E9; came to light and was given to your Lordships' House after I had answered the supplementary question of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins. So I answered both questions at the time and in the light of what was presented to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01163"><member>Lord Soames</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I suggest to my noble friend that he does not waste too much time examining these proposals? If the Russians really wanted to seek a reduction of tension and an increase in disarmament there is plenty of opportunity for them to put forward such proposals without using the Peace Committee as a stalking horse, let alone the noble Lord, Lord Brockway.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01164"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for parts of that supplementary question by my noble friend, and I shall bear his advice in mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01165"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are many issues on which I am not in accord with the Soviet Government and that I so expressed myself when I was in Moscow?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01166"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: I am sure that that is the case, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>

<title>"The Legal Basis of Further Education"</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01167">3.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01168"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they can give a date on which they will make a statement on <i>The Legal Basis of Further Education</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01169"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, but we hope to be able to make a statement shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01170"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that not very satisfactory reply. Is he aware that <i>The Legal Basis of Further Education</i> was published in June 1981, and that organisations, and so on, were asked to comment by, I think, the end of October, certainly about a year ago? The people who have responded are feeling concerned and disappointed that the Government have not taken a greater interest in this matter, since adult education is an area where the Government have not been very kindly. Those working in that field are very much hoping for an early response.<lb/>
Will the Minister also agree that there are a great many anomalies in the education law as it stands, particularly where 16 to 19 year-olds are concerned? For instance, a young person in school never has to pay fees, but a young person of 16 to 19 years in further education may have to do so. There is also the matter of recoupment. An authority is bound to pay recoupment if a young person is in school but not for further education. Will the Minister urge the Government to respond quickly?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01171"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as to the delay, as the noble Baroness described it, the latest comments on the report were not received until the end of last year and it is a very complex matter. On the friendship of the Government towards the world of further education, I shall only say that the Government have in this year alone given additional expenditure provision totalling about 100 million to enable more young people to stay on in education. Most of those extra people are, in fact, staying on in further education colleges. As to the anomalies, I think I should leave that to our response to the report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01172"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister assure the House that, when he is preparing his statement, full consideration will be given to young people between the ages of 16 and 19 who were the subject of special statements under the Education Act 1981 because of physical or mental handicap? Will he also include consideration for young people between 16 and 19 years of age who become handicapped, either physically or mentally, after they have left school but who need educational facilities up to the age of 19?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01173"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are well aware of the importance of the 16 to 19 year-old bracket. What I have said refers to those staying on outside school. We do not disaggregate payments for
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0123"/>
<col>229</col>
the 16 to 19 year-old bracket inside school. As to disabled people, the noble Baroness will be aware of our recent White Paper and the attention which my honourable friend the Minister for Social Security, in his special capacity as Minister responsible for the disabled, is giving to this matter. My honourable friend Mr. Hugh Rossi is doing a good job in seeing that the aims that the noble Baroness furthers are effectively pursued by local authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01174"><member>Lord Plant</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that those who are economically and socially deprived are also those who are educationally deprived? Does the noble Lord also agree that the Department of Education and Science agrees that much of further education is almost certainly <i>ultra vires</i> and that the need to amend Sections 41 and 42 of the Education Act 1944 is pressing? Finally, will the noble Lord say what is the Government's attitude to the voluntary bodies on further education, such as the Workers' Educational Association, which seems to be bearing a disproportionate amount of economy cuts?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01175"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's first premise would be the subject of an interesting sociological debate. I agree only that often social deprivation is accompanied by educational deprivation, although not always. His second question on the legality of further education is central to our response to the report, when it comes. If the noble Lord will remind me of his third question I shall answer it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01176"><member>Lord Plant</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I remind the noble Lord that my question was in relation to the Workers' Educational Association, which seems to be experiencing a disproportionate amount of cuts?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01177"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are well seized of the value of the Workers' Educational Association, as indeed am I. We seek in no way to limit the good work which it does.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01178"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that there are many aspects of this issue of legal recognition of adult education? Is he further aware that Professor Roger Dyson has just been talking about grants to students at universities and taking courses? A 24-week course will now cost &#x00A3;45 for adult students. There is a great difficulty with the Workers' Educational Association, now celebrating in North Staffordshire 60 years of existence, in finding courses which the young unemployed can attend, because they can no longer afford them.

<title>Fair Wages: Denunciation of ILO Convention</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01180">3.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01181"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what benefits they expect will accrue to our economy now that they intend to proceed with plans to abolish the Fair Wages Resolution; and whether the International Labour Organisation has been notified of this intention to denounce the ILO Convention Number 94; and further when Parliament will be given an opportunity to debate this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01182"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, industry and the economy will benefit by the removal of unnecessary and outdated constraints on the ability for people to reach settlements as a result of free negotiation on terms which suit their own circumstances. A Motion to rescind the resolution is to be put before another place in the next Session. Denunciation of ILO Convention No. 94 was notified to the International Labour Office on 20th September, 1982.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01183"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that this issue of the International Labour Organisation on fair wages is of paramount importance internationally on contracts? It has been in existence in this form for 35 years. Is he further aware that efforts to get fair wages goes back 91 years and that the ILO was awarded the Nobel Prize for its efforts to get friendly relationships on the industrial front throughout Europe? We have now broken or intend to break this convention. The answers were fudged, inosculated and brought in quietly by means of Written Questions in the other place and here.<lb/>
Finally, and then I shall sit down, when I asked the noble Lord opposite about fair wages I was partly told I did not know what I was talking about. I had already read <i>Hansard</i>, which he had not. There was a Written Answer, and I can give the dates. It is of importance&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01184"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01185"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: Give me an introduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01186"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01187"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the whole House realises that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, feels strongly about this matter. Could he just frame his question and ask it briefly?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01188"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, every question has been framed with the question mark at the end. I read a piece in the newspaper about this when the other place had already discussed it. Will the Minister tell the House when the Government are to allow a debate on this issue as asked in the Question?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0124"/>
<col>231</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01189"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not realise that anything that I had said had insinuated that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, did not know what he was talking about. If the noble Lord reads my original Answer I think that he will find nothing in it to lead him to construe it in that way. The noble Lord is quite right in saying that the present fair wages resolution goes back 35 years. He was not right when he said that we are breaking that convention. We have a period by which we can withdraw from the convention if we like. It comes once every 10 years. The date of our possible denunciation, which is the equivalent of withdrawal, goes from 20th September 1982 to 19th September 1983. If we give that notice of withdrawal it comes in a year later. So we are not breaking a convention.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked whether I would answer the last part of his main Question. I did so when I said that a Motion to rescind the resolution is to be put before another place in the next Session. The resolution is a resolution of another place and it is for the other place to countermand that resolution; it is not a matter for this House unless the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, or anyone else wishes to put down a Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01190"><member>Lord Kaldor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, going back to the noble Earl's original Answer, may I ask: is he aware that a widespread and intellectually highly respectable case can be made out for the view that the obligation to pay fair wages, far from having adverse effects on the economy, has very favourable effects on efficiency? Therefore, it is quite possible that the abolition of the obligation to pay fair wages will encourage the survival of inefficient enterprises and will, therefore, act to lower our national wellbeing and not to raise it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01191"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware from what the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, has said that there are people who take an opposite view from that which the Government take&#x2014;I accept that. However. I should tell the noble Lord that we consider the fair wages resolution to be obsolete. It refers to employees who are on Government contracts only; it does not help the low paid; it can be disruptive to companies who are in difficulties; and it does not mean that it will help companies, because very often they are obliged to pay what is the "going rate" in the industry and that is not necessarily the lowest paid rate. Also the complaints which we have had about the fair wages resolution, or the applications, have tended to come from those in the higher, and not the lower paid industries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01192"><member>Lord Collison</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened to the explanations which have been given. However, before this decision was taken, had the Government consulted the TUC, who obviously have a great interest in this particular convention, and also, of course, the ILO with which I was connected for many, many years? If the Government did not consult the TUC, can the Minister tell me why they did not do so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01193"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have consulted with a number of people, of which I think the Trades Union Congress was one, and they had a variety of different responses.</membercontribution></p>
<col>232</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01194"><member>Lord Jacques</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are we to assume that the Government wish to be free to enter into contracts with people who pay unfair wages?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01195"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: Certainly not, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01196"><member>Lord Spens</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Earl the Minister tell us whether ILO Convention Number 94 has ever been ratified by the United States of America?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01197"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: No, it has not, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01198"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that his right honourable friend Mr. Tebbit in another place, when delivering a breakfast-time broadcast on the Thursday of the Conservative Party Conference, answered the contention of his right honourable friend Sir Ian Gilmour that the payments to the unemployed should in fact be increased, by saying that that would cause widespread resentment among the lower paid workers, some of whom were paid below that rate? Is it, therefore, the Government's intention that wages should now be driven down to below the normal unemployment rates?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01199"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find the deductions of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, quite astonishing. There is nothing in what I have said or in the abolition of the fair wages resolution which will encourage wages to go down below the unemployment level. What the noble Lord must know, if he knows about the fair wages resolution&#x2014;which I am sure he does&#x2014;is that it sets a wage rate which is at the "going rate" in the industry concerned. It may oblige certain companies to go above the minimum, to pay what is the "going rate", which may well put them in financial difficulties and thereby end the company and the jobs for the employees. The purpose of this action is to allow free negotiation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01200"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister indicate how many countries or Governments have denounced the convention, or have indicated their intention of doing so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01201"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can tell the noble and learned Lord that 55 countries have ratified the convention, which means that some 93 have not done so. Those who have not ratified it include the United States, West Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada. Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Portugal, Greece, Luxembourg and the whole of the Eastern <i>bloc</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01202"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that has not answered my question, but perhaps it does not matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01203"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble and learned Lord would be kind enough to repeat his question I shall listen with even more care and see whether I can give an even better answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01204"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I merely asked, how many Governments have denounced the convention or announced their intention of denouncing the convention?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01205"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in that case my answer will be briefer. I shall find out and write and let the noble and learned Lord know.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01228"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their amendment. This is another new clause.

I agreed to try to take this power, and I intend to carry out my obligation to do so by means of the regulations when they are provided.<lb/>
It is a little more difficult than it seems. Ever since the Widgery Committee it was always held to be doctrine that it was impracticable to introduce a system of appeals against refusals of criminal legal aid. I could well sense the feelings of the House when noble Lords wanted me to make this promise, and I did make it, and it accorded with my own inclinations. My officials are now engaged in the process of consulting those concerned. I cannot yet say whether recourse will be to the Crown Court, to the legal aid committees, or to some other <i>ad hoc</i> body. But I intend to carry out
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0126"/>
<col>235</col>
my obligation, and this is the means by which I intend to do so. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Chancellor</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01229"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we&#x2014;and I suspect the whole House&#x2014;are pleased that the noble and learned Lord has accepted the principle of a right of appeal in respect of the refusal of legal aid by a magistrates' court. The problem that worried us very much when we discussed this on a previous occasion was the vast variation in the refusal rates of application for legal aid orders as between one magistrates' court and another. Indeed, it seemed that success in regard to such application very often depended not so much on the merits of the application but on in which court the application was made. We had the fascinating statistics that there were 33 per cent. refusals in Highgate, whereas in perhaps the more salubrious area of Hampstead there were only 4 per cent. refusals. Looking at the matter statistically, it indeed indicates a strange state of affairs, because I hardly venture to think that the nature of the cases coming before the Hampstead court would have been very different in substance from the nature of those elsewhere. This is one of the factors which certainly led us to stress the importance of this matter.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord has gone a good deal of the way to meet what was said in different parts of the House on this in Amendment No. 4. We wondered whether perhaps he could go further. As it stands, the amendment gives a power to make the regulations. We wondered whether it could be made mandatory. However, we appreciate that there are difficulties in the way of that. It is not contended that every case that results in a refusal of a legal aid application in a magistrates' court would necessarily call for the power of appeal. As I understand it, over a million of the cases that come before magistrates' courts relate to minor traffic offences. Nevertheless, the wide range of "(2)(<i>a</i>)" cases, as they might be called, remains for consideration.<lb/>
I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord could give us a little more guidance as to how he intends this power to be used and the kind of machinery that he has in mind. The amendment refers to the power to enable:
<quote>"a person who has been refused legal aid under the principal Act by a magistrates' court to apply to such other court or body as may be specified &#x2026;"</quote>
I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord has been able to carry his thinking on what the nature of the other body ought to be further than the tentative suggestions that he helpfully made when we discussed the matter further. If further guidance could be given on those lines, I am sure that it would be well received.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01230"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord. Again, we had quite full debates on the matter when it was before the House, and I yielded to the pressure which was brought to bear on me. My concession was in the face of what was always held to be established doctrine, but I intend to find a way through it if I can, and I am sure that I shall be able to. It is, of course, true&#x2014;and I agree that it has a relevance&#x2014;that there is a surprising divergence
<col>236</col>
between individual magistrates' courts as to the rate of refusal. I did point out some of the difficulties because magistrates' courts have a different pattern of offences before them.<lb/>
Moreover, it does not, of course, follow that those who refuse it in the fewest cases are those which are necessarily right. But the noble and learned Lord will remember that I have directed my office to investigate the reasons for that wide variation. As regards the type of body to which recourse could be made, I would rather leave the question open until the consultations that I am having are complete. The options really are what I adumbrated before. In theory, you could send it to the Crown Court; in theory, you could refer it to the legal aid committees of the Law Society; or you could create another body <i>ad hoc</i> for the purpose. It is precisely as between those three options that those consultations are primarily directed. I think that that is about as far as I can go. If the noble and learned Lord will look at subsection (3) of the new clause he will see why it cannot be made mandatory on me.</membercontribution></p>

They enable the Lord Chancellor to make regulations to prohibit or restrict the receipt by counsel or a solicitor acting for a legally assisted person of payments apart from those legal aid monies. This will be done by regulation under the amendments. It is designed to prohibit or restrict the process known as "topping-up", which will be familiar to noble Lords opposite.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01252"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the expression, "topping-up", may be known to the legal profession, I do not know that it is known as familiarly to all your Lordships. It is, as the noble and learned Lord indicated, a rather objectionable practice that there would be of a solicitor, for example&#x2014;I prefer to choose my own side of the profession in order not to be offensive to any other side of the profession&#x2014;saying, "Well, I have got a legal aid certificate, but I am afraid that the charges that I would be entitled to thereunder do not console me at all, and therefore I would like to charge you, if I am to act for you, an additional sum." This is prohibited in the civil legal aid and obviously ought to be prohibited in criminal legal aid, and that is so. So that I do not leave the other side of the profession completely out of it, that would similarly apply where there was a question of a silk not being authorised and in fact a silk comes on the scene in order that payment may be proffered to him in respect of his services when that is not covered by the criminal legal aid certificates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01253"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect, this could in special circumstances work an injustice. With the greatest respect, I would hope that these special circumstances might be taken into account when the regulations are made in due course. Take, for example, the situation that you have a complicated immigration appeal or application going up to the Divisional Court. It comes, say, from Birmingham or Wolverhampton with an ethnic minority solicitor and an ethnic minority counsel on legal aid who have little knowledge of the practice and procedures of the Divisional Court, or indeed of the Court of Appeal.<lb/>
There is a difficult point of law involved&#x2014;perhaps a spin-off of <i>Zamir</i>, something like that. Then what happens is that the local head man of the community passes the hat round and gets a few hundred pounds together so that they can approach leading counsel and pay him some fee to conduct that case. I am speaking from a position in my own experience. From seeing the papers some leading counsel who knew what he was up to was certainly required, and in circumstances like these I am not sure what the basic morality is. If there is a conflict of moralities, I would have thought that one should err on the side of ensuring in special circumstances that everything is done to uphold the highest standards of representation.</membercontribution></p>

"topping-up" is already prohibited, so that the point is not, as stated, a good one. But I would also point out that the power which I am taking if this be agreed to is one to prohibit or restrict, which I think would take account of any points which may arise but which do not immediately occur to me as I stand here.<lb/>

<title>Broadcasting (Television Programme Contractors' Additional Payments)<lb/>Order 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01264">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01265"><member>Lord Elton</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 14th October be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01266">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order was considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on 19th October and they had no comments. This draft order is intended to increase the ITV levy free slice, and thus to reduce the levy payments of the ITV companies, in order to compensate them for the increased subscriptions they will be paying to the IBA in order to meet their share of the costs of the Welsh fourth channel.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01267">Noble Lords will recall that during the passage of the Broadcasting Act 1980 the Government proposed to concentrate all Welsh language television programmes on a single channel, and that that single channel solution was subsequently approved by Parliament. The Broadcasting Act 1981 accordingly made special arrangements for the fourth channel in Wales and for the establishment of the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority. It was always recognised that these arrangements would be more expensive for the ITV companies, which finance both the fourth channel and the Welsh fourth channel through subscriptions paid to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The Government therefore agreed that they should compensate the ITV companies for the additonal costs of the Welsh fourth channel by means of an adjustment to the ITV levy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01268">The additional costs of the single channel solution were estimated to be &#x00A3;10 million in aggregate. After consultation with the IBA and the Treasury, my right honourable friend announced in July of last year that he proposed to lay an order during the next Session which should have the effect of increasing the ITV levy free slice&#x2014;that is, the amount of their profits on which ITV contractors pay no levy&#x2014;from &#x00A3;250.000, or 2 per cent. of advertising revenue, to &#x00A3;650,000, or 2.8 per cent. of advertising revenue, whichever is the greater, with effect from 1st April 1982.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01269">That is the draft order before your Lordships' House today. There has been delay, since it was discovered that the proposed order, which was intended to reduce the ITV companies' levy payments, would have had the perverse effect of increasing the levy liability of certain of the companies in the year of the change, because their accounting periods would be split as a result of the order. Amending legislation was therefore introduced in Section 144 of the Finance Act 1982, which made provision for the first order made after the passing of the Act to take effect from 1st April 1982; and noble Lords will note that this is reflected in the order now before the House. I apologise for the fact that this is inevitably a rather complicated and technical subject, but I hope I have provided a sufficient explanation to commend the draft order to your Lordships' House. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01270">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 14th October be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Elton</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01271"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining the details of the order. We are glad to know that it has been approved by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. We are also glad
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0129"/>
<col>241</col>
to know that the order will enable there to be sufficient financial support for the Welsh language channel. The figures in the order are, in a sense, slightly complicated because, on the one hand, one has the increase in the amount of the free slice from &#x00A3;250,000 to &#x00A3;650,000 before the payments start, but, on the other, those additional payments&#x2014;the amount of the levy payments&#x2014;are increased from 2 to 2.8 per cent.<lb/>
Although presumably most contractors will, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, have a decrease in the amount of levy payment which they make&#x2014;because of the increase in the size of the free slice&#x2014;there must be a point at which they would be making an increased payment. Perhaps the Minister could say to what point advertising receipts would have to increase for a particular contractor to have to pay an increase in the amount of his levy payments. With those words, we welcome the order and the purpose for which it was made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01272"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had intended to preface my brief remarks by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for explaining the order so clearly. Unhappily, I was prevented from being here to hear the explanation, but I am assured it was very clear and I rise to say that we on these Benches welcome the order in so far as it will be of help and assistance to the independent television contractors and other broadcasters at a time of very great difficulty. Looking at the order and the legislation on which it is based, it seems that there is an element of assistance here and a recognition of the special problems they face.<lb/>
There is a tendency at present for us to assume that independent broadcasting is free&#x2014;that somehow it falls from the sky and does not have to be paid for&#x2014;whereas the amount of advertising income available is necessarily limited. As we now diversify into a fourth channel and breakfast television. I can see a point when the independent contractors will be in increasing difficulty in meeting their obligations according to the high standards with which they have always met them in the past. And therefore, in so far as the order is of some temporary assistance to the independent contractors at present, I would merely say, "Thank you for small mercies", but will look continually at the increasing difficulties which the independent sector will face as we diversify into new fields and as, in other words, we dilute the possible revenue that can come forward from advertisers to support this very important part of our public service broadcasting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01273"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in thanking noble Lords for their reception of the order, I can explain the difficulty which the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, expressed by saying that this works not unlike income tax. By increasing the exempt income of the companies, we are not drawing more money from them and any company would have to increase its advertising revenue by a greater amount than the amount by which the free slice has been increased before it started to pay more, and of course it would be paying it on a larger income. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for his kind remarks and I hope that his break fast <i>Hansard</i> will have the effect of confirming his opinion of the lucidity of my explanation. If it does not, he has only to write to me.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ECC 15th Report: Natural Gas</title>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01275">4.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01276"><member>Lord Kings Norton</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the report of the European Communities Committee on Natural Gas (15th Report, 1981&#x2013;82, H.L. 190).</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01277">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the report before the House stems from two communications received from the Commission. The earlier of these is a particularly useful document analysing the role of natural gas in the Community's energy supply. It points out the growing importance of imports of gas from outside the Community and discusses the difficulties which are consequently emerging. It particularly identifies the problem areas of security of supply and the prices paid to producers. This paper was considered by the Council of Energy Ministers in October 1981 and they asked the Commission to study the question further.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01278">The first result of their further work is the second Commission document, in which possible ways of improving security of supply are discussed. They were, of course, studied in some detail in the inquiry conducted by Sub-Committee F of the Select Committee. The sub-committee includes a number of noble Lords with special knowledge of the problems of gas and oil production, and one of them, the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, will be making his maiden speech this afternoon. Knowing as I do the contribution that he makes to the work of the sub-committee, I look forward with more than usual interest to what he has to say.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01279">The inquiry was spread over six meetings in the first half of this year, during which written evidence was received from a number of organisations. Representatives of several of these, including the Department of Energy, British Gas, Shell, BP, Elf Aquitaine, and Phillips Petroleum, gave oral evidence. I believe that the resulting report is a straightforward document, and that in introducing it I need do little more than indicate its scope and conclusions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01280">About one quarter of the energy demands of the Community is supplied by natural gas. The Community is however very far from self-sufficient, and needs substantial imports. Two Community countries are at present more conveniently situated than the rest. One is the Netherlands, which can supply its own needs: the other is the United Kingdom. Of our energy demands, 22.8 per cent. is met by gas, and of this gas, 76&#x00BD; per cent. is from indigenous production. The rest comes from the Norwegian share of the Frigg field.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01281">In the United Kingdom, we have, in consequence, little need to worry about security of supply for some time to come. We have substantial reserves on the United Kingdom continental shelf, and the Norwegian reserves can reasonably be expected to remain a secure source. The problems lie in the longer term. What, for example, when natural gas reserves available to us begin to decline, is the right balance between pipeline imports, imports of liquefied natural gas, and the manufacture of substitute natural gas from oil or coal? And what should be our contribution to the security of supply to the Community as a whole? Those problems
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0130"/>
<col>243</col>
are bound to come. The question that comprehends them all is, when? The answer to that is the size and accessibility of the reserves on the continental shelves of the United Kingdom and its firm friends.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01282">The importance of accurate forecasting of reserves is therefore obvious. Most of the witnesses examined in our inquiry believed that the reserves lie in the range 40 to 60 trillion cubic feet, but the Phillips Petroleum witnesses gave a much higher estimate, in the region of 110 to 130 trillion cubic feet. The higher figures would, if correct, ensure United Kingdom gas supplies until about the year 2020. The lower figures, however, would mean that sufficient gas from our own sources and from Norwegian imports at about the present level would be unlikely to last us beyond the end of the century, which, from the viewpoint of making and implementing a secure policy, is not all that far away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01283">Considerations such as these, elaborated as they are in the report, lead to the first, and perhaps the most important, of the report's formal conclusions, which is that more precise knowledge about the extent of natural gas reserves is essential and can be obtained only by increased exploration drilling. Exploration drilling should, therefore, be encouraged.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01284">The form that this encouragement might take is discussed in Part II of the report. The possibility of funding exploration drilling at national or Community level is canvassed. Another suggestion is that the United Kingdom Government might offer for licensing such new acreage as would assist in the evaluation of reserves. Another, summarised in our second conclusion, is that in awarding new licences the Government should give more weight to the contributions to improving knowledge of gas reserves made by drilling on existing licences. We conclude also that disincentives to "farm out" activity should be eliminated, and I hope that in his speech the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, will discuss this somewhat technical point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01285">I mentioned a few minutes ago the possibility of the United Kingdom contributing to the European gas demand. This is discussed in Part III of the report, and while your Lordships' Committee counsels prudence, it believes that the United Kingdom Government should consider whether, and when, exports of natural gas to the Community would be justified. Obviously that conclusion, utterly dependent as it is on the forecasts of reserves and the progress of developments in substitute natural gas manufacture, introduces the notion of a cross-channel pipeline. Noble Lords will have gathered from the first paragraph of Part IV of the report that a mere cross-channel pipeline did not appear likely to attract finance from commercial, national, or Community funds, but from later paragraphs, that a more promising possibility is a Norway&#x2014;United Kingdom cross-channel pipeline.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01286">Here the basic idea is the connection of the large Norwegian gas fields via the United Kingdom and its fields to the continental gas grid. Certainly the Norwegian producers might prefer&#x2014;they might prefer&#x2014;to reach the continental grid by some other route, such as via Sweden, but the overland United Kingdom route is likely to be the cheapest. Your Lordships' Committee believes that it should be United Kingdom policy to encourage the construction
<col>244</col>
of such pipelines. It would be to the advantage of Norway commercially; it would be to the advantage of the United Kingdom in the long term when our own indigenous supplies are diminishing; it would be to the advantage of the Community, even when the present Soviet supplies are augmented by the Siberian pipeline, in that both available volume and security of supply would be increased. Indeed the encouragement of diversity of supply to the Community is one of the report's formal recommendations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01287">In Part V of the report the long term alternatives to United Kingdom indigenous natural gas supply are discussed. Witnesses generally agreed that pipeline imports should be the first option. An appropriate pipeline system could make available to us not only Norwegian gas, but supplies entering the continental grid from the USSR and Algeria. Beyond a critical distance, at present not accurately quantified, it is more economic to import liquefied natural gas in tankers than to pipe it. The other possibility, which I have already mentioned, is gas synthesised from oil or coal. At current prices this is certainly not economic but, with the vast coal reserves of the United Kingdom and West Germany, it is clearly a possibility always to be envisaged, and it is satisfactory to know that the European Commission supports research and development in SNG manufacture, and that the British Gas Corporation has a pilot SNG plant operating, financed partly by the EEC. With the long term future in mind, therefore, your Lordships' Committee recommends that both the Commission and Her Majesty's Government should regularly review the need for, and the timing of, LNG imports and SNG manufacture.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01288">My Lords, I have nearly done. I have dealt briefly with all the conclusions of the report, except two. One of these is that the free play of market forces provides the best defence against unreasonable price demands. The other is concerned with gas storage. The Commission documents recommend the development of gas storage facilities as one insurance against interruption of supply. The British Gas Corporation already have storage for liquefied natural gas and salt cavity storage for natural gas. They are also developing the use of depleted gas reservoirs for storage. They view these arrangements, however, as an insurance against interruptions in supply, and as ways of meeting peak demand. They see no case for strategic storage. In this your Committee agree, and have reported accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01289">My Lords, that is a brief review of the report on natural gas which is before the House. Your committee consider that it raises important issues of policy and principle, and we shall he interested to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, the views of Her Majesty's Government. My Lords, I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01290"><member>Lord Wynne-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I ask him whether the committee formed any opinion about converting natural gas into methanol in order to transport it, rather than to transport liquefied natural gas?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01291"><member>Lord Kings Norton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess to the noble Lord, Lord Wynne-Jones, that we did not consider that possibility, but it is one which, now he has mentioned it. I will bring before the committee.<lb/>
Moved, That this House takes note of the report of
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0131"/>
<col>245</col>
the European Communities Committee on Natural Gas (15th Report, 1981&#x2013;82, H.L. 190).&#x2014;(<i>Lord Kings Norton</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01292">4.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01293"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, for initiating this debate, and I think it is appropriate, as I am sure the House will agree, that he should do so as the noble Lord is, as the House knows, the distinguished chairman of Sub-Committee F, which has produced this thorough and far-reaching report. I should like to congratulate him, if I may, on the clear and concise way in which he has introduced this complicated subject.<lb/>
Of course, the subject is also an important one, as he has said, since, as the Commission's documents make clear, natural gas meets around a quarter of the Community's domestic, commercial and industrial market. The Commission recommends that in view of the rapid growth of imports from outside the Community, including imports from the USSR, future supplies should be secured, and indeed improved, by encouraging, in particular, more indigenous production in Community countries. The United Kingdom has, as we know, substantial reserves of natural gas on the United Kingdom continental shelf, and there are also substantial Netherlands and Norwegian reserves, as the noble Lord said.<lb/>
As the report makes clear, the problem lies in the longer-term. When natural gas reserves begin to decline, there must be a balance struck between imports by pipeline, imports of liquefied natural gas and the development of substitute natural gas from coal and oil. One of the difficulties seems to be, as the report points out, that there is by no means full agreement on how long the United Kingdom's reserves are likely to last&#x2014;and this was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton. The most pessimistic forecasts estimate until about the year 2000, while the more optimistic predict another 20 years on&#x2014;until, say, 2020. The most optimistic prediction of all, from Phillips Petroleum, one of the leading oil companies, concludes that the United Kingdom's needs could be satisfied until the middle of the next century. The only way to prove which is right among these various "guesstimates" is surely to have more drillings of both exploration and appraisal wells. The report suggests various ways in which this can be done.<lb/>
The committee has also proposed that more weight should be given in future, when awarding new licences, to the contribution made by drilling work on existing licences to any knowledge of the gas reserves in the area concerned. This, I think, is a very important point which I hope the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will be able to comment on when he comes to reply. I should like to ask the noble Lord also to tell the House when he replies how the Government propose to encourage more drilling, and whether they think that the recent legislation has had any effect, or whether the onerous tax regime is proving more of a disincentive. Can the noble Lord let the House have some idea of Government policy, if it exists, on long-term export commitments when knowledge of the extent of our reserves is so hazy and apparently dependent on a fog
<col>246</col>
of conjecture? Here, the committee comes down firmly on the side of prudence, against the advocates of free market forces. Will the Government tell the House where they stand?<lb/>
The committee's report considers the possibility of a cross-channel pipeline to bring the gas from the large Norwegian reserves due to come on stream in the 1990s to the European continental grid via the United Kingdom. This, I think, is a very interesting point, which was also alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton. Some of this gas could be delivered <i>en route</i> to the United Kingdom's grid. It is thought that an overland United Kingdom route might be cheaper than the seabed alternative. The committee concludes that such a pipeline would be an advantage to this country and also to our Community partners, and that it would improve Europe's security of supply in general, as this surely can only be increased by such a diversification of sources. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will be able to tell the House what the Government think of this proposal.<lb/>
Whatever the timespan for our reserves of natural gas, not even the wildest optimist would predict that these will last beyond the middle of the next century&#x2014;a mere lifetime away for a 1980s child. Let us hope that one day substitute natural gas, SNG, which can be synthesised through coal and oil, will be available to meet some of our everyday energy needs. The European Commission support research and development in this field, and I believe the British Gas Corporation have a pilot plant in Scotland which is part of the EEC research programme. I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, when the Government think that SNG will become commercially viable, and what are their long-term plans for large-scale production.<lb/>
There are several other matters which I should have liked to allude to, but I think there is no time available. These would have been particularly liquefied natural gas, its import and storage; but I know that many other noble Lords have their names down to speak, and we are also looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington. In conclusion, therefore, may I say that we are grateful to the noble Lord for introducing this report, and I commend it to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01294">4.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01295"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to echo the remarks which have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, to the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton. It has been a privilege to serve on his committee and to be part of this really excellent report. I think the staff who helped prepare it deserve considerable congratulation on the way it is presented and on the way it can be read. I think that the speeches will be extremely short, because virtually everything we should like to say has almost certainly been said rather better in the report which is before us. I should like also to say how much I am looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, because he made some very high-quality contributions to the subcommittee, and I look forward particularly to hearing what he is going to say to us in this debate.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, has said, the report raises a number of questions for which Her
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0132"/>
<col>247</col>
Majesty's Government should have some answers, or at least they should be in a position to indicate, at the same time perhaps, the longer-term thinking of the Department of Energy and the right honourable Minister concerned. But, for me, there is one question which the evidence in the report answers, which is the so-called energy crisis of resources. So far as gas is concerned, for me it appears to be over.<lb/>
We have much more time to work out our policy than was thought two or three years ago. I feel that it is very important that we use this time wisely to present policies, not only for this country but for the whole Community, in order that gas supplies remain stable as do their prices for the next 30 years. The sources of gas supply, whether they are to be found under the land or under the sea, whether they are liquefied natural gas or substitute natural gas, are there to a certain degree in abundance. The only question that remains is that of the price to the consumers. This, of course, in turn, must depend upon the cost of production and delivery. Therefore, if I may paraphrase, supply stability must equal price stability. That, to me, is what should be the objective not only of Her Majesty's Government but of the Governments of the EEC in their future thinking about gas and its position in the energy programmes.<lb/>
The only problem with the EEC is that they have a different approach, in that they are mainly importers of natural gas, whereas we in this country are in the fortunate position of having our own reserves. Therefore, the EEC may approach the subject from a different angle: although, basically, I do not think so.<lb/>
The problem of forecasting has been mentioned. If I may put it in gambling parlance, you either go for the low field or for the high field on the estimates that have so far been given. The only way that we can get nearer to the truth of the matter is by a rapidly increased programme of exploration&#x2014;and the incentives put forward in the Oil and Gas Bill are perhaps a start. The question is whether they are going to activate further exploration at a level and a rate which can give us some of the answers upon which to formulate an energy policy for the future.<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, if he would ever consider incentives to smaller, independent owners of land actually to dig for gas&#x2014;if that is the right expression&#x2014;at a low level. This has proved a very successful policy in the United States; and it need not necessarily be very expensive for a riparian owner to conduct his own search for natural gas on his own property. This may be a wasteful and expensive matter for the individual concerned but I should like to ask whether Her Majesty's Government would consider at any time giving incentives for riparian owners to do their own research at their own cost.<lb/>
To return to forecasting, if we reach the high-field option or if the indications show that the Phillips Petroleum estimates may be more correct and are deliverable, then I believe that there is a case for the United Kingdom to consider exports to the Community. If, on the other hand, the increased exploration indicates a low field, then perhaps we might have to reconsider the matter of exports. My own guess, for what it is worth, is that the figures
<col>248</col>
contained in the high-field estimate show that the high level table may prove more correct than the more cautious estimates. In that case, I think that a pipeline network in the United Kingdom, including a cross-Channel link to look after the transport of the gas from the large Norwegian fields, is something we on these Benches fully support.<lb/>
There is one matter which has already been touched on briefly. It is the Siberian pipeline, which will prove to become the biggest single supplier in Europe apart from Norway. Again, if I may go hack to the paraphrase of supply stability equals price stability, the diversity and continuity of supply for the Community must be at the forefront of any energy policy for the Community itself. I think it has been embarrassing to those of us connected with the subject of energy to see the efforts the United States Government have made to dissuade manufacturers from taking any part in this programme, and its quite considerable efforts to block this project in the form of technology. It could also be a costly policy to the Community, if it was successful, in the sense that it would create unemployment and would also create difficulties for those American subsidiary companies operating in Europe.<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, if he can give reassurance on the Government's position here to those companies that have been involved with the supply of technical apparatus for this pipeline. I believe that there are legal problems connected with this, and I think that some clarification would be helpful&#x2014;as much for the reassurance of employment in France and Scotland as for those companies which are directly connected with the supply of gas equipment. When all is said and done, gas is not a very complicated item to supply. This technology ban would only make it a more inefficient supply; it would not stop it. A number of Press reports have indicated that, if the Americans were to effect a proper embargo on this technology, then the Siberian gas pipeline deliveries would be unable to go ahead. I am informed that that is not so. They may not be able to produce gas as efficiently as they would with this special turbine equipment; but it would not stop it.<lb/>
Again a matter of principle is involved here. I do not want to widen the question into foreign policy or to deal with Poland. It is a question of a fair price for gas for the future of all in Europe. I believe that the Siberian gas contribution (which will amount to 22 per cent. of the European uptake) will go a long way to stabilising gas prices for the citizens of the EEC. I do not think it is any business of the United States to interfere with this policy, for whatever reason they may give. I cannot see the logic of it either, in the sense that they appear quite happy to export grain, possibly to feed the workers who are actually building the Siberian pipeline itself.<lb/>
I do not want to enter into the wider context of this, but it raises a matter of principle which I think that we in Europe could do without at the moment. We wish to maintain the friendly and harmonious relationship with the United States on which the whole security of the Western Alliance depends. I think that this has been a silly, misguided policy which is creating unnecessary misunderstanding and certainly a lot of doubt about the long term future of Scottish employment, as well as unnecessary frustration for those of us
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0133"/>
<col>249</col>
who are trying to involve any government which is part of the Community in a sensible energy policy for Europe. I hope that the Government, without affecting in any way our friendly relationship with the United States, will make their position more firmly felt than they have done to date, in that perhaps this matter can be dropped and the Community can plan its gas supplies rather on the lines that have been suggested in this report, without any disturbance for political reasons from our allies.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01297"><member>Viscount Torrington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must thank the noble Lords, Lord Kings Norton and Lord Tanlaw, for their introductory remarks. I had thought to open by saving that natural gas seemed a very appropriate subject for a maiden speech; but I think that that perhaps would be to treat it with undue levity. The benefits of natural gas now reach into a vast number of homes and commercial enterprises throughout this country. If we are going to continue to enjoy those benefits beyond the year 2000, we must take a number of important decisions in the relatively near future. I must declare an interest in this subject in that, outside this House, I am a director of a small gas and exploration company.<lb/>
As a number of speakers have already said, and I agree, the most interesting aspect of the report is the very wide diversity of views over the ultimately recoverable reserves of gas from the United Kingdom continental shell. As has been said, we will only ascertain the truth by drilling a very large number of exploration wells. In order that the industry can raise the capital to drill those wells two important aspects need to fall into place. The first is that the industry should he permitted to make the best possible use of the very small supply of prospective exploration acreage; and the second is that a market should exist so that when an explorer makes a discovery he knows that he may sell his gas.<lb/>
The raw material of the exploration industry is of course the exploration acreage and I must welcome, obviously, the decision of the Government to award new licences in the southern gas basin in the forthcoming licensing round. But in many ways we must be more concerned as time goes on with what I call secondhand exploration acreage. A great deal of prospective exploration acreage is now held by companies who have fulfilled their initial drilling obligations and whose original geological concepts have been shot down. The companies at the end of a primary term of a licence have to give up half the area and they give up the least interesting area.<lb/>
But, at the same time, they find it difficult to persuade their managements to make additional drilling expenditures. Waiting on the sidelines of course there are a number of companies with different geological concepts of a given piece of acreage and the funds to pursue their ideas. This is in effect the traditional basis for a farm out where he who has the acreage gets together with he who has the funds and the new idea and together they pool their interests and drill another well and possibly make another discovery.<lb/>
However, it is my impression that the Department of Energy in the past has not welcomed farm out
<col>250</col>
arrangements, possibly because they have tended to put a value on acreage which was handed out by the Government originally effectively for free. At the same time, the Inland Revenue has in a number of cases endeavoured to recognise this value and seek to charge a capital gain on he who is farming out the acreage. I am not aware that they have successfully recouped any tax on this basis, but obviously it is a disincentive especially as in quite a large number of farm-outs no cash actually arises in anybody's hands with which to pay the tax.<lb/>
Geologists are artists rather than scientists and the oil companies are their patrons. We must ensure that the very small supply of canvas is used to the maximum efficiency and that the bad pictures can be repainted. I certainly ask her Majesty's Government to consider easing and encouraging farm out activity.<lb/>
The other important aspect that I mentioned was market, and a very prominent aspect of the market is price. I do not think that it is appropriate for me today to say very much about price except that the pricing policy of the British Gas Corporation during the latter half of the 70s resulted in virtually no exploration activity at all. I hope that we are now about to see a change in that situation.<lb/>
As to the market itself, which is what will give the security to the explorer, the United Kingdom is a closed market. Gas may come into it but it may not get out. The domestic explorer is therefore faced with the situation that if he brings a discovery on stream he may be trying to sell gas into a saturated market, either saturated by other discoveries or saturated by an over-commitment to Norwegian or Algerian LNG imports. At the same time, the Norwegians have recently discovered a number of very large potential fields in the northern North Sea which will be slow and very expensive to develop. They have to take careful decisions. They appear to be faced by two markets: one, which is nearer, is the United Kingdom; but, as I said, it is a closed market and from the Norwegian point of view the problem is exactly the same as for a British producer.<lb/>
The European market is probably insatiable, although rather further away. Unless we take certain steps to encourage the Norwegians, I think that the bulk of Norwegian gas will go to Europe; but this need not be so. As another noble Lord has already said, the United Kingdom is a logical route for a grand trunk gas line. If such a gas line existed with the cross channel link, the Norwegians would be able to sell into the United Kingdom without the fear that perhaps domestic preference for a major, indigenous discovery will squeeze them out. The United Kingdom producer will be able to develop his field, knowing that if the market is saturated he will merely displace Norwegian gas which will travel on to Europe or (dare I say it?) maybe his gas will be exported. What is perhaps most important of all is that the United Kingdom consumer will have the bulk of the supplies of gas available to Western Europe passing through his back yard. That must be a very valuable aspect.<lb/>
This is not really a European Community matter; it is more a matter for Westen Europe and we might still be having this debate if the EEC did not exist. It must he to the benefit of the whole of Western Europe that Britain is encouraged to find and develop its gas reserves to the maximum&#x2014;and this is so for
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0134"/>
<col>251</col>
Norway&#x2014;so that ultimately the large anticipated imports of gas from Eastern Europe remain merely a useful palliative and not an addictive drug to Western Europe. My Lords, I commend the report to you.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01298">4.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01299"><member>Lord Kearton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is my good fortune immediately to follow my noble friend Lord Torrington and to congratulate him on his superb maiden speech. He has demonstrated in this speech his very powerful analytical mind, his great knowledge of the industry and the extraordinarily constructive comments that he always has to make on very complex subjects. I was one of the many on Lord Kings Norton's Sub-Committee F who learned a great deal from my noble friend Lord Torrington. It is customary to say on these occasions that we all hope that the maiden speaker will speak much more frequently in future. This is certainly the case with my noble friend. In this House I have noticed, as a sometime attender, that either the very young or the very old speak best, and those of us in the middle do not speak too well. I think my noble friend Lord Torrington, although no longer in the very first flush of youth, is one of the younger speakers whom we would like to hear very much more.<lb/>
It was a great privilege to sit on Sub-Committee F under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton. It was an interesting investigation, we had excellent witnesses and the documentation of the report which, as has been said, was so well put together, will provide a source book for many years to come on natural gas matters.<lb/>
It is said in the beginning of the report&#x2014;this is in paragraph 7&#x2014;that gas reserves hold the key to policy making. I think the range of gas reserves in the North Sea is perhaps even wider than has been already mentioned. The firm reserves, the reserves that people are absolutely sure about, are about 25 trillion cubic feet. In the upper range, the possibility, which was the one mentioned by Phillips Petroleum, is 130 tell So the ratio between what is certain and what might be is six to one and that is a very wide variability.<lb/>
It was generally agreed by the oil companies and the Department of Energy that the probable and possible reserves will ultimately turn out to be from between 50 tcf and 60 tcf. But to determine this figure will require a great deal of additional drilling. I should like to put into perspective the figures of 25 tcf which are the firm, indigenous reserves on the United Kingdom part of the North Sea shelf. They are about 1&#x00BD; per cent. of known world reserves. Similarly, if further drilling proves right at 50 tcf, it will still be about per cent. of the probable world reserves. So although natural gas is so important to us, it is really a very small fraction of world resources, and as a lot of the gas which exists is in countries which have no specific use for it, we obviously should consider importing some of our needs in future years.<lb/>
Why do we not know what is in the North Sea? The obvious answer: not enough drilling. Why did we not have enough drilling? I think the basic reason is that the fields found early were very large indeed and the British Gas Corporation was able in the 1960s and early 1970s to enter into contracts which ensured its needs for some 15 years ahead.<lb/>
<col>252</col>
British Gas concentrated on premium outlets and were able to develop those premium outlets because they were able to offer advantageous prices to the customer. British Gas did not want to establish great quantities of new reserves. They felt that if they did so the demand to use up those reserves by the producers who had spent their money on exploration would be to degrade the end use of natural gas. In other words, instead of being reserved for premium uses, the gas would start being burned under boilers. This is what happened with the Gruningen gas from Holland, and I frankly think that the policy of the British Gas Corporation turned out to be the correct one for the country.<lb/>
British Gas was able to develop this market because of its extraordinarily good service, because its price was right and because it did a brilliant job all round. It did an excellent job on transforming all domestic appliances to use natural gas, and the way it put up the equipment to handle the gas coming ashore was very well done. The land distribution of the natural gas was a major enterprise, again extraordinarily well done, and I think that the whole way in which British Gas tackled this wonderful new benefit to the country is deserving of the highest praise and credit.<lb/>
The low prices which British Gas offered, by which they were able to take the market from electricity and other energy forms even at lower purchase prices&#x2014;and it must be remembered that some of them were very low&#x2014;were freely entered into at the time by the producers, and this gave British Gas great cash resources. They used these progressively to write off all their obsolescent plant; they used it to pay off their debts and they invested heavily and wisely. As my noble friend Lord Torrington has said, British Gas perhaps got a little complacent about the strength of their position and in the mid-1970s were not very popular in the North Sea. At the time, if I might declare an interest, the British National Oil Corporation had a 50 per cent. share in the Viking Gasfield and I struggled very very hard indeed to get a rather better price from British Gas for the supply. I had to do it from BNOC because our partners, Conoco, were so intimidated by the British Gas Corporation that they did not like to do the arguing themselves.<lb/>
The British Gas position, as sole monopoly buyer, was extremely strong. I might mention that the price British Gas were paying in 1975&#x2013;76 was as low as 2p per therm, or even less. Since 1976&#x2013;77 there have been progressive increases. British Gas has been more accommodating to adjusting southern North Sea prices. They have had to pay a higher price for Frigg gas and for gas from the Brent field; so we have seen this progressive increase in the last few years in the price paid by British Gas. In the last financial year it was up to 10.5p per therm, which is five times what they were paying a few years earlier&#x2014;still very low, but more satisfactory.<lb/>
All the indications now are that British Gas is having to adapt to a new position. It coped very well with very wide seasonal demands: the difference between peak demand and the low summer demand is a factor of about four. British Gas renegotiated many of its contracts for the southern North Sea to cope with this to ensure that there was no hitch in supplies. But by now their comfortable position is going. Those
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0135"/>
<col>253</col>
original contracts are coming to an end, some of the southern gas fields are becoming exhausted and more than half the gas has already gone. It realises that it is going to need new gas, certainly in the second half of the 980s&#x2014;some figures put it as near as 1985 and others in 1988. But in only a few years from now British Gas will want fresh gas and this has altered its outlook on the price it is prepared to offer.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Torrington said, price is a very keen component in the whole exploration and development scene and the latest news is that for the associated gas from the North Alwyn field it is prepared to offer something like 22p per therm. The gas which British Gas was expecting from the North Sea spinal pipeline has not matured because the pipeline has not been proceeded with. Brent gas will be rather late and I think it has been rather below expectations in quantity. So we are going to have a change from the picture of a satisfied buyer with adequate gas and strong contracts into one of a buyer which needs extra gas; and all the indications are that the British Gas Corporation will be coming close to what is now the accepted price for new gas in Europe, whether it is from Algeria, Tunisia or Russia, of round about 25p per therm. So I think the anxieties of the producers and explorers, which were very real indeed for most of the 1970s, will now be a thing of the past.<lb/>
It is essential that the Government take steps, as outlined in the report, to make sure that more exploration is done. If we are going to get the extra gas we need, not just for the 1990s but even for the second half of this decade, exploration must take place now and development must be put in hand very shortly. I think the idea that the new Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act will greatly change the position of British Gas as a main buyer is not well founded. We did not find anyone in the witnesses from the oil companies who thought that being able to sell the gas directly to perhaps industrial consumers in this country would make any great difference. As my noble friend Lord Torrington said, selling into this closed market, the British Gas Corporation has an overwhelmingly dominant position. My own view is that with supplies of gas so uncertain this factor of six between what we know is there and what possibly might he there, and probably only a factor of two over what we know is there (and even that is dependent upon a great deal of exploration), does not really leave us with much room to export to the Continent, not if we are to safeguard our own position. If in fact some of the exploration produces major fields, then, as the report indicates, the Government could reconsider the position.<lb/>
I have paid some compliments to British Gas, and I think rightly, because their contribution in making possible the development of the North Sea has been really quite amazing and they have finished up providing tremendous assets for the nation. At current prices, the British Gas balance sheet is about &#x00A3;10.5 billion. Their capital liabilities, which are normally regarded as equity capital, are under &#x00A3;400 million; and even offsetting the &#x00A3;400 million British Gas have &#x00A3;300 million on loan to the National Loan Fund. So to all intents and purposes this immense asset of &#x00A3;10.5 billion has been provided by British Gas by clever
<col>254</col>
commercial operations with no load on the taxpayer whatsoever. For the future I have fears that the Government will try to take too much out of the gas industry, as undoubtedly they are trying to take too much out of the oil industry at the present time. It seems reasonable, I suppose, when the Gas Corporation get into the position of lending the Government money that they should take the money from it directly: hence we have the gas levy, which was about &#x00A3;300 million last year and will probably be between &#x00A3;400 to &#x00A3;500 million in the current year.<lb/>
However, when one looks at the figures of British Gas, one finds that their selling prices are now up to about 30p per therm, their buying price, plus the levy, is up to about 13p per therm and, if they have to pay&#x2014;as they undoubtedly will have to pay&#x2014;the going market European prices for the extra gas, which will be around 25p per therm, then the selling price for British gas, both to industry and to domestic consumers, will increase quite markedly over the next five or six years. It is most important that we do not get into a position where British industry is penalised by paying more for gas than its industrial competitors in Europe.<lb/>
I think that the Government have fairly asked British Gas whether the operating costs, which in the last year's accounts are 16.5p per therm, can he reduced. But if they cannot he reduced, then any further loading of taxation or levy on the British Gas Corporation will make the position both of the domestic consumer and of the industrial consumer of this country very much worse. I think that we must do everything we can to encourage more gas production. Our taxation system is already too onerous on the producer, and we must not make the parallel mistake of making the taxation system too onerous on British Gas.<lb/>
The report brings out that there is a great deal of natural gas in the world, and your Lordships will probably have gathered that I believe, as the report states, that British Gas should keep their options open when it comes to the importation of natural gas from other sources. It makes great sense to have this trunk pipeline from Norway, through the United Kingdom, across the Channel and into the Continent. We shall require a great deal of nursing to get this done. Our relationships with the Norwegians on previous negotiations have not been too happy. Maybe we were asking too much: maybe they got suspicious of us. But the fact remains that there are fences to mend there. Although there is a great deal of gas in Norwegian waters, it is not thought that it will be either very easy or cheap to extract and to get the full benefit of North Sea reserves in Norwegian waters passing through this country and on the Continent is going to take at least 10 years, as I think most experts would agree, and a great deal of money. Therefore, if we are to have our share in the 1990s we must get negotiations starting now.<lb/>
With regard to substitute natural gas from coal, I think that this is for the very distant future. Even the evidence from the Coal Board put it in the decade 2000 to 2010, and even that is probably optimistic. When one thinks also that, to provide even half the present natural gas that we are using from the North Sea by substitute natural gas would take 40 million to 50 million tonnes of coal, it does not seem to be an
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0136"/>
<col>255</col>
extremely sensible thing to base our future gas supplies on gasifying coal. It would be much better to scour the world to see what other supplies of natural gas we can import or, even more importantly, do everything possible, as outlined in the report, to get more exploration of the North Sea to make certain that our own reserves are established at a firm figure as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01300">5.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01301"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have had the privilege of being a member of the sub-committee which produced the draft of this report and I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, for the admirable way in which he introduced it in this debate today. I declare an interest, as I have in the past, as having worked during the last seven years for an oil company which is the operator of one of the largest fields producing oil in the North Sea at present. I am very glad to be following the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, because I am well aware of the great achievements which he made as the first chairman of the BNOC, which was a partner in the consortium for the field which I have just described.<lb/>
We have had the pleasure of listening to an outstanding maiden speech from my noble friend Lord Torrington and I congratulate him upon it. He can speak to us with great knowledge and experience from his position as a director of a company that is engaged in exploring for oil and gas. He said that geologists are artists, rather than scientists. He was certainly an artist today, with his brush painting the picture of farming out acreage in the North Sea. I know that we all look forward to hearing him many times in this House in the future.<lb/>
Already speakers have pointed out that there is a very wide range in the estimates of the remaining gas in the United Kingdom's sector of the North Sea. If one takes the minimum figure which the Department of Energy puts forward, and compares that with the maximum which the Phillips Company puts forward, the difference is enormous. I think we all agree that we need more knowledge, not only in order to evolve a policy for natural gas for our country, and also for Europe, but because it is basic to an informed policy on energy as a whole for this country. The question is: What are the best methods of finding out more information about our reserves?<lb/>
Hitherto, after the 1960s, there was little incentive for the companies to explore for gas; the gas had already been discovered in the basin off East Anglia. Companies were naturally attracted in the early 'seventies and onwards to finding oil further north, which led to the discovery and the development of the major oilfields east of Shetland. Those were, indeed, successful discoveries, because our self-sufficiency today depends to a great extent upon the oil flowing from those fields. But because the companies felt that it was not worth while or economic to find and produce more gas in those days, we have not gained as much knowledge, or as much gas, as we could have done.<lb/>
Of course, associated gas has been produced with the oil in oilfields and that will, no doubt continue. The point about that is that, in most cases, the gas has to be produced at the same time as the oil, if one is to get the oil. It has been important to make sure that as
<col>256</col>
much gas as possible was saved, either by being used on the platforms for power, or by being pumped back into reserves in the sea, and not simply flared. Those operations will still be necessary, but new, deliberate searches for gas are now required. I believe that the Government are aiming to encourage this&#x2014;certainly, their new legislation appears to have that as an objective&#x2014;and, for various reasons, as the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, said, prices are likely in future more to reflect the costs of producing natural gas from the North Sea.<lb/>
As regards the recommendations in the report, I should first like to turn to licensing. There are many factors to be considered when a Government are awarding licences to applicants. But I believe that the recommendation in the report should be taken very seriously; that is, examination of the extent to which companies have in the past gone out of their way to try to find gas. That mentions a past contribution, but I suggest that it should not be exclusive; after all, some companies have not had the opportunity to seek for gas in the past. So that recommendation should not be carried out in a kind of rough justice way. To some extent, it has been a matter of chance. So I should like to add a footnote to that recommendation, and say that Government should consider the general performance in the past of companies, and the likelihood in the future of their being able to add to knowledge, from the programmes which they are putting forward, of our reserves of natural gas. So it is also the contribution which can be made and is to be made by companies, as well as their past performance, which should be considered.<lb/>
I now turn to taxation, which is mentioned in paragraph 10 of the report. As the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, indicated, the North Sea tax regime has become oppressive so far as oil is concerned and it is now. I believe, a deterrent to development plans. This is not the only factor which deters companies but it is one which the Government can control. Most of the other factors are not within their power.<lb/>
Of course, it is not exploration that is as seriously affected by the tax r&#x00E9;gime as decisions on development. It can be pointed out that there are applicants who come forward, apparently eagerly, at succeeding rounds of licence awards, and that will no doubt continue. But it is the later development decisions which are very much more expensive and which indeed involve huge quantities of money. Exploration is expensive but it is small compared with the amounts of money involved when a field has been discovered and decisions have to be taken about development. The lead times for both oil and gas are very long. In order to ensure the supplies which the Government and the country will expect in the 1990s, decisions on the development of fields need to be taken in the near future and not delayed. The fields on which these decisions will be taken are, on average, going to be considerably smaller than the ones which have been found and developed in the past. Most of the large fields in the North Sea have been discovered.<lb/>
Another point is that the supporting industries, especially the platform building companies, are finding themselves without work while development decisions are being delayed. They may dwindle, and later we might have to go to foreign suppliers because our own industries have declined.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0137"/>
<col>257</col>
As I have said, I do not expect the applications for exploration to be much affected by the oil tax r&#x00E9;gime. It is the very important development decisions concerning our future supplies to which I draw attention. I urge the Government to re-examine very seriously the effects of the North Sea tax r&#x00E9;gime with their eyes on the 1990s and the quantities of both gas and oil which we ought to be producing in those years. I am not suggesting that there should be massive expansion. I am simply considering self-sufficiency in those years. But decisions will need to be taken now in order to ensure supplies.<lb/>
I come to the pipeline which has been suggested in the report: a pipeline for gas from the Norwegian sector to the United Kingdom and then another pipeline, which would be part of the scheme, from Britain to the Continent. It looks as though this scheme will be needed. It will provide flexibility of supplies and it will enable the price mechanism to operate. As other speakers have pointed out, this seemed to the Committee to be desirable and necessary in the future, but it will take some years to bring to fruition. It seems that recently gas pipelines have been bedevilled with difficulties. I refer to the gas gathering line which eventually did not come about and also to the Siberian pipeline. But in this case I suggest that the pipeline must be so clearly advantageous to all concerned that there should be no difficulty about the financing of it, whether from private sources or public, or a combination of both. Those decisions, however, must clearly be taken before the pipeline scheme is embarked upon. As regards this pipeline, I do not think there would he any difficulties about the strategic side.<lb/>
With those comments, adding to the recommendations of the report which I fully support, again I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, on introducing this debate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01303"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from this side of the House, I should like to join in congratulating the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, upon his informed speech. I hope that we shall have many more opportunities of listening to him. I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, and his expert team upon this splendid report which I have read, including that part where the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, expressed his doubts about the marginal development of gas from coal.<lb/>
I shall not detain the House for very long, because there are speakers yet to be heard with much more expertise than I have. However, I have a number of points to make. What has to be remembered is that the onshore infrastructure for the supply of gas from our indigenous offshore supplies was completed&#x2014;and suprised us all&#x2014;in the mid 1970s. It was a massive job, and it has proved effective. It proved so reliable that the demand for gas from industry as well as from domestic users almost outstripped supply. This was because of the excellent pipeline communications. To meet this demand the industry planned to increase capital spending from &#x00A3;300 million per annum in the current year, to about &#x00A3;400 million in 1983. It would be absolutely foolish of the Government to cut down
<col>258</col>
on that capital development. I am not going to discuss whether private or public enterprise should be involved. However, if Britain is to be less moribund than it is at the moment, it is vitally important that our sources of energy should be co-ordinated.<lb/>
This gas industry&#x2014;it is God's gift to us, together with oil&#x2014;is not being exploited and organised as it should be. Lack of capacity to meet today's demand for gas has placed a restraint on the industry's freedom to set prices. This is a political area. There must be a reasonable price, whether it be public or private enterprise. A private entrepreneur must get his price per therm for the gas which will allow for development. We want reasonable exploration and a reasonable rate of profit for those who are courageous enough to enter this difficult area. As I have already said, the demand for gas has placed a restraint upon the industry's freedom to set prices. The public do not seem to be aware, although I believe that it was the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, who mentioned it in his speech that the Gas Council did a magnificent job. They capitalised the expenditure programme with no recourse to national funds. This was an achievement in itself, proving that public enterprise has done a good job.<lb/>
Let me turn to Cmnd. 1978/7049 and Cmnd. 1979/7439. Without boring the House with the details, what do we find? In 1978&#x2013;79 there was a drop in the estimates of capital expenditure by 50, in the following year by 149, and in the next year by 188. Then it crept up a little to 100 in 1981&#x2013;82, because there was supposed to he a re-phasing of major transmission projects. The steel industry is of paramount importance to the gas industry, because it will supply the pipelines. What is the good of discovering gas in Morecambe Bay and the Irish Sea unless one can guarantee that British Steel will provide the pipes? We should not forget that President Reagan threatened not to provide steel for the transmission of gas from Siberia. We do not want to be in the hands of a Reagan or anybody else.<lb/>
We want our British steel industry to be kept alive, and if this Goverment had courage they would take the opportunity now of seeing that South Wales and other steel areas get cracking on producing. Once you lose good steel labour it is like losing miners, and the young ones will not come into it. Not any Tom, Dick or Harry can cut coal at the face; it is nothing like a factory. Once you lose these men and their strength (and, God forbid, they are good for Rugby only until they are 25, and then they are finished, with pneumoconiosis) it is very difficult to get the training undertaken for coal cutting. It is exactly the same in the steel industry. Although we are discussing gas, we are also discussing gas pipelines for communication, and the Government must be alerted to this point.<lb/>
Domestic, industrial and commercial consumers need as much energy as we can get. This Government's job&#x2014;because they now have the job of running the country and I do not want to make any party politics out of this&#x2014;is to get down to co-ordinating energy supplies. Do not let us forget that ruthless competition could be a drag on the co-ordination of energy supplies; competition, yes&#x2014;but do not let us get ruthless about it.<lb/>
Finally I should like to ask what progress is being made with the Morecambe Bay sites in the Irish Sea.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0138"/>
<col>259</col>
We have heard very little about this although it is in the report. Will the Government act on the expertise which has been presented by the assiduous progress of the noble Lords who sat for weeks to produce this report? Something should be done with this report. One other point; it is important to develop new resources and technology. I remember that on a visit to China I learned that the Chinese were trying fluidised combustion, which they had just heard about, and the liquefaction of coal. I am not qualified enough to get an in-depth argument going on that point but, from my reading and discussions, a coal-based natural gas is now already beyond the experimental stage. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, who is well informed, thinks that this is so far beyond the experimental stage that it is nevertheless worth dealing with that side of producing gas.<lb/>
My final point&#x2014;and it is not a crack at the noble Lord the chairman&#x2014;is that I have here a little book of initials and what they mean. I paid a lot of money for it. It states:
<quote>"This is a guide to initials, acronyms and abbreviations designed to soothe the temper of everyone who suffers from the current worldwide initial mania".</quote>
In the name of the Lord above, I was on a committee to which I suggested that on the first page of its report we put a list of the abbreviations so that when Lord Davies of Leek looked at SNG or ABC and has forgotten from three pages previous what those initials stood for, he could turn to the list and find the meaning. That is a bit of a jocular remark but to a student of these problems and to men who are busy, it would be time-saving and good for the English language.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01305"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder if I shall ever listen to a speech by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, when he does not refer to acronyms. Of course, one starts one's contribution to this debate by joining with other noble Lords in their accolades to the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Torrington. It was a very well-informed speech: clear, precise, instructive. It so happens that we got him interested in the sub-committee as a result of my meeting with him at a dinner, when I asked him, "Why not come and test the temperature and see how you like it for one morning a week, with two or three hours' reading a week?" He came and we on Sub-Committee F were all enchanted and instructed by his contributions. He has now gone a stage further and taken the temperature of the House itself. This is clearly welcome to us all and there is no doubt of the sincerity of successive speakers' conventional assurances that they look forward to hearing him again.<lb/>
I should disclose an interest in that I too am connected with a company that gave evidence to the committee. But nothing I have to say now has come out of my office nor from any kind of briefing they have given me. I always feel overwhelmed in these energy debates by the expertise of those who have gone before and those who threaten to come after. One is comforted by sitting for week after week under the distinguished and genial chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, and in company which is always stimulating.<lb/>
<col>260</col>
Most of the things I wanted to say have been said already but, to abbreviate a little, the short point of our report is that both Britain and the EEC will need a lot more gas than they at present know where to find&#x2014;and it will certainly he needed if the famous upturn in the economy ever comes about. In our consumption in this country of about 50 billion cubic metres per year, we have to import one-third from Norway. The EEC, consuming five or six times as much as Britain, will face a yearly shortfall greater by about half than our total annual consumption&#x2014;and that even when they have supplies from the Soviet Union. As has already been said, the difficulty is that nobody really knows where further gas is to be found nor indeed whether the Phillips estimates make sense or not.<lb/>
The first question that arises is, what about the gas in the Norwegian sector south of the 62nd parallel? There are not less than 500 billion cubic metres there and north of the 62nd parallel there may be anything up to 3,000 billion cubic metres, although the safe guess is about half that. It will he difficult to get&#x2014;costly in deep water and stormy seas and, moreover, there is oil beneath the gas which the Norwegians will naturally want to take out first. There are two big Norwegian fields in production now, Frigg and Ekofisk, and shortly there will be gas from Statfjord and Sleipner for which it is worth bearing in mind that BGC are now in sharp competition with European consumers to obtain an adequate share. The bargaining is, of course, about price.<lb/>
How does one discover more gas? The answer revolves around gas price on the one hand and fiscal disincentives on the other. We know that as a monopoly BGC did pretty good business for itself and paid chickenfeed for the gas supplies available from the British side of the continental shelf. Then they had to go to Norway and pay a great deal more, as the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, has reminded us. Until the Government agree in principle to the export of gas found on the British side of the shelf there will be no free market such as was adumbrated in the recent legislation. Until that happens the price of gas cannot rise to its natural level and therefore provide the price incentive for exploration and development that is needed.<lb/>
Although the Government are now inviting applications for new exploration licences&#x2014;and in the Southern gas basin in particular&#x2014;this is no guarantee that gas will be found. Nor is it any guarantee that if gas is found, those who find it will feel it is worth while developing it. As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, pointed out, there is a big difference between the cost of exploration with a wildcat well and the actual development of a field. One is going to cost up to &#x00A3;50 million or so, but a field may cost more than &#x00A3;1,000 million. No wonder companies are hesitant about going for the development of a field even when they know pretty well what is there.<lb/>
The Government are busy putting out&#x2014;I call it propaganda&#x2014;information from the press department of the Department of Energy that things are going very well, that no fewer than three big field developments are under way now or in early prospect. Well, at least two of them&#x2014;and I speak with knowledge of one&#x2014;could have been under way 18 months ago but for the extraordinary and almighty confusion which
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0139"/>
<col>261</col>
subsisted in the Department of Energy focussing on the gas gathering pipeline. If ever a department has missed the bus I am afraid that is true of the Department of Energy. It reminds me of Rossini's words:
<quote>"Look in my face. My name is 'might have been'; I am also called 'no more', 'too late', 'farewell'."</quote>
Of course, but for the violent fiscal disincentives to which the Government continue to be deaf and blind (despite arguments for months all over the country from economists, from businessmen, from oilmen, from gasmen, from investors)&#x2014;I say, but for those disincentives, to which the Government are blind and deaf, there are certainly smaller fields which could now be on the way to development.<lb/>
We read in today's paper that the United Kingdom Offshore Operators' Association are still deadlocked in their talks with the Treasury: those talks have been going on half the year. One can imagine the sort of wisecracks that these weary people must toss at one another: if we are to continue advance PRT, "give me today and take tomorrow". One pictures the exhausted negotiating team emerging from their long talks with the Treasury and the Inland Revenue wringing their hands and saying, "no use planting boiled potatoes; no use pumping a dry well".<lb/>
As to getting the gas ashore, the scheme for what has been called a gas land-bridge pipeline has already been well spoken of in this debate, and it is a particularly important recommendation in the Committee's report. But one or two points about it have not yet been made. Such a pipe ought to cheapen the transport of Norwegian gas from the northern areas of Norway down to continental Europe. Secondly, it ought to enable the British Gas Corporation, as a result, to offer a more competitive price to the Norwegians when the time comes. Finally, it should eventually facilitate the inward movement of Algerian gas from across the Continent.<lb/>
But there has been no sign, overtly at any rate, that the Government are much interested in this idea&#x2014;rather the contrary. The word that one gets in talking to people in Whitehall is that if this or that private enterprise company cared to launch the idea and put up the money, HMG would not stand in their way&#x2014;not much at any rate&#x2014;and might even allow a tax concession here and there to help it on. This was the trouble about the ill-fated gas-gathering pipeline scheme. Private enterprise was expected to fund this public utility, earning a return at public utility rates without a Government guarantee. Without a Government guarantee there never can be a public utility of this sort funded by private enterprise, so far as I can see. In all these matters I am reminded of a useful phrase which appeared in yesterday's London <i>Times:</i>
<quote>"In the administration of inertia, Britain has led the world".</quote>
These energy debates always produce interesting questions, and I believe there would be more energy debates and certainly more energy questions at Question time if we had the good fortune to have the noble Lord who is going to reply as in fact a Minister of the department concerned. This is no criticism of him at all. We know him, we like him, he is assiduous in his studies, he never misses an opportunity of trying to learn more about energy, he has a bright and sharp
<col>262</col>
intellect and a ready wit as well. But he is not a Minister of the department, and because of that I am afraid we have to expect&#x2014;I say it in the nicest possible way; I hope he will treat me as a friend afterwards&#x2014;little more than a dose of passionate apathy. We could wish that the apathy, when it does come, would be a hit more authoritative.<lb/>
There are more than 80 Ministers in the Government but not more than a dozen in this House. This is an opportunity to say, once again in the nicest possible way as I always do, that if the Prime Minister does not take the House of Lords more seriously and substantiate the familiar lipservice which is paid to a bicameral legislature, then the Government are likely to face more defeats in this House than they have had already. This is said in the most gentle and friendly way to my colleagues on the Front Bench, and I do not want to labour the point unduly and spoil the moderate temperature of this debate. But of course a dose of indignation does do one good.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01307"><member>Lord Hinton of Bankside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must immediately apologise for the fact that I was not able to be in the House when the debate was opened. I shall certainly read the speeches that were given then, and particularly I shall read with interest the maiden speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington.<lb/>
When I try to study the problems of supply and demand in the gas and oil energies I always feel like a rookie who, somehow or other, has managed to get himself into a poker school where all the other players are professionals. The energy correspondent of the <i>Financial Times</i>, when he was writing last August about the Siberian pipeline gas supply project, said:
<quote>"Bluff hard and play your cards close to your chest. These are the tactics currently being employed."</quote>
It seems to me to be obvious&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy as well as the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, have underlined the fact that it is obvious&#x2014;that sooner or later western Europe will need to import gas. It seems to me that that is likely to be sooner rather than later.<lb/>
But there seems to be a wide difference of opinion about when additional supplies from outside Western Europe are going to be needed. In July of this year <i>The Times</i> correspondent said that Europe badly needs the 40,000 million cubic metres of gas that the Soviet pipeline can supply, but only three months before that Peter Odell had said:
<quote>"I do not think 1982 will be out before Westen Europe as a whole does not need Russian gas".</quote>
As <i>World Gas</i> pointed out, Peter Odell was "never one to avoid controversy", and in the past he has made forecasts which were so widely different from those made by other experts that they were thought of as being derisory. I was among those who did think of them in that way. But a few months ago I was examining some of my old files and I came across letters and papers which Professor Odell had written in 1967, and I found that time has shown that the forecasts which he made in those papers were nearer the mark than the forecasts that were fashionable at that time.<lb/>
Professor Odell's present prediction is for the end of this year, and I very much doubt whether he intends it to be taken as a long term forecast. Even in the short
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0140"/>
<col>263</col>
term he may be thinking only about supplies from Russia through the proposed new pipelines and not of the very considerable quantities of gas that reach Western Europe through existing pipelines. As the Committee's report points out, there is little unanimity even among the major oil companies about the size of the United Kingdom reserves of gas. Most of those companies gave figures of between 1.1 trillion and 1.7 trillion cubic metres, but the Phillips Petroleum Company, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, pointed out, gave a very much larger estimate of about 3.4 trillion cubic metres. Your Lordships' sub-committee was not able to obtain a logical explanation of this major difference and we were left having to accept it simply as a "gut reaction" to the evidence that was available.<lb/>
An article which was published in the Westminster Bank quarterly review in August of this year gives the probable reserves in the Community of Ten as 4.2 trillion metre cubes, with a life of 25 years. Their figure of 4.2 trillion cubic metres compares with the Brussels figure of 3.2 trillion for the EEC. The consumption of gas is given by the EEC as 0.167 trillion cubic metres per year, but, of that, 25 per cent. is imported. Those imports are mainly of piped gas which came in from the USSR, the Middle East and North Africa&#x2014;countries which between them contain some 70 per cent. of the world's natural gas reserves.<lb/>
I think that those figures give a picture of the Community's present dependence on imported gas which is surprising to those of us who are not professionally engaged in the gas industry. When one realises that already a quarter of the gas that is used in the Community reaches us through pipelines which cross international frontiers, a man who is as politically naive as I am is inclined to wonder why the proposals for additional pipelines from Siberia which extend into France have caused as much friction as they have done.<lb/>
The production of indigenous gas within the EEC is likely to rise only slightly, if at all, above its present level and increased demand can only be met by imports of gas or by gasification of coal. Gasification of coal is not at present attractive. It is expensive and I have been unable to find any process which claims an efficiency of more than 70 per cent. for the coal conversion processes. Moreover, indigenous reserves of coal are limited within the EEC and they are, in effect, restricted to Germany and Britain, where supplies may meet further restriction by labour and by environmental limitations.<lb/>
It is likely that any coal for conversion would in the long run have to be imported into the Community, so that even when economical processes for the manufacture of SNG&#x2014;perhaps I should say "substitute natural gas," in the light of what the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, said&#x2014;have been developed.<lb/>
The raw materials of supply would have to cross frontiers, or more probably cross oceans, and they would not be immune from interruption. The alternative of importing natural gas by pipeline with cryogenic transport is difficult. Your Committee was told that this was cheaper than the conveyance by pipeline for distances of more than 3,000 to 4,000 miles, but it is quite certainly not proof against
<col>264</col>
interruption. Moreover, it may be difficult to find sites for terminal facilities. My own reluctance to live on the doorstep of a liquid methane terminal may arise from ignorance, just as the widespread reluctance to have nuclear power plants as neighbours arises from lack of familiarity with them, but in both cases the restrictions must be recognised.<lb/>
It seems to me that for many years to come the Community must rely, as it does now but to a far increasing extent on imports by pipeline and that whatever its origin the gas or the raw materials from which it is made are hound to cross the frontiers of some countries with which our relationships are not always cordial. If I take a relaxed view about possible hazards arising from this it may be because, having been in the electricity supply industry. I know how often supplies of electricity have continued to flow between countries which, to say the least of it, have had no friendly relationships with one another.<lb/>
It is true that gas pipelines may be more vulnerable than electricity supply lines, but if gas has to be imported into the Community by pipeline&#x2014;and commercial considerations seem to demand that there should be such imports&#x2014;I suggest that this is a reason why there should be many pipelines from many sources bringing gas in. As the article in the National Westminster Bank review points out, price as well as reliability of supply emphasise the dangers of overdependence on a limited number of sources of supply. As availability and demand for natural gas have grown, many countries have built and are extending distribution grids in which flow can be in either direction so as to give greater security of supply. Although these national gas grids have been built, little if any thought seems to have been given to the desirability of an international gas transmission grid.<lb/>
Now that additional pipelines are being built across frontiers, one wonders if they could be routed so that they could ultimately form a real international gas network instead of following discrete paths. It would, for instance, be possible to bring one of the Siberian pipelines through Finland to a point in Sweden, perhaps south of Stockholm, where it could join up with pipelines from Norway and run from there to cross through Denmark to Germany, having linked up with a line from the west coast of Norway and our own North Sea continental shelf gas. That line might run southwards through Britain to cross the Channel into France, and the ring could be completed by a pipeline from the Gulf States which could pass through Turkey and link up with lines running southward from Siberia through the Moscow area; interlinking rings could pick up gas from the North African countries.<lb/>
I obviously am not trying, nor if I tried should I be able, to design such a system; I am doing no more than to suggest it as a possibility. If that possibility has a basis of realism I am not so unrealistic as to imagine that the construction work on a complete system could be started now; I merely suggest that the skeleton of such a scheme could he prepared and that, as the need grew, each succeeding pipeline could be so designed and routed as to conform with the ultimate plan. This plan would obviously have to be prepared in collaboration between the countries concerned but, in so far as the Common Market countries are concerned, the responsibility might be placed with the EEC which
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0141"/>
<col>265</col>
could organise collaboration across frontiers in a way that could hardly be arranged by any one of its individual members.<lb/>
It can, of course, be argued that the fundamental weakness of the idea is that gas supplies might be exhausted before the network is complete. We do not know what reserves and resources of gas are available, but the USSR is at present negotiating its contracts to run for 25 years. If they do not have very large resources it is hard to understand why they are using gas to supply 40 per cent. of their boiler fuel (a most wasteful use of a premium fuel); why (according to the <i>Financial Times</i>) gas supplies 90 per cent. of the fuel that the Russians use in their iron and steel industry; and why 60 per cent. of the fuel used in their cement manufacture is gas. If they are wise in using gas in this way, it suggests that they must have immense reserves. In the longer term, we should remember that the gas network could be used for distributing gas brought in cryogenically from further afield and for distributing gas which is made from coal, as will ultimately be necessary. I suggest that at least the possibility of such a grid system is one that should not be discarded without thought.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01309"><member>The Duke of Portland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, on his admirable maiden speech to which I listened, I must admit, with a measure of envy remembering my own effort some 18 months ago. I can do little but echo all that my noble friend Lord Lauderdale has said with humorous emphasis and deep knowledge of the subject.<lb/>
As is shown in the committee's report, exploration has been inhibited by the low prices offered by the British Gas Corporation for gas from the United Kingdom sector. Consequently, we do not really know what the resources of that sector may be. Competition from members of the European Economic Community has forced the British Gas Corporation to offer higher prices for Norwegian gas than they are prepared to offer for gas from the United Kingdom sector. Nevertheless, the British Gas Corporation have been recently outbid in their efforts to purchase gas from the Norwegian sector and most of this gas will now go to Emden.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Lauderdale has said, negotiations are taking place for gas from the Norwegian Sleipner field, which contains, I understand, as much gas as the Frigg Field, perhaps more. It is well known that the British Gas Corporation are making a very determined effort to obtain this gas. If they fail, they are likely to be short of gas by the end of the present decade, or at any rate in the early 'nineties.<lb/>
It is said that Her Majesty's Government are trying to remedy this situation in the eighth licensing round by licensing areas of the southern North Sea, but this would only succeed if the British Gas Corporation are prepared to offer good prices. The measures taken by Her Majesty's Government to permit direct sales of gas to United Kingdom companies are unlikely to have much effect and could well be frustrated by tariffs inposed by the British Gas Corporation for the transport of this gas. In those circumstances the most
<col>266</col>
effective step which can be taken is to allow sales of gas from the United Kingdom sector to be made freely throughout the European Economic Community. That would stimulate both exploration and development; it would not diminish Government revenues since tax is based on sales price, and overseas earnings would be increased. Moreover, it would help to dispel the illusion that we are not good Europeans. I am well aware that the United Kingdom reserves are limited&#x2014;we do not know to what extent&#x2014;and it could he argued that these should be preseved for United Kingdom use. But in the present circumstances and in our present plight, it is surely to the immediate benefit of industry in the United Kingdom that the gas deposits should be developed now rather than hoarded for the distant future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01311"><member>The Earl of Bessborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted to follow my noble friend the Duke of Portland because he always gives us very briefly a very wise message. I am, of course, also delighted to support the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, in his Motion drawing attention to this report, and to have the opportunity of congratulating my noble friend Lord Torrington on his admirable maiden speech. It looks as though he has left the Chamber for the moment, but I must none the less pay my tribute to his work on Sub-Committee F. Why he has not taken part in our energy debates in this House previously, I fail to understand for he is perhaps as qualified as man), of us, if not more so, to speak on this subject. I hope that he will indeed address us again frequently, especially on energy questions.<lb/>
We have indeed had some interesting meetings in Sub-Committee F, discussing this subject with the various witnesses listed in paragraph 4 of the report. I need hardly add that I warmly endorse the conclusions, markedly brief and to the point&#x2014;exceptionally brief and to the point&#x2014;that are given in paragraph 32. Most of the points that I should like to make have already been made, but I think that I should repeat as others have done that there should be increased exploration drilling, and certainly in my view the Government should give more weight to the contribution made by drilling on existing licences to improve our knowledge of gas reserves.<lb/>
I agree, too, that the Government should consider whether and when exports of natural gas to continental member states of the Community would be justified. In that connection&#x2014;and, incidentally, having visited that part of the Frigg Field which falls within the Norwegian sector&#x2014;I think it most important that Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom should encourage construction of the so-called "gas land-bridge"; that is to say, the Norway-United Kingdom cross-channel pipeline.<lb/>
In advocating this I would not consider this pipeline as taking the place of the proposed Soviet pipeline. There must, as the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, said, and as many other noble Lords have said&#x2014;and I listened particularly carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Hinton, has just said about a Eurogrid network&#x2014;be a diversity of supply to the European Community. I feel certain that the Norway-United Kingdom cross-channel line would be of' great value,
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0142"/>
<col>267</col>
especially to continental member states of the Community, and especially in the event of any interruption of supplies from Siberia.<lb/>
I would like to add here (although it was not, I think, a matter specifically raised during the deliberations in Sub-Committee F) that I strongly support the Government's attitude, as I am sure do other noble Lords&#x2014;and indeed the attitude of other member states in the Community&#x2014;in authorising the export of turbines and other equipment needed by the Soviet Union to complete the Siberian pipeline as soon as possible. I feel sure that if we do not supply the turbines the USSR will be capable of manufacturing them themselves. Moreover, I completely fail to understand the United States' Government's attitude in this matter considering the quantity of grain that they are supplying to the USSR.<lb/>
I trust that the hopeful signs which were mentioned by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in another place yesterday, that agreement could he reached which may result in a lifting of the American pipeline sanctions, will be translated into fact, and that all members of your Lordships' House will urge the United States Government to reverse their policy in this respect. I wonder whether my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale may be able to add this evening to what my right honourable friend said yesterday on this matter.<lb/>
On a semi-personal note (and I hope that late in the debate your Lordships will permit me this personal note) I well recall how my great-grandmother, a distinguished Welsh lady&#x2014;her name was Lady Charlotte Guest of Guest Keen&#x2014;when she was managing the ironworks at Dowlais, in the latter part of the 19th century, supplied all the rails for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway. She negotiated personally with the Czar. There were some who criticised this because there were many who criticised some of the policies of the Czarist regime.<lb/>
Nor do we now approve the present policies of the Soviet Union in their own country, Poland, or in their invasion or penetration of Afghanistan, Africa and, indeed, in other parts of the world. However, most sensible people in this country in the 19th century thoroughly approved of our helping to build the Trans-Siberian railway and considered it a great tribute to British industry, and especially to those working at Dowlais, which the noble Lord, Lord Davies, knows so well, who played such an important part in its building.<lb/>
I think, too, now that we should take this opportunity of congratulating John Brown on having contracted&#x2014;and I emphasise the word "contracted"&#x2014;to supply turbines for the Siberian pipeline. I would indeed congratulate the other firms in France, Germany and Italy for being capable of making their own contribution to the laying of this pipeline. This is indeed a notable achievement in West European technological and industrial co-operation.<lb/>
In respect of our other conclusions, I hope that noble Lords will read the report in its entirety and also glance through the transcripts of the evidence from our witnesses, and perhaps especially that given by Mr. Robert Belgrave, on pages 91 to 97. There are a great many points that I would like to underline in regard to the evidence given by our witnesses, but in this
<col>268</col>
relatively brief speech I would particularly draw attention to Mr. Belgrave's remarks regarding relations between the British Gas Corporation and the Norwegians. While supporting what the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, said of the British Gas Corporation's remarkable achievements, like him I regret that British-Norwegian relations have not been altogether happy and that Norwegians involved in the negotiations are said to have been distinctly cool towards our own gas corporation. It is in my view unfortunate that a senior executive of a Norwegian company could have been led to say that we, the British, missed a chance last year, but that there might be a second chance as a result of the new discovery. We must not miss that second chance, and it looks as though we shall not do so. I think that we were glad to learn from Mr. Belgrave that he did not think that there was any underlying hostility in Norway towards us, and I felt that he was right in saying that the Norwegians were merely fed up with our method of negotiation. I certainly hope that that will change.<lb/>
I think that one of the conclusions of our committee is that the European Commission&#x2014;and, as your Lordships know we are particularly concerned with their proposals&#x2014;and our own Government will regularly review the need for and the timing of liquid natural gas imports and also synthetic natural gas manufacture, and that regular reviews on the subject will be published. Incidentally, I was very glad&#x2014;as obviously my noble friend Lord Lauderdale must have been&#x2014;to read over the weekend that Total and Elf Aquitaine, the French oil companies, have submitted development plans for the &#x00A3;12 million North Alwyn oil and gas field and that the Department of Energy hopes to give the go-ahead for these plans well before Christmas. Again, I hope that my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale will confirm that this is indeed the Government's intention. My Lords, I warmly endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, and other noble Lords have said, and also the conclusions of the report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01313"><member>Lord Briginshaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sincerely wish to associate myself with the congratulations extended to the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, on his able maiden speech and, with so many other noble Lords, I look forward to hearing him address this House again. In my view, the report before us fully warrants the serious attention that previous speakers have given it. It justifies the time and expertise that the committee has given to it throughout and, together with the noble Earl, Lord Bessborough, I commend detailed attention to the whole of the report.<lb/>
At this time, after a comprehensive discussion of the character that has taken place, I propose to rationalise my contribution. As I have indicated, I associate myself with the appreciations to the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, for initiating the discussion on the report before the House. I think he had the advantage of a concise presentation, which appeals to me in particular. He was not at any stage talking for the sake of talking. It was a presentation that was apposite to the report itself.<lb/>
I would accept the general direction set out in the report on the export of gas resources, in particular by the submissions of the Department of Energy. I do not
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0143"/>
<col>269</col>
accept that a flexible tax r&#x00E9;gime should not be equated with definite obligations. I appeal, and I think join others who in varying phraseology have appealed for flexibility. The obligation on the operators is the key question, and is one of control, and that clearly remains with the state, which in my view expresses the national interest at this time.<lb/>
The obligations are set out and restated in paragraph 14 and in Parts II and III on gas exports, and I understand those finally to contest the Phillips contention, which has been mentioned in this discussion. I suggest that that is a proper contest because I do not see the basis for it, even with all the expertise that has been presented to us.<lb/>
I see no advantage in weakening our security referred to in paragraph 16 in Part IV. Surely the alternatives set out in paragraphs 16 and 17 move in the right direction. Paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 of Part V are long-term alternatives which have been the centre of the last part of the discussion here on alternative supplies for the United Kingdom. These are set out in precise form in a few words, which again appeals to me. Paragraph 20 sums up much of our discussion and presentation.<lb/>
Imports by pipeline would need least in the way of new facilities and would pose fewest environmental hazards. Witnesses generally&#x2014;and this gives us a wide sweep when one studies the report&#x2014;agreed that the pipeline import should be the first option.
<quote>"Norwegian gas is an obvious source. A cross-Channel link, if suitably designed, would permit access to supplies entering the European grid, including gas from the Soviet Union and Algeria".</quote>
It says so much in such a little space, but it is consistent with the whole of the discussion.<lb/>
In saying that at this time of the discussion, and with a thin House, I think it is sensible to rationalise the presentation, and I find the summing up in the report itself another shortened version of a logical and sensible presentation to the House at this time. May I, without wearying your Lordships, go through it, because I am sure that I should save so much time in rationalisation if I could take advantage of an easy presentation, which is yet so important. In (<i>b</i>), the report says:
<quote>"In the award of new licences the United Kingdom Government should give more weight to the contributions made by drilling on existing licences to improve knowledge of gas reserves".</quote>
We have all been asking for more knowledge.
<quote>"Disincentives to 'farmouts' activity should be eliminated.</quote>
<quote>"The United Kingdom Government should consider whether and when exports of natural gas to the Community would be justified".</quote>
I am sure that that is correct.
<quote>"The United Kingdom should encourage the construction of a Norway/UK cross-Channel pipeline.</quote>
<quote>"The European Commission and the United Kingdom Government should regularly review the need for and the timing of LNG imports and SNG manufacture and should publish the results of such reviews.</quote>
<quote>"Diversity of supply to the European Community should be encouraged.</quote>
<quote>"Market forces are the best defence against unreasonable price demands".</quote>
Finally in their summing up, they say:
<quote>"No convincing economic case can be made for strategic storage of natural gas in the United Kingdom".</quote>
I would disagree with that. Of the nine points in the summing up, I would give six, and in order to save the
<col>270</col>
time of your Lordships now I should like to leave it there and say that on the three I have not marked favourably I should be open to conviction by the many noble Lords who have the expertise. Thank you very much.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01314">6.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01315"><member>Lord Polwarth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the course of this debate, there has been a wide measure of agreement with the report of the committee, which is hardly surprising seeing that out of the 12 previous speakers no fewer than 10 were members of the committee. Perhaps that is my only possible excuse for detaining your Lordships at this time by coming in myself as an outsider, perhaps with the excuse and the interest, which I declare, of being involved in various activities such as pipe laying, platform building, and the supply of equipment and services to the oil and energy industries.<lb/>
We are enormously grateful to the committee, first of all, for tackling this vitally important subject, for looking at it so thoroughly and so expertly, and for commending it to us for debate. They have done us a great service. They are a perfect example of what we in this House can do in a field where we can apply our specialised knowledge. What better example of that than the splendid maiden speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, with all his personal experience in the oil industry. I hope that he will come to us regularly. I know the difficulties. It underlines Lord Lauderdale's point, that when people like him and others who are very busy in such activities take the time and trouble to come down here and contribute to our deliberations, perhaps they are entitled to the occasional ministerial reply. Again, I emphasise that this is absolutely no reflection on the noble Lord who is to reply. I have the greatest sympathy with him and admiration for the way in which he handles a plethora of different subjects for us.<lb/>
I am so glad that we are looking at the Community aspects of this subject, because in this whole energy field we have tended to be rather inward looking and chauvinistic in the light of our good fortune in having these resources. Why do we not know what are the reserves of gas in the North Sea? Many noble Lords have already made clear the reason; namely, that there has not been the inducement, the encouragement, to producers, in the form of a reasonable market, to make it worth their while to do the vital development drilling needed. I need not reiterate that or the reasons.<lb/>
On the gas front, we had for a long time the British Gas Corporation monopoly, and a good job indeed they have done. As the noble Lord, Lord Kearton, said, they have created a great asset; but of course ultimately it was not they who created it. It was the consumers of the gas who created that asset, through the good offices of the Gas Corporation.<lb/>
The other aspect that is perhaps not emphasised so much in the report is the tax r&#x00E9;gime as it applies both to oil and to gas. I found it intensely disappointing to read another article yesterday in the <i>Financial Times</i> indicating that the talks between the industry and the Government on the tax r&#x00E9;gime seem to be just as much at a stalemate as ever, the Government insisting they are not convinced that an easier tax regime is necessary to encourage further development. I can only assume that this is not through ignorance but
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0144"/>
<col>271</col>
through stubbornness. The evidence is there; as we heard, it was only in the last few months that three new field developments have been announced, the first since 1980, and some of those after a good deal of arm-twisting.<lb/>
Perhaps the prospect is a little better now. There is the prospect of some competition in the purchase of gas, but it will not be a really free market until, as other noble Lords have said, we are able to export. There can be much argument about how long we should hold on to those resources for our own use or how soon we should be prepared to export. I believe we should show a little more courage and faith in the undoubted reserves there are or must be. It is, after all, a little ironical, is it not, that the French, who played such a leading part in developing our gas resources (with a little help from my noble friend Lord Lauderdale) should be unable to enjoy directly the fruits of all that work in the North Sea?<lb/>
There is the very exciting prospect raised by the committee of the eventual trunk gas line through Norway via this country to the Continent and, as we know, the Continent is already linked to the Continent of Africa. The security aspect has been emphasised. While I do not for one moment agree with the American view of the problem&#x2014;indeed, I think it was misguided and improper of President Reagan to be trying to cause our companies to break contracts freely entered into; as the noble Earl, Lord Bessborough, said, one particular company, John Brown, were suffering considerable hurt, financially and otherwise, from the policy adopted towards them&#x2014;nevertheless, it will be all to the good if the Continent of Europe can be less dependent on the existing supply.<lb/>
That will not merely be us doing them a favour. One can envisage a scenario well ahead when North Sea reserves might begin to run down&#x2014;and who knows by then what other discoveries may have been made in the African Continent?&#x2014;and we might be very glad indeed to have pipeline to bring gas to us from south of the Mediterranean. I appreciate the problems of pipeline schemes. We saw them with the proposed gas gathering scheme, on which, incidentally, the Bank of Scotland, with which I am connected, did a great deal of work to produce a viable financial arrangement, but it foundered because there were factors of monopoly and a failure of the Government to be prepared to give it real backing.<lb/>
I believe&#x2014;this is the view of nearly every noble Lord who has spoken&#x2014;we should give every possible encouragement to exploration for gas and oil because I cannot conceive that we shall not need all we can find. The market will dictate what should be done, if we allow it to, and we must always remember that there is a need not merely for fuel but for feedstock for our petrochemical industries which will continue to be important and grow in importance. I think it is never the right policy to leave one's talents in the ground. After all, we have the highest authority for that, and we know what happened to the one who did!<lb/>
There is a further reason for encouraging development in gas and oil more than we are at present, and that is because of the substantial industry we have built up in support of oil and gas. It has been the deliberate policy of successive Governments, through the Offshore Supplies Office, to create a
<col>272</col>
British industry for supplying and contracting to oil and gas, and they have had great success in doing so. It has been a real success story. The proportion of components of British content in the industry is now. I believe, up to about 70 per cent., and this has created a great deal of employment. It would be the greatest shame if that were allowed to languish, and I can tell your Lordships at first hand that a number of companies in the construction industry on this front are in a very uneasy position at present through the lack of orders coming forward as a result of the lack of new development. There could well have been substantial lay-offs and there could well be considerable, more, most of them in areas where there is very little alternative employment. That is another good reason to back a highly successful British industry that is not only supplying in this country but for export as well.<lb/>
At the end of the day, I fear that one of the main troubles has been the dominance of the Treasury over the Department of Energy. We had high hopes of the translation of the present Secretary of State from his previous Treasury post, and I believe we have seen some progress since that move. I hope we shall see more. We read yesterday of the translation of a senior official who played a great part in developing the oil and gas industries, being moved to another sphere outside, and rumours as to the succession to the senior post in that department, rumoured to be a Treasury man. One could take that in one of two ways. Will it bring Treasury views into the Department of Energy, or, more hopefully, will we have a gamekeeper turning poacher who will teach the Department of Energy how to tackle the Treasury on equal terms? Let us hope it will be the latter in the interests of the development of these very precious resources which we are lucky to have, not just for ourselves but for the benefit of the Community of which we are part.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01316">6.27 p.m.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01317"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether my correct course of action is to blush or hide. Whichever it is I should be doing, before beginning my daunting task of replying on behalf of the Government to the debate, I must apologise for rising to my feet for the third time today. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek&#x2014;if I might have a quick aside to him before I start&#x2014;made a comment which comes often from his lips on the subject of acronyms. When I was studying for my second Question, one of the prepared supplementaries I was given to read and consider was headed, "Non-First Use of Nuclear Force" with the acronym in brackets, "NOFUN". I am sure that is not in the little book.<lb/>
The House should be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, and his sub-committee for initiating today s debate, which I may perhaps summarise as covering the role which gas will play in the national, Community and international context. I was somewhat alarmed when I saw the list of speakers and related it to my experience of their erudition, but I need not have worried. It is a credit to the noble Lord to have collected such a list, not forgetting the expertise of my noble friend Lord Torrington, whose excellent maiden speech will repay much study. I hope your Lordships will have the opportunity to hear him again both soon and often.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0145"/>
<col>273</col>
The future of the natural gas industry is of great importance to both the United Kingdom and the European Community. It is important to us as a country, as we are both a major gas producer and consumer; and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, that we as a nation sometimes play down the immense success of the development of our reseves in the North Sea and onshore, and I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, referred to that. His idea of incentives to smaller independent owners of land to dig for gas is a most sensitive area. Safety, environmental and planning considerations are of great importance, and it is of course essential that the best oil industry expertise is utilised in such drilling and production operations. The Government are confident that their current onshore licensing procedures are effective in ensuring that such expertise is appropriately employed. I would add that it is not as yet&#x2014;although the situation could change, and I take the noble Lord's point&#x2014;generally considered that onshore finds are likely to make a significant contribution to the totality of United Kingdom gas reserves compared with prospects for additional offshore gas discoveries.<lb/>
We can, and should, be justly proud of our achievements over the past 20 years in this industry. The rapid discovery and development of the North Sea gas fields and the efforts of the British Gas Corporation in building with impressive speed the national gas transmissions system, have been major factors contributing to the situation where the gas share of domestic energy demand has doubled in the last 10 years, and where natural gas now accounts for about 56 per cent. of the total energy consumed in the United Kingdom domestic sector. My admiration of the British Gas Corporation's role in all this is obviously equalled by that of the noble Lord, Lord Kearton.<lb/>
This subject is important to the Ten as natural gas consumption in the Community virtually trebled in the 1970s, triggered initially by the development of the huge Groningen gas field in the Netherlands and spurred on by the oil crises of 1973 and 1979. The Community understandably hoped that this growth in the use of natural gas would reduce Europe's dependence on the fickle and politically volatile international oil trade. However, it is now apparent that Europe has in part decreased its dependence on imported oil at the expense of increased dependence on imported gas supplies. Imports accounted for only 5 per cent. of Community gas supplies in 1975, grew to 27 per cent. in 1980&#x2014;which is a fraction more than the figure quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, but I hope that we shall not argue on this comparatively small point&#x2014;and are now projected to reach some 40 to 50 per cent. of Community gas demand in 1990. Although, to be fair, gas imports will represent less than 10 per cent. of total Community energy consumption in 1990, it is, even so, an issue of major importance.<lb/>
It is therefore an appropriate time to review the role of gas in the European Community as a whole, and I should like to round off this debate by running through the main conclusions of the Select Committee's report, touching on some of the many important points that have been made this evening. The committee has highlighted that, in order to make the right policy
<col>274</col>
decisions, it is essential to find out more about the extent and nature of the United Kingdom's indigenous natural gas reserves. To that end it proposes three measures. The first is that the Government should encourage gas exploration drilling. On 24th September, the Government published the formal invitation to apply in the Eighth Round of offshore petroleum production licensing. The aim is to license up to 85 blocks in the round. Thirty-eight of the blocks on offer for licensing lie in the southern North Sea, where most of our existing gas reserves were discovered. We are confident that this licence round, together with the freeing of the gas supply market in the recent Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act&#x2014;I do not share the rather shallow doubts of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy on this&#x2014;will stimulate renewed North Sea gas exploration efforts.<lb/>
I shall return to this point later, but before I leave it I should like to tell my noble friend Lord Bessborough that press reports about North Alwyn are accurate, and I expect formal approval to be announced by my right honourable friend the Minister of State in the very near future&#x2014;certainly well before Christmas.<lb/>
Most noble Lords I think have mentioned the thorny subject of reserves. The Department of Energy estimates that the remaining gas reserves lie in the range of from 33 to 64 trillion standard cubic feet. That includes allowances for as yet undiscovered fields. My noble friend Lord Hinton of Bankside highlighted the problem of the difference between my department's estimates and those of, for example, Phillips, one of the oil companies. In an aside I should like to say how nice it is to see my noble friend with us again and to hear yet again his visionary ideas, which in the past have come to fruition in other fields with which he has been interested, and with any luck will do so again.<lb/>
The Phillips Petroleum reserves estimate is about twice that of my department's upper figure for total United Kingdom remaining gas reserves. The official figures were supported by the other industry witnesses to the committee. The United Kingdom proven reserves are equivalent to 14 years of consumption at 1981 levels. Using the official estimates of total remaining reserves&#x2014;that is to say proven, probable, and possible&#x2014;increases the figure to between 20 and 40 years.<lb/>
If I got his expressions right, the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, equated supply stability with production stability, and I must say that I completely agree with him. The noble Lord, Lord Kearton, said that British gas purchases must be at the right price to ensure supply stability. I agree with that analysis, too. I was less clear on the points made by my noble friend Lord Torrington on capital transfer tax in regard to farming out, and perhaps if he has any evidence on the point, he might write to me.<lb/>
Secondly, the committee urges the Government in awarding licences to give more weight to the applicants' record in drilling and evaluating existing licences in the area in question. I should like to make it clear to your Lordships that the past drilling performance of each company is examined when applictions for new licences are considered. I am pleased to inform the House that the Government indeed intend to increase the weight given to the relevant past drilling record in the evaluation of
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0146"/>
<col>275</col>
applications for the current Eighth Round of production licensing, though I am bound to say that I do not feel that the prospective records of the oil companies in this respect have very much hearing in our thoughts. The extent to which it is practicable to allow that factor to influence awards is however limited, since the composition of licence applicant groups changes from round to round and often varies from one area of the United Kingdom continental shelf to another.<lb/>
However, in respect of the Eighth Round blocks on offer in the southern North Sea, where most existing gas fields were discovered, there is a likelihood that applicant group composition will in many cases be the same as the groups already holding licences in the area. There should therefore be more opportunities for making a direct link between the award of new licences and the past performance of the applicants.<lb/>
Thirdly, the committee proposes that disincentives to the "farm-out" of licences should be eliminated. The Government believe that in practice our "farm-out" procedures are no disincentive to additional exploration and appraisal drilling. Admittedly, it is necessary to obtain Government approval for such transfer of licence rights and obligations, but we generally take a favourable view of "farm-in" proposals that contain plans for additional or earlier drilling in the relevant blocks&#x2014;and that, I would submit, is what we are all seeking.<lb/>
On exports of United Kingdom gas reserves, the Select Committee endorses the present Government caution, but suggests that the Government should consider whether, and when, exports of United Kingdom natural gas would be justified. The noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, asked whether I would come down firmly on that point, and it seemed to me that my noble friend the Duke of Portland was asking for the same thing. The position of the Government on the point is well known. We have said that we will consider exports if substantial new gas reserves are found and the United Kingdom gas supply position is thereby consolidated. I would tell my noble friend that I disagree with him, at least where he seems to be advocating exports whatever happens to supply. I would not condone that.<lb/>
As I said earlier, we are confident that North Sea gas exploration efforts will be pursued with renewed vigour, and will help to prove up new reserves. In fact, we have evidence that the encouragement which the Act is intended to give to the oil industry, together with the British Gas Corporation's expressed willingness to pay realistic prices for new United Kingdom sector gas supplies, is already beginning to work.<lb/>
My evidence is that in the three years before 1981, when our proposals for legislation were announced, there was not a single exploration or appraisal well drilled in the southern North Sea. Last year two such wells were drilled. The tally this year is already 11, and indeed I must tell the House that a week ago, when I was first studying this speech, the figure was 10. So things are increasing quite fast, and I suggest that the figures speak for themselves.<lb/>
The House has been obviously intensely interested in North Sea taxation, as evidenced by parts of the speeches of my noble friends Lord Campbell of Croy and Lord Lauderdale. The Government are of course
<col>276</col>
well aware of the continued oil industry representation that the present tax regime is too onerous. I think that my noble friends will not take it too hard if I say that we are not exactly minnows in this particular sea. We are constantly monitoring exploration and development activity and have seen a substantial rise in exploration drilling in the last two years, while indicators of development activity are also showing signs of some improvement. On gas developments, we are confident that more competitive prices will now be paid to North Sea producers as a result of the Act, and that there will be no shortage of projects coming forward.<lb/>
The Government also made clear their position on the tax regime in the recent response of the Secretary of State to the report of the Select Committee for Energy on depletion policy; but we are not ignoring the industry's pleas, and will continue to keep the tax position under review. I thought that both my noble friend Lord Polwarth and, indeed, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy were more than a little unfair on the Government's record on tax, because it will not have escaped their notice that there were in fact considerable, very useful and, I believe, welcome tax changes in the recent Budget. A number of these important structural changes were introduced, as I said, in the 1982 Budget, and they have since been modified by the changes announced by the Chancellor on 9th June. All these changes move in a direction sought by critics of the tax regime, so it really is not fair to say that the Government are totally obdurate in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01318"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to interrupt him. I should just like to say that this is really not the moment to go into all the details of a very complicated tax r&#x00E9;gime, although in fact I was a Front Bench spokesman in April 1975, and about the only speaker besides the Minister, when the original tax regime for the North Sea was introduced. I acknowledge that there were changes in structure, which were the ones asked for by the industry and which the Chancellor himself had foreshadowed; that is, the disappearance of the temporary tax&#x2014;the supplementary petroleum duty. But the main point is that the changes which have been made have very little effect in altering the deterrent to development&#x2014;not exploration, but development.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01319"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall refer the words of my noble friend to my right honourable and learned friend the Chancellor, naturally. The Select Committee recommends that the Government should encourage the construction of a Norway-United Kingdom cross-Channel pipeline, and my noble friend Lord Bessborough and the noble Lord, Lord Briginshaw, among many others, drew attention to this. As the primary purpose of such a scheme would be transhipment of Norwegian gas to European markets, it is clear that Norwegian participation is essential before the idea can be pursued. On a number of recent occasions, we have indicated to the Norwegian Government that Her Majesty's Government would be willing to consider any specific proposals for such a pipeline. So far, it is true, no such proposals have come forward, but we shall he ready to examine them positively if and when they do.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0147"/>
<col>277</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, raised the spectre&#x2014;if I may so call it&#x2014;of paying for this pipeline, and I would agree with him that this is obviously an important point in the whole agrument. It is, however, much too early to speculate on this. If the need for a land-bridge were established to the satisfaction of the Norwegian Government, of the United Kingdom Government and of other Governments concerned, it would still be some time before details of the scheme could be worked out. Only then would it be possible to establish the parties with the main interest in the project, to mobilise the banks and other sources of finance, and give detailed consideration to the financing problems, so perhaps the noble Lord is being a little previous on this.<lb/>
While talking about exports and imports, perhaps it would be as well to discuss the problem of the Siberian pipeline. It is, of course, for the individual Governments concerned to ensure that they have given adequate attention to the security of supply question. However, studies have also been made by the European Commission, which give confidence that these matters are being fully considered. We note, for example, that the West Germans plan to limit their dependence on gas imports from any one source to some 30 per cent. of their total gas supplies, or only some 5 per cent. of total primary energy demand. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency is conducting an IEA-wide study of the gas supplies and requirements of its members, including arrangements to cope with emergencies.<lb/>
Turning briefly to the United States embargo on exports to the Soviet Union of goods for the pipeline project manufactured by European licensees of American equipment, as your Lordships will be aware my noble friend the Secretary of State for Trade has directed six United Kingdom companies not to comply with these measures in order that these companies can fulfil their contractual obligations. My noble friend Lord Bessborough made reference to what my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, and I am afraid I have nothing to add to what he said then.<lb/>
The Committee also urges that the European Commission and the United Kingdom Government should regularly review the need for and the timing of liquefied natural gas imports and substitute natural gas manufacture. The Government are aware that work on this subject is continuing in the European Commission. Within the United Kingdom, the Government are confident that the gas supply industry is monitoring the development of the gas markets, and will initiate projects of this sort when they believe them to be necessary to meet projected demand. That answer may not please the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, but that is what I believe. It is, however, much too early to say when SNG will become a commercial proposition, and I hope the noble Lord will accept that.<lb/>
I would draw attention to the British gas industry's international reputation for both its pioneering work in the liquefied natural gas trade in the 1960s and its current research and development programme on substitute natural gas manufacture. It is therefore well placed to introduce these technologies to the United Kingdom when there is a market for such supplies.<lb/>
<col>278</col>
Finally, regarding the broader question of gas supplies to the European Community as a whole, the Select Committee responded to three specific recommendations made in the earlier studies by the European Commission which were the starting point for the committee's deliberations. First, the Commission recommended and the committee endorsed that the Community should aim to diversify its import sources of supply. The Government agree with this principle and know that those of our European partners who are increasingly reliant on gas imports are actively reviewing possible new gas supplies on a worldwide basis. The United Kingdom itself is fortunate in getting 75 per cent. of its gas, via a number of separate pipeline systems, from its own offshore gas fields. The other 25 per cent. is imported from Norway, which we clearly regard as a politically secure and reliable source of supply.<lb/>
My Lords, with so many speeches I am sure that I shall not have answered many of the points that I should have answered. I shall read <i>Hansard</i> carefully tomorrow, and, if I may, I shall write to those noble Lords whose dose of passionate apathy has been a little too little. I should like to conclude by recording how valuable I feel this evening's debate has been in bringing the attention of your Lordships' House to this important subject. I think its usefulness is due in no small part to the excellent report of the Select Committee, which has been the focal point of these stimulating discussions. I believe I am doing no more than echoing the sentiments of your Lordships in congratulating the committee on its report and noble Lords on their speeches today. I would end by saying that I believe that this report and today's debate have put another dent in the by now increasingly battered image that we in the United Kingdom have as bad Europeans.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01320"><member>Lord Kings Norton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House has a lot of business still to do this evening, and I do not propose to delay it any longer except to thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for his comprehensive comments on the debate. I shall read <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow just as carefully as he to make quite sure that Her Majesty's Government are as enthusiastic as I hope about the conclusions of the report.<lb/>
Secondly, I should like to take this opportunity to add my congratulations to those that the noble Viscount, Lord Torrington, has received on his extremely articulate, very expert and most interesting speech. It was all that I expected it to be. Finally, I should like to thank all those who have taken part in what I believe has been a most interesting and valuable debate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ECC 13th Report: Noise in the Environment</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01322">6.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01323"><member>The Earl of Cranbrook</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Noise in the Environment (13th Report, 1981&#x2013;82, H.L. 175).</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01324">The noble Earl said: My Lords, noise is a difficult subject to define, and difficult to quantify. It is perhaps most simply defined as "unwanted sound"; but
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0148"/>

<col>279</col>
whether or not that sound is wanted depends very much on the interest of the hearer in the source. Noise is difficult to measure, but, nonetheless, noise is a form of nuisance about which most people have strong feelings. In noise control legislation a distinction is made between noise in the workplace and environmental noise. Housewives may not be pleased to know that for this purpose the home is classed with the environment rather than as a place of work, but it is a fact that noise intruding into the home often causes the greatest annoyance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01325">The report which I bring before your Lordships this evening is concerned with noise in this broadest term of definition of noise in the environment. The review of the activities of the European Community in environmental noise control was carried out by Sub-Committee "G" of the Select Committee with the help of Lord Hayter, temporarily seconded to us from Sub-Committee "B". Speaking as chairman of Sub-Committee "G" I should like to record our gratitude for the specialist advice provided by Mr. Nigel Haigh and for valuable written and oral evidence which was given by the Departments of the Environment, of Transport, and of Trade and Industry, the Health and Safety Executive and the Consumers' Association.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01326">In addition we had a particularly fruitful meeting in Brussels with the Commission's Services, chiefly involving the staff of Directorate-General XI but with members of DG III and DG XII also present. A memorandum which was prepared for that occasion by the Commission's Services is published with the report. I should like to express the warmest thanks for this contribution and I should like also to express my thanks personally to the noble Baroness, Lady White, for her support on that visit and to express my regret that she is unable to be present here tonight.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01327">The report has a double function. Its lesser role, in my opinion, is to record the committee's reaction to three recent proposals for directives concerned with noise from different sources; that is, from subsonic aircraft, from helicopters and from household appliances. Its second role, much more important, is to review the whole range of Community involvement in the control of noise emissions in general. As the report shows, since 1973 the subject of noise control has found a place in successive action plans for the environment. It has therefore implicitly received support and the approval of Council. Earlier still, before the adoption of a Community policy for the environment, legislative action was taken in the area of noise control. I refer noble Lords to Annex 1 of our report and also to Annexes I and II of the evidence of the Department of the Environment. These sources provide a useful list of directives in the field of noise abatement, both those agreed and those still in the form of proposals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01328">The earliest of these directives was 70/157. This had the objective of setting limits for levels of noise emission from motor vehicles and, since it was adopted before the United Kingdom acceded to the Treaty of Rome, it was adopted by our Government on accession in 1973. The point is that this first directive did not originate out of environmental concern but as part of the general programme for the elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade between
<col>280</col>
members under Article 100 of the Treaty of Rome. In fact, as is pointed out in paragraph 11 of the report, to date all Community legislation on noise relates to articles in trade between member states. All directives have been promoted under Article 100, with the aim of providing uniform technical standards for the products in question; that is to say, in turn, four-wheeled motor vehicles, tractors, motor-cycles, construction plant, subsonic aircraft, helicopters, lawn mowers and, finally, household appliances.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01329">I hope that the point is clear because I believe it to be rather important. It is that whether or not an agreed environmental action programme exists&#x2014;and there have been disputes over the legality of such an action programme&#x2014;the Community will still inevitably be involved in legislation to control sound emissions of these essentially noisy products which are in trade between member states. From this point of view, I am particularly pleased that we have the Commission's permission to publish as Annex II of the report the brief memorandum prepared for us in Brussels on 6th May last by Directorate-General XI. This is entitled "The European Corn mission's Programme against Noise". I hope that your Lordships will agree with me that this is an important document and that it is a privilege that, through one of the Select Committee reports, we should provide the medium for the first publication of an itemised programme against noise from the Commission.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01330">This memorandum lays out the main objectives of the Commission in a clear and concise fashion. It also draws attention to the mechanism by which individual member states can influence, and have influenced, the Commission's choice of priority in the field of noise control. This is through the operation of what is called the Information Agreement of 5th March 1973, under which the Commission is notified of proposed national legislation in the environmental field and then has an option within a time-scale&#x2014;in the words of the report&#x2014;within time-scales that have
<quote>"proved to be reasonably elastic".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01331">Some of them might be considered excessively elastic. The Commission then has the opportunity to introduce harmonising legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01332">The memorandum continues by observing that noise emissions can be controlled in two principal ways. First, they can be controlled by specifications relating to use; secondly, they can be controlled by specifications in manufacture. In comment on the first method of control, the Commission's Services take the view that.
<quote>"in general, specifications relating to the use of a product are more appropriately pursued at the level of national, regional or local authorities of the Member States".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01333">Holding this opinion, the Commission's Services have taken a policy decision to pursue harmonisation at the European or the wider level in specifications to be taken into account during manufacture. This, in effect, leaves the control of use of noisy products to the member states.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01334">In previous debates on Community environmental matters, speakers have often urged that there should be an agreed partitioning of areas of action between the Commission and national or local Governments of member states at appropriate levels. Here is a proposal from the Commission for just such a
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0149"/>
<col>281</col>
separation of objectives. It leaves the United Kingdom Government free to take all action such as that already empowered under Part III of the Control of Pollution Act, for instance, for the control of noise on construction sites or in streets, noise abatement orders, quiet town experiments, noise insulation standards in building construction, and so on. Community legislation will he confined to the control of the noise emissions of manufactured products in trade between member states.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01335">I hope to hear from my noble friend Lord Avon that the Government view this proposed division of effort with favour, and I hope that he will agree that it is a useful and proper standard to apply to the level of appropriateness. If so, can we further hope that there will be an improved exchange of information and ideas between the relevant departments of our own national Government concerned with noise control and the Commission's Services? There were certain remarks of witnesses that appeared in our report which gave Members of the Sub-Committee cause for concern at the limited flow of information and mutual interaction between our own departments and the Commission's Services which exist at present.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01336">This led Members of the Committee in the report (at paragraph 71) to make a proposal that, in their opinion, would facilitate the exchange of ideas and of other developments in the field of noise control. It is suggested that the Commission should set up an informal advisory body to review the noise policies of the member states and the Commission. If my noble friend agrees that this will be beneficial I hope that he will ensure that moves are made to promote the formation of an advisory committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01337">I am not able in the time available to me to repeat all the remaining conclusions of the committee. They are summarised shortly and tersely in paragraph 78 of the report. But I wish to lay stress on one important issue which I believe affects many people: lorry noise. The rather sad story of the Commission's slow progress towards effective reduction of the noise of lorries&#x2014;or "heavy vehicles" as they are referred to&#x2014;is outlined paragraphs 74 to 77 of the report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01338">Originally the United Kingdom took a lead in the development of the quiet heavy vehicle. As long ago as 1971, the Department of Transport financed research that led to the production of the combined Rolls-Royce Fodens quiet heavy lorry in 1978. This was a real juggernaut of 350 bhp. Yet its noise emissions registered no more than 80 to 82&#x00BD; decibels, the different results depending on the different methods used to measure the noise emission. I understand that the manufacturing costs were not more than 7 per cent. above those of conventional vehicles of comparable power, and the running costs as a result of a fleet test were of the order of 3 per cent. to 4 per cent. higher, and fuel costs only some 1 per cent. higher.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01339">The lorry perhaps did not totally achieve the target of 80 decibels that had been set by the Council declaration in 1977 and which reflects the United Kingdom Government's own long term target. But its development clearly shows that considerable noise reduction is possible, and that it could probably be further improved by extra R and D effort. In the 1981 White Paper, <i>Lorries, People and the Environment</i>, the Government's target was set for a progressive
<col>282</col>
reduction in the perceived noise from new heavy lorries coming onto the road to
<quote>"less than half the 1981 level".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01340">If I take the 1981 level as being something up to 91 decibels&#x2014;and I remind your Lordships that noise scales are logarithmic so that to halve this value we have to subtract 10 decibels&#x2014;that halving 91 brings us to 80 or 81 decibels, which is in the region of the Government's target and also the Community's target. It was also stated in the 1981 White Paper that,
<quote>"The Government will press other European countries to adopt this target".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01341">If I may, I shall ask my noble friend: What has happened to this programme? Can he tell us if further R and D support will be forthcoming? Does he agree that the United Kingdom should not lose the lead which our manufacturers have apparently gained in the research into a quiet heavy vehicle? Do the Government support the Select Committee's conclusion that the biggest and most desirable contribution towards the reduction of environmental noise that can now be made through Community means lies in the quiet heavy vehicle project? If there is anything of truth in the short report that appears in <i>The Times</i> today, maybe we shall have something interesting to hear shortly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01342">In conclusion, I believe that this report of the Select Committee has produced a useful review of a subject that is of real concern to many people in this country, and to many people throughout the European Community. I hope that our own Government, through Community institutions, will press for rapid and effective action in the matters which we have highlighted. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01343">Moved, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Noise in the Environment.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Cranbrook</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01344">7.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01345"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we are indebted to the Select Committee under its chairman, the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, who has just introduced the report. We are grateful to him for the way in which he has outlined this very detailed report and has referred to its conclusions. We value the contributions made by all those who gave evidence, both in this country and abroad. The subject of course is one of great importance at a time when all forms of pollution seem to be increasing, and the quality of life is diminished because of it. Noise is one of the factors in this because we gradually get used to higher noise levels, and we may not realise the effects of it on individuals and on the local environment generally.<lb/>
To see the extent of the noise problem, we need to define what "noise" is. I was very pleased that the noble Earl, in his introduction, referred to that straight away. The report refers to it in paragraph 60, which says:
<quote>"Noise has been defined as unwanted sound".</quote>
This is not the best of definitions as there are many things that we do not want to hear, but they are not necessarily a noise. I think that it might be better for me to quote my own definition:
<quote>"A loud noise which annoys should not be allowed".</quote>
I think that sums up the position and the criteria which we might look for in studying the report.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0150"/>
<col>283</col>
While that is a desirable aim, there are noises which not only annoy but can cause harm within the environment and indeed to individuals, impairing their hearing and their health. I should like greater consideration to be given to the health aspects. Although "unwanted sound"&#x2014;as it is described&#x2014;is a factor, there are often hidden dangers and hazards for health and hearing. The report led me to look at the Health and Safety Commission's consultation document entitled <i>Protection of Hearing at Work</i>, which comments that, although noise at work has been known for many years as a cause of hearing loss, it is only during the past decade that major scientific studies have allowed a reliable estimate to be made of the relationship between noise exposure and the risk of hearing damage. Although high noise levels exist in many major industries, including among others, construction, agriculture, quarrying, shipping, transport, entertainment and a few others, it appears that with few exceptions no estimate of the percentage of the workforce exposed to various noise levels is available. This is a shortcoming which ought to be rectified soon.<lb/>
The Health and Safety Commission's report stresses:
<quote>"Noise represents a serious problem",</quote>
and recommends uniform controls for workplaces. The health factors need more attention. While I am referring to this aspect, may I say that I am pleased that the document of the Health and Safety Commission's Working Group on Machinery Noise, published on 5th August 1981, allowed for consideration and consultations during the past nine months. I hope there will be positive results in the future. I do not know whether the Minister might comment on the possibility of the report of the Health and Safety Commission's Working Group receiving some consideration from the Government and whether he will let us know something about their proposals.<lb/>
Regarding the committee's conclusions, there are many of great weight and it would be impossible and undesirable in a short debate to go too deeply into them. I feel sure that there will be general agreement with the Select Committee's conclusions. One difficulty was to sort out the priorities on a matter which is not only a national or even an EEC issue but indeed is international. The claim to reduce pollution in the community by reducing noise levels has to compete with commercial and other considerations. Another problem is the practicality of reducing noise levels, because what is desirable may not be technically possible, or indeed commercially acceptable, in a fiercely competitive world of trade imports and exports.<lb/>
The first conclusion of the committee shows the right priority in that it recommends that the EEC should produce an overall policy to combat noise. This is vital if the most appropriate action is to follow and if the areas for action are to be limited, as they must be. Such aspects as timing, noise levels, harmonisation and enforcement must have their proper place in the overall plan and in this, of course, we should have regard not only to action within the EEC but to those outside, and not least to third world countries. I was very pleased to see that stressed in the report.<lb/>
<col>284</col>
Harmonisation is important; research and development will be increasingly necessary, and we must bear in mind also that higher technical standards necessary to reduce noise levels could be costly. One has to balance the interests there. The Community is already involved, as the noble Earl has said, in prescribing noise levels between member states and is concerned about two of the most important areas&#x2014;those of traffic noise and aircraft noise. I think it is necessary that the EEC should enforce noise levels agreed by members and should also comply with other bodies such as ICAO. So there is a need for a comprehensive approach which cannot be underestimated.<lb/>
Paragraph 70 of the report suggests that the EEC's Second Action Programme accepts certain actions where appropriate at Community level and some at other levels, two&#x2014;national, regional and local. There must he co-ordination of the work and a decision taken as to who will ensure it. This is another important point, because there must be some responsibility of Governments or other bodies in industry, trade, local authorities, transport and other interests. It cannot be left without some authority to shape it up and get it moving.<lb/>
Recommendation No. 3, regarding an advisory committee to keep the EEC informed of activity in member states and to ensure direction of an orderly development of the EEC anti-noise programme, is most desirable. I think that efforts must be made not only to ensure that there are no gaps but also that overlap of effort is avoided. Technically, this could cost huge sums if, unknown to one another, companies and countries are pursuing similar research and development programmes at the same time.<lb/>
A fair amount of legislation in the United Kingdom concerning noise has already been produced. I would remind the House that the Wilson Report was issued in 1963, and we are still waiting for some action on its proposals. I wonder whether the Minister would comment on the possibility of the proposals of the Wilson Report being reviewed and acted on so far as may be necessary.<lb/>
One test of progress will be the extent to which the targets are met for noise limitation. Under the 1977 Council declaration, the EEC is working towards a limit of 80 decibels for all categories of new vehicles by 1985. I note that the British Government, in the evidence, aims for the meeting of that target by 1990; and it would be helpful to know what chances there are of achieving that target through the motor industry. Of course, this means consultation with those who have to bring it about.<lb/>
Aircraft noise is an international problem, especially for those living near airports. I think I am right in saying that, from the evidence, the Department of Trade believe that the EEC should not initiate aircraft noise standards but should follow international bodies such as ICAO. While ICAO may well know what is desirable and what is practicable, there seems to be no reason why we should not have an independent view on this, given the facts about practicality and the costs required to achieve lower noise standards.<lb/>
I think the Government should determine reasonable criteria in view of the continuing public concern which may not be matched by those who take the responsibility for noise standards in the airline business.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0151"/>
<col>285</col>
Even if limits set by non-governmental bodies are accepted, they must be enforced following directives. One factor to which our attention is drawn is the domination of markets in respect of aircraft, especially helicopters, by the United States, so that European reductions in noise levels may not be matched by the United States. This is a factor which could be damaging to our industry. Our Government departments, in their evidence, are rightly concerned with the effects of limits imposed internationally upon our own environment and upon our trade. They point out the need for exchange of information and the need for further investigation.<lb/>
Transport, as the noble Earl said, is a big area for work in the limitation of noise, The enormous increase in transport and also in the size and weight of vehicles and the movement of vehicles across frontiers produces a problem which is becoming even more intense. There has been a great deal of controversy about the size of lorries from the Continent, hurtling their smoky, noisy way through some of our charming but Dickensian villages; and so transport is another urgent aspect.<lb/>
Motor cycles seem to make their presence known, and indeed heard, in most of our towns and villages where the noise from the machines seems to be a modern virility symbol. Hordes of motor-cyclists screeching through our communities seem to have put the fear of God into more people than all the churches put together. I notice that the Consumers' Association&#x2014;which of course should know what we all want, as consumers&#x2014;considers that we should have more information about the goods we purchase, including test results and labelling. They rightly think that the EEC should bear in mind to a greater extent the view of consumers. Clearly, the Commission must do more to satisfy the Consumers' Association and those of us they represent; and I believe that the Government should be pressing for more assurances in that direction.<lb/>
The noble Earl mentioned household appliances. I notice that the Consumers' Association report on the measurement of human responses indicated that the majority of persons interviewed regarding their feelings about domestic noise emitted by vacuum cleaners and washing machines gave a neutral response&#x2014;25 per cent. and 28 per cent. respectively disliked the noise and I notice that 16 per cent. in both categories actually enjoyed the noise. I am not sure what that may be interpreted as meaning. But there are some noises we get used to&#x2014;perhaps I should say not "noises" but "sounds", because it may be that we are getting used to the sound of church bells, which appeal to many of us&#x2014;and of course we know that some noise is acceptable because it is part of the price we pay for higher living standards, especially in the case of domestic appliances.<lb/>
These are the only observations I would make. One could go into greater depth, because the report is so comprehensive; but, to sum up, I think we are greatly indebted to the Select Committee for the work they have done in bringing this report to the House and in drawing the attention of the House and of the country to this problem, which is already well under way within the Community. We generally back their
<col>286</col>
conclusions, especially the demand for an overall policy and for considered priorities which would include noise from motor vehicles, construction plant, aircraft and some domestic appliances.<lb/>
I believe there is need for greater co-ordination in planning, research and development, and the testing and setting of standards, and also with enforcement, because without enforcement all this work and all the efforts involved will not be satisfactory. In this I believe the Government must play a major role in getting progress and in representing the views of our people, recognising that there are vital health factors also to be taken into account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01346">7.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01347"><member>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, would like to thank the Select Committee for the work they have done on this extremely important subject and I should like also to thank the noble Earl for his introduction. Both speakers so far have started by defining noise and the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, seemed to be complicating the matter with his "noisy noise which annoys", rather like the riddle we all knew in our youth, I think:
<quote>"What kind of noise annoys a noisy oyster?"&#x2014;</quote>
to which noble Lords will remember the answer is:
<quote>"It is a noisy noise that annoys a noisy oyster".</quote>
There are all kinds of different noises, some of which we find pleasant, some of which we do not, but which, in large quantity at high levels, we find extremely annoying. We can find them in every branch of life. We can find them in the goods that we have in our homes. We can find them even in the countryside where at times, particularly in contrast with the stillness around, they are extremely annoying. Since I am in a reminiscent mood, I remember the Saki poem, where he asks:
<quote>"Have you heard the groan of a gravelled grouse, or the snarl of a snaffled snail? Brother or husband like me or spouse. Have you lain awake in a darkened house where the wounded wombats wail?"</quote>
We may not suffer from problems of that kind, but there are major ones with which we have to deal. Two of them, which I want to deal with, have been mentioned already and the first is the noise caused by transport. There are the lorries, which the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, and the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, have covered in quite a detailed way. This noise is something to which we must continue to pay a great deal of attention. It is exportable noise. The lorries that we send to other people's countries cause trouble, and the mere fact that you have to fix some kind of limit for them is something which affects the terms of trade.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, mentioned the noise of foreign lorries, but one correspondent who has written to me on this subject says about the problem in Ilford;
<quote>"It is the British lorries which make even more noise than the foreign ones".</quote>
Unless we get some kind of control right across the EEC, we shall have a situation where, because of the advantages to be gained from not having controls, countries vie with each other and we get more noise rather than less. That is one reason why it is extremely important to insist on noise limits.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0152"/>
<col>287</col>
This is particularly so because, as noble Lords will know from experience, it is almost impossible to pin down and do anything about the noise of a vehicle in transit. How often have we seen a lorry go past and thought, "I wish I could report that, because it is obviously making a noise which must be well above anything that the law allows." But, of course, we never do anything and, if we did, it is almost certain that absolutely nothing would happen. So we have to rely on controls on lorry makers and on customs checks when lorries move from country to country. It is very important that we move as quickly as possible towards the quiet, heavy vehicles which are mentioned in the report, because to have to wait until 1990 is a very long time for people who live in areas which are badly affected by noise.<lb/>
Of course, there are certain matters which are under our own control. While talking about the European Communities' report, I do not think I should fail to point out that more action should probably be taken domestically to direct heavy and noisy traffic away from residential areas, and also, perhaps, to increase insulation grants which are very helpful where the noise cannot be avoided. The rules governing insulation grants sometimes do not make a tremendous amount of sense. I have a letter here from the London Borough of Redbridge:
<quote>"Noise resulting from new or altered highways produces premises eligible for noise insulation. Noise resulting from increased traffic flows on existing highways does not, of itself, make premises eligible for noise insulation".</quote>
So there is plenty that we can do in the domestic area, but, primarily, we must forge ahead in the European area.<lb/>
Aircraft noise is something which the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, mentioned, but I want to deal with it in slightly more depth. It is rather more serious than is often appreciated, if only because it is very often a fairly limited number of people who suffer really badly from it over a long period of time; in fact, they suffer from it every hour of the day. I am particularly referring to those who live in the vicinity of airports. The ECC should certainly do something to limit the nuisance, because, if they do not, the fact that there is not a proper law which fixes limits will affect the terms of trade on which passengers and freight are carried.<lb/>
The Wilson Committee said in 1963:
<quote>"Traffic produces a serious noise problem in the air. Aircraft noise at Heathrow is more than people should be required to tolerate".</quote>
The committee recommended that the noise should be reduced progressively, but, in fact, it has increased since then. In 1963, there were 60,000 jet movements per year, while on 1982 there were 248,000. There are the problems of noisy aircraft. The Airbus has a takeoff noise of 85db, while the Concorde, about which I have spoken before in your Lordships' House, has a take-off noise of 111db, compared with the 78 to 86db of motorcycles.<lb/>
This has an international dimension, because, primarily, travelling across borders from country to country is what air travel is all about. According to the report, the,
<quote>"Trans-frontier effects of noise are &#x2026; localised and cannot readily be called upon to justify Community involvement".</quote>
But that is not so, because a major share of air traffic is inter-European, and therefore the EEC must have a
<col>288</col>
role to play in controlling this nuisance. The EEC need not involve itself in formulating noise standards. I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, about the ICAO levels and about our having a say in formulating the levels, because only in that way can we also control the use that we want to make of them. If we accept the ICAO methods of noise measurement, but apply EEC controls to enforce them, it will have, more or less, the main effect.<lb/>
One or two of the countries involved in the EEC are not enforcing ICAO standards. Italy, I believe, is an example of failure to comply. The noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, spoke about helicopter standards. This is a matter upon which we should concentrate, because we can obtain some benefit for ourselves, in trade terms as well as in environmental terms, by developing a quiet helicopter. We ought definitely to pay more attention to the problem of supersonic aircraft. It may be that supersonic aircraft have a short life and that in the future we shall not have this major problem in front of us. Nevertheless, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Concorde produces a noise which is considerably worse and less tolerable than other forms of aircraft noise. It is far louder than all other jets, yet it is not included in the monitoring figures, nor is it included in noise infringement statistics.<lb/>
There is also a problem about night noise. I do not see why the EEC should not take the lead in directing all European airports, certainly those with international trade, to close at night. In certain countries&#x2014;Switzerland. Japan, Australia&#x2014;there is a complete limit in many airports on the landings and take-offs which can happen at night. That would make a very great deal of difference to the many people who live near our major airports. Responsibility for noise seems to be largely the responsibility of the Department of Trade. In terms of the EEC, this obviously makes sense, but I wonder whether the Department of the Environment ought to have a greater say. A very interesting answer was given in evidence. At page 38 of the report, the witnesses from the Department of Industry and the Department of Trade were asked at Question 77:
<quote>"Will Europe fall in line behind France?"</quote>
The answer was:
<quote>"Not if we see it to be detrimental to our own industry, no".</quote>
One has considerable sympathy with that answer. We must do the best we can to keep our industry competitive. Nevertheless, there is a real sense in which we should try to do the best we can, regardless of the situation in which we find ourselves, in trade terms, to make certain that the environment is respected and that noise limits are acceptable to our citizens.<lb/>
There is one other question that I want to ask, of which I am afraid I have not given notice to the noble Earl; it relates to the legal situation and the recourse which is open to citizens. I said earlier that there is a problem for us all with really noisy lorries. In the Noise Abatement Act 1960, noise became a form of nuisance against which local authorities or private individuals could take action, as the report says. So far as I can gather, this does not apply to aircraft noise. May I ask whether it would be possible for the GLC or local authorities to complain and to bring prosecutions on a noise basis against aircraft and airlines which disturb
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0153"/>
<col>289</col>
the rest of our citizens? I do not think that it would be at all a bad idea if popular control of that kind existed.<lb/>
Finally, it seems to me that the most disturbing part of this admirable report is to be found at page where it is recorded that the member state which is strongly opposed to the total harmonisation solution put forward by the Commission was said by Commission officials to be the United Kingdom. If that is so, it is most unfortunate. I should have hoped that this country, which has always had a reputation for civilised living and for trying to ensure that its citizens can live in peace and quiet, would be one of the leaders in Europe. It is a great shame if we are not, and we should certainly reform.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01348"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend replies, may I apologise for not having put down my name to speak. May I also apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, for not being in my place when he opened the debate. I shall take up only a couple of minutes of your Lordships' time. This has been a very interesting debate. I agree entirely with most of what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, and the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley. The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, spoke about aircraft noise, and I understood him to say that aircraft noise was louder than motor-cycle noise. In my opinion, the reverse is the case. The aircraft comes and goes but the motor-cycle whizzes down the street and the noise reverberates between the buildings. I should like to know whether the Minister has got anything to say about motor-cycle noise.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, also spoke about airports. Those who design airports may put an airport in the middle of nowhere, but in no time at all there are houses all round that airport. Therefore one is in a cleft stick as to who is right and who is wrong. The people who work at the airport have got to bear in mind that they will have to live with the noise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01349">7.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01350"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be most grateful to my noble friend Lord Cranbrook for introducing this subject today in such a lucid form, thereby offering to the House an opportunity to debate the report by the European Communities Select Committee on action by the European Community to control noise in the environment.<lb/>
The Government welcome the review as a timely, useful consideration of what is going on in this field. As has been well demonstrated in the debate, noise nuisance touches all our lives in one way or another. It is quite clear when we are being bothered by noise. Unfortunately, it is not always so clear as to how to control, or who should control, that noise. So far as the European Community is concerned, it is a question of what is appropriate at Community level as part of the European Community action programmes on the environment under the Treaty of Rome. In looking at this issue, the report raises important matters of policy and principle.<lb/>
The Government recognise the importance of these matters and appreciate the strength and breadth of interest which has been expressed. Noise pollution has been referred to on occasions as the Cinderella of
<col>290</col>
pollutants. Control of noise nuisance has a relatively short history throughout the world, but increasingly more concern is being shown about the need to control it. In 1963, the Wilson Committee, to which noble Lords have already referred, defined noise as "sound which is undesired by the recipient"&#x2014;a slightly different definition from those which have been mentioned tonight. However, I believe that that definition still holds good today, almost 20 years later. Since that date the United Kingdom has made substantial progress in controlling noise from air and surface traffic at source as well as, for example, controlling noise at construction sites, from factories and between neighbours under the Control of Pollution Act 1974.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, asked particularly about the recommendations of that committee's report. I think I can fairly say that most have been implemented to some degree and that a considerable number fall within the scope of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. We in the United Kingdom are fortunate. We have a reasonably comprehensive legislative system for meeting our prime objective, the reduction and containment of noise wherever possible, both in the environment and in the workplace&#x2014;although the latter was not considered in this report.<lb/>
In the context of a European Community, the Government recognise that in certain circumstances noise causes nuisance and distress. For that reason we are far from complacent about noise problems. We recognise that our policies must keep pace with the times, and be geared to our internal domestic needs within the United Kingdom, and at the same time reflect the needs of a member state as part of the European Community. I can assure the House that all Government departments will continue to keep a watching brief on the activity of the commission on noise control which affects them. This will, I hope, become clear from what I shall say shortly about some aspects of noise responsibilities as they affect various departments.<lb/>
As this report concludes, it is desirable that there should be an overall policy to combat noise on a Community basis where Community action is appropriate; as the report further concludes, control of products is just such a sphere of noise control. The United Kingdom welcomes Community involvement in the fight to control noise nuisance&#x2014;provided, of course, that it is a balanced, discriminating involvement. My noble friend Lord Cranbrook will be pleased to note that, for this reason, the Government would welcome the creation of the advisory committee referred to in the report to take an overall view on the Commission's "anti-noise" programme. In this context, we recognise that the European Commission is concerned to investigate questions of noise pollution identified in the environment programmes.<lb/>
We certainly attach importance to the Commission having full information, in advance of any action it may take, about the situation in and the views of, the member states. It is apparent from the wide range of this debate that noise is a complex subject, with many different facets. It is for the Commission to decide how they can best take advice to help them to identify policies and priorities on the European scale. We would certainly see merit in some form of mechanism;
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0154"/>
<col>291</col>
for example, an advisory committee meeting occasionally to make sure that both the Commission and the Government are informed. That would help to avoid the risk of individual proposals coming forward out of context and perhaps at fairly short notice. As far as contact between the United Kingdom Government and the European Commission is concerned, officials of Government departments are together meeting Commission officials at the beginning of next year to discuss noise matters informally in addition to ongoing commitments on specific proposals.<lb/>
Clearly, as the report recognises, there are some aspects of noise pollution, such as neighbourhood noise, which are more appropriate to control within member states and which do not lend themselves to action at Community level. Indeed it is not appropriate in all cases to legislate even within a national framework; many noise problems stem from inconsiderate human behaviour. We cannot legislate to improve that, but we can hope to educate and inform. To bear witness to this, there has been the recent publication of the <i>Bothered by Noise</i> booklet and, before that, the codes of practice on, for example, model aircraft flying.<lb/>
If I may turn now to road vehicle noise, which all speakers have mentioned, attention has been drawn to the report's comments on Community action to reduce noise levels for road traffic vehicles&#x2014;heavy lorries, motorcycles and cars. Let me stress that the Government are well aware of the public concern about vehicle noise and the sub-committee's report reflects this concern. We are determined to see that action is taken to improve matters. There are two aspects to this problem: first, to make sure that new vehicles are as quiet as possible; and, second, to see that they remain quiet in use.<lb/>
New lower noise limits will apply to vehicles coming into use from next year and we are already urgently looking at what further reductions would be possible in the future. The United Kingdom was instrumental in the setting up of a European Community Working Group which is looking at all aspects of future noise limits. The working Group reported in July, and discussion of its report is taking place in Brussels this autumn. The Government will press for the lowest limits that are technically feasible at an acceptable cost. We are also working with the motor industry to develop a quiet heavy vehicle for the 1990s that should be no noisier than present day cars.<lb/>
The existing law and the annual testing of lorries and cars generally work well in ensuring that the agreed limits are maintained in use. But there is a problem with motorcycles, particularly because of the fitting of inadequate replacement exhaust systems. As a first step, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport laid regulations on 14th October 1982 which will make it absolutely clear that a replacement silencer must enable a vehicle to meet the same standards as the original equipment silencer did. We are also looking urgently at other ways of improving enforcement of the noise regulations in respect of motorcycles, bearing in mind that only an irresponsible minority do flout the existing regulations. I hope that it will be clear from what I have already said that the Government fully share the sub-committee's wish to see further substantial
<col>292</col>
reductions in vehicle noise limits&#x2014;subject, of course, to feasibility and cost.<lb/>
We must take issue, albeit slightly, with the report's concentration on the 1977 declaration by the Council of Ministers that the community should work towards a limit of 80dB(A) for all categories of vehicle by 1985. First, the declaration set a goal rather than making a definite commitment. Secondly, the proposal was made on the basis of the test procedure then current. The test procedure has been tightened and will bring reductions in noise limits for many heavy lorries and some cars even though the numerical values are unchanged. This has, as the department's oral evidence made clear, made the goal more difficult to reach, particularly for heavy lorries and large motorcycles. Thirdly, the majority of new vehicles are already meeting this goal.<lb/>
The European Commission is expected to make known its proposals for future noise limits early next year. Until they are available, the need for additional measures to promote the introduction of quiet vehicles into traffic cannot be assessed. However, the Secretary of State for Transport has already announced the collaborative research and development programme to take forward the work with the department's quiet heavy vehicle to show how the techniques may be applied to production vehicles. Work will begin on the project itself in the next months.<lb/>
As the Secretary of State for Transport announced in last December's White Paper, we have put in hand the next stage in taking forward to the production stage the techniques domonstrated in the quiet heavy vehicle. Some projects supported by the Department of Industry are already under way and we are heavily engaged with manufactureres to define further projects. There is a tentative provision of &#x00A3;5 million from the two department's funds, which, if matched by industry, would give a total &#x00A3;10 million programme. Part of the reason for a collaborative research programme involving vehicle and engine manufacturers is to ensure that British industry is as well placed as its competitors to meet this major technical challenge of meeting a noise limit of about 80dB(A). Nevertheless, a ceiling of 80dB(A) remains the government's broad objective, and to answer one of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitely, we are working towards it as quickly as possible in conjunction with our Community partners.<lb/>
Turning now to aircraft noise, which was particularly mentioned by the noble Lords, Lord Bishopstone and Lord Beaumont of Whitley, the Governments agree with the committee's conclusions that the amendments to the Subsonic Aircraft Directive are a natural extension of the present directive and should be adopted. Since the Thirteenth Report was published, the Council of Ministers has approved the directive on <i>Limitation of Noise Emissions from Subsonic</i> Aircraft (EC 8153/82). Legislation to amend the 1979 Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order, which will incorporate the provisions of the directive, will be laid before both Houses during the next Session.<lb/>
The Government also accepts the committee's conclusions on the proposed helicopter directive. As suggested by the committee European pressure has been brought to bear on the United States, within the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0155"/>
<col>293</col>
International Civil Aviation Organisation, to reconsider its decision to defer helicopter noise standards, but so far to no avail. Further pressure will be brought to bear through the relevant working groups of the organisation, but it appears unlikely that the Americans will change their attitude before 1984/85.<lb/>
Another area of EC action, following an initiative by an individual member state, is that of the proposed directive of noise labelling of houshold appliances. Let me say at once that the Government have noted the report's conlusion on this; and also let me say that we entirely take the point made by consumer bodies that labels showing only noise emitted by household appliances might confuse a purchaser. They might for instance, confuse low noise with good performance, or even high noise with high power. The way out of this difficulty is to provide that noise information is not mentioned in isolation but is always accompanied by other information, for example relating to energy rating.<lb/>
I note the consumer point, that the unit of noise, the decibel, and its relationship with everyday experience of noise is not familiar to the general public. I am sure that in the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, was using the term they will become aware of it very soon. It is, however, a well established unit that has a sound scientific basis and is internationally recognised as a method of measuring noise. In view of this we do not think it would be practiclabe to attempt to introduce any other method of indicating noise emitted. We would rather prefer to rely on the public's often under-rated ability to absorb and put to practical use the terms involved in new technology. This they have quite easily done, for example, in the case of film speeds for photography and distortions in hi-fi systems.<lb/>
It must also be remembered that the main aim of this directive is to remove barriers to trade, and we already have at least one member state anxious to introduce mandatory noise labelling. It is important, therefore, that we establish harmonised methods of measuring and quoting noise emitted, so that we do not find ourselves having to submit household appliances to a number of testing authorities in order to export to other member states. This is a most important consideration. We believe, therefore, that we should support the introduction of this directive, if only to prevent the emergence of barriers to trade.<lb/>
My Lords, a number of other points were raised on specific matters and I might perhaps just deal quickly with one or two of them. The noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, mentioned particularly noise at work. This forms part of the Community's action programme on safety and health at work as set out on page 20 of the report, and we are awaiting the proposal for a directive which the Commission mentions in paragraph 5 on page xxxi. When the proposal has been received its details can be studied, to consider how far they are sensible.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, mentioned specifically the sound insulation of dwellings against traffic noise. Recognising that noise is one of the most disturbing features created by a new road, particularly when it cuts through a residential area, the United
<col>294</col>
Kingdom Government adopted the approach that where the coming into use of a road would result in more than a specified level of noise outside a dwelling house, there should he a right for the householder to claim and a duty on the highway authority to provide such insulation. This approach has been given practical effect in Part II of the Land Compensation Act 1973 and the detailed regulations made thereunder. The Department of Transport undertook to keep the regulations under review and for this purpose a working party was set up to review their scope in the light of experience and the implications of any change. My right honourable friend is awaiting the working group's report, which is expected shortly.<lb/>
The noble Lord also referred to lorry controls or controls on lorry routeing. We are encouraging local highway authorities to make greater use of their powers to control the routes that lorries may use as part of our package of measures to control lorries. We have offered technical advice from the Department of Transport where required. Further encouragement will be offered through favourable treatment in transport supplementary grants settlements to councils making good use of these powers. Good progress has already been made in recent years with some 850 lorry bans made on amenity grounds.<lb/>
My noble friend mentioned motor-cycles. As he is well aware, there are limits on how far we can go in this field. There are already rules on how noisy new machines are allowed to be and these rules have just been tightened. Consideration of further reductions is likely. There are rules about not making excessive noise or tampering with exhaust systems. We are looking into ways of controlling inadequate replacement silencers. But modern motor-cycles used sensibly are already fairly quiet. The problems are largely caused by an anti-social minority of young riders who seem to take delight in drawing attention to themselves. The police do their best but it is difficult for them to take effective action against such mobile offenders. In some cases we are getting into deep questions about the alienation of some young people from society, and vehicle regulation is perhaps not the best way of tackling this.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, also referred to the noise at Heathrow Airport and from aircraft generally. At Heathrow itself, although aircraft movements have increased year on year, peak noise levels are already falling, and we believe they will fall further by 1st January 1986, when no older, noisier aircraft on the United Kingdom register will be allowed to operate in the United Kingdom. We and most other European Community countries greatly prefer to initiate aircraft noise proposals within ICAO, because, first, we have always done so, and, secondly, we feel that our own national interests are best represented in a wider international context. We are also anxious to avoid duplication of effort.<lb/>
My Lords, if I have not covered any specific points I hope the House will allow me to do so by writing. To conclude, the Commission of the European Community has included a section on noise pollution in its proposed programme for environmental action between now and 1986. These proposals have been endorsed by the European Parliament and will be put to the Council of Ministers later this year. I assure your Lordships that the views expressed in this House this
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0156"/>
<col>295</col>
evening will form a valuable basis for the United Kingdom's contribution to the Council debate, particularly in seeking to guide the Commission's priorities for future action.<lb/>
I would like to end by saying that I am sure all noble Lords would like to join me in thanking the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, for initiating what I believe has been a valuable discussion on noise pollution in the European Community. The Government appeciate the contribution of your Lordships, both in debate now and, more importantly, in the preparation of the Select Committee's report. This useful document will assist future progress on noise control both in the United Kingdom and in the European Community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01351"><member>The Earl of Cranbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hesitate to cross the indefinable barrier and from being a mere sound become an unwanted sound and therefore a noise. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, spoke of the appeal of bells and my noble friend Lord Avon spoke of the appeal of decibels, as a unit of measurement. But seriously, my Lords, I thank your Lordships very much for a fruitful and useful debate. The sub-committee will note with interest the remarks of noble Lords on the other side of the House, and I think they will note with particular gratitude two firm statements by my noble friend on this side: first, that the United Kingdom Government firmly supports the proposal for an advisory committee for exchange of information on developments in this field, and, secondly, for the assurance that there will be a grant of &#x00A3;5 million from the Government, which I sincerely hope will be matched by the &#x00A3;5 million from industry, if only to make true what we read in <i>The Times</i> today. My Lords, I thank you for participating in this debate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Badgers: Tuberculosis Control</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01353">7.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01354"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are aware that thousands of badgers gassed since 1975 under the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture for the purpose of bovine tuberculosis control have died painful or miserable deaths from starvation or slow asphyxiation, during which period the public have been led to believe that this was a humane method of destruction; and what are the full facts about the discovery of this massive cruelty inflicted upon an otherwise protected species of wildlife.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01355">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper. I will not read it, because when I put it down in July I was a little highly charged emotionally. I have calmed down a bit since, but if I were re-drafting it now I would direct rather more attention to the future than to the miseries of the past. Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned about badgers. I have them at my home in Surrey, I have studied them for years, and they are supporters in my crest of arms, so I feel very close to badgers indeed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01356">On the events in July, when gassing was suspended, I not only felt compassion for the way we are treating our badgers, but I felt angry at the way in which we had
<col>296</col>
misplaced our trust in cyanide gassing as a humane method of destroying badgers. Probably we are to blame for this. We did not know enough and apparently the experts appeared not to know enough. Nor did they get to know enough about this gassing business. The reason may be that no one can seriously have thought beforehand about using a method of miscellaneous pest control as the means for carrying out a systematic and prolonged extermination of the popular badger&#x2014;an extermination carried out with the authority and through the agency of the state. I believe that to be the root of the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01357">The implications of cyanide gassing being used on badgers, with their extensive underground galleries and the problem of the intensity of the gas for destruction purposes being in doubt and variable according to the terrain and conditions of the operation&#x2014;all these matters seemed to have escaped the attention of those who were responsible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01358">I call it extermination because that is what it is. It is not a slaughter policy in the sense that I understand it. Slaughter as a form of disease control in domestic animals does not lead to the extinction of the species as the slaughter of wildlife may well do. The cry in the West country where these operations are most numerous is, "Where will it stop?" I read in the <i>Western Daily News</i> of 24th February this year a statement attributed to Mr. Roger Muirhead, a Ministry of Agriculture veterinary officer in Gloucestershire, which was:
<quote>"As far as I am concerned, the only solution to the serious problem of TB in cattle is to wipe out badgers, but unfortunately it would not he politic to do so".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01359">According to the newspaper report, he went on to say:
<quote>"I really would like to see strong healthy badgers around who do not have TB. But that just will not happen".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01360">This, I fear, is the way we are likely to be going because I do not think that there is any comfort in what is happening at the present time. Already the control areas comprise of the highest concentration of these animals in the country. Indeed, the density of the badger population in the West and in Cornwall is believed to be partly responsible for the extensive spread of tubercular infection among them. We have to ask ourselves whether the present policy, however it is carried out and whatever the method adopted, can achieve its purpose. Is the threat to the badger becoming greater than the threat to the cattle? There seem to be some grounds for believing that it is.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01361">I do not need to remind the house of the tragic story of the badger and how, in 1973, we felt very gratified when Parliament passed a measure of protection for the badger which had suffered from persecution and abominable cruelties throughout the centuries. This interesting animal has emerged from the dark ages in its evolution to being one of the most popular of our animals in wildlife today. It has gone from vicious prejudice and cruel pursuit to being the Christmas card animal of the year. But now its popularity is turning to peril, not only peril for the badger but, I believe, a degree of peril for the Government themselves because feelings on this matter run very high indeed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01362">When we passed the first legislation in 1973 we thought we had ended the cruelties of badger baiting, badger digging, sending the Jack Russells down the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0157"/>
<col>297</col>
setts in order to test their virility and capacity for warfare, and all the abominations of the past. But that was rudely shaken when a couple of years later the discovery was made almost accidentally of the relationship between bovine tuberculosis in cattle and a similar infection in badgers. Then we had further legislation to give the Minister the power to issue licences for the killing of badgers which were found to he, or suspected of being, carriers of the infection of bovine TB.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01363">This, for the sake of keeping everyone's emotions down, is called badger control, but it is badger destruction. The means of enforcement of badger control has been accompanied by the right to enter and the right to enforced entry on to land and premises for the destruction of badgers. To obstruct the men from the Ministry is an offence. To hide an animal or to conceal its whereabouts or habitat are offences under the 1975 legislation. These powers alone have given rise to scenes of acute distress and resentment and of emotional outbursts in the West country. In all the designated areas many people are in a constant state of apprehension because they never know when they are to get a warning from the men from the Ministry that they are coming on the land in the exercise of their powers of badger control. The newspapers are full of it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01364">This area is pretty clearly defined at the moment. It is a line north to south in the South-West country from Chipping Campden, through Swindon and Salisbury, to Bournemouth. That is the line. I believe that Dorset, where there was an outbreak at Purbeck, is now clear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01365">I shall confine myself to the method of destruction and not argue the question of whether this is the way in which to deal with this very serious problem. The present Minister inherited the problem. When he arrived at the Ministry it was not long before he decided to suspend the destruction of badgers until the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, had undertaken a thorough investigation or stocktaking of the position arrived at in 1979&#x2013;80. I am very glad indeed that the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, has found it possible to be with us this evening because his contribution on this problem is of a distinguished character. He has probably put more thought into this matter than any other person in the country. Not everyone has agreed with his conclusions, but no one can question the thoroughness with which he has done the job. I thought that the Minister acted promptly and rightly when he came into office. It is very nice to see the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, in his customary role as Minister of Agriculture and no longer acting as the shadow of the Secretary of State for Employment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01366">The noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman produced his report in 1980, and paragraph 113 of that report recommended investigation into the use of hydrogen cyanide gas. In that respect Lord Zuckerman's doubts renewed those which had been expressed a little earlier by the RSPCA in a document which they had published on this subject, and it was thought that there was a case for further investigation of the method of destruction. The doubts were about the lethal levels of gas needed throughout the set to kill quickly and humanely.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01367">After the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, produced his report and recommended that the badger control measures should be resumed quickly, gassing was
<col>298</col>
resumed while investigation was made on the recommendation in paragaph 113 of Lord Zuckerman's report. The results became available last June, when the chemical defence establishment produced its report. The Minister straightaway suspended gassing on humane grounds. In his press statement of 1st July, the Minister said:
<quote>"The results, however, do imply that there must be doubt whether the badgers in a gassed sett die quickly and, therefore, whether they die humanely".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01368">He continued:
<quote>"We shall continue control and experimental operations by trapping in those areas where trapping is already in use".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01369">he also added:
<quote>"It is necessary to consider urgently what alternative methods are available which can provide an effective and humane means of controlling TB in badgers".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01370">That I am sure must mean that there may be other ways of controlling it than by wholesale destruction. Indeed, it is on the situation as it is now that I think the Minister will wish to inform the House, and it is certainly the matter upon which we all want to hear what he has to say.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01371">The experimental trapping which is now going on may involve the use of snares and we know how horrible snares can be, especially with badgers. No one who has seen a badger in a snare can feel at all satisfied with that method of trapping badgers. It seems to me that we are all facing a situation which is every bit as worrying as in past years. New outbreaks of bovine TB among cattle in control areas show little sign of slackening and as the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, emphasises in his report:
<quote>"The spread of the disease among badgers to other parts of the country could have serious consequences, not only to cattle but to the survival of the badger in our country".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01372">Those were the words with which the noble Lord concluded his report in 1980. With that as a possible danger, I suggest that the Minister should now regard this problem as one of major ecological importance to the country as a whole. It is now a national problem: The plight of the last and shyest of this type of mammal in our wildlife, and although it is one which is elusive and rarely seen by many people, it is nevertheless in a position of strong affection among the public. I sincerely hope that all avenues of research will be diligently explored.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01373">I conclude by saying that above all, the state, as executioner of whatever species, must satisfy the public as to need and keep clear of the taint of cruelty in its methods, It is on the outlook for the future that I ask the noble Minister kindly to inform the House.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01375"><member>The Earl of Lindsey and Abingdon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, for putting down this Unstarred Question. I trust that my noble friend on the Front Bench will take note of the various points raised by the noble Lord, as I for one have a certain amount of sympathy for what he has said.<lb/>
I have no interest to declare, such as being a member of the National Society for the prevention of Cruelty to Animals or the Anti-Blood Sports League. On the contrary, I am a keen sportsman, especially from the point of view of shooting. It is my intention to be extremely brief and I have no wish to get into an argument with, or to criticise, the Ministry of Agricul-

<col>299</col>
ture on their methods in the control of badgers where there is the slightest risk of bovine tuberculosis in cattle, and where there is a danger of it being passed on to human beings. However, where I am concerned is in the example set by the Ministry in the control of these unfortunate animals.<lb/>
I had the privilege and pleasure of owning a small 20 acre wood less than 25 miles from London, in which there was a colony&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;of badgers. It gave me great pleasure to know that they were there and if and when I had the time, I would make the effort to observe their environment. That was not easy, due to their nocturnal and burrowing habits. During the 15 years that I was in possession of this wood, I had to fight against continuous requests from neighbouring farmers and gamekeepers to allow them to gas the badger burrows.<lb/>
My refusal to allow this to happen was no less relaxed by the passing of the 1973 Act, making the badger a protected species other than by control through the Ministry of Agriculture, as was referred to by the noble Lord in his speech. In fact, the absence of any evidence of bovine tuberculosis in the area and, therefore, the presence of representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture made the position even worse. It was very difficult to convince the farmer that there was no danger to his cattle, and the gamekeeper that the badgers were not responsible for the loss of some of his pheasants. It became obvious that their minds had been instilled by generations of superstition that the badger was a carnivorous, diseased monster that should be put down at all costs. After all, it was a little over a century ago that badger-baiting was a favourite sport in this country.<lb/>
In conclusion, I would ask my noble friend when he comes to answer the debate, to make every effort to alleviate past misunderstandings in respect of this otherwise harmless and sometimes useful animal, before it is too late.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01377"><member>Lord Zuckerman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are two or three points that I should like to make in this debate. The first&#x2014;and I say this because we must be fair to the people from whom I took evidence in the course of my inquiry&#x2014;is that no one pretended to knowledge which he did not have. When it came to the question of cyanide as a means of getting rid of infected setts or setts which were suspected of being infected, I specifically asked the RSPCA representative about this matter, as I made clear in the report. I addressed the question to him and made quite sure that it was recorded as a matter of fact in the report. The RSPCA man knew no better way of dealing with the problem.<lb/>
Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, used the word "extermination". I really do think that it is unfortunate that we talk in terms of extermination. I know something about animal behaviour and animal numbers, and I should imagine that one of the most difficult animals ever to suffer extermination at human hands will be the badger. It is perfectly true that the densest populations are probably in the suspected areas where it is clear that transmission of the tubercle bacillus occurs between badger and cattle. I do not know which came first and, as I mentioned in my report, I think that is irrelevant. There is a direct link there and we have to deal with it
<col>300</col>
and establish the nature of the link as well as one can establish a point of that sort with the kind of information that we have at our disposal. If, as I believe, it is a statutory duty of Government to see that tuberculosis does not spread in our dairy cattle or in any of our cattle, obviously, any link must be dealt with, and the badger is a link.<lb/>
It so happens that in today's edition of the <i>New Scientist</i>&#x2014;and I was totally unaware of this until about an hour ago when I picked up my copy&#x2014;there is an article by Dr. Barrow, lately working at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, on tuberculosis. It has the headline "Must badgers be destroyed?"<lb/>
I shall not burden your Lordships with all that he says, but there are one or two points which he makes which I think are worth reading out. First, he quite correctly says that we are still ignorant of the ways in which the tubercle bacillus passes between badger and cattle.<lb/>
Secondly, he says:
<quote>"This, however, does not detract from the fact that badgers do harbour"&#x2014;</quote>
and I would not have put it quite this way&#x2014;
<quote>"a considerable reservoir of</quote>
the particular bacillus concerned. Then he says&#x2014;and this does not give me any pleasure&#x2014;that he would not expect the slaughter of infected badgers to be effective always. He goes on to say something which I am afraid will cause a certain measure of distress to the noble Lord, Lord Houghton. He says:
<quote>"we are left with an inevitable conclusion; if we want to control TB we must do so by controlling badger population &#x2026; It follows that eradication of TB from badgers can be achieved only by eradicating badgers. Any other notion is a pipedream".</quote>
That is the problem which I am afraid the Government face. It is a problem which causes me just as much distress as it does the noble Lord, Lord Houghton. However, I am also conscious of the fact that my sympathies go out to those Government scientists who, in carrying out their duties to the people of this country in seeing that tuberculosis is suppressed, now have this difficult task of finding more acceptable ways and more effective ways both of diagnosing the presence of tuberculosis in badgers and then of dealing with the problem in such a way that the tubercle bacillus does not go on spreading from badger to badger, from badger to cattle, back to badger, and then out of the affected area.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01379"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that one should pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Houghton for his continued vigilance with regard to the wellbeing of animals. Although he and many members of societies concerned with animal welfare often hit the headlines with their claims of alleged cruelty to animals&#x2014;indeed, they are not always allegations, for they say that there has been cruelty to animals&#x2014;I think your Lordships will recognise that they are not the only ones who care. We all share concern, some working behind the scenes as, indeed, has the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, in order to solve the problems.<lb/>
The subject, of course, is an emotive one and in our anxiety to ensure the wellbeing of animals as far as possible we must do what we can to get the facts. I am sure that we are greatly indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, for being with us tonight and for his
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0159"/>
<col>301</col>
brief but telling contribution on this sad matter. It is, of course, easy for us to be selective in deciding what experts to believe and it is easy for us to reach some conclusion, for there is sure to be an expert somewhere who will prove what we say. But those who exercise power in Government, and, indeed, many others, have some very difficult decisions to make. This is a matter which does not concern only this Government but which concerned the previous Government as well.<lb/>
How does a Minister with responsibility react when he is told that it is not only suspected but that there is real cause to believe that there is TB in some badgers which can spread to cattle, and when he is told that in one area&#x2014;say, Dorset&#x2014;several hundred cows can he affected and may have to be slaughtered? My noble friend says quite rightly that he is concerned about the way in which badgers are destroyed. There are two points to answer here. First, is the badger a real source of TB? Is he a carrier not only to cattle but to other clean badgers, and if it is necessary, to use nicer language, to put badgers to sleep, what is the best way to do it?<lb/>
These are the problems which have been facing those in Government and, indeed, advisers for a very long time. I do not think it helps my noble friend's case for him to revive memories of badger baiting, badger digging and so on as though those who had to take responsibility in this very sad situation were enjoying the process. He must know that the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, and many others have since at least 1975 been actively involved in finding the best way to tackle this problem. If a Minister is told in 1975, or whenever it may be, that several hundred cattle are at risk, dare he say, "Until we can find a way of killing badgers humanely and be absolutely certain of it"&#x2014;which is something that few can certify beyond all doubt&#x2014;"we must not do anything about it"?<lb/>
I would not ask my noble friend if he cares only for badgers which have TB and does not care about the clean badgers who could get TB from the small number which have it. I would not like to ask him whether he has no concern for the suffering of hundreds of cows which may be affected by the disease.<lb/>
If one talks about the effect of TB, then human beings are, of course, among those who can be affected, and most species of mammals and birds are susceptible to tuberculosis. I quote from the MAFF handbook of 1978:
<quote>"Amongst farm animals, cattle and swine are most frequently affected; horses and goats occasionally and sheep rarely.</quote>
<quote>"Symptoms. The disease is often of a chronic nature and objective symptoms are not seen. When the disease is advanced or becomes acute in a particular organ more definite symptoms are observed.</quote>
<quote>"The lungs are a common site of disease in cattle. When the lungs are involved the animal may cough and, in advanced case, show signs of respiratory distress. An affected quarter of the udder becomes progressively harder. The milk appears normal except in very acute cases or after the disease is long established; in these cases it may be a straw coloured fluid.</quote>
<quote>"The existence of disease may be confirmed by the demonstration of the organism in sputum, milk or discharge from the uterus. For routine diagnosis it is necessary to use a tuberculin test".</quote>
That is the fate for cows which get the disease from badgers or, indeed from any other source, but there has been real reason to believe that the badger has been responsible for cattle suffering in a number of areas in the country, though thankfully the areas are not widespread.<lb/>
<col>302</col>
Successive Ministers have had to deal with the problem which concerns not only badgers but cows as well, and I do not think there is any doubt, after what the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, has written or indeed said, that there is a strong link. The limited operation in the South-West, the most affected area, has been restricted to less than 4 per cent. of the land area, so there are not wide areas of land where badgers have been slaughtered. Clearly the Minister has been wise to seek evidence by collecting and examining badger carcases from other areas in order to restrict contamination where it exists. There is no doubt about the problem of infection.<lb/>
I was rather interested in a letter published in December last in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> from the chairman of the Dorset County Branch of the National Farmers' Union, who said then&#x2014;and it is still true, I am afraid&#x2014;that there is much misunderstanding as to the extent of, and the need for, the gassing of badgers. It is not suggested that he said that any badgers should be destroyed where healthy cattle are living alongside healthy badgers. He reminds us that in a period of seven years no fewer than 700 infected cattle had to be slaughtered. When the area of about 500 acres was cleared of badgers the infection ceased immediately. Following a series of clear tests the farm was given a clean bill of health by the Ministry of Agriculture. He says:
<quote>"Now restocking of the empty setts with badgers is taking place with the blessing of the farmer and the careful monitoring of the Ministry of Agriculture, which throughout has shown great consideration not only for the health of livestock but for the welfare of the wildlife".</quote>
I notice from replies to questions that something like &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million has been paid out in compensation. That money paid out represents a large number of cattle who have suffered in much the way that I have quoted tonight, and suffered a great deal. If my noble friend had been in charge of the situation would he have said, "Well, I recognise that something should be done, but until we are sure as to how we can get rid of these infected badgers with no suffering whatsoever the thing must be left"? I do not know what would have happened to our herds in that situation.<lb/>
It has not been just a matter for the Minister of the day to decide what action he shall take, because he has had a lot of expert advice in addition to that of the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, and I think it would be helpful if I just put on record the reply to my noble friend on a Question in your Lordships' House on 14th July of this year, at column 452, about the composition of the Advisory Panel. I shall not mention names but it is important to know what organisations they represent. The composition of the Advisory Panel on Badgers and Tuberculosis includes members of the British Veterinary Association, the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners' Association, the RSPCA, which I think is an important point, the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society, the Mammal Society, the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, and expert on the diseases of wildlife, an eminent authority on badgers, a member of the Transport and General Workers' Union, the Nature Conservancy Council, a general medical practitioner and expert on badgers, the Royal Society for Nature Conservation, and a microbiologist from Middlesex Hospital. That is a formidable gather-
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0160"/>
<col>303</col>
ing of experts and people representing all interests; nature as well as conservation, as well as animal welfare. We are indebted to them and indeed others who have given advice on this matter. They have met on five occasions since January 1981, the last time being on 1st July this year.<lb/>
I do not think I need say anymore about this because Lord Zuckerman's contribution is one which I am sure will be accepted by all Members of the House. We are grateful to my noble friend for having raised this, and I hardly need to assure him that we all share the concern about this matter. In Government problems come along on which one hopes on occasion you would not have to take a decision. During the whole period under review, from Governments of both parties, we have been seeking all the advice we can to check on methods as to whether they are humane and to see whether there are alternative methods which might be even more humane. I think the Minister was right to suspend the present procedure until he has more assurance. I hope, as I am sure we all do, that something will come along soon which everyone can accept.<lb/>
We would be wrong to be selective about this and say that we ought only to be concerned about the badgers who have TB and pay little regard to those who can get TB&#x2014;the clean badgers, and there are many more of them, and also of course our dairy herds. My noble friend has rightly raised this matter, of which the gassing of badgers is only a small part. The other larger part concerns the many more clean badgers and the massive number of cattle who are threatened. We welcome this opportunity to enlighten the House and indeed the country about what steps are being taken, because we all share the dilemma and concern of the general public that something shall be done as soon as possible to make sure that the risk of contamination from some badgers does not spread the suffering to much wider areas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01380"><member>Lord Ferrier</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend rises to reply, may I say that something has recently been said about the areas concerned. Like the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, I am not an agriculturist but I am devoted to wildlife and to the prevention of cruelty to animals. The only case of bovine tuberculosis of which I have heard recently in our neighbourhood was in cattle imported from Ireland. I should like to ask my noble friend whether there is any limit in terms of region, or latitude, and whether badgers in Scotland are just as likely to be infected as are badgers in southern and warmer areas?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01381">8.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01382"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston. I also should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, for having asked this Question. It gives me an opportunity to explain the position as it is, and it is an important Question. The noble Lord said that he had put this Question down in July and it was fairly emotionally charged, and if he had rewritten it he would have used more modest words. I am bound to say that he had three months in which to rewrite his Question, and if he did not rewrite it I am bound to answer the Question which was put on the Order Paper.<lb/>
<col>304</col>
In that Question he refers to the,
<quote>"thousands of badgers gassed since 1975 under the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture".</quote>
He refers to the,
<quote>"massive cruelty inflicted upon an otherwise protected species of wildlife."</quote>
These are strong words, and I accept that the noble Lord would modify them. But those are the words he used, and the words of the Question that one has to answer. I take them very seriously. Everyone knows Lord Houghton's intense interest in the protection of animals, and he is not alone in this. I want to see animals protected, and I have no doubt that every other noble Lord does too. Whatever the critics may say, the Ministry of Agriculture sets great store on the preservation of wildlife.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston. I did not think that my noble friend Lord Lindsey and Abingdon's description of badger baiting which was done only 100 years ago was particularly helpful. We have moved on since then, and people's opinions have changed a great deal; and if we are to talk about conservation, or anything like that, people's opinions have changed monumentally over the last seven years. Although my noble friend said that some people consider that badgers are diseased animals and should be put down at all costs, I do not think that is a fact. Certainly it is not the experience I have had. The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, is entirely right to say that the badger is liked and that the gassing of badgers is bad for Government. Indeed, I would not take any exception with him over that. Of course people do not like it. People have disliked it and, as he rightly said, they have demonstrated against it.<lb/>
My officials at the Ministry of Agriculture do not like doing it either. The gassing of badgers does cause revulsion. It goes without saying that the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, under the instructions of my right honourable friend the Minister&#x2014;and, indeed, of his predecessors who belonged to the party of the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston&#x2014;did not undertake these operations without very good reason, and I shall take this opportunity to tell your Lordships exactly why badger control was, and remains, necessary; and I found the speech of Lord Bishopston particularly helpful when he said it was a difficult problem for any Minister. Any Minister can act only on the advice he has, and when one is talking about diseases, whether of cattle or human beings, he can act only on scientific advice, and it must be the best advice. He cannot act on his own opinions, however strongly he may feel, or on his own sentiments, because once one starts going down that road on matters of disease, one really loses credibility. My right honourable friend and the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston and his right honourable friend before him, acted, I believe, on the best advice they had.<lb/>
In the 1930s, and even 30 years ago, tuberculosis was still a serious problem in this country, with 50,000 new cases in human beings every year. A substantial proportion of those cases arose from the tuberculosis organism which infects cattle. In the 1930s nearly one in three cattle were infected. Nowadays, tuberculosis is no longer the fearful scourge it was. It is uncommon in human beings, and in cattle only one animal in every 5,000 is now found to have any infection&#x2014;as I say,
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0161"/>
<col>305</col>
compared with one in three in the 1930s&#x2014;and those one in 5,000 we soon wipe out.<lb/>
Fifty years ago we began a voluntary programme to eradicate this disease from cattle. Thirty years ago the eradication from cattle was made compulsory by law. In 1960, we were able to declare ourselves virtually free of bovine TB. That was a great achievement. Now, we regularly test the adult population of over 5 million cattle and any reactor animal is slaughtered as soon as it is detected. That means that few, if any, cattle get beyond an early stage of the disease. This is the only safe method and it is used by all developed countries. We should he failing in our obligations, both domestic and international, were we to do otherwise.<lb/>
Nevertheless, despite that, there are still sporadic outbreaks, as with any other disease which has been removed. But it is no longer endemic. With few exceptions, these sporadic outbreaks have been confined to some parts of the South West. There, there is 10 times as much bovine TB as in the rest of the country&#x2014;one reactor in 500 instead of one in 5,000&#x2014;and while that is still very small, it is far too big. Tuberculosis could still be transmitted through milk to those who live and work on farms there. What is more, this higher level of infection could soon spread to neighbouring herds and to other parts of the country, to which the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, referred.<lb/>
It is a fact that badgers can, and do, harbour bovine tuberculosis and their connection with the disease is inescapable. Ministry scientists did not just jump to the conclusion that badgers were the culprit after finding just one carcase with TB. They examined many diseased badger carcases and studied the way in which the disease developed and where it occurred before reaching a conclusion. Indeed, there was criticism at the time that they were far too cautious about a conclusion which had long been obvious to many paople.<lb/>
So the evidence accumulated. There is a very strong geographical correlation between outbreaks of the disease in cattle and the presence of diseased badgers, and I must tell my noble friend Lord Ferrier that, so far as I know, there is not an association between TB of badgers in Scotland and TB of cattle in Scotland. Badgers, when diseased, can excrete vast quantities of TB organisms, particularly in urine and pus, from bites or wounds, and so they can contaminate pastures. Cattle and badgers share the same pastures and the possibility of cross-infection is obvious.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, insinuated that possibly badgers get tuberculosis from cattle, a criticism I have frequently heard. However, the possibility that cattle could spread the disease to the badger or other cattle is considered to be extremely small, as cattle are regularly tested for the disease and reactors to the test and contacts are removed and slaughtered. The regularity of testing is such that in almost all cases the disease is discovered before it has developed to an infective stage, and any cattle sold prior to a test which reveals infection in the herd are immediately traced to their destination, check tested and, if necessary, slaughtered. So I really think that the possibility, so often put, that cattle give the disease to badgers is in fact not so.<lb/>
<col>306</col>
I am bound to say that I was not altogether impressed with the connection between outbreaks of tuberculosis in badgers and TB in cattle until I went to the South West and saw the detailed field work, and at that level the connection is remarkably apparent. I believe that most impartial people who study the evidence would be convinced. And in the face of such evidence, no Government could afford to run the risk of not dealing with what is clearly a reservoir of a potential killer disease. It was decided that in order to neutralise the wildlife reservoir of the disease, infected badger social groups and their contacts should be removed, only in those areas where there was an undoubted connection. Of course, it may be that in some cases badgers have been destroyed when, in the full knowledge which we should like to have but which we do not have and which we did not have, that might not have been necessary. But when the eradication of serious disease is involved, we must act quickly and sometimes harshly. So, if it was necessary to destroy badgers in those limited areas, one asks: what should be the method?<lb/>
Before deciding to use gassing as a means of badger control, the then Government undertook extensive and thorough consultations with a number of bodies: the Nature Conservancy Council, the Mammal Society, the Council for Nature, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and people eminent for their work in badgers. There was unanimous agreement among those consulted&#x2014;and they were people who were, by nature, expected to want to protect badgers&#x2014;that gassing was undoubtedly the most humane method of killing badgers. That was exactly the advice contained in the Scott-Henderson Report of the Committee on Cruelty to Wild Animals issued in June 1951. All the evidence was that gassing was the most humane method of destruction. We have always tried to operate on the smallest possible scale where badgers have to be destroyed.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Lindsey and Abingdon said Ministry officials in the field had shown themselves not open to conviction about the role of badgers and bovine TB. All I would tell him is that in every investigation on each outbreak of the disease we have examined every other possible source of infection before even considering the possibility of badger-bourne infection.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships that the total of gassing operations has not been large. A map showing the total extent of the operations has been placed in the Library of your Lordships' House, and it shows that only about 4 per cent. of the land area in the Ministry's South-West region has been covered by these operations, and this is only three-quarters of 1 per cent. of all the land in England alone&#x2014;not Great Britain; just England.<lb/>
So I really do not think that it is right for the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, to say that this is an exercise that will exterminate the badgers. It really is not. The noble Lord described the Government as being the executioner of the species. I realise how strongly he feels, but, with the greatest of respect to him, I must say that such phraseology does not measure up to the facts. The operations have been carried out in only a very limited area, and only in those places where the badgers themselves have tuberculosis, or are suspected of having it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0162"/>
<col>307</col>
I am bound to tell your Lordships that, despite the evidence about the involvement of badgers with the disease, despite the advice that was given about the humaneness of gassing, and despite the Government's statutory duty to eradicate tuberculosis from cattle, vociferous criticism still came from certain quarters.<lb/>
When my right honourable friend the Minister came into office he decided to have the whole subject re-examined, because he wanted to make sure that the policy was right. He wanted a very eminent person to do this. So he appointed the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, whose presence tonight and whose contribution to the debate was very substantial and, if I may say so with all humility, very important. The noble Lord is president of the Zoological Society of London, he was president of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society, and he is a very enminent person in this field. My right honourable friend asked him to carry out an independent review of the whole question. While that was being done, my right honourable friend stopped the gassing of new setts and in so doing permitted badgers which possibly had the disease to continue to spread it. The noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, concluded that the evidence involving the badger was overwhelming and that the only policy was to destroy badgers where they were known to be infected or in contact with infection. So gassing was resumed.<lb/>
In the course of his inquiry, the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, paid particular attention to the question of the humaneness of gassing. He discussed the issues specifically with the Consultative Panel on Badgers and Tuberculosis, and it gave him the advice that there was no more humane or efficient method of badger control than gassing. Of whom does the panel consist? It consists of representatives of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, the Royal Society for Nature Conservation, the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society, the Nature Conservancy Council, the Transport and General Workers' Union, the British Veterinary Association, the National Farmers' Union, and the Country Landowners' Association, as well as four individuals who are eminent in the fields of badger and wildlife disease studies. That is not exactly the village darts team, but rather a very eminent and respected body of people.<lb/>
Their advice was that there was no more humane or efficient method of badger control than gassing. Nevertheless despite that assurance, the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, penetrated further. He decided to recommend yet a further check, and he advised that further inquiries should be carried out; in particular, inquiry into what concentration of gas in the air of the sett would be needed to kill the badgers both quickly and humanely. The necessary work was therefore commissioned to be done by the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down, and its report has been placed in the Library of the House. In passing I would mention that the Chemical Defence Establishment based its work mainly on ferrets and involved only a very few badgers. Even in this crucial work every effort was made to avoid killing badgers, as scientific advice was to the effect that ferrets would give a very good
<col>308</col>
indication of what might happen in badgers. But of course the ironical part is that ferrets had to die in order to find out the information to protect the badgers.<lb/>
The results from the experiments suggest that, if badgers are to be killed in one minute, then 2,000 parts per million of gas is needed in the air of the sett, and that the corresponding figure for five minutes is 882 parts per million, and for 25 minutes it is 194 parts per million.<lb/>
I am hound to tell your Lordships that those results were unexpected, and they were unexpected in what was then the present state of informed opinion, which was based on investigations over a number of years into the toxicity of hydrogen cyanide to a very wide variety of animals. The results indicate that the response to cyanide of the badger is different from that of other animals. The reasons for the difference are not understood. However the results imply that there must be doubt as to whether all the badgers in a gassed sett die quickly, and therefore whether they die humanely. That is because the levels of gas in a sett are in general lower than the new experiments show to he necessary.<lb/>
I must emphasise that the results do not suggest that thousands of badgers have died painful, miserable deaths from starvation or from asphyxiation. That is the interpretation of the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, and he is perfectly entitled to it. What the results do is to cast doubt on what had been thought about the speed of death and the after-effects for those badgers which do not die. My right honourable friends the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Wales decided that they could not afford to be doubtful in such a matter, and accordingly they suspended gassing as a means of badger control on 26th June this year.<lb/>
Of course a new method of control has to be substituted for gassing, and the Ministry has resorted to live trapping. The decision was taken by my right honourable friend on the unanimous advice of the consultative panel. It agreed that it was necessary for control measures to continue, and it was satisfied that live trapping was a practicable and humane method of control. Live trapping also has the advantage that carcasses become available for scientific investigation, and the panel has urged that every effort should be employed to use this material to advance scientific knowledge of the subject&#x2014;and this we are doing.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, asked whether the use of snares would be a possibility. We are discussing with the consultative panel on badgers the question of how best to operate live trapping, and we shall discuss with the panel the use of snares. On top of all of that a very wide variety of interested organisations have been invited to give their views on methods of controlling tuberculosis in badgers. The new main method of control will be reappraised once this advice has been received and has been considered. Our methods of control will be kept under continuous appraisal.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, is worried about gassing, and he is worried that gassing has been wrong&#x2014;a policy that has been continued not just by the present Government, but by our predecessors, who of course came from the party opposite. I am bound to say to the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, that I make no apology for what we have done. We have acted, as did
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0163"/>
<col>309</col>
my right honourable friend's predecessors, to protect human health and to protect animal health. We acted in the best of faith with the information which was available to us. As can happen in any aspect of life, further research has shown up unexpected facts which have cast doubt on the basis for our actions, and even contradicted our assumptions and our knowledge. That is what research often does, and that is the purpose of further research. We can only try once more to find the best method of control in the light of the knowledge which is available to us.<lb/>
I know that this is a matter of great concern, and I would remind the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, that apart from anything which the Government may do on research, the Consultative Panel on Badgers and Tuberculosis has endorsed the Ministry's major research programme. On certain aspects of the research close liaison has been established with the Middlesex Hospital in London; the Department of Pure and Applied Biology; the Imperial College, London; the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down; the Universities of Reading, Exeter and Surrey; and the National Environment Research Council, through its Institute of Terrestrial Ecology. So there is quite a lot going on for the badger.<lb/>
I would conclude with the penetrating observations of the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman, in his report&#x2014;for which, if I may, I would add my personal and modest word of thanks and appreciation, because it was a remarkable report and easily readable. He said this:
<quote>"I am confident that the Ministy's policy does not constitute a threat to the survival of the species in the United Kingdom. Indeed, the very high prevalence of tuberculosis in the badgers of the South West seems to me to be a far greater threat, for if the disease were to take hold in badgers in other areas of the country, there is no saying what the consequences would be, not only so far as the transmission of tuberculosis to cattle is concerned but also as they relate to the survival of the badger in our country".</quote>
Then, in his recommendations the noble Lord concluded&#x2014;and I quote his words:
<quote>"the spread of tuberculosis among badgers now implies a major hazard in their survival".</quote>
Tuberculosis is bad for humans, it is bad for cattle, and it is had for badgers themselves. It is our intention to continue to eliminate this disease in the most humane and reasonable manner that is known.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01394"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member>: In recent months the Soviet Union has made four proposals for disarmament at meetings of the United Nations. We have said that we do not believe that a declaration renouncing the first use of nuclear weapons would increase international security. We have however welcomed the references to verification and on-site inspections in the Russian draft of a convention banning chemical weapons. We expect that we shall have an opportunity in the near future to make known to the Russians our views on their initiatives for a nuclear freeze, and for a Comprehensive Test Ban to be negotiated by the Committee on Disarmament.</p>

By April 1981, of some 280 <i>ex-gratia</i> awards approved, 133 totalling about &#x00A3;430,000 had been paid. The Claims Commission was without a chairman from then until September 1982, during which period no claims were considered and no awards paid. The Commission has now resumed work under a new Chairman and to date 17 further awards totalling &#x00A3;42,000 have been paid.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01415"><member>Lord Elton</member>: Section 14 of the Education Act 1981, relating to the discontinuance of maintained special schools, was brought into effect on 5th January 1982.

A national conference of voluntary bodies is to be held on 15th November. Local education authorities are known to be reviewing their arrangements for special education in the light of the requirements of the Act. Following consultations with the local authority organisations and other interested bodies, regulations and a circular of guidance are being prepared on the assessment of children under the Act. Regulations on the approval of special schools and independent schools wishing to admit children with statements of special educational need are also in preparation. It had been hoped that these regulations would be ready in time to bring the remaining provisions of the Act into force in January next. This will not be possible and, in order to give the local authorities adequate time in which to take account of the regulations, my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Secretary of State for Wales now plan to bring these provisions into force at the beginning of April 1983.</p>

<title>Military Strengths of East and West</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01433"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of the conflict in evidence on the respective military strengths of East and West, they would propose to the United Nations Security Council the appointment of a commission of unaligned experts to reach conclusions for the benefit of the START and Vienna negotiations and the United Nations Committee on Disarmament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01434"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is for the parties concerned to resolve any differences. In the START talks this means the United States and the Soviet Union. As far as the MBFR negotiations are concerned, the NATO allies have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to discuss force strengths co-operatively with the other parties. It is up to the East to show a similar willingness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01435"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that when I went on a peace mission to Moscow we had to listen for one hour to a Minister in the Kremlin trying to prove that Soviet forces were not greater than the American forces, and I retorted that we would have heard exactly the same in reverse if we had gone to the Pentagon? Does this not illustrate the problem that, while there is this difference of opinion about the strength of forces, negotiations for arms reductions are bound to be prejudiced? Would not an uncommitted examination he useful to resolve this problem?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01436"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after answering a Question of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, on Thursday, how could I possibly forget that the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, went to Moscow recently on a peace mission? All proposals for neutralising blockages should be examined carefully and on their merits, but I am afraid I am bound to say that I see this as a well-intentioned idea but a non-starter. It is very difficult to see how a group could be assembled which was both genuinely independent and sufficiently experienced to resolve an inevitably complex matter. Furthermore, it is difficult to see that the Eastern <i>bloc</i> would be any more willing to co-operate in a constructive manner with some sort of independent arbitrator. The bugbear, as I and my noble friends have said on numerous occasions, is verification. We are perfectly open on this side of the Urals as to what is going on, but would that the Eastern <i>bloc</i> were the same!</membercontribution></p>
<col>316</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01437"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minster agree that, so far as land-based warfare in Europe is concerned, the balance has shifted decisively in favour of defence with the advent of light and accurate infantry borne anti-tank weapons? Does this not mean that arguments about the exact strength of forces on either side of the Iron Curtain have become irrelevant and that we should settle down to negotiations to dismantle the theatre nuclear weapons on either side, because so far as the West is concerned they are unnecessary to repel an attack by the Warsaw Pact?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01438"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I do not think these things are irrelevant at all. What I would say, however, is that the more the numbers of conventional forces are in balance the less likelihood and the less need there would be for nuclear forces.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01439"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord has mentioned the Question I put to him the other day, may I respectfully ask him if he has not misunderstood the purport of my noble friend's Question? He is not suggesting that the function of negotiation on policy should be usurped. The proposal, as I understand it, is that a factual attempt should be made to establish what are the real nuclear strengths on both sides. Is the noble Lord not aware that my noble friend has pointed out that each side is saying that the other side is stronger, and he is suggesting an attempt to establish the facts? Would the noble Lord not agree that this is a good idea?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01440"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I do not think I misunderstood the supplementary question put by the noble Lord, Lord Brockway. What I was saying is that this is not the right way to go about resolving the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01441"><member>Lord Derwent</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what is an "unaligned expert"? Is it somebody suffering from a disability?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01442"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not quite sure, but I note that Cuba is currently at the head of the non-aligned nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01443"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord be good enough to be rather more precise in his replies to the questions put to him? Is he aware that the average man is dismayed and confused by what is said about the various disarmament conferences that are taking place&#x2014;Vienna, Geneva, the United Nations initiative? All these are taking place. Will the noble Lord recall that his noble friend Lord Trenchard&#x2014;I think it was last December&#x2014;said that the Geneva talks had got off to a good start? What the man in the street wants to know is whether they are likely to get off to a good finish. Will the noble Lord be good enough to say whether verification is the only problem? While the House realises that there is a limit to what Her Majesty's Government can do, and that the matter is primarily one between the great powers, nevertheless on several occasions it has been said from the Front Bench opposite that we do have an influence in the matter. Will the noble Lord be good enough to ensure that Her Majesty's Government now exercise their influence to ensure at least that there is more clarity in the situation than exists at present?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01444"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry if I have caused confusion to the man in the street, or indeed to noble Lords; it certainly was not my intention so to do. There are, of course, three main negotiations going on: one is the START talks which are about nuclear forces; another is the MBFR talks which are specifically about non-nuclear forces; and the third is the INF, so-called, which is a NATO allies nuclear talk.<lb/>
What I was trying to say was that START and MBFR, the two negotiations asked about in the Question on the Order Paper, were only appropriate to the parties involved: in other words, for START, the United States and Soviet Russia, and for MBFR the NATO allies and the Warsaw Pact countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01445"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that the quintessential of the submission in the original Question of my noble friend Lord Brockway is probably the most vital issue facing mankind and is too great an issue to depend on even the most erudite civil servant's brief or on fifth rate jokes? Does the noble Lord also agree that if there is one nation in the United Nations Security Council that could command support because of its experience and loyalty to that organisation, it is the United Kingdom? No proposal whatever regarding the future of mankind should be ruled out, as the noble Lord ruled out this proposal, as a non-starter. Will the noble Lord reconsider that and also seriously consider the points that I have submitted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01446"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that the United Kindom could be possibly involved in this discussion - this committee of experts - simply because by the very nature of our geographical position and our nuclear forces we are an involved party. I apologise for using the expression, "non-starter", which may or may not he a parliamentary expression, but none the less it is a symptom of what I feel in this instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01447"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is there not something to be said for probing the possibility that a committee of - non-aligned is unattractive - non-committed experts could be invited to consider this matter? There is total conflict on each side of the fence on this issue. It would be an interesting probe to see the good faith of one side or the other if this idea was launched to see what the response would be?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01448"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fully agree with the noble and learned Lord, but the great problem is to find these experts who are non-aligned. If they could be agreed by both sides as being non-aligned experts we would be a great deal further forward, I agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01449"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, has been trying to rise for some time. I think I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that the clock is running six minutes early and that we have been 10 minutes on this Question. Perhaps after the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, has asked his question and my noble friend has answered it we can go on to the next Question.</membercontribution></p>
<col>318</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01450"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in his original reply the Minister referred to the difficulty of finding nonaligned experts. Does he remember that, on the instruction of the United Nations General Assembly, the Secretary-General found 12 scientific experts to discuss the question of nuclear weapons, headed by a scientist from Sweden? Could not that example be followed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01451"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, it could well be, but, as I have sought to say throughout, these nonaligned experts must be acceptable to both sides.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Helicopter Safety: North Sea Oil Rigs</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01452">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01453"><member>Lord Balfour of Inchrye</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should first like to ask my noble friend whether he is aware of the grief which we feel, and which is shared by all sides of the House, at the accident which occurred yesterday on an oil rig in the North Sea, and that we should send a message of sympathy to the bereaved families?<lb/>
My Lords, I beg leave, to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in the interest of the operational safety of crews and passengers flying to and from North Sea oil rigs, they will enforce those provisions of the Air Navigation Order 1980 which lay down the requirement to carry a cabin attendant in all helicopters with 20 or more passengers but for fewer than 20 leave the decision to the Civil Aviation Authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01454"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, I am sure the whole House will wish to be associated with my noble friend's expression of sympathy on the tragic accident that occurred on one of the rigs in the North Sea yesterday.<lb/>
In answer to my noble friend's Question, statutory responsibility for air safety rests with the Civil Aviation Authority, and I am advised that the authority does enforce those provisions of the Air Navigation Order 1980 which require all helicopters on a flight for the purpose of public transport and carrying 20 or more passengers to include a cabin attendant in the crew. Furthermore, where it appears to be desirable to do so in the interests of safety, the authority will direct operators of helicopters carrying fewer than 20 passengers to include a cabin attendant in the crew.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01455"><member>Lord Balfour of Inchrye</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his Answer, but it does not go quite far enough. Will the noble Lord envisage a dark night in the North Sea, an emergency landing, strong seas running, a 35-knot wind, and the need for a crew member to leave his post and come aft, but a trained cabin attendant is not on hoard? Are these dispensations sufficient, even, when there are fewer than 20 passengers? Should not the authorities review them with a view to doing away with dispensations, on the ground of safety precautions? These dispensations are prepared by worthy civil servants and officials who are desk-borne and do not actually fly aircraft. Those people who do fly aircraft are determined that
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0168"/>
<col>319</col>
operational safety is increased by the carriage always of a cabin attendant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01456"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the House will agree that all your Lordships would be in very safe hands in the conditions envisaged by my noble friend, since I understand that my noble friend, in his early youth, was a pilot. Alas, your Lordships will note that the Government Front Bench is not full of pilots, but certainly there is one here today. I would not necessarily care to envisage all the circumstances which have been detailed by my noble friend, but I assure him and your Lordships that we believe that the existing provisions covering safety are more than adequate. I would stress to my noble friend the outstanding safety records of the main helicopters which are used in the North Sea. Indeed, I am sure that your Lordships will be interested to know that so far there has been no fatal accident involving the carnage of passengers to and from the rigs in the North Sea concerning this one major helicopter, the S.61, in approximately 500,000 hours of flight; whereas the average as regards the worldwide use of S.61s in these conditions is in the region of six fatal accidents so far. I understand that the North Sea has an outstanding safety record.<lb/>
I would also stress to my noble friend and the House that all operations are carried out according to the operations manuals agreed by representatives of pilots and the department. I hope that my noble friend and the House will not believe that they are all deskhound&#x2014;most of them are very active. Moreover, at all times the safety of the aircraft and the passengers is the sole responsibility of the pilot.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Drugs: Price Differences</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01457">2.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01458"><member>Baroness Dudley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government why some drugs which are sold to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom can be purchased for under one-quarter of the price in other countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01459"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, such large differences in price are exceptional. I do accept that some medicines in some countries are cheaper than they are here. But others are more expensive. The differences are due to different economic and fiscal policies, local price control schemes, exchange rate fluctuations, effectiveness of patent protection, and market forces. Price differences from country to country are not of course peculiar to medicines. On the whole the prices of medicines in this country compare well with those in Western Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01460"><member>Baroness Dudley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not true that in some cases they are 10 times more expensive here than they are there? If we could do something about that, would it not save the National Health Service &#x00A3;80 million a year?</membercontribution></p>
<col>320</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01461"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend may be referring to a case that attracted some publicity recently&#x2014;namely, the case of a drug called Zyloric which is apparently available in Spain at about a quarter of the price at which it is available in this country. It was a special case. That drug has been available in Spain for about 12 years and it was introduced into that country in 1970, at which time it was more expensive in Spain than it was here. But since that time price controls in Spain have prevented any price increases apart from two recent ones, and the sale of that drug in that country is now unprofitable for the manufacturer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01462"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the question of the cost of drugs is one that needs thorough investigation so far as the Health Service is concerned, because it is a field where there could be considerable savings without affecting patient care? Secondly, is the noble Lord aware that I can give some slight evidence to support the noble Baroness? I use a proprietary medicine occasionally, and recently in Malta I bought a small tube for the equivalent of 30p; it is an item manufactured in Great Britain and it costs me in the United Kingdom 59p.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01463"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to hear about the noble Lord's unfortunate experience, but our own method of controlling price and profit levels is, of course, the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme. It does not control the price of individual drugs which are fixed by companies, but it ensures that excessive profits are not made. British pharmaceutical companies make a very large contribution to our exports&#x2014;the balance of payments in our favour in pharmaceuticals is about &#x00A3;600 million per annum&#x2014;they invest heavily in research and development and employ about 70,000 people. It is important that they should be given a proper return on their investment, and, of course, we take these benefits into account in operating the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01464"><member>Lord Wells-Pestell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble Lord about the basis of the comparison upon which he states that the prices of drugs here compare favourably with those in western countries. Is he comparing drug with drug, or is he taking an average?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01465"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am looking at the cost of drugs right across the spectrum. Some drugs in this country are more expensive than they are elsewhere; some drugs in this country are less expensive than they are elsewhere. I was taking a broad look at the position when I made the general assertion which I did just now. Perhaps I should add that, of course, in some of the countries of Europe&#x2014;not all of them&#x2014;they do not have the large pharmaceutical manufacturing industry which we have in this country and we have to take the interests of that industry into account when operating our scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01466"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, should we not also bear in mind that pirating drugs without spending any money on research at all is very simple in many cases and that, as my noble friend indicated in his second reply, most pharmaceutical companies spend up to 10 per cent. of their annual sales on research, which is the only source of new products?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0169"/>
<col>321</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01467"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is quite right that the source of funds for research purposes in the pharmaceutical companies is from the margins they make from the sales of their products. It is also the case that, without the necessary controls upon the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals, one cannot he certain where the drugs come from, whether they are counterfeit, whether they are contaminated or, indeed, whether they are the product they say they are.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01468"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble Lord whether he would be prepared to examine the possibility of perhaps establishing a guidance council from the British Pharmaceutical Society to aid the Government and the National Health Service in such matters as we have been discussing this afternoon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01469"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has put his finger on what I believe is a very important point. I wonder whether he has seen the work done by Professor Turner at Bart's Hospital where he has prepared what is called a formulary to give advice to doctors and others about the best and most economical drugs to prescribe in any particular case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01470"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord like to consider the question that arose over agricultural chemicals, which I think has some bearing on the question of the noble Baroness? When we went abroad to buy these chemicals we found that sometimes we could buy them at a price up to 50 per cent. less than the price at which they were sold in this country. Since then the price in this country has been brought down by 20 per cent., 30 per cent., or 40 per cent. in many cases. If the same happened with drugs, we would find them cheaper in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01471"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect that goes slightly wide of the Question on the Order Paper, but, speaking from personal experience as regards my own cat which had to go to the vet recently, we found it very expensive.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NHS and Personal Social Services</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01472">2.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01473"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the total expenditure on health and personal social services represents an increase in real terms compared with 1978&#x2013;79.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01474"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, In 1978&#x2013;79 total Goverment expenditure on the National Health Service in England was &#x00A3;61 billion. Last year we spent over &#x00A3;11 billion. This represents growth in services of about 5 per cent. in real terms and there will be further growth this year. Over the same period net current expenditure on personal social services grew by some 7 per cent. in real terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01475"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in thanking the Minister for that reassuring reply, may I ask him to
<col>322</col>
confirm that, under this Government, more is being spent in real terms on the National Health Service than in any year of the previous Labour Government or, indeed, of any previous Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01476"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. If I may underline what I said just now, we are spending more now in real terms on the National Health Service than ever before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01477"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following the very helpful supplementary question to the Government by the noble Baroness, which almost reminded me of a planted question, I should like to ask the noble Lord what "real terms" means? "Real terms" to me means an expansion of services, yet the Government say that they are spending more and the services are getting less and less. The noble Lord should have a look at the South-East Metropolitan Regional Health Authority's proposals to reduce services by millions, and the proposals of other metropolitan authorities as well. So "real terms" in the sense that we regard it is a meaningless term when the Government use it in the way in which the noble Lord has used it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01478"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no region in the country which, in real terms, is suffering a cut in the funds which we are making available to it. By "real terms", I mean that we are providing more money than just the increase in inflation would necessarily require. That is what I mean by "real terms", and the increase in real terms over the time during which we have been in office is about 5 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01479"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend give comparable figures for Scotland? Does he have them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01480"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that I have been asked that question before in your Lordships' House and I do not think that I have been able to give a satisfactory reply. The figures for Scotland are separately collated. I do not have them in front of me, but I shall write to my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01481"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although the noble Lord has given us total figures, will he not agree that there are more old people and, sadly, very many more unemployed people, and that, therefore, the benefit per head is, if anything, reduced, especially in view of the Government's failure to reinstate the 5 per cent. abatement, which was imposed on benefits in 1980?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01482"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure whether the question of unemployed people is particularly relevant, but I take the point about the question of elderly people. Certainly in some areas, there are more elderly people as a percentage of the population than there were before, and the distributions of funds that we make take that into account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01483"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord say by what percentage the real value must increase in order to provide the same services for the increasing number of people? Can he say how much the increase per annum must be in order for us to stay where we are?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0170"/>
<col>323</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01484"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the demographic changes, as they are called in the jargon of health service economics, are taken into account in the allocation of resources to the various regions. As for the increase in elderly people, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, referred and which I think is at the back of the mind of the noble Lord. I believe that would account for about 2&#x00BD; per cent. of the 5 per cent. increase in real allocations to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01485"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for the benefit of the many of us on all sides of this House who care deeply about conditions of work for nurses, will my noble friend confirm that 1980 to 1981 saw a reduction in the working week from 40 hours to 37&#x00BD; hours for nurses and midwives in normal circumstances, giving scope for earning more for unsocial hours?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01486"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is right when she refers to the reduction in the nurses' working week, which took place about the time she mentioned. That was, of course, one of the reasons, but not the only reason, why the number of staff in the health service&#x2014;and particularly of nurses&#x2014;has increased since that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01487"><member>Lord Wells-Pestell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that there are considerably more doctors unemployed now than there were three years ago?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01488"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have seen figures which purport that, but there is no shortage of doctors in the health service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01489"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the question of unemployment that was raised by my noble friend Lady Jeger is, of course, very relevant to the items that he has been quoting? Is it not a fact that, owing to increased unemployment and generally to the increased poverty and deprivation which has now come upon us since the Government have been in office, the demands on the social services have become much greater and are much greater than the percentage increase of the expenditure in real terms, to which the noble Lord referred?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01490"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure that the noble Lord is right in that. I was replying earlier to the particular question of the health service and the relation of unemployed people to demands on the social services. But, of course, I agree that unemployed people very often find themselves in need of what the social services can provide. That is why we have seen an increase in the demands upon the social services and why we have responded to that increase with increased funds is real terms of about 7 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01491"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that what matters to the ordinary patient is not the amount of money that is spent on the National Health Service, but the ease with which he can get access to treatment and the length of time it takes him to get an out-patient consultation or to have an operation for a condition which is uncomfortable or painful, such as hernia or varicose veins? Can the noble Lord say whether the increase in the level of resources, which he
<col>324</col>
say has been provided, has led to a reduction or an increase in the length of time that people wait for treatment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01492"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am happy to say that the lengths of the waiting lists prior to the commencement of the present industrial action have been significantly reduced since we came to office. Unhappily, it is the case that since the recent industrial action started, the lists have lengthened again, but that, of course, is one of the inevitable consequences of this action.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Code of Guidance Concerning Sites of Special Scientific Interest</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01497">3.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01498"><member>The Earl of Avon</member> rose to move, That the Code of Guidance laid before the House on 5th July be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01499">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I beg to move that the Code of Guidance for sites of special scientific interest, a copy of which was laid before this House on 5th July, be approved. The code is the joint responsibility of my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Scotland and for Wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It has been prepared in accordance with Section 33 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is intended to assist all those who exercise functions under Sections 28 to 32 of the Act or who are affected by the exercise of those functions. The code will apply to England, Scotland and Wales, and will be published in Welsh as well as in English.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01500">The idea of publishing such a code of practice, conduct or guidance, as it was variously called, first arose at a stage during the debates on the Wildlife and Countryside Bill when it was envisaged that notification by landowners of intended operations should he voluntary. The code was to make it clear exactly what sort of co-operation was desired.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01501">As a result of later changes in the Bill, including obligations on landowners, the function of the code was extended to include, first, an explanation of the various statutory provisions relating to SSSIs embodied in the Act as well as giving guidance on procedures; secondly, on the way in which voluntary co-operation would still be very valuable over and above compliance with the legal obligations: and, thirdly, on the importance of conservation of special habitats. The consultation draft of the code was prepared in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy Council, the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners' Association and Timber Growers (Great Britain) Limited, and perhaps I may take this opportunity to repeat the expression of the Government's gratitude, which was made by my honourable friend in another place last week, to these from outside Government who gave their time so readily in putting the document together. The public consultation exercise on the basis of this draft took place from February to April this year. About 150 organisations were consulted and as a result of it we received a number of helpful and constructive suggestions which enabled us to produce the improved text now before the House, which was finally laid on 5th July. The Government regret that pressure of other
<col>326</col>
parliamentary business prevented this debate from taking place before the summer Recess as we had originally hoped.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01502">The content of the code follows closely the indication given during the Committee debates on the Wildlife and Countryside Bill, particularly by my right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government and Environmental Services. He then said:
<quote>"The code will govern procedure. It will stress the importance of SSSIs and the need for conservation and outline the consultation procedures that owners and occupiers will be urged to respect&#x2026;. The code would govern NCC's duty to notify sites of special scientific interest, the ways in which sites of special scientific interest are selected, the relationship between the code and existing consultation procedures, agricultural and forestry activities, agricultural and horticultural capital grant schemes, forestry grants, stressing the presumption that grants are put at risk if prior consultation and agreement with the NCC is not reached before work is started, and the financial advantage that might accrue from SSSI ownership and management."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01503">The result is, I am afraid, not easy reading. While we have done our best to avoid unnecessary complexity, the inescapable fact is that the statutory provisions in the Act and the various related grant arrangements are themselves complex and it was essential to explain them comprehensively. I believe that the text we now have is as concise and as straightforward as is consistent with this requirement, and I trust that all those who use it will find that the effort of concentration it will call for is repaid by a clear understanding of the role they are expected to play.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01504">The code begins by emphasising the importance of SSSIs and the fact that their conservation and proper management is vital to the maintenance of Britain's diverse wildlife. Government departments have been specifically mentioned at this point because the private sector co-operation with the voluntary spirit which is essential to the proper working of the SSSI provisions in the Act cannot be expected if Government do not set the example.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01505">The code goes on to set out the procedure by which the NCC notifies SSSIs to all those concerned. It deals separately with the provisions which apply to SSSIs already in existence before the passing of the Act and those which apply to "new" SSSIs. SSSIs notified before the passing of the Act&#x2014;of which there are about 4,000&#x2014;remain extant, but as a basis for the new requirements on notification by owners and occupiers of intended operations the NCC is now required to inform every owner and occupier of the whole or a part of an SSSI of its location, the nature of its scientific interest and the operations which could cause damage to it and may not, therefore, be carried out without prior notice. This exercise of re-notification has already begun but it involves a great deal of detailed work and will take some time to complete. I understand that most notifications should be made during the course of this financial year, but in some cases where survey work cannot be carried out before the spring, it will take somewhat longer. The code contains advice to owners and occupiers on how to proceed in the period before they receive formal notification.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01506">In the case of new SSSIs, the Act requires the NCC to give notice of its intention to notify a site and to consider any representations or objections before making a final decision. This is the essential difference between "old" and "new" SSSIs. The code tells
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0172"/>
<col>327</col>
owners and occupiers that they should not carry out any potentially damaging operation during the proposal period without consulting the NCC.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01507">The code then describes how the NCC will go about listing potentially damaging operations, the registration of SSSIs as a land charge and the procedures to be adopted where owners and occupiers cannot be traced and when SSSI status is to be removed. A separate paragraph is devoted to statutory undertakers, whom the NCC will inform of all SSSI details that may concern their operations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01508">Once the NCC has notified an owner or occupier of the particulars of a site, he is then obliged to consult the council if he wishes to carry out any operation that has been specified in the notification. Section III of the code sets out the procedures for such consultation and also those which apply when farm capital grant or forestry grant is to be claimed. The farm capital grant procedures dovetail with the arrangements which have been successfully operated by the agriculture departments since October 1980 and which have resulted in a large number of cases being satisfactorily resolved at the local level without the need for formal objection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01509">Two aspects of this part of the code deserve special mention. First, the Act specifies, in Section 32, that the NCC must offer to enter into a management agreement where agricultural grants made under Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970 are refused in consequence of their objection. The point to be made on this is that there are other similar farm capital grants (for example, under EEC arrangements) not covered by that Act; and that because the essential features of grant applications to which there is a conservation objection are the same whatever type of grant is involved, the NCC have agreed that they will offer a management agreement where any kind of farm capital grant is refused in consequence of their objection. The same applies to crofting grants and, as my noble friend Lord Mansfield explained to the House last Wednesday, to grants that may be applied for under the integrated development programme for the Western Isles of Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01510">Secondly, the procedures reflect a greater involvement for the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) in the process, which is in line with their commitment to further conservation. The ADAS service has regular contacts with farmers, whose confidence it enjoys, and its co-operation with the NCC will he of very great assistance. In forestry cases also, although under no legal obligation to do so, the NCC has said that it will normally offer to enter into a management agreement where forestry grant and/or felling permission is refused on conservation grounds. The next section of the code, on information helpful to the NCC, has been included to encourage owners and occupiers to assist in the NCC's need to have up-to-date information on the scientific interest of a site, on ownership details or on operations undertaken by third parties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01511">Section 5 deals with conservation options. It explains the purpose of management agreements and the circumstances in which the NCC will offer them. The Act also requires Ministers to prepare financial guidelines on which the compensation provided by management agreements must be based in certain
<col>328</col>
circumstances. A public consultation exercise has been undertaken on a draft of these financial guidelines. The closing date for receipt of comments was last Friday. We have received a number of important comments, which we shall need to consider carefully. However, we recognise the need to finalise the guidelines as speedily as possible. When this has been done Sections 32 and 41 of the Act will be brought into force. For any management agreements that may be made in the period before the guidelines are settled the NCC is including appropriate provision for the financial terms to be reviewed when the final version is available.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01512">The last section of the code deals with the provisions for special protection for certain areas. Section 29 of the Act provides in specified circumstances for my right honourable friend to make orders, which we are calling Nature Conservation Orders. These orders, which come into operation immediately they are made, prolong the period during which specified operations may not be carried out without the consent of the NCC. The House will be interested to know that my right honourable friend has just made the first such order, on the recommendation of the Nature Conservancy Council, to safeguard a heathland SSSI at Baddesley Common in Hampshire, which contains a unique combination of plants and related fauna. The code explains the procedures related to such orders and to the compensation to which they may give rise. It also covers the circumstances in which compulsory purchase may be used&#x2014;very much a last resort&#x2014;and the matter of offences and penalties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01513">That then, in brief, is what the code is about. It is a comprehensive procedural guide to that part of the Wildlife and Countryside Act which deals with SSSIs, to the various associated administrative processes and to the role for voluntary co-operation. Once it is approved the code will be printed and distributed free to all owners and occupiers of SSSIs by the NCC as part of their re-notification exercise. It will also be available through HMSO at a price of about &#x00A3;2.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01514">Perhaps I may at this point refer to a matter which goes beyond the text of the code, but which is doubtless in the minds of many noble Lords today. That is the question of the resources, both of money and of staff, which are required by the NCC to ensure that its functions under the new Act and under the code are carried out. These are not easy questions. We live in times when it is imperative to scrutinise very closely all claims on the public purse and to ensure the maximum economy and efficiency in the use of resources. Decisions as to future years remain to be made and I cannot anticipate them today. Nevertheless, there are a few comments which it may be useful for me to make.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01515">First, reference has often been made to a figure of &#x00A3;600,000 which is said to have been allocated to the NCC this year for the consequences of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. That is rather misleading. It is true that this year's allocation to the NCC, at &#x00A3;11&#x00BC; million, was some &#x00A3;600,000 more than last year's in real terms. But the Government have not said that &#x00A3;600,000 is the maximum that can be spent by the NCC on matters arising from the Act. It is up to the council to deploy its total allocation as it thinks best; and it is worth noting that it already had an ongoing programme of site protection.</p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0173"/>
<col>329</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01516">The extent of financial commitments arising from the Act is notably difficult to predict. Reference has been made to the fact that 8,700 hectares of SSSIs were damaged in 1980&#x2014;about half of that was agricultural&#x2014;but there are indications that the situation has greatly improved. Much of what was done was doubtless due to ignorance, which it is the purpose of the Act and of this code to remove. Nevertheless, the best estimates possible must be made and these estimates and all available evidence will be carefully considered by my right honourable friend when he determines the council's allocation for the coming year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01517">The staff of the NCC is also heavily involved in implementing the Act. In that connection I should like to remove the impression, which seems to have gained some currency, that the recently announced Rayner review of the NCC is aimed at cutting its staff. The terms of reference require the staff needs of the NCC to be examined but they in no way prejudge whether the number of staff should be cut or increased. The review is in fact aimed at increasing efficiency and it is particularly apposite at this time that such a review should be made to ensure that the staff resources of the council are used to the best possible effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01518">To conclude, and to come back to the Code of Guidance, the willingness of owners and occupiers of SSSIs to operate the voluntary arrangements set out in the code, as well as to comply with the legal obligations which it explains, is critical to the protection of our national heritage of wildlife sites. I am sure that most of those who have such a site on their land and who are clearly told of its importance will feel privileged and will be readily disposed to co-operate in preserving it from harm. Failure to do so, whether deliberately or by inadvertence will, I hope, be rare and should certainly be minimised by the code, which I commend to the House, as well as to all those whom it will concern. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01519">Moved, That the Code of Guidance laid before the House on 5th July be approved.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Avon</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01520">3.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01521"><member>Lord Melchett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House is grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Avon, for his explanation of the code and its provision&#x2014;somewhat shorter and clearer than the code itself, I think it is fair to say&#x2014;and I wish to raise a number of points with him, in particular the question of resources, which he mentioned in some detail. At the outset I would like to comment briefly on the Wildlife and Countryside Act itself. Your Lordships will not need reminding, any more than the Minister will, that it was a controversial measure; it was controversial when we debated it in this House at great length and it is continuing to be so now that it is passed into law. I have been concerned, as I am sure some other noble Lords have, about attempts, as I see them, to some extent to rewrite the history of the Act.<lb/>
It is common for Ministers, once they leave office, to rewrite the history of what they did when they were in office, and I am sure all of us are guilty of that. But it seems a little soon to start rewriting the history of this Act. By "rewriting its history" what I mean is that the Government and some other interest groups have been
<col>330</col>
attempting to say that, because it was so thoroughly debated&#x2014;because 1,200 amendments to it were tabled in your Lordships' House and because it took so long to go through Parliament&#x2014;therefore it is a thoroughly agreed measure and nobody should subject it to any further criticism. In fact, of course, the reverse is the case. It was subject to so many amendments, it took so long to go through Parliament and it was changed to such a great extent in both Houses, because there was so much all-party disagreement to its provisions; and that all-party opposition to the measure's provisions continued right up to the very last votes in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I suggest that many of the criticisms&#x2014;I shall touch on a few of them&#x2014;that were made in all parts of the House when the measure was going through are already proving amply justified. It is therefore unfortunate, to say the least, that people should attempt, so soon after that very controversial series of debates, to suggest that the Act should be considered as being quite beyond and above party controversy simply because it is the law of the land and that those who hold different views about what provisions are needed to protect wildlife sites, as certainly noble Lords on this side do, should in some way not express that opinion. Indeed, it has even been suggested that to express the opinion that greater controls are needed&#x2014;as the Labour Party believes; we have said in our party policy that greater controls are necessary to protect wildlife sites&#x2014;in some way puts the whole Act in jeopardy. That seems almost to amount to saying that any other political party which expresses a contrary view to the Government, just by expressing that view, will wreck the Government's legislation. If their legislation is that fragile, it is hardly worth having. A number of us&#x2014;as I say, certainly in the Labour Party&#x2014;believe that quite different legislation is needed to protect the countryside heritage, and we shall continue to press to see that legislation implemented.<lb/>
Having said that, we welcome the arrival of this voluntary code. As the Minister himself suggested, it is a little legalistic and rather late, which we very much regret, and it is certainly not firm enough in places. But I hope very much that the House will approve it today.<lb/>
Like the voluntary conservation organisations, who also opposed many of the provisions in the Act when it was proceeding through Parliament, the Opposition want the code of practice to work. But whether or not it does is largely in the Governments's hands, because the key to the success of the Government's system, although it is referred to by the Government&#x2014;the noble Earl used the word several times&#x2014;as a voluntary system, is that it is in fact a system based on the payment of large sums of money. It is voluntary in the sense that at the end of the day, unless the Nature Conservancy Council uses its powers of compulsory purchase&#x2014;which it has had for a great many years, since well before the Act&#x2014;a landowner or farmer is still free to destroy a site of special scientific interest. But if the "voluntary" system works, they will be given very expensive payments worked out by a very complicated system, to which the noble Earl referred in relation to the financial guidelines which are still under consideration. I hope he will impress on all his colleagues in the Government who are involved in the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0174"/>
<col>331</col>
mattter the importance of getting those guidelines completed and finalised in the very near future.<lb/>
Before returning to the question of resources, I wish to consider one other problem which is covered by the code and which the Minister also touched on, and that is the question of new sites of special scientific interest where the Wildlife and Countryside Act introduced the new procedure of a three months' consultation or warning period, as it has been called, and owners and occupiers are given a notice by the NCC that they intend to designate their land as an SSSI. In another place the Minister, at column 303 on 19th October, said that the code "urged" owners and occupiers not to carry out any potentially damaging operation during the proposal period. In fact, the code is a great deal weaker than that, and paragraph 7 of it says:
<quote>"Owners and occupiers who have received notice of a proposed notification should not, in advance of the NCC's final decision, carry out any operation specified in it without consulting the NCC".</quote>
"Should not" does not seem to me to amount to a very strong urging. The code adds insult to injury by at least leaving the door open for somebody actually receiving a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture after destroying a proposed SSSI during this three-month period, and it seems to me to he a scandal that the code does not make it perfectly clear that no grant aid will be available if a site is destroyed during this three-month period. As some noble Lords will remember, this matter was raised in the debates on the Act. In another place the Minister, Mr. King, spoke on 13th July last year, at column 922, to an amendment which attempted to close the loophole by ensuring that in the three-month consultation period operations on the site were banned, so that things were frozen. He said that the amendment,<lb/>
<quote>"seeks to prevent a situation whereby the moment the NCC even hints that it is thinking of having an SSSI, out come the bulldozers and the drainage equipment and away we go".</quote>
The Minister went on:
<quote>"there is no evidence that immediately any farmer or landowner is approached his worst instincts are aroused".</quote>
I think that it is worth looking at what has actually happened at a number of sites since July last year. I refer first to West Sedgemoor, in Somerset, an area of a proposed SSSI which has received considerable publicity, and which a number of noble Lords, including some who are to speak today, have visited and taken a personal interest in. In the spring of this year under the new procedures in the Act the NCC notified the area as a proposed SSSI, and the three months' consultation period came into effect. Well, contrary to what the Minister said would not happen, out did come the drainage equipment, and away they went. At least away went three landowners, who started a damaging pump drainage scheme, affecting 40 to 50 acres in the heart of the moor. It was not illegal, because of the loophole. Nevertheless away they went.<lb/>
Next, I refer to a site in Dyfed, in Wales. A valley mire with old grazing meadows, rich in wild flowers, including orchids, was identified by the NCC before the Wildlife and Countryside Act came into force, but notification awaited the new procedures under the Act. The owner of the land had actually agreed with the NCC that it should be a SSSI. But unfortunately he died, and his heirs called in the Farmers' Union of
<col>332</col>
Wales. Quite sensibly, a meeting was arranged between the various parties, including the Farmers' Union of Wales and the NCC. However, the Farmers' Union of Wales subsequently cancelled the meeting. Contrary to the Minister's assurances, somebody's worst instincts had in fact become thoroughly aroused, because the NCC discovered that most of the 26-acre site had been ploughed and harrowed.<lb/>
Another site, also in Wales, comprising an area of acid heath and marsh, was notified, using the new procedures, on 31st July this year, without any consultation. Again during the three-month warning period the landowner burnt and rotivated an area of three to four acres. That was at the end of August, and just before the three-month consultation period had elapsed.<lb/>
It may be that the noble Earl can reassure me that those three cases are simply 0.1 per cent of all the new SSSIs notified under the Act, that I am talking about the tip of an iceberg, and that in fact the vast majority of new SSSIs have gone through without any problems of this kind arising. In fact I think the reverse is the case, and the problem has arisen on nearly all the new SSSIs that have been notified. It really is a scandal: and I should like to give your Lordships an example of some of the "nearly missed" cases. There is a proposed SSSI which was on the market in Shropshire&#x2014;an important area&#x2014;and after the local county naturalists' trust had managed to buy it, it was discovered that a solicitor, acting for another potential owner, apparently had given them legal advice that the sensible thing to do, if they managed to buy it&#x2014;as they could well have done&#x2014;would be to spray off the whole area immediately to avoid what were called complications regarding SSSI status.<lb/>
It is clear to me and, after what I have said. I hope to the noble Earl and to your Lordships generally, that an amending Bill is needed to close this loophole. It is an absurdity, and it will bring the procedures under the Act into total disrepute if the NCC finds itself unable to create any new SSSIs without sites being destroyed in the three-month period. I really think it regrettable that the Minister should have been quite so ready 12 months ago to dismiss as a fantasy what in fact has since happened all too frequently.<lb/>
Turning to the question of finance and staff for the NCC, I move into an area&#x2014;if I have not already been in one&#x2014;where there is very widespread agreement. I dare say that the NFU has provided a number of your Lordships with a brief, and the union as well as a number of conservation organisations all agree that the NCC is seriously under-financed and needs more money if the Wildlife and Countryside Act is to have any chance of working.<lb/>
I should like to give your Lordships an example of what I have in mind. The noble Earl mentioned the &#x00A3;600,000 that the Nature Conservancy Council received for the current financial year. I do not think that he mentioned that the NCC actually asked for an additional sum of between &#x00A3;950,000 and &#x00A3;1,130,000. It received from the Government &#x00A3;600,000&#x2014;around half of the maximum extra that it had asked for. The noble Earl says that that is not the total sum that the NCC can spend on the Act. I assume he means that it can switch resources from other operations to which it does not have to give the same kind of priority. It is of course also true that the Wildlife and Countryside Act
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0175"/>
<col>333</col>
does not give the NCC new duties only so far as SSSIs are concerned. Your Lordships had a particular interest in marine nature reserves, which exist only due to a vote moved by, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, which put into the Bill a provision, which was then accepted somewhat reluctantly by the Government in another place, that there should be such things as marine nature reserves.<lb/>
The other day I discovered that the NCC is unable to finance a survey to find out where along areas of the coast there should be marine nature reserves, and without such a survey there is really no chance of our having a sensible network of marine nature reserves. A few might be created in sites that are already well known. But the NCC is actually unable to start such a survey for two years. The noble Earl may think that the NCC has swilling around plenty of money, which it can simply transfer from one place to another, but here is a new statutory obligation for which it cannot do the basic survey work for a further two years. To suggest that there is lots of money for use on the Wildlife and Countryside Bill is, frankly, a fantasy.<lb/>
An extra &#x00A3;600,000 might sound quite a lot. But there is one voluntary agreement, a solitary one, which covers one quarter of one SSSI in the North Kent marshes, and that will cost one-sixth of the &#x00A3;600,000&#x2013;4100,000 a year. So to save a quarter of one SSSI will take a sixth of the total extra income that the NCC has been given this year.<lb/>
The NCC staff has already been cut by about 10 per cent. in the last two to three years. It has lost 55 members of staff, and now a review is being conducted by Sir Derek Rayner. The noble Earl introduced the interesting concept which I must say had not previously struck me, that Sir Derek Rayner had been appointed by the Prime Minister to go around lavishly distributing new civil servants, to increase numbers of staff available to quangos such as the NCC in order to carry out their tasks. I have really no evidence whatsoever of that. As I understand it, Sir Derek Rayner has been appointed by the Prime Minister to cut staff, and every review that he has conducted has had that consequence. If the noble Earl can point to precedents where Sir Derek has actually substantially increased the staff of quangos, I am sure that the NCC, among others, would be very relieved to hear of it. But that really is stretching a point, if the noble Earl does not mind my saying so. Sir Derek Rayner's review team has been set up to cut staff, and that is what it is going into the NCC to do.<lb/>
For the noble Earl to say, "Well, the terms of reference leave it open", really is disingenuous, because he knows as well as I do that the terms of reference leave it open due only to an extremely stiff fight put up by the NCC and its chairman, to insist that the terms of reference were changed from the original ones which the Government intended to impose. From the original terms of reference imposed by the Government, it is clear that they had absolutely no intention of the review doing anything other than cut staff, and I hope that the noble Earl will have the honesty to admit that when he replies to the debate.<lb/>
In another place the Minister, in discussing the Rayner review, said, again on 19th October, as reported at col. 333 of the <i>Official Report:</i>
<col>334</col>
<quote>"The NCC's morale and determination to implement urgently and competently the vital work for our countryside and inheritage is impressive".</quote>
Morale in the NCC is at rock bottom as a result of the Government's decision to institute this Rayner review, and that is not surprising. They have lost 10 per cent. of their staff in the last couple of years: they have had a host anew obligations and duties placed upon them: and now they are obviously going to lose more staff. For a Government Minister to suggest that the morale is good is an absurdity, and it just shows, if the Government believe that, how out of touch with the NCC they really are.<lb/>
The fact of the matter is that the NCC already have no money left this year, and they are already desperately short of staff where it is most important. They have no money left for land purchase. There are a number of cases where voluntary bodies need to buy land which has come on the market, sites of special scientific interest, because of the programme of renotification. The county naturalist trusts need to buy, to save them, 10 sites which have a total value of about &#x00A3;200,000. The RSPB has been offered between about 100 and 150 acres in West Sedgemoor, which I mentioned earlier. Again, the total cost might he around &#x00A3;200,000. In both these cases the Nature Conservancy Council, as I understand it, is unable to offer grant aid to the voluntary movement to help them make these purchases because the NCC has run out of money for land purchase&#x2014;and that halfway through the current financial year.<lb/>
For the noble Earl to say that he cannot give any commitment for next year is all very well, but what are the Government going to do about this year? The NCC are already out of money, and they are also out of staff in many areas, as I have said. They do not have people on the ground in a number of counties&#x2014;in Warwickshire and Cheshire (in Cheshire, the nearest member of staff, an assistant regional officer, is in Shrewsbury). Lincolnshire, Kent and Norfolk are all short of assistant regional officers. These are the people without whom, on the ground, the Nature Conservancy Council have no chance of making personal contact with farmers and landowners, and without that personal contact everybody agrees&#x2014;the NFU have confirmed this, and I think quite rightly&#x2014;the Wildlife and Countryside Act, the procedures in the voluntary code and so on have really no chance whatsoever of working.<lb/>
It is not just that the NCC cannot do the job on marine nature reserves, that they have run out of money for land purchase and that they are desperately short of staff on the ground. One of the most important aspects of the Wildlife and Countryside Act was the renotification of SSSIs: that everyone would be told again that they had an SSSI on their land, and they would be given details of operations which might damage it. We were assured in Parliament that this would be done quickly, within 12 months of the Act becoming law, and, obviously, this was a major factor in the debates that we had and the way that the votes went, indeed, on different amendments. If everyone was going to he renotified reasonably quickly and given the information, one of the criticisms, which came particularly from the farming and landowning side, would be answered.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0176"/>
<col>335</col>
Far from that being the case, the NCC are actually going to take 2&#x00BD; years to renotify these sites. The noble Earl said that most of them were going to be renotified in this financial year. That is six months longer than we were told would be the case; and "most of them", as I understand it, is actually 60 per cent.&#x2014;slightly over half. Forty per cent. will not be renotified in this financial year; and at current estimates&#x2014;and estimates have already proved to be grossly over-optimistic&#x2014;the last of them will not be renotified until March 1984. The Minister in another place appeared to contradict this when it was raised by one of his own supporters, Sir Hector Monro, and I hope the noble Earl will be able to correct what seems to me to be a rather misleading impression and confirm that with the current numbers of staff and resources that the NCC have renotification will in fact not be completed until March 1984.<lb/>
There was a unanimous view expressed in another place that the NCC needed more resources, both in staff and in cash, to make this work, and I very much hope that that will he the unanimous view of those of your Lordships who are going to speak today. I hope that, even if the noble Earl cannot this afternoon commit his department or the Treasury to more money, the Government will go away with a very clear message that unless they do come up with the goods nobody can seriously expect their legislation to work in the way that they hope it will.</membercontribution></p>

The bodies which are mainly concerned with nature conservation in this country&#x2014;and at this stage I think I ought to emphasise that when we are talking about such bodies we are not just talking about the organisations which organise lobbies here, which issue pieces of paper and which bombard us with letters&#x2014;in fact represent a very large proportion of the population of this country. Indeed, the membership of some of these bodies is quite enormous in itself; but the people of this country as a whole, I am quite sure, are on the side of the efforts to try to retain the beauty of our countryside and the treasures of nature which otherwise might disappear. One of the troubles that we face is that in so many cases we are dealing with problems which, if there is abuse by the people who are in charge of the countryside, will lead not just to damage but, in fact, to permanent harm. Damage is done to these sites which cannot be put into reverse, and day by day and year by year we lose some of the glories of our countryside.<lb/>
There seems to be fairly general agreement about the problems which will arise from the Act and, therefore, to a certain extent, from the code of practice. There is first of all the loophole whereby owners and occupiers can, if they so wish, damage a site proposed as a new SSSI during the three-month
<col>336</col>
consultation period without committing an offence. We have had a number of examples of such sites, some of them given by the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, and I do not propose to go over them. I would merely say that there have been a sufficient number of them to show that any complacency about this field has no place at all.<lb/>
Then, secondly, there is the problem of whether Section 29 can be used to deal with the loophole I have just mentioned. Section 29, dealing with the nature conservancy orders, is something for which we must be very grateful; and it is very timely for today's debate that only in the last few days, as the noble Earl, Lord Avon, said, there has been a Section 29 order put on Baddesley Common. But I think we need to know&#x2014;and here we seek an assurance from the noble Earl which I hope he will he able to give us at the end of this debate&#x2014;that Section 29 orders will be used promptly in a wide variety of situations; that is, not merely in the case of the so-called super sites, but anywhere where there obviously appears to be a real threat to an SSSI.<lb/>
Thirdly, there is the matter of further funds for the Nature Conservancy Council, which the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, went into in some detail. The NCC, as he made clear, is short of staff; and, indeeed, it has had to employ expensive contract staff over the last few months in order to supplement numbers. There is no real saving in the ceiling which is at the moment applying to the staff which the NCC can employ. The additional work which they are being given by this Act and by this code of practice will mean a hump of visits to 13,000 owners and occupiers over the next year or so. Then, after that, there is a grey area over the next few years when they start to receive responses to the notifications of changes on SSSIs.<lb/>
The only people qualified to deal with these are the land agents, of whom there are about a dozen at the moment, which figure is already under strength. The NCC estimate that they will need double the number of land agents within two years. There will probably be four or five times the present number of management agreements which need to be drawn up and, as a result of all this, if we keep to the staff who are at present employed by the NCC it is quite clear that a growing number will be tied to desk work because there will be so much of it to be done. There will be a shortage of officers out in the field&#x2014;which is a thing that none of us would like to see.<lb/>
These are matters which are very disturbing and worrying to everyone on both sides of the House and in all the various camps connected with the countryside who want to see this Bill work and, particularly, to those who want to see it work by voluntary means. To those of us who have been dubious as to whether it ever would work by voluntary means it unfortunately fulfils our worst fears.<lb/>
There is a basic flaw in this Bill and it is a flaw which is not in any way cured by this present code of practice. The fact remains that greed is a vice from which we all suffer to some extent. There is no gift of God which means that living a life in the open air, living a useful life and being a farmer ensures that you cannot suffer from that kind of greed. It is not farmers alone, it is all of us who have to be restrained from the danger that we can do to the environment that surrounds us.<lb/>
But that environment is being damaged, and it is
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0177"/>
<col>337</col>
being damaged because we have not got the enforcement that is needed to make certain that what Parliament wants and what the great majority of people in this country want is enforced. I think that at the moment it is clear that we are not in a situation on which we can change. We are lumbered with this Bill and we are lumbered with this code of practice. But there are things that the Government can do. They can enforce the Bill as we have it; they can produce the resources and, having really willed this particular end, they must, it seems to me, furnish this particular means. I hope that this afternoon they will say that they can do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01524">3.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01525"><member>Lord Sandford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would like to express my welcome for this code of practice, but for reasons very different from either of the two previous speakers. I would like, nevertheless, to share with them my admiration for the thoroughness and the painstaking way in which the departments involved and the voluntary bodies consulted have co-operated together to produce this code, and I would like to thank my noble friend for his comprehensive yet succinct explanation of it. I welcome it for two limited reasons. First, because it corrects the absurd defect in the 1949 legislation, for which Parliament must take the blame, of not requiring the Nature Conservancy Council to notify anybody other than the local planning authorities of their designation; and it rectifies the mistake which the NCC have compounded and continued ever since of not having the sense to see that if designated SSSIs were not notified to the land owners and occupiers of the land they can hardly expect the system to work. Both those defects are rectified in this legislation and, to that extent, it is a step forward.<lb/>
I must say I was intrigued by the strenuous efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, to try and sustain, to continue or even to intensify the party political differences which he apprehends in this area. I believe he will be totally unsuccessful in that, for reasons which I will come to in a moment. But underlying those reasons is my hope that nothing like Section 29 will be used except on the rarest occasions, because what matters much more than this or any other legislation, and more than any other code&#x2014;this code or the subsequent codes coming along on financial guidelines&#x2014;is a voluntary approach, a commonsense approach through personal and local dialogue over the issues that are involved. I base my hope on this approach on the success that this approach is having and has had over the past two years or 18 months in the national parks where one might expect the conflict between access and conservation, on the one hand, and agriculture, on the other, to be at its most intense, and in the area of the administration of capital grants where the incentives to farmers to improve their land and engage in potentially damaging activities is at its strongest.<lb/>
This system for the administration of capital grants in the national parks and the SSSIs is a system which was introduced before the Wildlife and Countryside Act and it is also the system which the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, did his best to urge your Lordships to resist and to throw out. I quote now from the <i>Annual Report of the Peak National Park</i> as to the way this is
<col>338</col>
all working. Last week, when we were discussing the integrated development plan in the Highlands I quoted Dartmoor. The report reads:
<quote>"The end of the year marked 18 months of dealing with notifications of proposals for which farm grant will be claimed from the Ministry of Agriculture. During the year [the year of the report) about one third of the notification proposals"&#x2014;</quote>
and there were 534 in all&#x2014;
<quote>"were modified by agreement"&#x2014;</quote>
not by management agreement but by verbal agreement&#x2014;
<quote>"with the farmers to meet National Park interests".</quote>
That is what has been known as an ADAS tea party&#x2014;just ordinary, verbal, local, personal discussions.
<quote>"One of the most significant agreements was with a farmer whose original proposal was to fence across the middle of a moorland block to separate his flock from his neighbour's. The fence would have enabled him to increase his stocking to the probable detriment of a site of special scientific interest. Following long negotiations with the farmer, his landlord and the neighbouring farmer, it was agreed to complete a stock-proof boundary around the entire moorland block. Within this boundary both farmers would limit their stocking to an agreed level, consistent with maintaining the diverse and rich moorland flora. A small area of largely abandoned old inbye land would he improved allowing the farmer to keep the same number of animals as he had originally proposed, but managed in a different way.</quote>
<quote>"The events of the past year show how well co-operation with agriculture can work. Where necessary, most farm grant notifications were modified by agreement to meet National Park interests. No proposal has so far gone the full course of objection to the Minister of Agriculture."&#x2014;</quote>
that is with 18 months' experience, 534 proposals in the current year&#x2014;
<quote>"Of the three objections raised in the 18 months since the new procedures came into effect, two were withdrawn by the farmer pending further discussions, while the third is currently with Ministry staff who are attempting to find a solution acceptable to all concerned."</quote>
All that is before this legislation has come into force in the light of the farm grants administration system introduced for the national parks. Now we have this code of guidance to back it up, and we also have coming into force at the same time Section 41 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act.<lb/>
There are two paragraphs in this report indicating reasons for doubt as to whether this works. It then goes on:
<quote>"However, Section 41 also requires the Ministry of Agriculture to use their farm capital grant scheme to further, so far as is consistent with agriculture, the conservation of the countryside and the promotion of its enjoyment. This offers [yet] greater scope. The next step will be the introduction by the Government of a 'Code of Practice' for these compulsory agreements. Its contents will determine the extent to which the board's fears are realised."</quote>
This is the stage that we are now in, my Lords.<lb/>
The Ministry of Agriculture's new duty under Section 41 which comes into force following the introduction of these guidelines, is to advise on conservation and diversification. Those are two aspects which have to be borne in mind, side by side with the main purpose of agriculture, food production, and on which the Ministry of Agriculture has now new duties.<lb/>
This is satisfactory so far as it goes, but we have to pay a lot of attention in Parliament&#x2014;at least as much as we do to the starting of the NCC, and I would say more&#x2014;to the degree to which the Ministry of Agriculture develops its capability to exercise this statutory duty. I believe more depends on that than depends on
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0178"/>
<col>339</col>
the starting of the NCC, because the Ministry of Agriculture's new responsibilities cover the whole of conservation, not just nature conservation&#x2014;landscape conservation and all sorts of other conservation, field monuments, and also diversification by farmers on their farms. At the present moment, the staff within ADAS for the discharge of this duty consists of six regional socio-economic advisers. There are only six officers who have a full-time responsibility in this field. It is true that there is the whole of the rest of ADAS, some of whom can and will exercise functions in this field.<lb/>
My question to my noble friend is: What can he tell us at this stage about the Ministry's plans for developing this capability? It is not good enough to say: "Yes, ADAS will take this on hand. ADAS are doing it". They certainly are, but they have to do very much more, and one wants to have some idea at this stage of what more they have in mind in the way of organising themselves, girding up their loins, to get on with this matter.<lb/>
I think that they need three things: they need some additional assistance, some more staff to concentrate on this field of activity. They need some more leverage&#x2014;that is to say, other bodies and organisations through which to work&#x2014;and they need to have a local framework in which to operate. One of the reasons why the administration of farm capital grants and its reconciliation of conservation has gone so well so far, is that most of it has happened in national parks where there is a national park authority with staff of its own, there is a national park plan with a conservation policy spelt out, and a satisfactory framework.<lb/>
The staff of ADAS can use the agricultural colleges. If they do, that brings in a responsibility for the counties. They can use local planning areas and local planning staff to co-operate with them. That will bring in the districts. They can&#x2014;and I hope that they will&#x2014;use the county secretaries of the NFU and the CLA. I hope that noble Lords who will speak later will have something to say about that. They can and are using the farming press. It is now quite customary for farmers to refer to wildlife habitat where in the past they would have been talking about rough shooting.<lb/>
It is possible to use the farming and wildlife advisory group. This is a voluntary organisation and there may be limits to the amount of weight that you can put on a body which does not have statutory foundations. Another alternative is to use the rural equivalent of local enterprise trusts, groupings of the private sector and the local authority, which are already being very successful in urban areas in promoting new jobs and generating fresh life into the local economy.<lb/>
These are the questions which I should like my noble friend to deal with, perhaps in outline or summary, when he comes to wind up. They are the questions to which we must all be giving attention in the ensuing months. Meanwhile, I wish this admirable code, so far as it has something to contribute to this matter, every success when it is in force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01526">4.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01527"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, combined with the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, has raised all the
<col>340</col>
possible objections not so much to the code, as to the Act itself, so I shall not go through these again. I am concerned over one or two small points, but chiefly over the big ones. I think that we all share this concern. I think Rule 3 of the Prison Rules says that prison authorities shall turn their prisoners into better citizens as a result of prison. I have a feeling that paragraph 2 of the draft code, which is a very full and admirable paragraph, may end in the same disastrous way as Rule 3 of the Prison Rules has ended. It says:
<quote>"The conservation and proper management of SSSIs is vital to the maintenance of Britain's wildlife in all its forms"&#x2014;</quote>
it says "vital"&#x2014;
<quote>"and owners, occupiers, Government Departments, statutory undertakers and others concerned are urged to co-operate by following the guidance contained in this code, in addition to complying with the legal obligations which it outlines."</quote>
My Lords, one could not possibly ask for more. What is entirely absent is the machinery for monitoring this, for seeing that it is done. This point has been made repeatedly and I shall not make it again. If the code is to be operated as it is stated the Government intend it should be operated, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, was very grudging in his praise, because it will he a splendid result. The truth is that it is pretty clear that it is not going to be operated for a good long time.<lb/>
If a responsible body, which is a quango of the most responsible kind, asks for &#x00A3;1,200,000 and is offered &#x00A3;600,000 and if, having cut its staff by 55, which is 10 per cent., it then has a further Rayner review, one only hopes that we shall not get recommendations of the kind that we had for the theatre museum which were rejected by everybody with any sense in this country. So one is left a little uncomfortable about the Government's real intention here. However, they have said everything for which anybody could ask in paragraph 2. I can assure the noble Earl that we shall hold him to that week by week as things go on. He will find himself apologising more and more often.<lb/>
I am much less worried than some other colleagues about the voluntary principle. My own feeling is this. When I used to farm years ago, before many of the younger Members here were born, the National Agricultural Advisory Service&#x2014;as ADAS was then known&#x2014;was very much disliked by farmers and many farmers refused to have them on the farm, and the situation was very difficult. It is now perfectly all right; they are generally recognised as people who are there to help the farmers. It is very good, as the noble Earl has told us, that ADAS is going to be brought in closely with the NCC to help with monitoring and looking after the results of this Act.<lb/>
A couple of small points. The NFU have asked&#x2014;and I think that they are absolutely right&#x2014;that not only should the notification, which is obligatory under this code, be made but also there should be personal visits. This, of course, depends on staff. However, this is probably as important a way of making sure something happens as any other, and if the Nature Conservancy Council have not enough staff to accompany their notifications by personal visits they are going to meet far more resistance than there is any reason for them to have.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, raised the question of Section 29, concerning a year's compulsory delay. We are a bit worried, because it has
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0179"/>
<col>341</col>
been said that the Department of the Environment still holds the view that Section 29 orders should be used in only a small number of cases. I think Section 29 orders should be used in those cases where things are going wrong. One hopes that the number will be small but it is very important that there should not be a general ukase of this kind, saying, "You must be very careful about how you use it." We all know why that is&#x2014;it costs a lot of money, and that is part of the old problem.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, mentioned the subject of the agricultural grant and the failure to obey an order. We say, as indeed I think most people concerned with this say, that in such a case the agricultural grant should be withdrawn. I should like to know what the noble Earl has to say about that, but I do not feel as gloomy as my quondam political and present social friend, the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, about the possibilities here. I think it can be made to work and I do not see why it should not go very well. Subject to the paragraph I have read out, which is in every way admirable, I think, we will do what we can to help the noble Lord enforce this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01528">4.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01529"><member>Lord Stanley of Alderley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I very much welcome this code and its encouragement of the voluntary approach, particularly in relation to landowners and farmers, as stated in paragraph 22 of the code. I have one question. My noble friend said that the Nature Conservancy Council is bound, under Section 32 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, to offer a management agreement when the agriculture grant is denied. My noble friend also confirmed that paragraph 17 of the code means that it is the intention of the Nature Conservancy Council to offer management agreements when the capital grants originate elsewhere, and particularly in the EEC. What I want to know is: What is the position of the National Park Authority? Will my noble friend encourage that authority to take a similar view to that of the Nature Conservancy Council?<lb/>
There is also the vexed question of money. I hope and believe that the Government will do all in their power to make sufficient funds available for management agreements, but, as has been said before, I doubt whether enough can be made available to satisfy all demands for all sites of special scientific interest and particularly enough to satisfy&#x2014;and here perhaps I tread on dangerous ground&#x2014;the arch-conservationists. After all, the Government have to make a decision on priorities for spending their money. If it comes to a question between seagulls and old age pensioners, I have a feeling that most of us would come down on the side of the old age pensioner, although I am not quite so sure that some&#x2014;and particularly perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Melchett&#x2014;feel quite so strongly. So we come back to the hub of the matter that 90 per cent. of conservation must be done by voluntary help from farmers and landowners. Perhaps, in this context, my noble friend would say that he hopes that orders made under Section 29 will be few and far between, because I personally believe that the voluntary system will work perfectly satisfactorily in the very great majority of cases and the number of failures will be in direct proportion to the
<col>342</col>
financial state of the individual farmer concerned and also to the amount of stupid and, indeed, irrational criticism thrown at the industry by the irresponsible.<lb/>
There will be mistakes; there have been mistakes; there always will be in any matter&#x2014;I believe even the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, must have made a mistake at some time or other in his life&#x2014;but the farming industry is determined to make the Act work through the voluntary approach.<lb/>
The first essential to enable this to happen&#x2014;this was brought out by my noble friend Lord Sandford&#x2014;is that there must be these informal get-togethers or "tea parties" between the Nature Conservancy Council, ADAS and the farmers.<lb/>
I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, must be so old as to remember when there was this criticism of NAAS, as I think it was then. As he probably tried to point out, he must be much older than I am, because, as he also pointed out, that certainly is not the case today. I cannot stress too much that the "clipboard approach", followed by statutory notices appearing on the farmer's desk is the worst possible thing that could happen. The best way, as I have said, is to get together informally so that this need never arise or arise only in very occasional circumstances. Therefore, I very much hope that we will have an absolute minimum of Section 29 orders.<lb/>
Secondly, and almost as important, is a will and a determination on the part of not just farmers but all those who are engaged in the countryside to make sure that the Act will work. Nothing induces failure more than believing that it will fail, and I am sorry to say that this does seem to be the view of certain people and organisations (though I may have misinterpreted them) who have been trying to do this during the last year or two. Therefore, for the sake of our countryside, I ask that those who criticise would be occasionally a little more constructive. If they are as determined as we are in the farming industry to make the voluntary approach work, it will; and the nation will get reasonable conservation&#x2014;even comparatively cheaply, dare I say. If the voluntary approach breaks down because of the incessant sniping by certain people and certain organisations&#x2014;yes, even the media and even certain noble Lords&#x2014;the result will be the expensive destruction of our countryside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01530">4.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01531"><member>Lord Middleton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, 18 months ago we debated at length Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Bill, and this is not the time to repeat the arguments. I am glad that this is the view of noble Lords today. Broadly speaking, however, as my noble friend Lord Stanley has just reminded us, owners and farmers agreed with the Government that cooperation rather than coercion would be more effective in achieving good conservation. After the enactment of the Bill the CLA was acutely aware that responsiblity for conservation lies, as it always has done, squarely on the shoulders of owners and occupiers. It has therefore addressed itself in the past year to informing its members and reminding them of their continuing responsibilities. My organisation was privileged to serve on the informal working party on this code of guidance and I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Avon for his kind remarks about this
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0180"/>
<col>343</col>
participation. We hope that, having been laid before Parliament, it will be a helpful contribution towards making the Act effective.<lb/>
I welcome the intention of the Government to issue the code to owners and occupiers of SSSIs. The document, although perfectly clear to those who are familiar with Sections 28 to 32, is rather long and may not be in a form which is easily read; so the CLA have produced an advisory paper giving guidance to their members on the provisions of the Act. They are also preparing a short and simple document for wider distribution, giving the key points concerning SSSIs.<lb/>
In addition to spreading the written word, I myself have taken every opportunity, in speaking to landowners, to remind them of their duty to make the Act work. I have visited some sites where difficulties have arisen or were envisaged. I know perfectly well, from these visits and from what I have heard, that there are a small number of cases which could be cited by opponents of the voluntary principle as evidence that it is failing.<lb/>
It is quite like old times to hear the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, in such good voice. Only three weeks ago, he astonished the North of England by his performance in the role of the Macheath of the public highway network. Last Wednesday, he played Lammermuir, or, if it was not Lammermuir, it was some other uncultivable part of western Scotland, and today he returns in a part which he played with much ability 18 months ago. When it comes to the conservation of a special site, such as we are now discussing, I thought that the song he sang today was reasonable and helpful. It was agreeable to hear his constructive remarks, despite his disagreement about the basic principles of the Bill.<lb/>
Noble Lords will remember that this disagreement was robustly expressed during the passage of the Bill, when he and the critics of voluntary conservation said that tampering with sites by farming and forestry operations was inevitable because the provisions in the Bill were not tough enough. They feared, too&#x2014;and this has been reiterated today&#x2014;that there would not be sufficient money to support the NCC and to finance management contracts. This criticism is being voiced over and over again in the press and through the medium of broadcasts and television programmes. The article on 17th October in the <i>Sunday Times</i> headed "Fiasco of the Wildlife Law" was typical. This kind of criticism is strident, it is unceasing and I believe it is also premature and defeatist.<lb/>
I believe it is wrong to pass judgment on the Act before it has had a chance to prove itself, and I do so for the following reasons. First, for all that was said in last year's debate about the Act having no teeth, I believe that, if persuasion has not been successful, the escalating powers of the NCC to impose a conservation order and, in the last resort, to make a compulsory purchase order are sufficient. The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, referred to destructive operations carried out during the three months' consultation period and I find myself in some sympathy with him about what he said. But let us not forget that Section 29 was brought into force only last month. If Section 29 could have been used&#x2014;and here I do not seem to be on quite the same track as my noble friend Lord Stanley&#x2014;as a deterrent against the odd instance of
<col>344</col>
what I might call pre-designation activity, which I think we agree is deplorable and against the spirit of the Act, then those who said that the section was not made effective soon enough may have been right.<lb/>
Secondly, it is said with justification that none of the statutory powers to which I referred, and which are available to the NCC, can be used unless they have adequate financial support from Government. I am not aware that up to now the Secretary of State for the Environment has been asked for, and has refused, sufficient means to work the Act. It seems to me that a Government which set up an elaborate framework for voluntary conservation depending upon agreements and management contracts and which then refused to provide the finance to operate the system would be running into trouble. That, I do not believe is the intention of this Government. There is a widespread public concern about conservation which no politician can ignore.<lb/>
Thirdly, I believe that the Nature Conservancy Council are becoming more aware that the new duties laid upon them by the Act demand a new expertise. I remember saying to your Lordships that you could lead a farmer in a sensible direction, but you could never push him anywhere, and the worst way to start to tell a farmer that his farming operations, and indeed his livelihood, possibly, may be restricted in the interests of conservation is to send the kind of daunting letter that I have seen. The NCC's duty to notify, which I remember demanding and which was embodied in the Act, must be performed sensibly. Where it is not, it seems that it is where the NCC's officers are under pressure. The noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, voiced his misgivings&#x2014;and rightly&#x2014;on this point.<lb/>
Reference has been made this afternoon to NCC staff numbers. There are, I believe, no less than 535 on the NCC's staff and I sometimes wonder whether a reallocation to permit the employment of a few people who are used to talking to farmers, such as retired ADAS officers, might be worth considering. I welcome the code of guidance. As the document in front of us says on its front page, "Goodwill is necessary". Organisations such as the CLA will be untiring in ensuring the goodwill of farmers and owners. This is a good Act. It can work and it must be made to work. Its critics should give it a chance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01532">4.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01533"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like all noble Lords who have spoken. I, too, welcome the appearance of this Code of Guidance on SSSI's, with its detailed advice on ways in which the conservation of our natural heritage can be reconciled with the other legitimate interests of land ownership, management and good husbandry. I do not know whether my noble friend Lord Stanley regards me as an arch-conservationist. I do not think I really am one. But I certainly see no reason at all why there should be any fundamental clash between those who take a special interest in conservation and those who own or occupy SSSIs, with a little give and take on both sides.<lb/>
Much has already been said in this Chamber and elsewhere about the new conservation responsibilities under the Act of owners and occupiers, agricultural departments and water authorities, and about the need
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0181"/>
<col>345</col>
for adherence to the letter of the statutory provisions to be matched by an equal commitment to their spirit. This, surely, is what the code is all about. As we all know, the Act itself is far from perfect; of course it is. There are, naturally, loopholes and opportunities for exploitation by the unscrupulous and, unless this code is widely followed, I fear that more stringent controls on activities in SSSIs will surely need to be introduced. But I, for one, very much hope that that can be avoided and that the pessimists can be proved wrong.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Middleton said a word about the complexities of the code which we are discussing today, and which we shall no doubt pass, and I was very glad to hear that the CLA has already taken on the job of producing a simplified version of some of the more complicated parts of it. I strongly welcome that. My noble friend Lord Avon himself said that the code was not easy reading.<lb/>
Some noble Lords already know that I am a member of the council of the NCC and, of course, the NCC bears the main brunt of the workload arising out of the new SSSI provisions in the Act. So I should like to draw the attention of the House to one very important area where the code is less than expansive. As the largest single landowner, the Government have the responsibility and the opportunity to set a good example in the way in which they manage their land. I welcome the fact that the Minister speaking in another place touched on this question and made some very helpful remarks about it. Nonetheless, I think that the code itself is less than forthright. For example, the absence from the code of a clear directive to public authorities on the conservation of SSSIs is disappointing and is surely an omission. And what is the reason for the lack of a positive response from the Forestry Commission to the NCC's extra-statutory commitment to the extension of the Sections 32 and 41 principles governing agricultural grants to forestry operations? This, I think, is disappointing, particularly when it is viewed in the light of the new and very constructive dimension to the relationship between the council's staff and those of the Ministry of Agriculture. That is something which I have noted and greatly welcomed.<lb/>
May I say a brief word about something which has not been touched on; namely, what I might call the other side of the coin. Farmers who are prepared to forgo increased agricultural production in the national interest have certain advantages, of which very little has been said. That is what I mean by the other side of the coin. I am thinking of the capital transfer tax and capital gains tax concessions which are already available to the owners of land of high scientific, scenic or historic value. So far as scientifically important land is concerned, the main incentive at present is exemption from capital transfer tax on land notified by the Nature Conservancy Council as a site of special scientific interest or declared a national nature reserve, provided that certain management conditions are met. In addition, sales of such land to approved bodies such as the National Trust and the Nature Conservancy Council benefit from the capital gains tax concession. Land can be accepted in lieu of capital transfer tax, and maintenance funds created for the purpose of managing the land properly are now also exemptable.<lb/>
<col>346</col>
Welcome as these incentives are, they do not go far enough. I think many noble Lords will agree with me. To date, only a very small number of owners of sites of special scientific interest have applied for capital transfer tax exemption. Perhaps many of them do not know about it. The more obviously attractive provisions for management agreements with the Nature Conservancy Council in the 1981 Act might well reduce the flow or stop it altogether.<lb/>
The Nature Conservancy Council have recommended to the Treasury that improvements should include an increase in the capital gains tax concession&#x2014;usually called the <i>douceur</i>&#x2014;on land sales. This is only 10 per cent. at present, as opposed to 25 per cent. for works of art. They also recommend the expansion of the list of approved recipients of land to include the voluntary conservation bodies such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the County Naturalists' Trusts. These are sensible suggestions which would be very inexpensive and very helpful. I do hope therefore that my noble friend will have a chance to comment on this, at least to the extent of saying that urgent thought is being given to it, and that, with luck, we may hear something about it in the next Budget.<lb/>
Finally, I must, like everyone else who has spoken, say a word about the Nature Conservancy Council's resources. Here I express my own personal views. In seeing the Wildlife and Countryside Act through Parliament and accepting many of the changes proposed from all sides of the House, the Government have quite clearly demonstrated their absolute commitment to nature conservation. I recognise that. But the Act and the code together represent a commitment to the offer of funds to the Nature Conservancy Council which must be honoured if there is to be any hope for the future of a voluntary system based on the principles of co-operation and consent in the countryside.<lb/>
These facts came out forcefully in another place&#x2014;on all sides of the House and from almost everybody who spoke&#x2014;when the code was being debated. The Government were criticised on all sides for their equivocal attitude towards the funding of the Nature Conservancy Council&#x2014;as, indeed, they were in both Houses during the passage through Parliament of the Wildlife and Countryside Bill. Not an extra penny piece has been made available to the Nature Conservancy Council to pay for staff shortages in the field, which are very serious indeed, or to cover the cost of management agreements into which we are hound by law to enter&#x2014;beyond, that is, the &#x00A3;600,000 provided for in the Bill which is now an Act. This sum of &#x00A3;600,000 could take no account, of course, of the cost of all the extra duties imposed on the Nature Conservancy Council during the passage of the Bill through both Houses as a result of its amendment, yet the sum was not increased. This is very disappointing indeed and I think that it is already beginning to create quite serious problems for the Nature Conservancy Council, which is the subject of a great deal of criticism&#x2014;some of it I think quite well justified.<lb/>
I am glad none the less to note that in another place Mr. Neil Macfarlane stated that the Rayner exercise through which we are now going and to which I do not object in principle is not necessarily a cost-cutting exercise but would also review the Nature Conser
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0182"/>
<col>347</col>

vancy Council's complement in the light of their present workload. It is surely just as important to find out whether the Nature Conservancy Council's present and anticipated resources match their statutory duties as to find out whether we can improve our efficiency and cut certain overheads.<lb/>
So I say in conclusion that I hope my noble friend can give a positive assurance&#x2014;a more positive one than he has been able to give yet&#x2014;that the necessary funds will be made available to enable the Nature Conservancy Council to carry out their duties effectively and so avoid the present risk of destroying a national asset that can never he replaced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01534">4.36 p.m.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01535"><member>"The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (The Earl of Cowrie)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope it will be for the convenience of your Lordships if at this point I repeat, in the form of a Statement, the Answer to a Private Notice Question given in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the subject of the De Lorean Motor Company Limited. My right honourable friend said:
<quote>"As I announced on 19th October, because no investor had come forward to take over De Lorean Motor Company Limited, the Receivers were proceeding to a final rundown of the company's Dunmurry plant. I greatly regret the loss of many jobs to Northern Ireland. I understand that since then a number of interests in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America have been in touch with the joint Receivers to explore the possibilities either of purchasing the stock of cars held in Belfast or of acquiring the entire business as a going concern. No detailed proposals have yet been referred by the Receivers to the Government. Any such proposals would be considered on their merits".</quote>
My Lords, that ends my right honourable friend's Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01536"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for reading that Statement to the House. It tells us rather less than we understood from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, but we prefer a little accurate information to a lot which is not. So I am grateful for what little we have been told. The Statement says that a number of interests are exploring the possibilities of acquiring the entire business as a going concern. May I ask the noble Earl whether that means that liquidation can be stopped and that it is not an absolute certainty? I think we should all like to know the answer to that question, because the worry now in this House, as everywhere else, is more about unemployment in Northern Ireland than even about terrorism.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01537"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with the noble Lord in thanking the noble Earl for repeating the holding statement made by the Secretary of State in another place. I am sure all noble Lords hope that detailed proposals will result from the present discussions. I think noble Lords should remember that
<col>348</col>
we are speaking not just about jobs at De Lorean but about jobs in a number of other factories and enterprises in Northern Ireland. Therefore the complete collapse of the De Lorean Motor Company would be a calamity for Northern Ireland. I need hardly add that jobs are desperately needed in West Belfast.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01538"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join in thanking the noble Earl for repeating the Statement made in another place. We, too, regret that the noble Earl is not able to give us better news than the morning press suggested might be imminent. We must hope that an offer of the kind reported in the press may in fact be forthcoming. I should like to join with the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, in asking the noble Earl whether he can give any indication of how much time is left for such an offer to be made. Clearly such an offer would be welcome because of the economic situation in Northern Ireland and the considerable amount of Government money invested in the project.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01539"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, that it would be irresponsible for the Government to raise expectations at this juncture which might in the event not be fulfilled. Therefore I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Banks, and to the House that the process of the running down and liquidation of the company (the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, also asked me about this) will continue. However, should any realistic possibilities open up of new investors coming along, then of course the Government would consider every proposal on its merits. I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, about how badly jobs are needed in Belfast generally and perhaps in West Belfast particularly. I would like to pay the Government's tribute to the very great achievement of the people of this part of a beleaguered city in moving very rapidly from having no tradition of motor manufacturing to a tradition of motor manufacturing whose failure was not much to do with them, if I may put it that way.<lb/>
We must, of course, live in hope but at the same time it would be quite wrong for the Government not to recognise the realities or not to put, as it were, any time extension on the procedure. It may be that the fact that the sands are running out so quickly will concentrate the minds of those who may still be interested in the project.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01540"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will welcome the rather warmer words which the noble Earl used in his supplementary answer, as compared with the original Statement. It is, of course, absolutely essential to consider any proposals on their merits, but it would be encouraging if the noble Earl could say that they will be considered at any rate, with a degree of sympathy. Also, may I ask the noble Earl if he is aware how much his words will be appreciated, when he said that the effort&#x2014;although not creditable in certain ways&#x2014;was no discredit to the great effort put into it by the people of Northern Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01541"><member>The Earl of Cowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Beswick. Again, I must repeat that I
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0183"/>
<col>349</col>
did not want to give any false prospectus or any bogus encouragement. The Government will have to look at proposals on their merits, as I said. I must reiterate, however, that the Government have decided&#x2014;rightly in my view&#x2014;not to put any more public money into a fund which has absorbed a very great deal of public money, unfortunately without visible dividends for the public and without any real job security for those who were engaged in the manufacture of the cars. We can always live in hope that private investment will note the achievements of the people at the Dunmurry plant, note the excellence of the equipment and the rest of it, and will make decisions on a commercial basis&#x2014;which will be very welcome in Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<section><title>Code of Guidance Concerning Sites of Special<lb/>Scientific Interest</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01542">Debate continued on the Motion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01543">4.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01544"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if we have now finished with the Statement I will with the permission of your Lordships' House make my contribution for about three minutes to this very important little debate concerning sites of special scientific interest. I find it interesting that the National Farmers' Union, in the brief that it has sent out to many of us, states:
<quote>"The National Farmers' Union believes that the new system promises to be successful in protecting the nature conservation interests of the SSSIs whilst at the same time giving a fair deal to the farmers concerned. However, much will depend on the patience, goodwill and co-operation of all parties and the provision of adequate resources by Government."</quote>
The approval of the code, the NFU says, is recommended. The noble Lords, Lord Middleton and Lord Chelwood, to whom the House owes quite a bit for the effort they have made and their assiduity in attending to the NCC meetings and helping to produce this code (and some of us are grateful to them for that) said that attention has been drawn to the need for the farming fraternity not merely to have peremptory notices by post but that they should be visited by people who are trained to understand the farming industry and even to understand landowners in some cases. We want to get rid of bureaucracy. There are no more telegrams, unfortunately, in rural Wales or rural Scotland and although intimation may be given by post, I believe this should be thought out in depth. Visits are necessary to create goodwill.<lb/>
In the minute or so that is left I want to draw attention to paragraph 13 of the code on Section 28, which deals with the removal of SSSI status. It states:
<quote>"The NCC may decide that an SSSI or part of an SSSI, no longer merits that status because of a reduction in the scientific value of the land due to natural or other causes. In such cases the NCC will inform all owners and occupiers, the local planning authority, the Secretary of State and other relevant bodies that the land in question is no longer an SSSI and arrange for cancellation of the entry in the local land charges registry."</quote>
That is an important <i>caveat</i>. We want to make sure that it is used fairly and squarely. We have not spoken about this, but the mining industry&#x2014;it is open-castmining&#x2014;and the new oil and gas pipelines going through Britain, Scotland and even Europe, could very well influence the application of this code and its
<col>350</col>
practices to places of special scientific interest. I do not want to elaborate because this House understands very well. I could speak for 10 minutes on that one point, but having made the point, the House will see that there is a reality about this; when does the need for natural gas or the need for open-cast coal overwhelm the demand for places of special scientific interest? It is not an easy question to answer but it is a question about which the House could be alerted.<lb/>
I will now sit down with just this tribute. I was fortunate enough to be brought up in different little mountainous parts of Wales. I want to pay tribute to the small landowner and small farmer who, over the years, by hedging, by ditching, and by cleaning streams which sing over the pebbles and the hills, have kept those places beautiful. It has created&#x2014;particularly in parts of Wales, Scotland and the Pennines&#x2014;places of beauty which have brought balance of payments money to this country. Much of the beauty of Britain today is due to the rough hands of the farmers of the past who have kept it beautiful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01545"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01546">4.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01547"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this has been a wide ranging debate on a document that will exercise a strong influence over the way in which the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act for the protection of habitats are implemented. I am grateful for the various kind remarks by noble Lords on my introduction. I believe I am right in concluding that so far as concerns the formal question of the approval of the draft Code of Guidance (while some noble Lords might have preferred to see something shorter or easier to understand, and I have already touched on the reasons for its complexity), I gather there is general agreement that the document should be approved. I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, did suggest that we have been "lumbered"with it, which I thought was, perhaps, less than generous. I also noted that Lord Middleton's organisationation has already produced a simpler guide, which may be of use to us all later.<lb/>
In the course of the debate we have listened to a number of matters of concern to noble Lords about the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Cases have been mentioned in which despite these provisions, a site has been damaged&#x2014;and concern has very rightly been voiced over these cases. I would like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, that I agree absolutely there is absolutely no case at the moment for complacency. Indeed, it is a matter for great regret that some people, although acting within their legal rights, should refuse to extend the voluntary co-operation which underlies the provisions of the Act. Examples have been given, especially by the noble Lord, Lord Melchett, and seen where, after the NCC has given notice of its intention to notify an SSSI, harmful work has been carried out on the land within the three-month period which must elapse before the formal notification can take place.<lb/>
The code, as noble Lords will be aware, comes out firmly against such action, and I hope that its publication will help to stamp it out. Paragraph 7 of the code states that owners and occupiers should not carry out any specified operations during this period without
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0184"/>
<col>351</col>
consulting the NCC. Both the NFU and the CLA have pledged their support for the code and the voluntary principle and have a vested interest in seeing that the Act works, since they do not want even stricter controls. Both my noble friend Lord Stanley and the noble Lord, Lord Middleton, touched on this point.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, mentioned West Sedgemoor. Perhaps I may just say that although three farmers in West Sedgemoor have indeed damaged 40 to 50 acres, some 70 owners and occupiers are involved altogether in some 2,500 acres. While, of course, we much regret the damage, it is clear that the great majority of those concerned have voluntarily cooperated. In Wales, notice of over 20 new sites has been given and only in two cases has there been any trouble.<lb/>
So far as grant is concerned, the only sanction an agriculture minister has is the right to refuse grant. The Minister of Agriculture has made it clear in the context of West Sedgemoor that if a claim is received for works carried out in this period he will carry out the agreed consultation procedure with the NCC and consult the Secretary of State for the Environment. The Agriculture Minister's decision will be based on the situation before the work was carried out. I agree that the sort of action of which we have given examples does need to be most vigorously discouraged, and I am sure that the Government can look to all responsible organisations to support the plea for voluntary restraint in such situations.<lb/>
But we should not he too alarmed, nor conclude too readily that the Act is failing. The number of such cases is small and, what is more, very few cases of damage to existing SSSIs have been reported since the Act came into force. The NCC advised during the passage of the Wildlife and Countryside Bill that in 1980 some 15 per cent. of all SSSIs&#x2014;and that was several hundred sites&#x2014;were damaged, although it amounted to only 0.7 per cent. of the total land area which was affected. While we have no comparable study for the past year, the number of cases reported has been no more than a handful. Maybe there are some which have not come to light, but there are many people on the lookout for damage to SSSIs, and unless I am much mistaken the position is already greatly improved. This is no doubt due in large measure to the greater awareness which already exists as a consequence of the Act; it will be further increased by the publication of the code. I do also know that a number of cases are being resolved satisfactorily at the local level.<lb/>
A different kind of situation which has also caused anxiety is that in which after consideration by Ministers a conservation objection is not sustained. I do not believe that this is the time to discuss individual cases, but I want to make it clear that, in all cases where such an objection is raised by the NCC, my noble and honourable friends in the Department of the Environment and the Agriculture Department do consult together and give the fullest consideration to the Council's views. I will not undertake that the conservation case will invariably predominate over all other interests, since that would be to prejudge the ministerial consideration of the merits of individual cases; and it so happens that in two recent cases the objection has not been upheld. But there has already
<col>352</col>
been one decision the other way, and there will surely be others; each case will be very carefully considered on its merits.<lb/>
The question of finance for the NCC has also been mentioned by a number of noble Lords. I made some remarks on this subject in my opening speech. May I now repeat that my right honourable friends will consider carefully all available evidence and information and the best estimates that can be made of the likely scale of activity under the Wildlife and Countryside Act in reaching a decision on the financial allocation for the coming year, and in particular we will take note of the points that have been made in this connection in today's debate by the noble Lord, Lord Chelwood, with his great knowledge of this particular matter. So far in this financial year, the NCC have not had to withdraw any objection to a damaging proposal on resource grounds. Although the NCC's funds for this financial year are now fully committed, this is, I am led to believe, a normal state of affairs, because it is by this time of year the only way in which the NCC can ensure that they spend the available monies. However, they are willing to consider further cases as they arise and if necessary to approach Ministers for funds. As my colleague Mr. Macfarlane said in another place, we are always willing to consider approaches from the NCC. This, of course, still holds. We shall look forward to the bid, which should be coming forward any moment now, for the next financial year from the Nature Conservancy Council.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Melchett, mentioned the Rayner Review. It is true that the original draft of the terms of reference would have required the scope of staff reduction to be considered. However, these terms were put to the NCC for consideration and were changed in the light of their comments. I must reject the imputation that although the Government agreed to make this change they intend to proceed as if they had not done so. The Rayner studies have, indeed, resulted in staff cuts where inefficiences and scope for economies have been found, but it is not right to assume in advance that this will be the case with the NCC. Not even the original terms of reference made that assumption.<lb/>
May I say a word here on renotification? The NCC hope to complete the exercise as soon as possible after the start of the next field season, when the remaining surveys will be completed. The NCC had to strike a balance between immediate impersonal renotification, with the possibility of misconceptions and unnecessary anxiety, and full consultation with all owners and occupiers. To draw up meaningful lists of potentially damaging operations the NCC has had to take a personal contact in most cases. This, I know, will please the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek. This has proved to be a very time-consuming operation, and I am led to understand has no doubt taken a lot more work than the NCC originally envisaged. I am told that the NCC are slightly below complement in the assistant regional officer and land agent cadres. The problem cannot be resolved overnight, since most of the work arising out of the Act demands experience and knowledge of the sites. In making their bid for additional resources, the NCC will be taking into account a probable increase in workload, but the level of response to the SSSI notification exercise is still an unknown factor. I am sure that the current review of
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0185"/>
<col>353</col>
NCC staffing will suggest ways in which their problems may be eased.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Sandford talked about the role of ADAS. Over the past two years there has been a great commitment of ADAS resources on conservation and an increase in training in conservation matters. This has been reflected in the farming community by greatly increased requests for advice on habitat management and other conservation matters, including socio-economic advice. There is good liaison between ADAS and NCC officers on the ground, and ADAS plays a major role in the farming and wildlife advisory groups. The MAFF advisory literature increasingly includes conservation advice and some booklets are entirely devoted to this subject. Their wildlife and countryside conservation committee meets under ADAS chairmanship. The committee, which consists of representatives of Government departments and conservation bodies, meets about twice a year to discuss subjects of mutual interest.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Sandford mentioned the six socio-economic advisers. These are specialists in this type of advice on which a front line officer can fall. There are also other specialists in a variety of conservation, landscape and other matters who are responsible for training and for responding to requests for guidance. This advice is available not only to other Ministry officers but also to any local government or other body which seeks advice or guidance.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Stanley asked about the national park authorities. It is a condition of the farm capital grant schemes that a farmer in a national park must seek the agreement of the NPA before starting work. This applies whether or not the grant is sought under Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970 or Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act. The consultation procedure therefore applies to all capital grants. It is for the national park authority to decide whether it will apply Section 41(4) of the Wildlife arid Countryside Act to grants other than those sought under Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970. I am sure that if they listened to my noble friend they would be encouraged so to do. I should also like to say to my noble friend Lord Sandford that I will of course read with care his other comments and see that they are brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities.<lb/>
A word on capital grants. It should be remembered that eligibility for a management agreement for an SSSI does not depend on a refusal of proposals which will be eligible for capital grant. As is made clear in paragraph 25 of the Code of Guidance, owners or occupiers may seek an agreement at any time. Most capital works eligible for grant have no implication for damage to SSSIs. Only about 4 per cent. of agricultural holdings have an SSSI on any part of the land.<lb/>
I am advised that since October 1980, in the few cases where the NCC has had reservations about capital grant proposals, there has been a willingness by the farmers concerned to discuss the issues involved and as a rule, either to drop the proposals which could cause significant damage or to accept NCC suggestions for modifications of the agricultural works to avoid damage without recourse to management agreement. I hope, as do many other noble Lords, that this spirit of co-operation will continue.<lb/>
<col>354</col>
There were some comments made about Section 29. I believe that the way forward on the use of Section 29 is being developed in consultation with the NCC in the light of recent discussions. It is likely to stress the fact that on very many SSSIs no threats will arise, but where they do they should normally be dealt with on a voluntarily agreed basis, and that consideration of the use of Section 29 will be a last resort. It is expected to avoid specifying any category of SSSI for which Section 29 will, or will not, he considered appropriate or giving any generalised commitment in advance of individual proposals from the NCC, which in each case will be considered on its merits.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Chelwood raised a point on taxes. I can assure him that my right honourable and learned friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is aware of the position. I believe that the Wildlife and Countryside Act is a good Act and that the protection of SSSIs is a fundamental part of that Act. I recommend this Code of Guidance to the House.</membercontribution></p>

</section>
<section><title>Motor Vehicles (Tests) (Extension) Order 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01549">5.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01550"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (Lord Bellwin)</member> rose to move, That the order laid before the House on 23rd June be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01551">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order which is before the House today forms the last part of a package designed to meet the requirements of the European Community directive on roadworthiness tests. Your Lordships may not be very familiar with this directive, so perhaps I could quickly run through the main points in it, before explaining why the Motor Vehicles (Tests) (Extension) Order is needed, and how it affects testing arrangements in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01552">The purpose of the roadworthiness directive is to harmonise the arrangements in all the counties of the European Community for testing goods and passenger vehicles. It covers all motor vehicles with more than eight seats, excluding the driver's seat, used for the carriage of' passengers. It covers, motor vehicles and trailers used for the carriage of goods with a maximum weight exceeding 3,500 kg; and taxis and ambulances. The directive goes on to require that tests on these categories of vehicles should be carried out one year after the date on which the vehicle was first used, and then after that on an annual basis. It also lists the items which should be tested, but leaves member states to decide how tests are to be carried out, and by whom. In other words, the directive lays down certain minimum standards; it is quite modest in its scope, and is, I think, a useful road safety measure for the Community as a whole.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01553">We are fortunate in this country, that we already have extensive testing arrangements for the vehicles covered by the directive and, in the main, these arrangements already meet, or in some cases even exceed, the requirements of the directive. However, we have had to make two significant changes, in order to comply with what the directive lays down. The first was the introduction of a formal annual testing scheme
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0186"/>
<col>355</col>
for public service vehicles, which replaced the old informal inspection system. Your Lordships may remember that the legislative foundations for this were laid in the Transport Act, 1980. The detailed arrangements for the new scheme were laid down in the Motor Vehicle (Tests) Regulations 1981, which came into operation at the very end of last year. They were subject to the usual negative resolution procedure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01554">The second change which we are obliged to make concerns the age at which vehicles have to be tested for the first time, and that is the reason for this extension order. In order to comply with the directive, we have to ensure that from 1st January 1983 all taxis, ambulances, and large passenger vehicles, as well as public service vehicles, have their first test by the time of their first birthday. This order introduces that new requirement. Goods vehicles are not included in the scope of the order, because their annual test already starts at one year old, and no change is needed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01555">The form of the order is governed by the provisions of the 1972 Road Traffic Act. Section 44 deals with compulsory test certificates for certain specified classes of vehicles and provides the foundation for the MOT tests. It makes it an offence to use a vehicle on the road without a valid test certificate, if it comes within the MOT test scheme and if it is over a certain age. When Section 44 was written, the age specified was 10 years, but the Act provides that a shorter period can be substituted by statutory instrument. As noble Lords will know, this power has been used several times, and the age for the first test under the MOT scheme has been gradually reduced to its present three years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01556">The last Motor Vehicle (Extension) Order was made in 1966. This new order revokes the 1966 one, and brings down the age of the first test from three years to one year for the roadworthiness directive vehicles. The House will note, however, that paragraph 5 of the order provides for the three-year period to continue in force for all vehicles except taxis, ambulances and passenger vehicles with more than eight passenger seats. This means that the testing of private cars, motorcycles and light vans is not affected in any way by the order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01557">I imagine that some of your Lordships may feel some concern about the apparently rather short deadline. The effect of the order is that from 1st January 1983, any vehicle which falls within one of the specified categories and is more than one year old on that date must possess a test certificate. I can, however, reassure the House on this point. The intention to bring in the order was widely publicised a year ago and the new arrangements for testing vehicles have been operating throughout the year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01558">Generally speaking, there is very little change at all, with vehicles being tested at the same places, by the same people and to the same standards. Apart from the new testing arrangements for public service vehicles, and the difference in the age at which some vehicles must be presented for their test for the first time little else has been necessary. I am sure, however, these two changes are very worthy ones and will encourage an improvement in the maintenance standards for the vehicles affected. There is no radical revision to the testing systems already operating in this country, and on that basis I commend the order for approval by this House. I beg to move.</p>

Anything that will assist safety standards should be encouraged. I am almost tempted to join in the discussion in the light of what the noble Lord said that national States will be free to determine how the testing shall be done and by whom, but that will be trespassing on your Lordships' time. However, in view of the Government's decision in the recent Bill to transfer the testing from our very efficient arrangements, I am tempted to do so. As the Minister said, in effect the order makes no change to the arrangements this country already has for heavy goods and public service vehicles. It extends them to other classes and this will add in general to safety conditions.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"All's well that ends well".</quote>
The department certainly chose for itself a hard and stony road to travel over to get this order. That may be gleaned from the last paragraph of the explanatory notes to the order, which state that the order of 1981, with a similar title, not having been approved by Parliament, was never registered.<lb/>
The 1981 order came before the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments who questioned the <i>vires</i> of it. They invited the department to submit a memorandum. The memorandum stated four grounds upon which the department contended that the order was <i>intra tires</i>, none of which grounds appealed to the joint committee. The committee invited the department to come and give oral evidence. I shall not weary your Lordships with all four grounds that were contended for, but with only one.<lb/>
An assistant solicitor in the department giving evidence before the joint committee said that one could see that the order was <i>intra tires</i> when one looked at what the Minister had said in the Committee stage of the enabling Act. When confronted with the proposition that it is well known that the courts in interpreting legislation may not look at <i>Hansard</i>, the witness relied upon half a sentence of the judgment of Lord Reid in a House of Lords case of 1969 called <i>Regina</i> v. <i>Warner</i>. The words which the witness quoted were as follows:
<quote>"I am bound to say that this case seems to show that there is room for an exception where examining the proceedings in Parliament would almost certainly settle the matter immediately one way or the other".</quote>
Those words, taken by themselves, certainly seem to support what the witness was contending for, but when one looks up the case to see what Lord Reid really said on this point one finds that Lord Reid was saying the exact opposite. I shall tell your Lordships what Lord Reid did say. It is not very long and it reads as follows:
<quote>"...the layman may well wonder why we do not consult the Parliamentary Debates, for we are much more likely to find the intention of Parliament there than anywhere else. The rule is firmly
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0187"/>
<col>357</col>
established that we may not look at <i>Hansard</i> and in general I agree with it, for reasons which I gave last year in <i>Beswick</i> v. <i>Beswick</i>&#x2026; This is not a suitable case in which to reopen the matter, but",</quote>
and he then says the words quoted by the witness. At the beginning of the next paragraph Lord Reid makes the situation perfectly plain when he says:
<quote>"As things are we must do our best with the material available to us".</quote>
It is a sorry day when a witness from a Government department quotes a snippet of a judgment of a judge who, in fact, one finds when one looks up the case, is saying the exact opposite to what the witness is relying upon. That is why I say that the department have chosen a very stony path, but they have got here in the end.</membercontribution></p>

<section><title>Driving Licences (Community Driving Licence) Regulations 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01564">5.14 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01565"><member>Lord Bellwin</member> rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 22nd July be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01566">The noble Lord said: My Lords, these draft regulations have been the subject of a report by the Joint Scrutiny Committee, which commented that their purport calls for elucidation, and that the necessary elucidation is supplied by the memoranda submitted by the Department of Transport.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01567">I am conscious, therefore, that this instrument is rather technical in its drafting. This is probably inevitable in a draft which uses the powers in Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act to amend existing main legislation&#x2014;the 1972 Road Traffic Act&#x2014;as distinct from the more radical approach of rewriting this main legislation, which would necessarily have taken up more parliamentary time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01568">However, I owe it to the House to explain both the impact of these regulations, and the European obligations to which they give effect. Essentially, the regulations make it possible for a person who has lived and held a licence to drive in one country of the Community to move to another member state and obtain a driving licence there without first taking a driving test. This is the central provision of the directive on driving licences which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 4th December 1980 and which comes into effect on 1st January 1983. A further provision of the directive, the issue of new licences in common format, will be introduced in this country on 1st January 1986.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01569">The directive was many years under negotiation. I should like briefly to recount this background because I think it will make clear why the directive does what it does in the way it does, and why it does not do some other things which people have suggested it should do. The initial proposal in the early 1970s was that all member states should issue the same driving licence. This remains the very long-term object which is stated in the directive, and accounts for its title:
<quote>"on the introduction of a Community driving licence".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01570">But the title has caused confusion because the actual provisions fall far short of this. In fact it emerged in the course of negotiations that there were major discrepancies among national practices in regard to driver
<col>358</col>
licensing which militated against achievement of the most ambitious aim.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01571">After prolonged negotiations the Community finally got down to the essential question: how to remove undue obstacles to the freedom of movement of workers, as guaranteed by the Treaty of Rome, without compromising the essential aims of national driver licensing. The Community identified driving competence and medical fitness as the key areas where harmonisation of minimum standards was both desirable and realistic. That is what the directive of December 1980 sets out to achieve. However, it was accepted that, for the future, there must be adequate minimum medical and driving test standards. The directive did not rule out individual states maintaining their own higher medical standards, and indeed expressly provided in Article 8 that they might be imposed on applicants for exchange licences. In fact, neither the driving test nor the medical standards affect practice in Britain, because in essentials our standards are at least as high as the directive prescribes. The other member states must adopt these minimum standards not later than 1st January 1983, if they have not already done so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01572">Another reason why negotiations on the draft directive were long drawn out was that the United Kingdom had special supplementary licences for heavy goods vehicles in several classes for which there is an exacting driving test, and similar vocational licensing for public service vehicles. These schemes set high standards of competence in the interests of road safety, on account of the known hazards presented by large, heavy vehicles with complex controls and in some cases special handling characteristics. We insisted&#x2014;rightly&#x2014;on maintaining stringent safeguards on access to these licences. Our partners however were able to point out that the directive's contribution to freedom of movement of workers would be incomplete if it did not extend to vocational driving. This roadblock, if I may so call it, was finally removed by the device which has been used in this and in other countries when a new licensing scheme is introduced and it is not practical to test all of those who are currently driving. In 1970 when the heavy goods vehicle driving licence was introduced, it was granted to many thousand drivers on the basis of certificates of recent driving experience. I should like to stress this, because it means that in fact many of our HGV licence-holders entered the scheme without taking the British HGV test. This does not remove the quite legitimate grounds for concern about admitting drivers from other Community countries to the scheme, but it does, I hope, place the matter in perspective. We are talking of at most a couple of hundred drivers a year coming without equivalent tests into a scheme which contains about a million and for which tens of thousands of tests are conducted annually.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01573">Moreover, what was negotiated in the directive was an arrangement which provides more stringent safeguards than were possible when many thousands were admitted to the new HGV scheme in 1970. It has been agreed that the applicant must first obtain the British ordinary licence by surrendering his current Community licence. He must then apply to the independent licensing authority in the local traffic area and satisfy him on three counts. First, the licence he
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0188"/>
<col>359</col>
surrendered must be valid for heavy goods vehicles in the country of issue. Second, he must produce a certificate from former employers showing exactly what types of vehicle he has driven in the last three years, and for what periods within that time. And third, except for passing a British test, he must meet the same requirements as other applicants by providing a British medical certificate and declaring any driving convictions. He must satisfy the licensing authority on these matters. If he has been a self-employed driver he must produce evidence comparable to an employer's certificate which like that certificate can if necessary be checked. If he cannot satisfy the licensing authority about his experience or on any other count laid down in this or other legislation, he will not get the licence without a test. Exactly the same applies to applicants for exchange who want public service vehicle drivers' licences.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01574">I will not conceal that this is a quite novel task for the licencing authorities, though one for which their experience with the road traffic industry well qualifies them. The Secretary of State was therefore interested to hear from the Transport and General Workers' Union, which had some misgivings whether the exchanges could be conducted with due regard to the need to maintain standards. The union has been invited to provide any information to which they have access which would help the licensing authorities to consider and verify these applications. I am glad to be able to extend this invitation publicly to other representative organisations on both sides of the industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01575">I have given your Lordships an account both of the background to the directive and the present regulations, and of the way the exchanges will work in the most difficult field, that of vocational licences. Perhaps I could now give a short explanation of' the actual text which is before us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01576">As your Lordships will know, the Secretary of State is the licensing authority for the ordinary driving licences issued at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre in Swansea and the Chairmen of Traffic Commissioners in Traffic Areas for heavy goods vehicle drivers' licences. Existing road traffic law states that these authorities may not grant a full licence unless the applicant has either held such a licence previously, or passed the appropriate test. There are special provisions for both visitors and new residents to drive for up to a year on foreign licences, but there is no right for new residents to drive heavy goods or public service vehicles, and after a year they must pass the test even to continue driving a car. The directive requires, and these draft regulations provide, that the holder of a currently valid licence issued in another state of the European Community may surrender it within the first year of becoming resident here, and obtain the corresponding British licence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01577">Under Regulation 1, the first exchange licences will date from 1st January 1983, although issue will begin once this instrument has parliamentary approval. The licences which can be exchanged are defined in Regulation 3 as the national licences issued in other Community states. The definition is so framed as to cover the licences issued for dependants of the British armed forces serving in BAOR&#x2014;the British Forces Germany licences.</p>
<col>360</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01578">Regulation 4 is a technical provision, designed to avoid any discrepancy over rights to drive during the first year of residence between our existing legislation, which concerns Great Britain, and the directive, which applies to the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this directive, this also includes Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01579">Regulation 2 permits the grant of ordinary licences for the groups which most nearly correspond to the categories for which the foreign licence is valid, and for the grant of those additional groups which automatically go with certain groups on the British licence. Regulations 5 and 6 provide for the subsequent issue of vocational licences. In recognition of the need to make a separate application for these and provide additional information, they allow a further six months, making the qualifying period 18 months from the date of becoming resident. These regulations also lay down the minimum periods of experience&#x2014;six months within the 18 months preceding the date of becoming resident in the United Kingdom, or one year within the previous three years. The licence will be based on the British class within which vehicles have been driven for these minimum periods.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01580">I have spoken at some length on the detail of the regulations and of the arrangements we are making to ensure that the safety of our roads is not compromised. Let me finally put this into its broader perspective. Movement of people is a feature of the world in which we live, and this is now to a very large extent accomplished by personal means of transport&#x2014;by car. Hundreds of thousands of people enter and leave this country every year as visitors with their own transport. But we are here concerned with a few thousand who depart or arrive with the intention of settling for more than a year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01581">The largest group of beneficiaries of the directive is, in fact, likely to be the dependants of British servicemen and women who have been on a tour of duty in Germany. Rather smaller numbers of people move here each year from other Community countries with other Community driving licences, and will be seeking to convert their licences. This is, of course, a two-way flow. The directive contributes a new and valuable element to that freedom of movement to live and work which is a tangible aspect of our participation in the European Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01582">As for the more distant future, the directive seeks more detailed harmonisation of the standards for driving tests and licensing with a view to improving road safety throughout the Community. This must be right. I should perhaps add that the British driving test is viewed with great interest by the authorities in other countries, because it is thorough and relevant. Even without the stimulus provided by the directive, we should be seeking efforts to copy it; and I believe the commitment to harmonisation will accelerate that progress. If the continuing process gives rise to any proposals for modifying our own system of driver licensing, we shall of course consult both this House and all those organisations which have an interest in these matters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01583">As the House will have observed, this is not an area where rapid change is likely or indeed desirable. But I am pleased to be able to move the approval of a
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0189"/>
<col>361</col>
measure which marks a step of real benefit to individuals within the Community. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01584">Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 22nd July be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Bellwin</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01585">5.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01586"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as noble Lords will observe, this is a set of rather complex regulations and we are very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, for explaining them so clearly to us. Any regulations which have, as their objective, easing the movement of people and assisting them to work and take up residence are to he encouraged. But we must ask ourselves, is this particular harmonisation necessary and desirable and, if it is, is it adequate? Does it in any way militate against Britain's safety standards?<lb/>
We have a number of items to assist us in this discussion. I have read the debate in the other place on the original directive, which took place in November 1980, as well as the guidance note which was issued to various organisations in June this year, and also the detailed memorandum which is contained in the Thirty-Second Report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. However, the noble Lord's explanation has enabled us to understand many of those points more clearly. He mentioned that one argument for this is that as regards Britain the main beneficiaries will be those who are serving in BGF and their dependants, many of whom will have had tests undertaken by military driving examiners and have a BGF driving licence. Although that may be very useful, does it require a Community directive to provide for it? If that was something that we wanted to provide for, surely it could have been dealt with by some other means.<lb/>
On looking through the various propoals, it would appear that a person from another EEC country who takes up residence here may, as we all know, drive on his or her existing licence for 12 months and during that period that person may exchange his or her national licence for a British licence without having to take any tests. Are we satisfied that tests in other EEC countries are satisfactory? How do they compare with the British standards? Is not the harmonisation of those test standards something which is essential if this particular set of regulations is to mean anything?<lb/>
The Minister has said that minimum standards are set for driving tests and health. He also says that in general the British standards are commensurate with those and in many cases exceed them. In the debate in the other place the Under-Secretary of State confirmed that it will be possible for a person to fail a driving test here, but, when living in a Community country, may possibly obtain a licence there and on moving back to Britain the licence may be exchanged within 12 months for a full British licence. The question therefore arises: Can that be justified, particularly if the driving test standard in another member state is much lower than the standard in this country?<lb/>
I note that the Secretary of State in a debate on the directive in the other place in November 1980 commented that in Britain we have a practical test of ability but that several of the European systems place an emphasis on a theoretical test. That is a point that must be considered when considering the different
<col>362</col>
standards of test in the different national countries.<lb/>
Then, as the Minister has said&#x2014;and this is mentioned in the 32nd Report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments in paragraph 2&#x2014;
<quote>"The main obstacle to agreement on the draft directive was the existence in the UK of vocational licence schemes for drivers of heavy goods and public service vehicles."</quote>
The guidance note from the Department of Transport issued in June this year, to which I referred, says:
<quote>"Unlike most of her partners in Europe Britain has separate heavy goods vehicle and public service vehicle licensing arrangements."</quote>
The Minister emphasised that in these connections Britain has a high standard of competence. I am certain that your Lordships will be concerned that in any measures now put before us there is to be no lowering of those standards in this country.<lb/>
We know that the draft directive says that it does not provide expressly for a situation where a separate licence is issued for those particular vehicles, and we do issue those special licences. I recognise that in these regulations there are a number of proposals for safeguards for heavy goods vehicles, particularly the question that a person must either have passed an equivalent test or can show experience of driving similar vehicles in their own country. But this means that within a period of 18 months residence here a person could obtain in exchange a heavy goods vehicle licence in this country without any test whatever. I note that when this matter of the directive was debated in the other place the Opposition proposed an amendment that:
<quote>"no heavy goods vehicle, or passenger service vehicle, licences shall be granted to persons who have not passed tests of standard equivalent to those in the United Kingdom."</quote>
I know that the Minister said that there may be only 200 applications a year, but 200 applications of persons who have not passed any standard to drive any goods vehicles commensurate with that in this country is something with which we should be concerned. The same conditions for the exchange of a heavy goods vehicle licence are to apply in the case of an application for exchange for a public service vehicle licence.<lb/>
As has been stressed in Britain now there is provision that the licensing commissioners may require an applicant for a public service vehicle licence to take a driving test. They may require him to do so. Paragraph 9 of the memorandum of the Department of Transport states.
<quote>"It would be inconsistent to require a person who holds a valid licence of another member state to take a test."</quote>
But I would ask the Minister if the commissioners are not satisfied with the evidence of driving experience, notwithstanding what has been said in the guidance note from the department, will the commissioners have the authority to require a test to be taken so as to ensure the safety provisions of driving public service vehicles?<lb/>
The Minister referred to correspondence from the Transport and General Workers' Union. This is quoted in some detail in columns 461 and 462 in the debate in the other place on the regulations. I understand that, although the union has offered to obtain information they were very concerned about the effect of these regulations on driving standards, particularly as in some European countries a number
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0190"/>
<col>363</col>
of persons who are engaged in heavy goods vehicle driving are self-employed.<lb/>
I recognise that the Government share concern with everyone for safety provisions and have endeavoured to bring a number of those points in these regulations. However, I note that the Secretary of State in the debate on the directive said that in the short term the directive adds very little to Britain's safeguards, but that it does cut out a lot of red tape, and that in the longer term it could contribute to better safety standards generally. It would appear to me, in the light of our own standards in this country, that it will only lead to better standards generally if there is some harmonisation in test standards throughout the Community.<lb/>
May I just raise two other points. I understand that the British licences issued in exchange will be free of any endorsements, even though the existing licence from another member state may have endorsements upon it. The Under-Secretary of State in column 460 in the other place said:
<quote>"With the discrepancies between the various national laws, I think that would he impractical"&#x2014;</quote>
I think she is referring now to these being transferred to the British licences&#x2014;
<quote>"But I shall take advice about it".</quote>
Later, when asked whether, where appropriate, details of penalties could be put on the British licence for our totting up procedure she said in column 472:
<quote>"I simply do not know without conferring with the Home Office, whether that would he practicable".</quote>
It may be asking a lot of the Minister, but is he able to say whether or not there has been consultation with the Home Office so that we may have an answer to that important point? If a licence from another member state being exchanged for a British licence has a number of endorsements, it would be wrong for them not to be transferred to the British licence.<lb/>
Finally, in the memorandum from the Department of Transport, paragraph 15 indicates that for the purposes of a common transport policy of the Community Gibraltar is included in the term "United Kingdom". It goes on to say that as there are no powers there is:
<quote>"an intention to take the next opportunity to include such exchanges in primary legislation presented to Parliament".</quote>
If the Government therefore intend to have primary legislation introduced in Parliament to meet that point would not this also he an opportunity to make other bilateral arrangements for the transfer of driving licences with other states in addition to those of the Community? There is value in the exchange in the Community proposals but surely, even if we do not want a wide-sweeping provision, there ought to be some bilateral arrangements with other states. With those points, I generally commend the regulations, but there are some problems attached to them which I hope I have been able to explain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01587">5.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01588"><member>Lord Bellwin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, for quite properly raising again certain aspects of what is proposed. I am glad to try to give some clarification to him. It is true, as he said, that various criticisms have been made on the scope of
<col>364</col>
enforcement. I have to stress that it is no part of the aims of the directive to improve the enforcement of the traffic laws in this or any member state. This is concerned with the issue of driving licences and does not touch on their endorsement or withdrawal for offences under national law except by implication.<lb/>
However, I should make it clear that if a person applying here for an exchange has a current disqualification in this country the licence can, and will, be refused. If a person's licence has been withdrawn in the country which issued it he, or she, will not get an exchange because he, or she, will be unable to produce a valid licence. In the case of applicants for vocational licences the normal application form must he completed stating any recent convictions. The licensing authority may take these into account in exactly the same way as convictions in Britain declared by a British applicant.<lb/>
Further than that it is not possible to go. Road traffic laws are not identical even between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, let alone among other Community countries. For foreign courts' convictions to be recorded on our licences would be to give them jurisdiction to order the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre to enter those matters in its driver records. Even if that were to be enacted&#x2014;and I stress that it would represent a major and controversial step in an area of basic constitutional importance&#x2014;such a transfer of endorsements would not be practicable unless there was an exact correspondence between national laws so that everything which was an offence in another Community state was an offence in British law. For my part, I cannot foresee the day when that will come about. I think it must follow that the enforcement aspects of the British licensing system remain apart from those aspects to which these regulations are directed and with which the directive itself is concerned.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, expressed anxiety about the standards of other Community driving tests. It is true that, from our point of view, many of them leave room for improvements. It is also possible that when the further discussions on harmonisation foreseen by the directive have started, they will reveal some respects in which we can improve our own requirements, although we have reason to believe that in all major respects our tests are the most thorough. What the directive offers is a framework within which we can press our partners for a general levelling up of standards, and I believe there are already signs of that. There can he no question of a levelling down.<lb/>
This levelling up is of real benefit because it means that the standard of driving in the Community will be slowly but surely improved. That affects safety on the roads everywhere, above all for those who encounter visiting drivers from other member states on the roads here and those who take their holidays on the Continent or drive there on business, all matters which are a fact of life already. Allowing quite a small number of Community licence-holders to have our licences, regardless of what tests they have taken in the past once they become resident here, is, I submit, a small price to pay for setting in motion this major force of improvements. Let us not forget that a large proportion, probably the majority, of those who exchange licences will he our own citizens returning from periods of residence on the Continent.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0191"/>
<col>365</col>
The noble Lord was also properly concerned that there should be no lowering of standards concerning vocational licences. I went in some detail in my opening remarks into the safeguards for the exchange of vocational licences. There is a balance to he struck here. The directive is a hard-won compromise between the commitment to free movement which we accepted on accession to the community and our right to maintain our high standards in the interests of road safety. That directive is a commitment and the emphasis is now on the administrative arrangements to ensure that this balance is kept in the assessment of individual applications. I have made it clear that the Department of Transport will pass on to the licensing authorities any useful information to assist them in this task.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked what would happen if the commissioners were not satisfied. If they are not satisfied, they can refuse a licence. The driver can then take a test or, of course, appeal to magistrates, and I assume that they would then take his or her experience into account in considering the matter. I hope I have covered in the main the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, quite properly expressed by him because, as we have both said, these are complex matters. They have been evolved over a period of time, they are an attempt to move in what I think it fair to call the right direction and I am sure they will take us further down the road of harmonisation in all matters of this kind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01592">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I thank in anticipation all those on all sides of the House who are taking part in this debate. I understand that I shall not have the right to thank them afterwards, so I am doing so now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01593">Like many Members of this House, I have many other outside interests, and two of them are pertinent to my Question this evening. For over 25 years I have been a magistrate and for an equal length of time I have worked with leagues of hospital friends, and it was in that capacity that I was invited to visit Rampton again some 18 months ago and I have been there on several occasions recently. On 22nd May 1979, Yorkshire Television showed a programme about Rampton Hospital which was to have three important repercussions; first, the police were at once put into the hospital, and they are still there; secondly, the Boynton Committee was set up; and thirdly, confidence in the hospital at all levels was shattered and a trail of havoc has followed. At no time did the people making the film go into the hospital.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01594">Rampton is one of four special hospitals. It is an austere building set in austere countryside in Nottinghamshire. In 1961 there were 975 patients.</p>
<col>366</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01595">Today there are 662, 497 male and 165 female; 42.6 per cent. suffer from mental illness, 22.8 per cent. from psychopathic disorder, 18 per cent. from subnormality and 16.6 per cent. from severe subnormality; 265 patients are unrestricted and 397 are restricted and therefore cannot he discharged without the consent of the Home Secretary; 81 per cent. of males come from courts following convictions, 34 per cent. of women are from the courts and only 26 per cent. are restricted. At the beginning of this month there were 1,037 members of staff, of whom 683 were nursing staff, 447 males and 236 females. Nearly all the staff are members of the Prison Officers' Association.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01596">The criteria for admittance to a special hospital is that a patient is dangerous, violent or has criminal propensities. When their treatment is finished they are transferred to National Health hospitals or hostels. Unfortunately, at this time 111 patients are awaiting places. I am told that recidivism is very low, which is a comforting thought.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01597">The Boynton Committee was set up in the autumn of 1979. As a result of very hard detailed work while living in the hospital, the report contained over 200 recommendations. It also contained specific references to the dedication and care of the nursing staff and the help given by the voluntary leagues of hospital friends. The report was also of the opinion that the school of nursing should be maintained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01598">Recommendations already implemented include the appointment of the Rampton review board of six members, who are making a big impact in the life of the hospital, and the setting up of the hospital medical team, who have day to day responsibilities; that came into operation in June 1981. There was also the appointment of a medical director, who took up his post last spring, as well as other medical appointments. Improvements for the patients include provision of their own lockers and the making available of interview rooms on 13 wards to date, with the hope of more to come. Transistor radios apparently were very important, and patients are allowed to use them in bed. Ties do not have to be worn, except on the admission ward. Auto-shavers are in use, and, to hide the bare walls, pictures, peg boards and posters have been put up. Those are only a few of the very many improvements which have recently been made. The League of Friends gives considerable help by visiting and by arranging coaches for visitors from long distances, and it is now arranging very well-publicised horse-riding lessons. These are very much appreciated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01599">As I have said, Boynton also made a point of the retention of the school of nursing. Therefore the morale of the nursing staff was recently lowered again when they were told by the General Nursing Council that the school must close. I am told that the intake to the school is unusual, in that mature people often join, perhaps after early retirement in the social fields, and they find a rewarding vocation in nursing the mentally ill. I hope that the Minister will use his considerable influence and powers of persuasion to see that the unit is retained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01600">In one of my semi-judicial capacities I was able to meet eminent psychiatrists. I have written to several of them, and they have been kind enough to give me their professional opinions. I asked whether they thought that patients' evidence of alleged incidents that may
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0192"/>
<col>367</col>
have happened up to 21 years ago could be relied upon. The replies from all but one ranged from, "Probably not", to "No". One said that he thought possibly an incident could be remembered. One doctor gave the view that six years was the maximum period of memory retention. However, all agreed&#x2014;which is very rare with psychiatrists&#x2014;that, because of the nature of the illness, patients are prone to exaggeration, suffer from delusions, often go out of their way to make trouble, and can frequently be vicious.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01601">We know of course that even the non-violent patients assault nursing staff. When I visit wards I am aware that I am closely guarded in case of an attack. Although attempts have been made in the past to institute a code of practice for nursing in the special hospitals, so far it has not been found possible to formulate one which covers every contingency at Rampton. That might be one reason why nurses have been charged by the police, and indeed have even had to stand trial.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01602">Of course as a magistrate I agree that offenders must pay the price for their offences. I am also aware that there might be a substandard apple in a barrel. But, my Lords, in my submission it is not possible for a police officer, who is not trained in psychiatry, who does not have the day to day responsibility of coping with, treating, and trying to cure patients&#x2014;who often are very sick and violent&#x2014;to differentiate between what might happen in the streets outside and what occasionally can happen when dealing with patients. For instance, the problems of stopping a violent street brawl and stopping violent patients from fighting must be similar, but the difference is that the police officer is not likely to be charged with assault, while the nursing officer might well be charged. It was because of&#x2014;and only because of&#x2014;the lack of a code of practice that nurses recently withdrew escort duties, but the review board, with all the interested parties, is now working on this matter and normal duties have been resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01603">The police have been in the hospital for over three years. The net result to date is that there have been charged with offences 21 nurses, six of whom retired or resigned before trial. Charges have been of ill-treatment of patients under Section 126 of the Mental Health Act 1959, and a small number of charges have been preferred under Sections 18 and 47 of the 1861 Act, which are for offences against the person. All charges relate to alleged incidents between 1961&#x2013;22 years ago&#x2014;and 1979. Four nurses were found not guilty at Crown Court. Two were found not guilty at magistrates' courts, and two charges were dropped by the department of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01604">Last Friday at Nottingham the learned judge dismissed most of the charges against four of the nurses, saying that there was insufficient evidence and that the alleged offences were too long ago. Three other nurses were convicted by a jury, and the learned judge awarded nine months, suspended for two years, against two of them and three years, suspended for 18 months, against the other. All six nurses earlier found not guilty have been reinstated at the hospital.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01605">Meanwhile, the nurses are carrying on their very difficult duties with care and devotion, but they are ever mindful that each one of them may receive a summons to attend Worksop police station to answer
<col>368</col>
a charge relating to an incident that is alleged to have happened many years ago. Meanwhile, also, some of the patients are taunting the nurses with threats of "telling on" them to the police. No one can go on working under those conditions of considerable tension. Staff are now weary, deeply disillusioned, frustrated and tired of the endless stress.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01606">I am glad to know that the Secretary of State and my noble friend the Minister on the Front Bench have recently been to Rampton. I should like to say, for what it is worth, that I have enormous admiration for everyone working at the hospital. In asking the Minister to use his good offices in the right quarters to withdraw the police from the hospital. I am sure that a new spirit, a new hope, a new confidence in a new challenge will make Rampton Hospital the great place of care and healing that it has always been.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01607">5.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01608"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am mindful of the fact that this is not a short debate, but an Unstarred Question, and therefore it behoves me not to make a speech, but merely to elaborate a little upon the noble Baroness's Question, and perhaps add one or two questions of my own. I thank the noble Baroness for drawing the attention of your Lordships' House to this matter of vital public importance&#x2014;and it is a matter of public importance, not of importance merely to those at Rampton.<lb/>
In thanking the noble Baroness for her initiative in seeing that this very important matter is noticed and is discussed in your Lordships' House, perhaps it would be appropriate if I also make clear that though the noble Baroness and I are at one on this particular Question, we do not necessarily see eye to eye on all the various matters involved in the history of the events. Indeed, I would say that I differ a little from the noble Baroness in my attitude to the original film by Yorkshire Television&#x2014;I think it was entitled "The Secret Hospital"&#x2014;shown in May 1979. I do not for a moment say that everything that was said or suggested in that programme was true. Indeed, we now know that a great deal that was said and suggested was not true. But in my view events and public opinion at that time were such that it was perhaps necessary for somebody to draw attention to the whole matter&#x2014;and Yorkshire Television did that.<lb/>
Following that, as the noble Baroness has said, we then had the Boynton Inquiry. I welcomed the Boynton Inquiry, and indeed I warmly welcomed many of the matters in the report. Here, perhaps I might take the liberty of reminding the noble Lord the Minister who is presently to reply of two very brief sentences in the Boynton Report which seemed to me to be very important. They are brief, and I will quote them. In the report (Cmnd. 8073) on page 22, paragraph 5.12, we see this stated by the Boynton Inquiry:
<quote>"We think that Rampton operates too much as a closed and secretive institution".</quote>
We also see, if we look at the detailed recommendations at the end of the report&#x2014;and the noble Baroness has referred to these&#x2014;that Recommendation 203, on page 152, says this:
<quote>"Less emphasis can and should be placed at Rampton on the provisions of the Official Secrets Act".</quote>
My Lords, I should merely like to ask the noble Lord
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0193"/>
<col>369</col>
who is to reply whether progress has in fact been made since those days on those matters, because I share the view of the Boynton Report that it really is very important indeed that institutions such as Rampton, Broadmoor and so on should be exposed to public scrutiny as much as is possible, bearing in mind the need for the staff to be able to get on with their work.<lb/>
So I hope that progess has been made with opening up these institutions to public scrutiny, but I would go on to say that doing those things&#x2014;and I think it is necessary to do those things&#x2014;certainly does not in my view require a permanent police presence. As the noble Baroness has rightly reminded the House, the events into which the police were very properly and correctly inquiring took place a very long time ago, and very few of the present staff at Rampton were in any way concerned in those events. Indeed, many of the present staff at Rampton were not working in the hospital at all.<lb/>
Perhaps I could go on to say that it seems t o me that the police have more urgent and pressing matters to get on with than merely living permanently in Rampton Hospital. They have very important work to do. Indeed, I might suggest, if this is not digressing too much, in relation to the deplorable events which took place at a public meeting of the police with the Home Secretary and the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police in London recently, that to my mind the behaviour of the police then was not really related to resentment about low pay. I think it was related in many ways to the tact that the police as a whole are desperately overworked; and while they are desperately overworked I think it is very important to see that numbers of policemen, from whatever force they may come, should not be tied up indefinitely in continuing an operation such as that which has been going on for so very long at Rampton.<lb/>
Indeed, too, the situation and the climate of opinion have changed. I think, as I said before, it was right that the police went in and carried out a thorough investigation. But they have had long enough to complete that, and I take very much the point that was made by the noble Baroness: it is not helpful to members of staff doing a highly difficult job in extremely difficult circumstances to have the constant feeling of a police presence somewhere looking over their shoulders and looking over their work. I repeat that I think it is necessary that these places should be open to public scrutiny; but, of course, that is going on now. We shall be dealing with another measure in your Lordships' House in a day or two, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, which sets up a mental health commission and sets up machinery whereby hospitals will be under continuing scrutiny from the point of view of public interest.<lb/>
Therefore, I think there are a number of developments which have taken place since those days in 1979 which surely make it important that the police presence in Rampton should be removed at the earliest possible moment. I hope that in replying the noble Lord the Minister will be able to tell us why it is that after such a long time they are still there; and I hope that he will, perhaps, tell us that it will be possible for that police presence to be ended very soon. And if that is as a result of the initiative which the noble Baroness has taken today, then I would join with so

many other noble Lords in your Lordships' House in thanking her for having done what she has done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01609">6.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01610"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we should he grateful to my noble friend Lady Macleod for initiating this debate. Quite apart from the merits of the debate, it is, so far as I know, the first debate in which as many Peeresses will be taking part as noble Lords. That is a fine demonstration of sympathetic sex equality in your Lordships' House. My Lords, I was chairman of MENCAP at the time, 3&#x00BD; years ago, when this matter came to light, and we were extremely worried because, in addition to the psychopaths, some of them very violent, and the mentally ill at Rampton, there are a number of people there who are simply mentally handicapped to various degrees. Indeed, quite a number of our parent members have or have had mentally handicapped sons and daughters there, including our founder member.<lb/>
My Lords, it became abundantly plain, when investigations were started after Yorkshire Television did their rather sensational filming of this, that the problem arose through a minority of the staff who were in charge of the most violent patients perhaps exceeding the force that was necessary. It is not for me to question, and I do not question, the action taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the results of the cases in the courts. I was most relieved, however, to hear my noble friend Lady Macleod say what has happened in the case (which we should not discuss any further) so far as discharges from certain charges are concerned.<lb/>
My Lords, Rampton has a very wide range of people there for treatment. Some, as I say, are suffering from various degrees of mental handicap, and you go right through various degrees of mental illness to the truly violent psychopaths. It has seemed to us at MENCAP that perhaps not enough care has been taken to separate those three categories, and I suggest that all the information which has come out points at the real necessity for a complete separation of those three categories of people&#x2014;the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and those with violent criminal tendencies. I do not think that that is a counsel of perfection. I would have thought that as a practical matter it was something which needed to be done. Perhaps by now it been done&#x2014;we do not know; we may hear this evening. But it is certainly something which should be done, and which, if it has not yet been done, then I hope it soon will be.<lb/>
So far as the police are concerned, whatever the original complaints against the minority of staff in the 1970s, there can be no justification, in my opinion, for keeping the police there indefinitely. I hope I am not being emotive when I say that it cannot help the staff in this very difficult and demanding work indefinitely to have the police breathing down their necks. Unless it is really necessary, it should not happen; and I cannot believe that it is necessary any longer, after all that has happened in the last three years. So I hope that we shall hear from my noble friend Lord Trefgarne this evening that the suggestions made by my noble friend Lady Macleod have been heeded by the Government and by those responsible for the administration of our criminal law, for whom I have such

admiration. I hope we can call this a closed chapter before long.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01612"><member>The Countess of Loudoun</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is now over three years since I visited Rampton with the All-Party Parliamentary Mental Health Group, since which time the staff there have been coping with the difficulties caused by the continuing police inquiries and the court cases, some still in progress. Rampton has an enormously difficult and demanding task to fulfil. It has to deal with a population that almost all other institutions and services have failed. On June 1st 1982, there were still 106 people on the "approved for transfer" list at Rampton, despite there having been a more positive response from local hospitals recently, 174 patients having left the hospital in 1981. Rampton has its Eastdale unit for rehabilitation which could offer eleven more places were the funds available but there is no similar unit at all for female patients and the other special hospitals have none either, to my knowledge.<lb/>
May I ask the Government what the present situation is with regard to the interim secure units? These units were planned to relieve the pressure on the special hospitals but to do this effectively more of these secure units need to he established. Without these, the ordinary psychiatric hospitals will continue to evade their responsibilities for dealing with difficult or unlikeable patients under the Mental Health Act. Since the establishment of a new hospital management at Rampton with the appointment of a medical director, Dr. Alfred Minto, and a review hoard with management responsibility for the hospital, a distinct mental handicap division of approximately 250 men and women has been set up under the care of three newly-appointed consultant psychiatrists who are responsible for both medical and psychiatric care.<lb/>
Now, Rampton Hospital wants very much to get on with its job. Its medical director, Dr. Alfred Minto, is very keen to bring Rampton into the mainstream of current psychiatric thought and progress and is actively organising seminars, lectures and such to further this purpose. The hospital needs help to reduce its sense of isolation and, with this in view, useful links with neighbouring universities have been established, such as with the School of Social Work at Leicester University. I understand from Mr. Herschel Prins, the director of this school, that they now have various joint activities with Rampton including the placement of social work students. This training and education programme could be extended into the post-qualifying field to include the utilisation of Rampton's facilities; but to do this adequately it needs a continuing injection of funds. This is crucial. Let us not dwell on the past with all its mistakes but look to the future&#x2014;a brighter one, I trust. I should like to pay tribute to all the dedicated officers and staff at Rampton and I wish them well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01613">6.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01614"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I am sure your Lordships will agree, to perform many tasks in the nursing profession calls for the very finest qualities. Psychiatric nursing in particular makes huge demands and asks for almost superhuman strength of character.<lb/>
<col>372</col>
Any one of us who has seen the quiet and patient concern and understanding shown by those psychiatric nurses who really find a vocation in such hospitals is left inspired and admiring. Obviously, it would be impractically idealistic to expect all nurses to reach this standard of dedication, but the unselfishness displayed really does deserve the best support of those of us lucky enough to be neither patients nor nurses in those hospitals.<lb/>
Many of us have felt very disturbed about the difficult conditions for staff at Rampton; so now we are deeply indebted to my noble friend Lady Macleod for giving us this chance to talk about it and for her fact-filled speech. In addition, I should like to back up the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Renton as to categorisation of patients. For a long time I have felt that categorisation of schizophrenic patients alone is something that has not been attended to nearly enough. I hope his appeal today will be heard in wider circles.<lb/>
In all our thoughts must be anxiety about the morale of nurses working in such taxing circumstances. It seems quite astonishing that so few nurses have thrown in the sponge and left the hospital for good. Nevertheless, it is interesting to know how many of those who have been involved in court cases have later been reinstated. Undoubtedly the morale of the staff at Rampton deserves to he well and truly boosted. These people are carrying out duties that few of the rest of us could claim to have the care and compassion to do. Therefore, the least that we can do is to back up my noble friend lady Macleod in her requests to the Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01615">6.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01616"><member>Baroness Faithful!</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must thank the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, for asking this Unstarred Question today, but I have to ask the indulgence of your Lordships because I cannot speak directly to the Motion as it is now eight years since I went to Rampton. But, having said that, four patients to whom I was social worker came to see me within the last few months and I am in touch with them. They are now all, except for one, out in the community and working. I think that that is a tribute to the work done at Rampton.<lb/>
That is not to say that they have not got some complaints. It would be quite unnatural if they had not; but the complaints were something quite different. The complaints concerned the siting of the hospital. Oxford to Retford and on to Rampton is a terribly difficult journey and the great complaint of the patients with whom I was in personal touch was that they were losing touch with their families. Their families could not visit, their families could not afford to visit and, when they did visit, it had very often to be with one of us social workers because often that was the only way that the family could get to Rampton. If patients are unable to be in touch with their families, they become more disturbed than they are already. I think that we have not looked closely enough at what it is that really disturbs the patients at Rampton. They are disturbed. But not to be in touch with your family, to be miles away from your family, and not to be visited by them, causes great concern. Very often it is only to their families that they will tell
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0195"/>
<col>373</col>
anything that they are deeply worried about. Therefore, my Lords, my question to the Minister, alongside the Unstarred Question which the noble Baroness has asked, is this: Is there any possibility that there could be regionalisation of the special hospitals, particularly Rampton? As the noble Baroness has said, we have four hospitals in this country; but Rampton is particularly and peculiarly difficult to get to.<lb/>
The noble Baroness spoke with warmth of the League of Hospital Friends, and I support her tribute to them. Canon Mason, the chairman, arranges outings for the patients and, where possible, he arranges for patients' families to come along. But this cannot be very often. At Broadmoor there are 800 visitors visiting patients who have no family to visit them. There are three such visitors at Rampton. The reason why there are three of these visitors at Rampton is because of its remoteness and the fact that it is right out in the country. Despite the points made by the noble Countess, Lady Loudoun, who told us of the interest taken by the universities, university people come and go. What is needed is consistency, and what is needed is the same person visiting year after year. So my question to the Minister&#x2014;and I repeat it&#x2014;is this: Is there any hope of setting up smaller hospitals in different parts of the country and regionalising the special hospitals? This would be an asset not only to the patients whose families could keep in touch with them, but to the staff and thus to the running of the hospital.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01618"><member>Lady Kinloss</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is just over three years since I visited Rampton in October 1979, but it was an unforgettable experience. The distressful state of mind of many of the patients was equalled only by one's admiration for the devotion and skill of the staff. It is because of this that it is most fitting that the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod of Borve, should have asked this Question this evening.<lb/>
For more than three years publicity has been directed against certain members of the staff who may or may not have felt or displayed temper under extreme provocation. Some have paid the penalties of the law for it&#x2014;others have a cloud hanging over them. Surely it is high time that this was brought to a conclusion for the sake of both nurses and patients. It is to be expected that mentally ill or mentally handicapped patients will have delusions about ill-treatment on the part of the staff and then forget what they have said. Is it possible that the memories of mentally ill or mentally handicapped patients can be relied upon over a short period, let alone a long one? We all know how difficult it often appears to be for details to be remembered by apparently sane witnesses.<lb/>
What has happened to the code of practice for Rampton? Why has it not yet been formulated? I believe it is under urgent discussion, but could not the medical director promulgate a set of draft guidelines with the proviso that they could be modified or disused after the final code of practice has been agreed? The reason why the nurses recently withdrew from their escort duties but have since continued those duties was because of a lack of a code. One has to remember that nurses have from time to time to deal with violent patients and must be allowed to use such force as is
<col>374</col>
necessary to restrain them, to protect not only themselves but others, and to prevent the unfortunate patients from hurting themselves.<lb/>
I am glad to know that the review board proposed by Sir John Boynton in his report on Rampton has been set up and is operating. I was also glad to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, say that it is giving great help. Could the Minister say whether it is likely to continue after its three years (I think that is the period) are up? Could the Minister when he replies also say whether nursing auxiliaries are or can he employed at Rampton? It seems to me to be wholly reasonable that no nurse should ever be alone with violent patients in view of the danger both of possible violence and of unfounded allegations. It is here perhaps that nursing auxiliaries could be of real help, where the highest degree of nursing skill is not involved.<lb/>
My Lords, I should like to ask the Minister who is to reply what opportunities the staff have for transfer to other institutions. After several years nurses might well feel that they would benefit from a change of scene within their profession. Every week one reads in the newspapers of the posting of members of the armed services and others. Such changes could perhaps be beneficial to both the nurses and the patients, and maybe a grant or payment to help them with the move would be possible.<lb/>
In <i>The Times</i> of last Saturday, 23rd October, there was a report about Rampton. Three nurses were acquitted of the charges. The offences were alleged to have taken place in 1961 and one nurse is now stated to be 71 years old. The judge said:
<quote>"There was no supporting evidence for the allegations, and since the events were said to have taken place 21 years ago, recollections could be dimmed."</quote>
Would the Minister say whether there are many such cases outstanding of stale charges? If there are, is it not time that there should be an end to it? How can there he peace at Rampton if nurses continue to be kept in suspense and under suspicion? How can the nurses under these circumstances be expected to impart a sense of security and confidence to the patients who are at Rampton precisely because they need those things?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01620"><member>Lord Auckland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although this is a very important Question directed towards a relatively narrow point and has been asked by my noble friend Lady Macleod with her usual sensitivity and compassion, this particular very disturbing Question raises wider issues, although I do not propose to go into that situation this evening.<lb/>
I have not visited Rampton or any of the other special hospitals; but obviously, anybody who has served on the committee of a mental hospital will take a very deep interest in the situation at Rampton Hospital. One of the great problems of this hospital&#x2014;and although I have not visited Rampton I am reasonably familiar with some of the territory around that area&#x2014;is that it is six miles from Retford, which is the nearest main line station. The weekend services to Retford, particularly the Sunday rail services, are not particularly frequent. That means that people coming from the London area, for example, or from the South of England who may have
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0196"/>
<col>375</col>
relatives and friends at Rampton, find it difficult for weekend visiting. I understand from the admirable Boynton Report that Monday is the other day for official visits. This may be somewhat more convenient for travelling, but obviously it is not so for those who have other jobs to perform.<lb/>
A few weeks ago there was a very disturbing series of television programmes on the women's prison at Styal in Cheshire. I only mention this because two of the women in this programme, who were looked after with great devotion by the wardresses of that hospital&#x2014;and there was no question of any ill-treatment there&#x2014;were, certainly so far as I could tell, confirmed psychopaths who should certainly be in an institution such as Rampton. But as my noble friend has already stated, there are a number of inmates or patients in Rampton already waiting to be transferred to other establishments. Here is the very difficult anomaly which must face any mental health tribunal, review board or indeed Her Majesty's Government. I should like to ask my noble friend: what consideration has been given to this point?<lb/>
Two hundred and two recommendations were made in the outstandingly clear report from Sir John Boynton. Obviously, in an Unstarred Question, one cannot go into details about these, but one concerns the matter of night duty. I accept that many of these recommendations have been acted upon or are, hopefully, in course of being acted upon. I should like to ask: what is the present situation regarding night duty? Twenty years of consistent night duty, which is stated as having taken place so far as some nurses are concerned, seems to be an inordinately long time, particularly with such disturbed patients.<lb/>
The League of Friends at Rampton and elsewhere perform the most marvellous job. Indeed, one wonders how any hospital, be it a general hospital, a psychiatric hospital or a special hospital of any kind, could function at all so far as the welfare of patients is concerned without the League of Friends; and so I should like to pay a real tribute to them.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to ask my noble friend the Minister whether he can to tell your Lordships how many of the 202 recommendations regarding Rampton Hospital, as instanced in the Boynton Report, have been acted upon or are in the process of being acted upon. My noble friend, happily, has mentioned some of the more important points, such as transistor sets in rooms and improvements in bus transport and so on. I would hope that facilities will be made available for more of your Lordships and Members of the other place who have not yet visited these places to do so, because I believe that Members of both Houses of Parliament have a duty, and particularly those of us who are interested in this question of mental health at whatever level, to make ourselves acquainted with these establishments where very hardworking and hard-pressed nursing staffs are looking after extremely difficult patients who are frequently violent through no fault of their own.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01622"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first may I say that the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, in thanking her supporters, as she expected, in advance, has
<col>376</col>
certainly got the results she asked for. Because so many Members have spoken, giving very briefly their expertise, my job from these Benches is to speak as briefly as possible in order to give the noble Lord as much time as he needs and deserves to reply.<lb/>
Let us face it, the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, has painted a serious and worrying picture which must give cause for concern, and in raising this issue for us tonight she has done a good service. I would particularly agree with her that it is a mistake to close or to envisage closing the school of nursing. This does have an effect on the morale of the nursing profession because a school of nursing does confer prestige on a hospital, and nurses are naturally very proud and conscious of the prestige of their profession. I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, that surely something could be evolved without having to call in the police.<lb/>
I would also agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull&#x2014;and how right she is&#x2014;and also with the noble Lord, Lord Auckland, that the lack of visitors and distance from family can cause worry and unrest in addition to other things, and this does not help the patient's condition. That, of course, applies not only to Rampton, but to Her Majesty's prisons as well, as your Lordships will realise.<lb/>
I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the mental hospital staffs and particularly to the nurses, not only at Rampton, but generally throughout the country, because we must recognise that theirs is a very difficult job calling for extreme patience and skill. I recollect some years ago visiting a Durham hospital and going through the women's section (where a male has to be closely escorted) with a matron. It was very touching indeed to see some women touch the matron's cloak and give every sign of happiness in so doing. That impressed me so much that I cannot forget that particular picture.<lb/>
Let us also recognise that some patients, because of their illness, can be unpredictable in behaviour and sudden violence may arise which puts the nurse at risk. This is something they always have to be prepared to face as part of their job in the course of their duties. I well remember many years ago having to help a male nurse whose skull had been fractured by a patient suddenly hitting him over the head with a chair. So it is not only a question of patient care; it is a matter of looking after the staff as well. In special hospitals, such as Rampton, obviously the risk of patients becoming violent is even greater, because of the special category of patients.<lb/>
As has already been indicated, there is at present no code of practice and I agree that it would be extremely difficult to formulate such a code: but some nurses have to work in difficult conditions and at greater risk than their colleagues in other mental hospitals. As we are to evolve a code of practice generally for our mental hospitals, I am wondering whether it would not be possible in the proposals in the Bill which is still before Parliament to extend it to special hospitals, because in this case a different code of practice would need to be evolved.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Minister for some reassurance on another point. Although I am open to correction on this, I understand that tribunals which will be set up under the new Bill would not apply to special hospitals, I hope I am wrong here, but if they
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0197"/>
<col>377</col>
can be brought forward for special hospitals I think it would ease the present position. I think that such tribunals, in the case of special hospitals, would have to be separately staffed in order to deal with the problems they would face. I would say in passing that it seems incredible that witnesses should be asked for evidence of incidents going back some 20 years. It looks as though there is some lag on tribunals in this case, which would he eased if we brought in special tribunals for the future.<lb/>
Patients have rights, and legislation which is before Parliament will advance them. I refer specifically, of course, to the new Bill; but we must not overlook the fact that staff have rights too, and protection must also be extended to them. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, will be able to indicate the present position and say what steps, if any, the Government are prepared to take to improve the matters which have been so well outlined by the noble Baroness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01623">6.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01624"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must, of course, start by thanking my noble friend for bringing this Question to the attention of your Lordships. I should like, before responding to the debate, to pay tribute to the valuable work which she does as national Chairman of the Leagues of Hospital Friends, but particularly for the interest she has shown in Rampton Hospital and the encouragement which she has given to the staff working in the hospital during a very difficult period. The League of Friends of Rampton Hospital, under the chairmanship of Canon Mason, have given considerable support over the years to patients at the hospital, to patients' visitors and to the staff, and I gladly include them in this tribute. I know something of the great lengths to which my noble friend has gone in giving her personal support to Canon Mason and his colleagues and to all at the hospital.<lb/>
Since I took up my present ministerial appointment, in which I have a particular concern with mental health services, I have visited a large number of hospitals and other units, to get a first-hand impression of the work which they are doing. I have a particular concern with the special hospitals and I did, in fact, visit Rampton Hospital, as part of my preparation for this debate, on Friday, 15th October. This provided me with a most valuable opportunity to meet the local managers of the hospital, and staff representatives, and to visit many of the wards and departments where I was able to talk to a large number of patients and individual members of the staff.<lb/>
I think I should first make some general comments about the special hospital service as a whole, before moving to the particular situation at Rampton Hospital. There are four special hospitals, the others being Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire&#x2014;probably the best known&#x2014;and two hospitals situated just north of Liverpool, which I have also visited recently. These are Moss Side Hospital, which has been in use since the 1930s, and the completely new Park Lane Hospital, which is still being built, although it already accommodates some 200 patients in facilities which I believe are as good as could be found anywhere in the world. The buildings at the other special hospitals obviously do not compare with these, but the care provided in them is, of course, of an equally high standard.<lb/>
<col>378</col>
The four special hospitals are provided in accordance with Section 4 of the National Health Service Act 1977, which places on the Secretary of State for Social Services a duty,
<quote>"to provide and maintain establishments for persons subject to detention under the Mental Health Act 1959 who, in his opinion, require treatment under conditions of special security on account of their dangerous, violent or criminal propensities".</quote>
Since the point is sometimes misunderstood, I think I should emphasise that this is the only basis upon which people are admitted to special hospitals. Most of the patients have been sent there from the courts, but the special hospitals are places of treatment and not in any sense of punishment. In fact, nearly 25 per cent. of all the patients in these hospitals were not admitted in connection with any offence, but were transferred from other psychiatric hospitals or admitted direct from the community.<lb/>
There are hundreds of thousands of people who at any one time are suffering from some form of mental disorder. Seven thousand people are compulsorily detained under the Mental health Act. Of these, only 1,750 are in the special hospitals. We are thus concerned with a tiny minority of mental patients who, for some time at least, require to be treated under conditions of special security. Unlike all other hospitals in the National Health Service, these four hospitals are the direct responsibility of my department, and the 2,800 staff who work in them are employees of my department. The hospitals are, as I have said, provided under the terms of the National Health Service Act, and the care and treatment given in them is part of the total spectrum of health care which the National Health Service provides.<lb/>
I turn now to Rampton Hospital. This hospital is situated in a rural area near Retford in Nottinghamshire. My noble friend described it as austere countryside. But I must say that I thought it was rather beautiful when I visited the district the other day. Originally opened in 1912, the hospital was responsible from 1920 onwards for the care of mentally handicapped people under secure conditions, when it operated under the direction of the former Board of Control. Since 1959, the hospital has been the direct responsibility of my department. The number of patients in the hospital has fallen significantly in recent years. At the present time, as my noble friend said, there are about 650 patients&#x2014;three-quarters of them male and one-quarter female. There has also been a substantial shift in the types of patient in the hospital; less than half of the total are now suffering from mental handicap. I will deal with the point raised by my noble friend Lord Renton in a moment.<lb/>
At Rampton Hospital, as in all the special hospitals, a full range of therapeutic treatment is provided and there is a variety of industrial and other occupations. Care is provided by a number of disciplines, including doctors, nurses, psychologists and social workers. In total, there are about 1,000 staff employed at the hospital, some 670 of whom are nursing staff. I think it may be helpful to quote these figures&#x2014;some 650 patients cared for by 1,000 staff&#x2014;to indicate to your Lordships the scale of the task which is undertaken in this hospital.<lb/>
On 22nd May, 1979, as my noble friend reminded your Lordships, a film about Rampton Hospital was
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0198"/>
<col>379</col>
shown on independent television. The film, which was entitled "The Secret Hospital", included many serious allegations of ill-treatment of patients by members of the staff at the hospital. The then Secretary of State, my right honourable friend Mr. Patrick Jenkin, referred these allegations to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who arranged for the allegations to be investigated by the Nottinghamshire police. It is the protracted nature of these inquiries which has given rise to the concern expressed by my noble friend and other noble Lords and Baronesses who have spoken this evening.<lb/>
Mr. Jenkin also announced his intention to institute a thorough review of the organisation and facilities at the hospital. A review team was subsequently appointed under the chairmanship of Sir John Boynton. In October 1980, the review team produced a comprehensive report, which was published in full and which included more than 200 separate recommendations. If your Lordships will allow me, I will deal with some of those recommendations in a moment. But, for now, may I just refer to the central one, which was the establishment of a special health authority, to be known as the Rampton Hospital Review Board, to take over responsibility for the local management of the hospital and to ensure the implementation of the Boynton team's recommendations.<lb/>
The review board assumed its responsibility in September 1981. The chairman of the board, who devotes two day a week&#x2014;as well as a lot of other time&#x2014;to the management of the hospital, is Mr. Leslie Teeman, a leading businessman in the East Midlands. Mr. Teeman and his colleagues on the board, originally five and now six, undertook a challenging task when they accepted their appointments. Changes were needed at the hospital, but it was not a case of starting from scratch. As the Boynton team had acknowledged, and as the members of the review board came to recognise, there was already much that was good about Rampton Hospital, a fact which has received all too little recognition in the various public comments. The staff of the hospital were providing dedicated care for some of the most seriously mentally disordered patients in the country. All of those staff had been bruised by the general accusations which were then flying about. Rampton Hospital is a human institution and it is not surprising that the morale of many staff in the hospital had been undermined, initially by the sensational accusations being made, and subsequently by the extensive, but entirely necessary, police inquiries at the hospital.<lb/>
Thus, the task facing the review board was to help restore confidence and morale; to build on what was good&#x2014;and, as I have said, there was much that was good in this hospital&#x2014;and to seek to make changes where needed in the light of the Boynton recommendations. This task called for high qualities&#x2014;of patience and understanding, as well as imagination, vigour and determination. I am very glad to acknowledge the sympathetic and enthusiastic manner in which the members of the board have set about their task. One of the national characteristics, from which we so greatly benefit in this country, is the willingness
<col>380</col>
of able people to undertake public service often in difficult circumstances. The service which the members of the Rampton Hospital Review Board are giving typifies so much of what is best in our society and all of us owe them a debt of gratitude and the assurance of our full encouragement.<lb/>
My noble friend has drawn the attention of your Lordships to the effect on staff morale at Rampton Hospital of the protracted police inquiries. I can assure her that my colleagues and I are fully aware of the problems which have arisen. Both we and the chairman of the review board, while recognising the difficult task facing those responsible for conducting the investigations, have drawn the attention of the prosecuting authorities to the effects of the protracted inquiries on staff morale and thus on the effective management of the hospital, and the consequent need to complete the investigations as soon as this could properly be done. My right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General acknowledged this problem when he replied to an adjournment debate in another place on this subject on 2nd March this year.<lb/>
I think it is important, however, while recognising the difficulties, that we should take great care to avoid saying anything which might have a further adverse effect upon morale. The review board members are seeking to restore both the morale and the confidence of the staff of the hospital. I believe, from what I saw on my recent visit, that they have achieved a great deal and I hope that I, too, was able to make a modest contribution when I was there. We must give them positive encouragement in this important aspect of their work.<lb/>
My noble friend referred particularly to the effect on morale of the loss of the hospital's status as a nurse training school. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, mentioned this, and at least one other noble Lord or noble Baroness. The decision to withdraw approval from the school was taken by the General Nursing Council, which is, of course, an independent professional body with statutory responsibility for such matters. I am aware of the background to the GNC decision, which I do not, of course, question. I do, however, agree very much with my noble friend's view that the existence of an approved nurse training school in a hospital is an important influence for good; and there is no doubt that the withdrawal of approval from the school was a further severe blow to management and to staff at Rampton Hospital.<lb/>
A great deal of work has been done at the hospital since the approval was withdrawn to deal with the various matters which have given rise to criticism. I understand that the nursing management of the hospital will shortly be submitting an application for reinstatement of the school's approval. This is a matter entirely for the GNC to decide but I wish to say in plain terms that all of us concerned with the management of the special hospitals very much hope that in the light of the new circumstances the application will be successful and that basic nurse training approval will be restored at Rampton Hospital just as soon as possible.<lb/>
I turn now from the particular concern of my own department with its responsibility for the management of the special hospitals to the question of police presence in Rampton Hospital. The special police inquiry team which has been carrying out the inquiry
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0199"/>
<col>381</col>
into allegations against some members and former members of the staff at the hospital was set up following the request to the Director of Public Prosecutions in May 1979 to which I have already referred. I am aware that my noble friend has been in correspondence about these matters with my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General, and I have of course consulted my right honourable and learned friend about the response which I should make on this aspect of my noble friend's Question.<lb/>
Let me first make clear the Government's attitude to abuse or neglect of patients. We are aware that in the special hospitals and in mental hospitals in the National Health Service an enormous amount of care and treatment of the highest standard is given to patients by the dedicated staff who work in those hospitals. But we also know that mistreatment or neglect can occasionally occur, and I say unequivocally that where there is any evidence of such mistreatment or neglect it will not be tolerated.<lb/>
It is also sometimes alleged that some members of staff cover up the misdeeds of colleagues out of a misdirected sense of loyalty, or bring pressure on others not to complain if they see any wrongdoing. Our position on this also is absolutely clear. I can do no better than to quote the words of my right honourable friend Mr. Jenkin when, as Secretary of State for Social Services, he addressed an international psychiatric nursing conference in September 1980. He said then:
<quote>"Management must support those who complain; there must be thorough investigations; and victimisation or intimidation of those who are doing their duty must be ruthlessly stamped on."</quote>
I am sure that all of your Lordships would endorse those sentiments.<lb/>
So our attitude to any wrongdoing against patients is clear. It is totally unacceptable and must be rooted out wherever it occurs. But we recognise that the kind of exhaustive inquiries which may he needed to establish the truth regarding allegations of wrongdoing can have a depressive effect on the hospital concerned, not only for those against whom allegations might lie but for the general body of the hospital's staff who have to carry on the daily business of caring for patients against a background of suspicion and often ill-informed comment. It is this problem to which my noble friend has drawn the attention of your Lordships in the case of Rampton Hospital.<lb/>
The position at Rampton Hospital is that, following the reference of this question to the DPP and the setting up of the special police inquiry team, more than a thousand separate allegations were received. The police team was thus faced with a mammoth task of investigation to enable the prosecuting authorities to decide whether there were cases in which the evidence required prosecutions to be brought. The allegations made were of many different kinds. All of them had to be looked into. Some were very serious, others trivial. The vast majority of the allegations received have not been substantiated, or were of a character which could not have given rise to any question of prosecution. But in some instances the prosecuting authorities were satisfied that the evidence did justify charges. This is not the occasion to comment on the nature of particular allegations. That
<col>382</col>
would be quite wrong, especially as some trials are still to take place, but your Lordships will wish to know that, of the cases so far concluded, one person has been convicted of the single charge made against him, three people have each been convicted of one or more of the charges made against them, and are currently seeking leave to appeal; nine people have been acquitted of all the charges against them (three of these were involved in the recent case in which the judge, after hearing the prosecution evidence, directed the jury to acquit the defendants); and the charges against two people have been dropped.<lb/>
My noble friend, who has taken a close interest in these matters, now asks explicitly for a date after which there will be no more police presence at the hospital. I understand completely why she seeks that undertaking, but I am afraid I must tell her that an undertaking cannot be given in that form. There are two main reasons for this. First, so long as criminal proceedings are continuing&#x2014;and it may be some time before the remaining charges now outstanding will have all been finally disposed of&#x2014;the police may have to visit the hospital to obtain information required by those responsible for conducting the prosecutions in connection with the charges which have already been brought.<lb/>
Thus we must expect that the police inquiry team set up to investigate the allegations at Rampton Hospital will continue in existence until the last of the outstanding charges has been disposed of I should emphasise that responsibility for the inquiry team rests, as it must do, with the Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire who has been responsible for conducting these investigations on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It will be for the chief constable to decide if and when the inquiry team should be disbanded. But I can inform your Lordships that the inquiry team which, at the peak of the investigations, included 20 police officers has now been reduced to six, with two supervisory officers. This is a clear indication that, as we would all hope, this matter is now nearing its end. Thus, the first reason why I cannot give the undertaking which my noble friend seeks is the essentially practical one, that the work which this police inquiry team is doing is not yet completed and will not be completed before the outstanding charges have all been disposed of.<lb/>
The second reason why I cannot give the undertaking is more fundamental and is a matter of principle. The assurance being sought is that beyond a certain date the police will pay no more visits to the hospital in relation to the matters which the special inquiry team was set up to investigate, except possibly for some limited purpose. I am told by my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney General that some allegations are still being made. Generally, these are not revealing any fresh matters of substance. But if some matter should be brought to notice which indicated that a serious offence might have been committed, clearly the police must be free to investigate it. We have no grounds for supposing that any such matter remains uninvestigated or undiscovered; but it would be quite wrong in principle to give an undertaking in terms which could be seen as preventing the police from properly investigating any serious allegation which might arise either at Rampton Hospital or elsewhere, no matter how unlikely the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0200"/>
<col>383</col>
possibility of any such allegation might seem at present. There could be no question of Ministers seeking to interfere with the actions of the police in such a matter.<lb/>
I hope the House and my noble friend will recognise that I have chosen my words with care and that there are sound reasons why I cannot, on behalf of the Government, give the undertaking which she seeks. I hope, however, that the explanation which I have given her will serve as some reassurance both to her and to the management and staff at Rampton Hospital that we have now reached a stage where we would expect that any continuing police presence in the hospital is likely to be limited to inquiries relating to charges which have already been brought or to any fresh matter of substance that might be brought to notice. I believe that goes a very long way towards meeting my noble friend's point. But I am, in fact, able to go even further&#x2014;and I am very glad to be able to do so.<lb/>
My noble friend is probably aware that the police inquiry team recently questioned, under caution, five more members of the staff at Rampton Hospital. Four of them have since been told that they are to be charged and the fifth has been told he will not be. I am now able to tell my noble friend and your Lordships, on the authority of my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General, that those charges are the last which are to be brought as a result of the information obtained by the police inquiry team over the last three and a half years. No further charges are to be preferred as a result of those investigations. As I have indicated, if any new matters of substance should be brought to notice, they must be properly investigated, but I am sure that my noble friend will have been glad to receive the information I have just given. It will. I know, be widely welcomed by the management and staff at Rampton Hospital.<lb/>
I have already spoken at some length and I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I do not deal with individual points which have been raised in this debate. But I will certainly write to noble Lords who have raised them with a full response. The end of the ordeal which the hospital has now been suffering for more than three years really is, at last, in sight. As I said earlier. I have recently met and talked to many people in the hospital. I have seen clear evidence of the valuable work undertaken by staff in the hospital, often under very difficult circumstances&#x2014;work which few of us would want to share. The tribute which I wish to pay to them is in no sense rhetoric or formality. Society asks these people to undertake on its behalf one of the most difficult jobs that anyone can be asked to do. We rarely show any recognition of the value of this work, usually preferring to sensationalise or criticise; but my colleagues and I certainly do recognise its value. We wish to give to staff and management the support they deserve and to encourage them to look to the future with a positive resolve to continue to care for their patients with commitment and dedication and at the same time to keep fully abreast of new developments in treatment and care.<lb/>
Before I end, I want also to repeat my tribute to Mr. Teeman and his review board. They took on their task at a time of great difficulty for the hospital and have rendered a considerable service, not least to the
<col>384</col>
patients. We are indeed most grateful to them. I have sought to make the most of the timely opportunity provided by my noble friend to deal with the understandable anxieties prevalent at Rampton Hospital. I have been able to give some new assurances which I hope will be widely read&#x2014;not least at the hospital itself.</membercontribution></p>

<title>AIRGUNS: DANGER TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01643"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01644">Whether they have noted the comment on "Airguns and injury to animals" in the <i>Veterinary Record</i> of 12th June 1982, and what progress has been made with preparation for the publicity campaign to warn parents and young people of the dangers to humans and animals of these weapons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01645"><member>Lord Elton</member>: The comment has been noted. It has been decided to hold the campaign in the six weeks or so before Christmas 1983 because many air weapons are bought at that time each year. Some preparatory work has already been done. Officials are about to write to interested voluntary organisations to invite them to a meeting next month to discuss the detailed arrangements for the campaign.</p>

<title>LEAD LEVELS IN LONDON SCHOOLS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01646"><member>Lord Molloy</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01647">What action is contemplated following the report of environmental health officers regarding lead levels in London and particularly in London's schools.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01648"><member>The Earl of Avon</member>: I take it that the noble Lord is concerned in particular about higher than normal levels of dust-lead which have been found in certain London school playgrounds. Flaking leaded paint appears to be the cause of this. DoE Circular 22/82 has just given local authorities information and advice on various sources of environmental lead. Investigation of unusually high levels of lead in dust may well reveal a specific local cause (for example, deteriorating leaded paint), and it may be thought necessary to remove the dust as well as dealing with the cause. But because levels of lead in dust can vary widely over short distances, a small area with a high dust-lead level does not necessarily represent a significant hazard. It is for local authorities to decide upon appropriate action in the light of the DoE advice and the results of any local monitoring.</p>

Nevertheless, Her Majesty's Government are aware that when local education authorities seek to apply to the wide range of individual cases the provisions of the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations in respect of eligibility for mandatory awards, they may put varying constructions on the requirement for ordinary residence. The interpretation of the ordinary residence provision is now under consideration in the courts; once the legal position has been clarified, the Government will consider what further guidance to local education authorities might be helpful.</p>

In the light of the low priority Nicaragua gives to resources for social and economic development the Government believe the special programme could be put to better use in other countries of the region.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01665">What response they have made to the disclosure in the report for 1982 issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that third world countries are suffering the gravest economic crisis since the present depression due, among other causes, to monetarist policies, pressure on external payments, the collapse of commodity prices, and the strain of interest and profit remittances.</p>

<title>Air Permits and Licences: Approved Fares</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01682"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of the necessity to take all possible measures to deal with the problem of ticket discounting, they will make a statement on the progress made by the Department of Trade in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Authority concerning the issue of air transport licences: whether all air licences now issued contain a tariff clause requiring the airline to abide by the officially approved fares for the route licensed and when such a tariff clause was introduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01683"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the noble Baroness's Question is primarily concerned with operating permits which are issued by the Department of Trade to foreign airlines serving the United Kingdom, rather than licences which are issued by the Civil Aviation Authority to United Kingdom Airlines. Licences invariably include a requirement to charge only officially approved fares, and so do most permits. Since 1979 the Department of Trade has been including a similar requirement in permits issued to foreign airlines as and when they come up for renewal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01684"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say how frequently permits come up for renewal? Is this a regular period, or not? Secondly, can he say whether such clauses are now inserted in the operating permits of most European airlines and all the United States carriers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01685"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that most of the permits&#x2014;I believe 95 per cent. of them&#x2014;come up for examination and, I believe the technical word is, "amendment" at least once every 12 months. Some do not. As regards the noble Baroness's second question, I am afraid that I cannot give her precise details of the United States airlines or the European airlines in these special circumstances. If I may ascertain details as far as the European and United States airlines are concerned for these specially permitted routes, perhaps I may write to the noble Baroness with details of these specific airlines.</membercontribution></p>
<col>392</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01686"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: I would be most grateful, my Lords. May I ask the Minister, if these permits come up roughly once every 12 months, what is the reason for a clause not being inserted? Is it because the Government do not wish to do so, or because the airline concerned is in a position not to accept it? I have one further question. If this clause has been in the permits until now, has the Department of Trade taken no action against airlines which have broken the clause?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01687"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the noble Baroness's first question is a double negative&#x2014;"no" and "no". The answer to her second question is that it is a very difficult legal point as to against whom the legal action should be taken. Indeed, this has been stressed by my noble friends who have answered this question during the lifetime of this Government. I am sure the noble Baroness and your Lordships will be aware that the Government will not rule out any legal action, but I am sure that the noble Baroness, and the airlines, will accept that it is no solution to the problem raised by the noble Baroness.<lb/>
Baroness Burton of Coventry: My Lords, if the House will permit me, can the Minister say what is the use of having a clause inserted in operational permits for airlines if the clause is not kept and the Government take no notice of it? Does the Minister recall that we have had long exchanges in the House, through the kindness of the House, about the legislation on discounted tickets which has gone on for years and for which evidence has been submitted? Does he further recall that the Government have said on frequent occasions that they have no intention of either withdrawing the legislation or acting upon it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01688"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that the answer to her last question is very much the same as I am afraid I had to give in answer to her second supplementary question, and the same as my noble friend the Minister and previous spokesmen on this area have given to the noble Baroness in past years. It is very difficult to take the legal action even should the Government wish to do so. I stress to the noble Baroness, and the House, that this entire matter of discounted air fares is a commercial decision and it is one for the airlines to settle themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01689"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if a condition in a permit or a licence is broken, is it not perfectly simple to cancel or withdraw the permit or licence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01690"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: Not entirely, my Lords, since it is primarily a matter for the airlines themselves. The Government have very much a supervisory function in this area. Perhaps I may write to my noble friend with specific details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01691"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if my noble friend says that it is difficult to find out who is legally responsible for discounting tickets, does this not make the permit totally valueless? Either there is someone who can answer for the conditions of the licence or there is not. For the Government to say that they cannot find someone responsible is very odd.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0205"/>
<col>393</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01692"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that I did not say that nobody was responsible. I hope that I can clarify the point in my noble friend's mind and in the minds of your Lordships. It is particularly difficult to find a target, if that is the word for a non-legal person to use. It is particularly difficult to enforce these legal obligations. I stress that the legal obligations found in permits issued by the Civil Aviation Authority are to be found in paragraph 80 of the Air Navigation Order 1980.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01693"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I am being stupid, but can the Minister clarify the point for me? Did I understand him to say, in effect, to the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that if an airline breaks the clause in its agreement it is not possible for the Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw the agreement it has given to the airline, and that presumably it is up to the airline itself to go the CAA and say that it does not want the agreement any longer?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01694"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is often very difficult to obtain evidence that the airline has broken an agreement in the permit. That, mainly, is the problem. Secondly, it is very difficult to take legal action and to enforce these obligations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01695"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it a case of power without responsibility or responsibility without power?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01696"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would have to seek guidance as to untying the Elwyn-Jones' knot. Perhaps I might take guidance on that and possibly write to the noble and learned Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01698"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what views they have formed on the proposals for action set out in the Report <i>The future of technological higher education in Britain</i> (the Chilver Report) sponsored by the Royal Society of Arts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01699"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are at present considering this report, which contains a great number of wide-ranging recommendations. In general, the Government welcome the report as being very much in keeping with their own views, and have taken a number of initiatives along the lines it proposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01700"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for that heartening reply. In particular, I should like to ask whether the Government are attracted by the idea of using some public money as seed-corn to enable institutions to get extra money out of industry, which would help in the collaboration of industry in this training?</membercontribution></p>
<col>394</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01701"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have made it quite clear that they wish to see universities attract increasing income from outside sources and that income so raised will not lead to any consequential reduction in UGC grant. We believe that it is right to encourage institutions to become progressively less dependent on the public purse, but that does not mean of course that we propose to limit Government funds according to their ability to obtain other support. We do, however, want to see some greater diversity in the way in which institutions are financed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01702"><member>Lord Taylor of Blackburn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that universities such as Salford University attracted a tremendous amount of public money and yet were cut by the UGC?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01703"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the priority of allocation of money in university grants is, of course, determined by the University Grants Committee. That said, it is not the case that universities such as Salford and some others are the only ones which have a special expertise in technology, and nor is it the case that that is the only expertise that they have. Therefore, it is necessary, is it not? for universities such as Salford to improve or maintain their usefulness and merit by seeking the savings that are required to keep the whole system effective, from those subjects where the savings can best be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01704"><member>The Earl of Bessborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I not right in saying that the Cranfield Institute of Technology, of which Sir Henry Chilver is the head, is one of the only institutions of higher education that does not receive support from the UGC but receives more support from industry than perhaps any other institution of higher education of that kind?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01705"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Cranfield certainly does attract a very large proportion of funding other than from Government sources, and that makes Sir Henry Chilver a very appropriate person to have chaired the body which produced this excellent report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01706"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the usefulness of the University of Aston absolutely imperative for employment in the West Midlands? Is the Minister aware that the University of Aston attracts to its research a tremendous amount of money from industry in the West Midlands which is of paramount importance to not only the West Midlands but the economy of the whole country? Is he not aware of the grave disquiet that is arising at the University of Aston?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01707"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I could well have coupled the University of Aston with my remarks about the University of Salford. I am of course aware of the importance of its role and I am very glad that the noble Baroness confirms that it is receiving increasing sums of private and industrial money which will offset the difficulty of the grants reduction to which she referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01708"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are the Government paying particular attention to Recommendation 6 which says that the school examination system should
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0206"/>
<col>395</col>
be reformed to establish education for capability in society as a key component, which is based on a paragraph in the report which says that the prevalent emphasis of the examination system on academic achievement even at junior levels, tends to inhibit desirable movement towards a more technologically literate society? Does he not think that this must start very early on in the schools? Is he aware that Mrs. Warnock, a highly respected figure in the educational world, wrote an article last week in, I think, <i>The Times</i>, suggesting that the whole examination system should be switched so that there were practical subjects and theoretical subjects? Can the Minister say that the Government will be paying attention to that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01709"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we do indeed recognise the need to ensure that the examination and the education systems are kept in touch with the real world of work for which they prepare people. The Government are taking initiatives to secure this. In particular, through the examination system, we propose to introduce in 1984 a national prevocational qualification at 17-plus. Associated courses will give a vocational bias to a balanced programme of general education aimed at the better preparation of young people for adult and working life. The Government have also acknowledged the need for reform in the examinations at 16-plus. They are playing their part in the national criteria exercise. When we have the result of that, a decision will be taken whether or not to replace the CSE and GCE 0-level examinations with a single system. A statement of policy which will be of interest to the noble Baroness will be published early next month. I regret that I have not read the article to which she referred, but I shall see that that error is made good.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01710"><member>Baroness Wootton of Abinger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask whether the Minister would bear in mind another feature of academic education? I do not know whether it can be procured by the examination system or not&#x2014;probably not. All education in universities and other forms of higher education and further education concentrates on the acquisition of the knowledge, skill and ability of the individual. They do not do anything whatever to prepare for the fact of life that when he leaves the university, or whatever institution he is educated at, he goes out into a world where he has to work in the company of other people. This seems to me to be entirely overlooked in our whole educational system. You try to get a first-class degree for yourself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01711"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01712"><member>Baroness Wootton of Abinger</member><membercontribution>: Does not the Minister feel that there is something in this? He tries to get a first-class degree for himself, and then goes out and has to mix with people who are perhaps of greatly inferior intelligence. Could not something be done to give a bigger sense of the communal nature of all kinds of occupation at all levels after leaving the educational system?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01713"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have a great sympathy with the general tendency of what the noble Baroness said, but I doubt whether reform of the university system would answer it, largely because universities
<col>396</col>
themselves are social communities in which a great deal of work is done together&#x2014;for instance, in seminars and tutorials&#x2014;as communal intellectual exercises. Of course, the amount of argumentation with which students convince themselves that they are members of a community with which they do not necessarily agree but with which they have to cooperate is at no level higher than that at the age at which a person is at the university. I do not think that I can answer the noble Baroness's wide philosophical question in more precise terms than that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01716"><member>Lord Alexander of Potterhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do I understand from the Minister's reply that Her Majesty's Government no longer fully accept the quotation from Disraeli that precedes the Education Act 1944?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01717"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Potterhill, has been bombarding me with powerful and unexpected questions since long before I came to sit on this side of the House.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01718">2.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01719"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majest's Government whether they will have discussions with the Trades Union Congress and National Union of Mineworkers about making the mineworkers' ballot secret and the voting malpractices minimal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01720"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (The Earl of Mansfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the organisation of ballot votes of the membership of the National Union of Mineworkers is a matter for that union.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01721"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend say whether the Electoral Reform Society, which I understand is to supervise this ballot, or the certification officer have any responsibility for seeing that there are not two ballot boxes, one marked "Yes" and one marked "No", and that a a trade union official is not supervising the ballot, so that secrecy prevails, which is surely the intention of the rule?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01722"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the votes are to be counted by the Electoral Reform Society. So far as the conduct of the ballot is
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0207"/>
<col>397</col>
concerned, that is nothing to do with the certification officer, it is entirely a matter for the National Union of Mineworkers and its rules. I understand that practices vary in different parts of the country but, as I have said, it is the responsibility of the union to see to the conduct of its own affairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01723"><member>Lord Blyton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that for 65 years, during which we have had ballots on many things, such as electing our local officials every year on a ballot, we have had independent scrutineers, the same at district level and at national level, and never once has there been a word said against the validity of the ballot in all those years? Is the Minister further aware that this is a dangerous, mischievous Question, especially on the eve of an election in the coalfields in the crucial position we are facing? The questioner ought to remember that it is only six years since democracy was introduced in his party, because the Leader of his party was elected by a heirarchy. You only introduced democracy six years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01724"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very aware that the National Union of Mineworkers is jealous of its own practices. The only advice that I would seek to give it is that perhaps it should consider seeking funds from the certification officer, who is an independent statutory creature under Section 1 of the Employment Act 1980, to obtain public money to hold secret postal ballots. Unfortunately, the TUC has advised affiliated unions not to apply for such money. One hopes that the National Union of Mineworkers will perhaps see fit to reconsider its position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01725"><member>Lord Taylor of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that this Question is no coincidence coming, as it does, on the eve of a national miners' ballot which takes place on Thursday and Friday? Would he also agree that the inference in the Question is that the National Union of Mineworkers is not capable of taking and organising a secret and a fair ballot?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01726"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the National Union of Mineworkers and the effects which can flow from its actions next week are of vital importance and concern to the whole community. Therefore I am not in the least surprised that my noble friend has put down this Question which reflects the anxiety of us all. But I repeat that the matter of the ballot is one for the National Union of Mineworkers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01727"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend the Minister not agree that subventions to drum up support for a ballot for strike action could constitute a voting malpractice rather akin to buying a borough?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01728"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is for the membership of the National Union of Mineworkers to ensure that the union's rules are observed, and it is a matter for the union as to whether it is proper to pay an attendance allowance to people who come to meetings rather more than a week before the actual pithead ballot takes place. It is certainly not a matter for the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<col>398</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01729"><member>Lord Davies of Penrhys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who for many years worked in the pits and collected these ballots and knows what it is all about, may I ask whether the Minister appreciates that the noble Lord who put down this Question knows nothing at all about the matter? Let me ask the Minister one question. The noble Earl said: why do we not take advantage of the postal ballot. In postal ballots you have fewer people returning than you do in a miners' ballot on the pit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01730"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is of course the purpose of Questions in this House for noble Lords who do not know the facts to elicit them from the Government. If the noble Lord who knows so much about the practices of the union is quite sure that they are above hoard, why then he and his friends have nothing to fear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01731"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister agree that what he said initially on this subject at this crucial moment should he directed primarily towards ensuring that in the vote on Thursday and Friday the miners reach a responsible decision?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01732"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, and I am obliged to the noble Lord for that question. I have said more than once that the matters which go towards the conduct of this particular ballot are matters for the National Union of Mineworkers, and naturally the whole community is concerned, but I repeat that it is for the union to conduct its own affairs according to its own rules.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01733"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that many votes in this House are not carried out in secret? Is that necessarily, as the Question says, a malpractice?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01734"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rather agree with the noble Lord. A perusal of Rule 43, which I have perused, does not mention the word "secret".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01735"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that by the response from the Benches opposite, the greatest conscientiousness is now being shown, as I understand it, and one hopes that will long be so, under whatever leadership presides over the National Union of Mineworkers? Is he aware that the Electoral Reform Society a few years ago on a ballot in South Wales in similar circumstances said that 102 per cent. of the strength of the miners had actually voted? Somebody asked if that was usual in a democracy and they replied that it often happened in ballots. Therefore, it is not quite as perfect as some people suggest and I am grateful for the helpful response which the Minister has given to some anxiety which exists in these quarters under the present leadership of the NUM.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01736"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if my noble friend is correct, there seems to have been an almost too enthusiastic response from the membership to exercise their right. Basically, I am quite sure that the ordinary membership of the NUM know pretty well what they are doing and will vote according to the way they see their future as being best advantaged.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0208"/>
<col>399</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01737"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of what the Minster just said, may I, as somebody who has spent his adult life in the Labour movement but who is not a miner, tell him that I regard the ballots of the NUM as the fairest in the whole trade union field?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Lebanon and the Arab/Israeli Dispute</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01738">3.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01739"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make a statement following the Foreign Secretary's visit to the Middle East, with special reference to the creation of an independent Lebanon and the next steps towards a peaceful resolution of the Arab/Israeli dispute; and whether recent developments have increased the prospects of a joint European Community/United States initiative to these ends.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01740"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are participating fully in the current round of diplomacy. On Lebanon, we are working for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, which is an essential step in the restoration of the Lebanese Government's authority. Recent developments on the Arab/Israel problem, particularly President Reagan's initiative, which brings United States and European positions closer together, offer an important opportunity to make progress. We shall continue to urge all the parties concerned to respond as constructively as they can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01741"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: May I press my noble friend to go a little further, my Lords? Do not the prospects for the Arab/Israeli dispute look rather better now than they have at any time since 1948? May this not be a good moment to consider setting up a high-level joint working party between the United States and European Community to try to narrow still further the differences that still exist on both sides of the Atlantic and perhaps prepare the way for a reconvened Geneva Conference?<lb/>
Secondly, may I ask my noble friend a specific question about the Lebanon? Should not Her Majesty's Government clearly be seen to be doing all they can to help the Lebanon to recreate its integrity and restore its shattered economy? If a larger multinational force is set up, as has been asked for by President Gemayel, and which will surely be needed, may I ask whether Her Majesty's Government will be willing to contribute at least a battalion? I very much hope so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01742"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the first part of that supplementary question, I share my noble friend's hope that progress in bringing the two parties together in the Middle East will be possible, and I assure him that we shall be working to keep up the momentum. We share the objective of President Reagan's initiative, but the fact is that our policies are identical and we believe that an independent European Community role can make a useful contribution to efforts to bring the parties together to negotiations.<lb/>
<col>400</col>
To answer the second point my noble friend raised, about British participation in a peace-keeping force, we were not asked to participate in the force that is presently in Beirut, but we fully support the principle of a strengthened peace-keeping force in the Lebanon. We should obviously consider seriously any request for participation, but in this context we cannot get away from the fact that British forces are presently heavily committed elsewhere, particularly in the Falklands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01743"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as Israel has welcomed a full inquiry into the question of the massacres in Beirut&#x2014;a very important thing to have happened&#x2014;may I ask the Minister whether she agrees that that should be followed by a full inquiry into what is going on in and with the PLO? The situation should be made fair in that sense; that is, not just that there should be this inquiry, which has been welcomed by Israel, but that it should now be followed up by an inquiry into the activities of the PLO.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01744"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the answer to the noble Baroness is that we recognise that the Israelis have instituted an inquiry into what happened in Beirut. We believe as a Government that the best chance for peace in the Middle East is to continue to work for the implementation of the proposals by President Reagan.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01745"><member>Viscount Monckton of Brenchley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that whether we be Christians, Jews or Moslems we have nothing but shame to carry for what has happened in the Lebanon, and that anything that can be done should be done to help that situation now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01746"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the British Government have of course condemned what happened in Beirut, which we feel was an appalling affair, and I would like to confirm that we have given &#x00A3;386,000 to aid victims of the conflict. This is being channelled through the International Red Cross, the Lebanese Red Cross, Oxfam and other relief organisations. We have also contributed &#x00A3;2 million through the European Community to a Red Cross appeal, as well as a further &#x00A3; 1 million as food aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01747"><member>Lord Wells-Pestell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Leader of the House to say whether the British Government will take the view that, before there can be meaningful discussions between Israel and the PLO, or anything relating to that, the PLO and others taking part will recognise the existence and future of Israel?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01748"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: We recognise, my Lords, that part of the proposals that have been put by President Reagan depend on both an acceptance of Israel's right to exist as well as the other proposals of Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01749"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Baroness agree that, owing to the limited size of the existing multi-national force, there is a real danger of further massacres among the Palestinian refugees in Southern Lebanon? Even though, as she says, we may not have
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0209"/>
<col>401</col>
received a formal invitation to send a contingent, is she aware that that does not mean that an offer from us would not be extremely welcome? There is much evidence that it would be. Is she aware that if it is hard to find British troops for such a force, a United Kingdom contingent to a Commonwealth battalion should not be beyond the resources of the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01750"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, asked a question in somewhat similar terms to that of my noble friend Lord Chelwood in one of his supplementaries. I do not think I could at this stage go any further than the answer I gave to the original supplementary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01751"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: In this instance, my Lords, is there not a case for minding our own business, much as the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, advised us to do a few minutes ago? It seems to me that for excellent reasons we are not in a position to provide either troops or money. In that case, is it not more sensible to refrain from handing out advice which has not been asked for, remembering that when we did it quite recently, it caused gross offence to one of the parties?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01752"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is important that both sides to this dispute should realise that we very much support President Reagan's initiative, and we have given support to his proposals. It is another matter whether or not we should intervene to send forces into Beirut, and, for the reasons I gave earlier, we have not been asked to do so and it is not really a practicable proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01753"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the present intention&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01754"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I am in the hands of the House, but I would point out to the House that we have been 33 minutes over Question Time today, which I think is almost a record, and one which I think we must not strive to break again. But I would suggest to the House that it might perhaps be the time to pass on to the next business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01755"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the present intention that the peace-keeping force should remain in the Lebanon until&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01756"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order, order!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01757"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>:&#x2014;it has it been evacuated?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01758"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I should take the supplementary question of the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, and then we might move on to the next business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01759"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the present intention that the existing peace-keeping force in the Lebanon should remain there until the Lebanon has been evacuated by troops of both Syria and Israel?</membercontribution></p>
<col>402</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01760"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we consistently support the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the Lebanon, and in the meantime the peace-keeping troops that are in Beirut will remain where they are. The United Nations' forces in UNIFIL will remain in the Lebanon as well.</membercontribution></p>

That amendment satisfied objections to which the noble Lord's amendments had been open at earlier stages, but none the less it was technically defective.<lb/>
Your Lordships will recall that, when it was considered, I undertook that, should your Lordships see fit to include it in the Bill, I would try to secure the provision of Government amendments which would achieve the intended results without being subject to those technical defects, and that these would then be moved
<col>404</col>
into the Bill during consideration in the Commons of your Lordships' amendments. I am happy to say that it has proved possible to achieve that. Amendments Nos. 3 to 8 between them provide that, when a young offender is released on parole, his parole licence shall run only until his remission date and that parity is achieved between the period of supervision under licence of those released on parole and the period of supervision of those released in the ordinary way. I am grateful to the noble Lord for leading us to the point where it was possible to do this, and I am glad that at this very late stage we have been able to meet the wishes of your Lordships' House.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01773"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 10 to the Lords Amendment No. 9. Amendment No. 10 is a tidying-up amendment consequential on the decision in this House on the Third Reading of the Bill to remove from the new clause on the use of accommodation for restricting the liberty of children in care provision for an <i>ex parte</i> application to a justice of the peace to confirm placements in secure accommodation. Amendment No. 10, moved by the Government in another place, simply deletes from the new clause the only remaining reference to such provision. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Elton</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01774"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this amendment touches upon a very important matter which we discussed at some length at the earlier stages of the Bill; namely, the concern about the hundreds of children&#x2014;amounting perhaps to 2,000 or more a year&#x2014;who are locked up in prison-like conditions without any proper judicial control, review or supervision. It really is an affront to our criminal justice system. It may also be an infringement of the European Convention on Human Rights that there is no such judicial review available. The new Clause 21A sought to remedy that situation, and we are glad that after the matter was considered by the House and your Lordships accepted the Opposition approach to it, the Government now accept it.<lb/>
<col>406</col>
However, the question that we are now discussing is whether those provisions should take effect on Royal Assent, or whether the making of regulations to give effect to what the House had in mind should first take place before the provisions are implemented. In another place, speaking for the Government, the Minister said that the regulations should be made as soon as possible, and he said that it was hoped that they would be made in the latter part of next spring. Well, spring has a way of being late, and a late spring has a way of being even later.<lb/>
The real anxiety of those who are concerned in this field is that what has been done by the House should be given effect to at as early a stage as practicable. Indeed, some people have asked, why should not the provision remain and so go on to the statute book, and not be restricted in relation to when it should come into effect, in the way that is proposed in the amendment? Perhaps at the very least the noble Lord the Minister will give us an assurance of the intention of the Government to produce the regulations as soon as possible; if possible before the spring, the early spring, if I may put it that way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01775"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord has rightly pointed out that "spring" is an elastic term, but I can certainly assure him that we shall not countenance any unnecessary delay in getting on with the work. If the noble and learned Lord will bear with me until we reach Amendments Nos. 13 and 14, he will find that I shall then have much to say about implementation. If I tried to extract that now, I should get into a muddle and either repeat myself or leave bits out. So, if the noble and learned Lord will be patient, I hope that your Lordships will accept the amendment as it stands.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01783"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons Amendment No. 14 to your Lordships' Amendment No. 13. Amendment 13, which was agreed by this House on Third Reading, provides for certain provisions of the Bill, including those which are simply enabling powers, to come into force on Royal Assent. Amendment 14, which was moved by the Government in another place, deletes the reference in the amendment to the new clause dealing with the use of accommodation for restricting the liberty of children in care. The reason for the amendment is that, until the Government's new clause on the use of secure accommodation was agreed in this House at Third Reading, the clause in the Bill dealing with the question of the use of secure accommodation was simply an enabling power, which it was appropriate to bring into force at the time of Royal Assent.<lb/>
The new clause agreed at Third Reading still makes provision enabling the Secretary of State to make regulations to cover the new arrangements governing the use of secure accommodation. It also sets out, however, in main legislation, the criteria which must be satisfied before a child may be placed or kept in secure accommodation. If the clause were to be implemented when the Act is passed, local authorities would be required to apply these criteria. But criteria for placement in secure accommodation already exist in the Community Homes Regulations 1972. Regulation 11(2) states that the person in charge of a community home may place a child in secure accommodation,
<quote>"if he considers it to he necessary in the interests of a child residing in the home or for the protection of other persons".</quote>
It is clear we cannot have two requirements regarding the use of secure accommodation in force simultaneously. The effect of Amendment No. 14 is that the new clause on the use of secure accommodation will,
<col>408</col>
in common with the majority of provisions in the Bill, be brought into force by commencement order.<lb/>
I regret that this amendment was not carried through into Amendment No. 13 when it came before your Lordships' House on Third Reading. However, I am happy to say that my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Security was able to give a categorical assurance (which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, would be asking for immediately after I sat down had he not already done so) that the Government intend to make regulations providing for arrangements for judicial reviews of placements in secure accommodation as soon as possible. The precise timing will depend on a speedy conclusion to the consultation process about the regulations and on whether the arrangements governing the use of secure accommodation can satisfactorily be separated from a wider review and reform of the regulations governing the conduct of community homes.<lb/>
The process of consultation has already begun. My honourable friend indicated that the Government's hope is that they will be in a position to bring the regulations forward "by the latter end of next spring". The noble and learned Lord will forgive me if I do not give a more precise date than that. It depends a bit upon the weather, but before your Lordships rise for the Recess I would hope that we had achieved this. I beg to move.<lb/>

<title>Planning Amendment (Northern Ireland) Order 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01790">3.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01791"><member>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (The Earl of Cowrie)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 7th July be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01792">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the main purpose of this order is to bring the system of enforcing planning control in Northern Ireland further into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom. In addition, it reflects changes in the planning code which were introduced in England and Wales by the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 and by the Local Government and Planning (Amendment) Act 1981.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01793">As my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland has already explained in another place, the order is intended simply to reduce delay and improve flexibility in the planning enforcement process. One of the principal changes (contained in Articles 8 and 10) is to transfer the responsibility for dealing with appeals against enforcement notices and against listed building enforcement notices from the magistrates' courts to the Planning Appeals Commission. Under the existing system an unauthorised developer in Northern Ireland can oppose an enforcement notice by submitting a planning application, appealing the refusal to the Planning Appeals Commission and then appealing to the courts against the enforcement notice itself. This double appeal system can enable a developer to continue with an unauthorised activity, which may have a very damaging effect upon the amenity of an area, for some considerable time. There has also been some considerable confusion as to the responsibilities of the two appellate bodies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01794">It was to resolve this problem that enforcement appeals were removed from the courts in Great Britain. Under the new procedure, an enforcement appeal to the Planning Appeals Commission would he deemed to include a planning application, so that planning merits could be fully considered. Any current appeal against a refusal of planning permission in respect of the same development would be dealt with at the same time. This change would bring Northern Ireland towards the situation in Great Britain, where appeals against both planning decisions and enforcement notices lie to the same authority, the Secretary of State.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01795">The draft order proposes a number of other changes with respect to listed buildings, one example being the requirement, placed by Article 6 upon the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland as planning authority, to consider the effect of a proposed development, not only on the listed building itself but also on its setting. I would remind the House that Northern Ireland is one of the most beautiful parts
<col>410</col>
of the kingdom and one of the most beautiful parts of the island of Ireland; it has many splendid buildings, and we want to look after them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01796">The draft order (at Article 15) also contains an important proposal to enable the department to take out a summons within three years of the commission of certain offences, instead of within six months, as at present. This would deal with a problem which arises out of Article 19 of the Magistrates' Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, which prohibits proceedings being initiated in the magistrates' court more than six months after the end of the period specified for compliance with a planning enforcement notice. The six months' rule no longer applies in England and Wales to any offence which is subject to either summary trial in the magistrates' court or subject to an indictment. The order also provides (through Article 3) for a new right of appeal. Where the department has refused any consent required by a condition imposed on a planning permission, the applicant will be able to appeal to the Planning Appeals Commission. There is no right of appeal at present. Such consents normally relate to matters such as the layout of a car park or the use of premises at unsocial hours.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01797">Lastly, my Lords, I should mention Article 11, which would provide for the enforcement of duties as to the replacement of trees. The department will be authorised to serve notices requiring trees to be planted within a specific period, to enforce the replacement of trees where a condition to this effect has been attached to a consent to fell trees covered by a tree preservation order. My Lords, I commend these proposals to your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01798">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 7th July be approved.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Gowrie</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01799">3.31 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01800"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the House is grateful for the Minister's explanation of this brief but important order. As he points out, the order makes various amendments to the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order, 1972. I have studied the order and compared it with previous legislation. I should like to raise one or two points and to ask the Minister questions on them. First, I would welcome the order as a step forward in this matter. The main amendments have several welcome features, including the transfer of the appeals against enforcement orders from the courts of summary jurisdiction to the Planning Appeals Commission. There appear to be some advantages in this in so far as it will ease the case loads of the courts who deal not only with planning matters. I may be right in thinking that planning appeals commissions will be specialised and, I hope, will allow a degree of informality and continuity in decisions and policy matters. If so, this is to the good.<lb/>
It is also a help that despite the specialised character of the appeals commissions, there will be a certain informality to make it easier for laymen and others presenting their case to do so without undue difficulty. If appellants can appear before them without undue formality and without undue professional advice and other costs, I am sure that it will be to their advantage. Can the Minister say a little more about these aspects, and also concerning the membership and general composition of the appeals commissions?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0214"/>
<col>411</col>
On the other aspects that he has mentioned, the strengthening of planning controls to protect listed buildings and trees in conservation areas is also welcome. We need to protect and preserve such buildings and trees; so often, as we all know, it pays to allow buildings to fall into decay or disrepair and to use the site for other purposes. On the other hand, to maintain a building's character and to restore it can be very costly. It would be helpful if the Minister could say something about any financial or other help which will be available to those who have the responsibility for listed buildings. In that. I have a special interest, not only in Northern Ireland but in this country; so that one is aware of the liabilities that are incurred often quite willingly. It would appear that any decisions are final. May I ask whether the Minister is satisfied that appellants and others affected have proper representation? Is there no appeal to, say, the Minister himself?<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, I think the review is timely and the revisions mentioned in the order in relation to planning, listed buildings, development and planning will be welcome. I note that the Historic Buildings Council and the district councils are also involved in this matter. I think it might be helpful if the Minister could indicate what consultations have taken place with all the authorities, both statutory and otherwise, concerned. I should imagine that that has happened and I anticipate that they would have been pleased with the outcome of this order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01801"><member>Lord Foot</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I, too, thank the Minister for his explanation of this order. It is a highly technical subject on which I should hesitate to embark, but I am very much relieved to know from the Minister that this order is being asked for approval on the basic principle that it is going to bring the planning law of Northern Ireland more into line with the law which prevails in England and Wales. That is a principle which my noble friends and I strongly support and about which I should like to say a few words on the next order when the Minister produces it. I do not have any questions of the noble Earl and am very grateful to him that this order is to be brought before us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01802"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I follow my noble friend Lord Foot and say that anything which brings legislation, planning or otherwise, in the Province into line with that on the mainland is to be welcomed. I should like to know whether the noble Earl can tell us what more remains to be done. What are the differences outstanding? If this is a complicated problem then a letter perhaps would be better than an answer at the Dispatch Box; but it is a matter of interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01803"><member>Viscount Brookeborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in welcoming the order may I make particular reference to historic buildings preservation because I think that in this branch of the department we have an excellent team. I have an interest to declare in that I have a listed building. Throughout their work, they are particularly helpful to everybody no matter whether it is the smallest cottage that is preserved or a large mansion such as that of my noble friend. They are absolute experts, they are architects; and the whole team works
<col>412</col>
extremely well. If willingness to carry out the tasks the Government set them is any guide they will certainly do it well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01804"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the way in which the House has received this order. I can say to the noble Lord opposite that the Planning Appeals Commission comprises 10 members, five of whom are full-time professional commissioners and five part-time lay commissioners. All are appointed by the Secretary of State and they are charged, as an independent body, with the hearing of planning appeals. The position, therefore, is not identical to that in the rest of the United Kingdom, where the ultimate court of appeal, so to speak, is the Secretary of State for the Environment.<lb/>
Northern Ireland must have institutions which are appropriate to its special needs and difficulties. I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, that our view is that this independent Planning Appeals Commission is widely acceptable in Northern Ireland and I do not think that we will have trouble about it. Consultations were taken in forming it. With the passage of this order, Northern Ireland law will be broadly in line with that in Great Britain, and no further changes are proposed.<lb/>
On the subject of listed buildings, I enjoyed my noble friend Lord Brookeborough's casting himself as the poor man at the gate of the castle of my noble friend Lord Abercorn. I am glad to say that the cottage at the gate is listed as well as the castle. Buildings considered to be of architectural or historic merit are listed by the Department of the Environment on the advice of the Historic Buildings Council. No works can be undertaken to a listed building without the consent of the department, and grants are available from that department's budget for the repair and maintenance of listed buildings. I do not think at this point that I can say much more than that. Again, I welcome the way in which the House has received the order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Homosexual Offences<lb/>(Northern Ireland) Order 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01806">3.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01807"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 14th July be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01808">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the effect of this order will be to legalise private homosexual acts between consenting adults in Northern Ireland, thus bringing the law in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales and, broadly, with that in Scotland. I am sure that a number of your Lordships will recall the debates in 1966 on the Bill introduced by my noble kinsman, Lord Arran, which was later to become the Sexual Offences Act 1967 and which changed the law on homosexual offences in England and Wales.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01809">It might be helpful to the House if I briefly sketched the background to this order. In July 1976 the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland undertook to consider whether to legislate to bring Northern Ireland law more closely into harmony with laws in other parts
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0215"/>
<col>413</col>
of the United Kingdom, for example in the area of homosexuality. He invited the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights to consider the question of amending the law relating to homosexuality in Northern Ireland, and in due course that commission recommended that the law in Northern Ireland should be brought into line with the Sexual Offences Act of 1967. A proposal for a draft Homosexual Offences Order was published therefore in July 1978 and during the ensuing three months' consultation a certain amount of fur flew.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01810">Strong views, both for and against changing the law, were expressed by churches, politicians, and a range of religious and political organisations, professional bodies, voluntary organisations and individuals. It was clear that opposition to the proposed order was very strong, and the then Government chose not to proceed with it at that time. When the present Administration took office in 1979, we too chose to leave the position unchanged. In 1976 a Mr. Dudgeon, living in Northern Ireland, complained to the European Commission of Human Rights that the Northern Ireland law on homosexual offences was in breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01811">The two articles in question deal with the right to respect for private life and to freedom from discrimination. The commission concluded that the law in Northern Ireland breached Article 8 but that there was no need to examine the case under Article 14. The case was then referred to the European Court of Human Rights who, while taking into account the argument put forward by Her Majesty's Government that the existing law in Northern Ireland was justified by the great and particular emphasis placed on religious and moral factors in relation to the law on social matters, decided that there was not sufficient reason for the interference with private life entailed in the present law in Northern Ireland. The court accordingly issued their judgment on 22nd October last year that the law in Northern Ireland breaches Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01812">The Government are therefore put in no doubt that the United Kingdom must abide by the court's judgment in this case, since by signing and ratifying the convention they have undertaken to abide by the court's decision in any case to which they are a party. Not to do so would be to fail altogether to fulfil our international obligations. The Government therefore published, on 18th March this year, a proposal for a draft Homosexual Offences Order which would make the changes in the law necessary to comply with the court's ruling. A consultation period of six weeks followed, during which comments were received from various organisations and political parties. However, all the suggestions made by these bodies would have created inconsistencies with the law on homosexual offences in England and Wales, whereas what is required to rectify the breach of Article 8 of the European Convention is legislation bringing Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales. To have made the Northern Ireland provisions more restrictive might have left the Government in a position where we had not fully rectified the breach and indeed had compounded our offence. Thus it has not been possible to include any changes recommend-
<col>414</col>
ded during that consultation period. It fell to my office and my responsibility to receive these consultations. I can say, looking back, that some Ministers draw unhappy cards from time to time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01813">There are, however, three minor technical changes which have been made to the draft order as a result of further scrutiny since its publication as a proposal. These are an amendment to Article 11(2), making it clear that it is not necessary to obtain leave of the Director of Public Prosecutions under Article 11(1) in the case of proceedings under Section 22 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 which deals with indecent conduct towards children, and two additions to the schedule of the order, detailing consequential amendments to that Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01814">May I now summarise briefly the main provisions of the draft order before the House. Article 3 contains the main change to the existing law: a homosexual act in private between two consenting men over 21 years of age will cease to be an offence. However, an exception is made in paragraph 4 of the article for servicemen, for whom homosexual acts will still he offences under the service Acts. Under paragraph 3 of Article 3 it will not be possible for a mentally handicapped person validly to consent to a homosexual act. Article 4 amends the Mental Health Act (Northern Ireland) 1961 so as to provide protection for men receiving treatment for mental disorder in a hospital against homosexual acts by any male member of the hospital staff, and also for mentally disordered men cared for under other guardianship arrangements.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01815">Under Article 5 a homosexual act on a United Kingdom merchant ship between members of the crew of that or of any other United Kingdom merchant ship will continue to be an offence, as now. Article 6 sets out revised penalities for those homosexual acts which will continue to be offences. These penalties will be the same as for similar offences in England and Wales, and include an increase in the existing Northern Ireland penalty for gross indecency by a man over 21 with another man who is under 21.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01816">Article 7 provides that it will continue to be an offence to procure a man to commit a homosexual act with a third man, even though the act itself may be legal. Under Article 8 it will be illegal for anyone knowingly to live on the earnings of male prostitution. Article 9 provides that premises used for lewd homosexual practices shall be dealt with as brothels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01817">Articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 deal with the time limits for prosecutions, the procedure for prosecutions when a man under 21 years old is involved, the mode of trial and arrangements for prosecutions which may be pending. Under Article 10 it will not be possible for proceedings to be commenced more than a year after the offence, unless a the offence involved a boy under 16. That has obvious implications for the crime of blackmail.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01818">Article 11 will protect young people from unnecessary exposure to court proceedings. Article 14 and the schedule deal with consequential amendments to existing legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01819">In sum, we believe that this order, by bringing the law on homosexual offences in Northern Ireland into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom, will make the minimum changes needed to enable the United Kingdom to comply with the ruling of the

European Court of Human Rights and thus to meet our international obligations. I hope and believe that many noble Lords will agree that the provisions contained in the order will not have the adverse effect feared by some on the moral fabric of Northern Ireland society. I commend the draft order to the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01820">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 14th July be approved.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Gowrie</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01821">3.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01822"><member>Lord Elystan-Morgan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, by its very nature this issue is one that cuts through party boundaries in many cases. Nevertheless, in supporting the order as I do I apprehend that I shall be speaking on behalf of the vast majority of my noble friends on these Benches.<lb/>
The order deserves support both on its merits as well as on account of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights which was referred to by the noble Earl. Both the opinion of the Commission and the decision of the European Court were expressed in very substantial majorities. The Commission on 3rd March 1981, by a majority of nine votes to one, gave its legal opinion that there was a breach of Article 8, and the European Court on 22nd October of last year gave its verdict by 15 votes to four.<lb/>
As the noble Earl has already said, the United Kingdom is a signatory of the convention and under Article 53 of that convention has bound itself to bring the laws of the United Kingdom into line where any decision of the European Court of Human Rights pointed to a breach. There is no compromise possible in this situation. Either we blatantly break our international obligations as a contracting party under that convention or we initiate legislation of this type to bring the law of Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
May I say a few words about the intrinsic merits of the case as I see them. I appreciate that there are very conflicting views, sincerely held and very robustly articulated, in Northern Ireland on this matter. It is not, after all, every day that the Roman Catholic Church, the Unionist Party and the Orange Lodges all find themselves in total amity on any particular issue. But the opponents of the order see this law as a provision that will have the effect of endorsing on the part of the Government homosexual practices, if not indeed encouraging them. I do not for a moment believe that is so. The issue, as I see it, is rather whether the criminal law should be used at all times to enforce the moral law, and particularly so in the circumstances of this case.<lb/>
I venture to suggest to the House that there are two other factors which should be considered in relation to the general arguments. The first is this: in my submission, the order is nothing more than an endorsement of the <i>status quo</i>. The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>Dudgeon</i> case makes it clear that between January 1972 and October 1980 there were in Northern Ireland 62 prosecutions for homosexuality. Most of them dealt with the position of young people under the age of 18. A few were mental patients and one or two were persons who were in custody. Not one of those cases dealt with a consenting male adult over the age of 21. I am sure that, although those figures go only as far as October
<col>416</col>
1980&#x2014;I see the noble Earl nodding&#x2014;he will confirm that there have been no such prosecutions from 1980 to date. The law therefore in Northern Ireland, in so far as it is different from that for the rest of the United Kingdom for consenting male homosexuals, is a dead letter and all this order does is to place the letter of the law into line with what has been the practice in Northern Ireland for the last 15 years.<lb/>
Some will say that is an excellent argument for doing nothing and they will ask: why do anything at all? There are further considerations, are there not? First, there is the question of the guilt of the person who knows he is breaking the letter of the criminal law. Secondly, there is the question of possible blackmail. Thirdly, there is the prospect&#x2014;remote but nevertheless real&#x2014;of a private prosecution, and of course there would be no answer to such a prosecution while the law remains unamended.<lb/>
The second consideration is this: as many Church leaders over the last 15 years in relation to this issue have pointed out, the criminal law does not run parallel with the moral law. I wonder how this House would view the suggestion if, in the next Session of Parliament, we were to legislate upon the seven deadly sins? How would it greet the Gluttony (House of Lords) Bill, the Avarice Bill or the Sloth Bill? I think I had better stop there.<lb/>
Most certainly there has been, particularly in relation to sexual offences, a clear severance between the criminal law and moral law. Adultery, so far as I know, has never been a crime under secular law in Britain; nor indeed in this century has lesbianism ever been condemned by the criminal law. As a Member of another place, in 1967 I had a quite ambivalent attitude towards the Sexual Offences Bill in that year. On the other hand, I had been horrified on many occasions as a young lawyer in seeing the very harsh way in which male homosexuals were treated and the massive sentences that were passed upon them. Very often they were sent to prison with two or three in a cell, and it struck me, bearing in mind the ridicule and oppression they very often had to face, that it was almost like condemning a dipsomaniac to be sent to a brewery for some years.<lb/>
Looking at that side of the situation, one was filled with compassion: but on the other hand I felt, as many did on that occasion, the fear&#x2014;perhaps the naive fear&#x2014;that one was opening the floodgates to what might be described almost as an alternative society. For that reason I abstained from voting at all stages of that legislation.<lb/>
Looking at the situation now, 15 years later, it is clear that there never was any danger of the 1967 Act setting up any form of alternative society to the heterosexual society that the vast majority of us live in. The law in Scotland was changed some 2&#x00BD; years ago and I have never heard a shred of evidence that there was in respect of Scotland any substantial social change in relation to this matter.<lb/>
In my submission, therefore, the measure must be placed on the basis of a compassionate tolerance rather than on any question of slack permissiveness. It is right that the citizens of Northern Ireland should enjoy the same rights in this respect as the citizens of the United Kingdom. It is right also that we should place our law in line with stern international obligations.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01824"><member>Lord Foot</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in the happy position of agreeing with every word that the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has spoken. He started off by saying quite rightly that this was certainly not a party political issue. I was particularly glad that yesterday in the other place this was a matter of a free vote and there was no attempt to line up the political parties. Because it is not a party political matter, I speak today for myself rather than for my noble friends, but I suspect that the majority of my noble friends, like me, will welcome this order. Indeed some of us, including myself, believe that it is long overdue.<lb/>
Over the last 15 years since the passing of the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 we have been living with an anomaly and with what I would suggest is a not very attractive anomaly. It arose in this way. The 1967 Act was passed after prolonged public debate and discussion; there was the Wolfenden Inquiry and Report, and years of discussion before that Act was put on the statute book, It meant that in future homosexual acts between consenting adults in private should no longer he a criminal offence. But of course that Act did not extend either to Scotland or to Northern Ireland, with the result that in Scotland and Northern Ireland&#x2014;in Scotland up to 1980, when we put the matter right&#x2014;for all those years, at any rate in theory, conduct of that kind between consenting adults was liable to what can be properly described as fearsome penalties under the law. The undesirability of that state of affairs, I think, was almost universally recognised and I say that for the reason which was explained by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, just now.<lb/>
What, in fact, happened was that the Law Officers of Scotland decided&#x2014;and they told us this at the time of the passing of the amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act in 1980&#x2014;that they would not authorise prosecutions of anyone who had not committed an offence under English law. That administrative decision to disregard, in effect, the law of the land in Scotland was, of course, itself a recognition that the anomaly was unacceptable; and the same thing occurred, as the noble Lord explanied, in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
I would not myself dispute that there may be occasions when the special circumstances of one part of the United Kingdom justify some different treatment in the criminal law than in the other parts of the United Kingdom. I think that such circumstances can easily arise. They would, perhaps, justify differences of approach. Perhaps the most striking example of that is the way in which we have over the last few years suspended jury trial in Northern Ireland in certain cases because of the exceptional conditions that there obtain. But while, therefore, you obviously cannot lay it down as a fixed rule that there must be no difference in the criminal law in any part of the United Kingdom, what I find intolerable is that, in a basic matter affecting human behaviour, conduct which is permissible in one part of the United Kingdom should be liable to draconian penalties in another part. That is something which, as a matter of principle, I do not think can ever be justified.<lb/>
Therefore, I welcome this order. It comes very late. I wish that the Government and the Minister had
<col>418</col>
defended it more upon its intrinsic merits. He explained to us, perfectly properly, how the Government have been forced into this position by the decision of the European Commission. But I would commend the order to the House on its own merits. It will cancel an anomaly which has endured for far too long. I only wish that the Government had been coming forward today with this proposal on its merits and not, as it were, at the behest of the European Commission. With that said, I welcome the order and I have not the least doubt that it will receive the approval of this House, as it received in the other place yesterday.</membercontribution></p>

If I had it would be unnecessary, because I think that the noble Lord, Lord ElystanMorgan, put them admirably. So all I can say is that I am very glad that this moral decision which we made in 1966 should now be extended to Northern Ireland, to bring them into line with our own freedom in this country, and I have the greatest pleasure in supporting the order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01826">4.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01827"><member>Lord Blease</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support this order, and also the statements made by my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan and by other noble Lords on this side of the House. This order, which amends the law in Northern Ireland concerning some aspects of homosexual acts, is not, by any means, among the most serious of the issues which are today confronting the Northern Ireland people. At the same time, there is no doubt that the order has given rise to highly charged political controversy; political controversy which, I believe, has grossly misrepresented the legal implications and the socially acceptable purposes of this order; political controversy which has created a great deal of misunderstanding and the use of community energies, which could be much better employed in promoting measures to protect our children, rather than in pressing for hollow repressive penalties on adults.<lb/>
As other noble Lords have pointed out, it is important to note that this draft order will not give practising homosexuals <i>carte blanche</i>, with no public accountabilitity. The draft order has two sides to it. There are many homosexual practices which will continue to be offences under the new law. The distinction between homosexual and criminal offences is clarified in the order, and the police will be better equipped to deal with the latter and to protect those who are in real danger. It is, therefore, vital that the public should be made aware of the distinction between what the new law will permit and what were, and will continue to be, criminal offences.<lb/>
It is worth mentioning, also, that when the law is brought into line with that in Great Britain the penalties for committing or procuring the commission of an act of gross indecency with a young person under 2I years of age will be more severe than those at present in force in Northern Ireland. Such facts seem to be either ignored by objectors to this proposed new law, or else they, like so many, are ignorant of them. Such increased protection for those in real danger is to
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0218"/>
<col>419</col>
be applauded. It is as necessary in this respect as conforming with the European Convention on Human Rights.<lb/>
In April, 1977, as the noble Earl the Minister has pointed out, the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights published a report on the law in Northern Ireland relating to divorce and homosexuality. At that time, having invited and received evidence from a wide and representative body of opinion in Northern Ireland, they concluded that most people did not regard it as satisfactory to retain the existing differences in the law, and few only would be strongly opposed to changes which would bring the Northern Ireland law into conformity with that in England and Wales.<lb/>
In its report, the commission quoted from a special feature article in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, dated 19th May 1976, which read:
<quote>"Today we publish an article on homosexuals in Ulster&#x2014;who they are, how they organise themselves and what are the changing attitudes to them. It is a subject that even many liberally-minded people prefer to ignore, rather than face up to the need for a change in the law. But the point has come when, for the sake of common humanity, action should be taken... British public opinion was ready for the change nine years ago, and Northern Ireland has been catching up over recent years...</quote>
<quote>"Other things are more pressing, of course, but attitudes are changing, and in this Ulster society is becoming more compassionate and understanding. There is more than enough suffering in this community to add to it by threatening people for being what they are."</quote>
There are also those who will argue that to liberalise the law will encourage deviant behaviour. In this respect, I would echo the views of Mr. Roy Jenkins, who was then Home Secretary when the Bill of 1967 became an Act. He stated, during the passage of that Bill, that:
<quote>"There is certainly no evidence whatever that homosexuality has increased in those countries which have relaxed the law very much on the basis proposed by my honourable friend, such as Sweden in 1944, or Austria in 1960.</quote>
<quote>"Such evidence as there is goes the other way and suggests that the existence of largely unenforceable legal provisions tends to bring the law into discredit and to invest the behaviour it seeks to prohibit with a spurious and most undesirable glamour and attraction. The present law certainly does not discourage homosexuality. I believe that homosexuality cannot be described as a disease in the sense that it can be cured. It is a disability and a very real disability for those who suffer it, which greatly minimises their chances of finding ordinary, stable emotional relationships.</quote>
<quote>"The question that we have to answer is whether on top of that disability we should subject these people to the rigours of the criminal law. We would have to be very certain in our own minds that we were sustaining some clear social purpose by doing that. Unless we are doing that, we do not discourage homosexuality; we do not reduce it to any extent".</quote>
It is untrue to claim that all churches in Northern Ireland are opposed to this order. Certainly the churches in Northern Ireland are concerned about homosexuality and about overt forms of sexual behaviour and the exploitation and corruption of the moral standards of our young people. Among many bodies which do not oppose this order is the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Trade union organisations have also expressed concern about the unfair use of the present law to victimise some workers.<lb/>
We have been dealing with some of the legal aspects and I have tried to indicate a Northern Ireland point of view. I am the proud grandfather of nine
<col>420</col>
grandchildren who bring great joy to my wife and me. I believe in and seek to uphold the sanctity of the home and the family unit, but family wellbeing, happiness, care, love and tolerance must be extended with grace and understanding to others in our community. I, believe that this order is an expression of that understanding. In its judgment the European Court said at paragraph 62:
<quote>"The court has already acknowledged the legitimate necessity in a democratic society for some degree of control over homosexual conduct, notably an order to provide safeguards against the exploitation and corruption of those who are specially vulnerable by reason, for example, of their youth".</quote>
I am glad that the draft order takes care of this. For these reasons I give it my support.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01829"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise only for a few minutes, I promise your Lordships, as possibly the only Member in the House this afternoon who was a member of the Wolfenden Committee which sat some&#x2014;it seems odd to remember it&#x2014;26 years ago. It is surprising that some 26 years later we are wondering whether the recommendations of that committee should be carried into effect in Northern Ireland. I wish to make only a couple of observations in order, at least from my own point of view, to try to clear up some of the points which have been raised this afternoon and which may lead to a little misunderstanding.<lb/>
In the first instance, may I turn, almost apologetically, to the noble Earl the Minister who referred, as I remember it, on two or three occasions to the criminal law relating to homosexuality. There never has been anything in our criminal law relating to homosexuality. The mere fact of homosexuality has never been a criminal offence. The only thing that the criminal law deals with are homosexual offences which arise out of homosexuality. I think that is a point which ought to be made abundantly clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01830"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether my noble friend would give way. I am interested in what he said about the Wolfenden Committee of 26 years ago. Can he explain to the House what were the charges under which many thousands of our fellow-countrymen were almost harried to the rack? My noble friend is now saying that homosexuality is not a criminal offence. What, then, were those people harried for in the courts of this land?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01831"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, obviously it was to some purpose that I rose, if only for a few minutes, since my noble friend is under a misunderstanding. I repeat that homosexuality itself was never an offence in English law. The mere tendency to have homosexual thoughts, the mere desire to have homosexual activities was never in fact an offence under our law. It was merely giving vent to those desires and in fact committing homosexual acts which was an offence. That was a distinction which was very definitely drawn in the Wolfenden Report.<lb/>
In view of the fact that the words "moral judgment" have been used in the course of this debate, may I make it clear that the Wolfenden Committee did not make a moral judgment on homosexual offences. It made a moral judgment as to what ought to be the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0219"/>
<col>421</col>
boundary lines of criminal law and conscience. We left it to the individual conscience to decide whether or not homosexual relationships were proper or improper. It was not the purview, we thought, of the criminal law to interfere in such matters where the acts were between private persons who conducted their activities in private and with the consent of both them, if they were adult.<lb/>
Lastly, I wish to agree most fervently with those who have referred, as did the noble Lord, Lord Foot, to the European Convention on Human Rights, our obligations thereunder and the decision of the European Court of Human Rights. Too often in recent years your Lordships and honourable Members in another place have had to follow in the wake of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. I regard this as rather reprehensible in view of the tradition that we have so proudly upheld over the years: that if ever there were a Parliament, that if ever there were a nation which protected human rights it was this country. Whatever be the political colour of Governments&#x2014;and it has been emphasised that this is in no way a political debate&#x2014;we seem to lag behind, in legislative action, what ought to be done regarding human rights.<lb/>
I do hope that governments of whatever political colour will try to see to it in future that in this very sacred field of human rights we are in the vanguard and that we are teaching others, including our fellow members of the European Community, what human rights ought to be protected, instead of having to be told by the European Court of Human Rights how to behave.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01833"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who has consistently spoken and voted in favour of decriminalising this form of private activity between consenting adults on almost every occassion the issue has arisen over the past 17 years or more, and as one who strongly believes in harmonising laws throughout the United Kingdom in order to weld the kingdom more closely together, it is obvious that I wholeheartedly welcome this order in principle. But so far as the actual timing of the order is concerned, there is surely one thing which should make us hesitate, if only for a moment. This is the state of public opinion in Northern Ireland to which the noble Earl, Lord Gowrie, and others have already referred.<lb/>
Over 20 years ago at the beginning of the 1960s, or possibly right at the end of the 1950s, when this issue first began to surface the late <i>News Chronicle</i> published a most significant public opinion poll on the tentative proposals, as they were at that stage, for liberalising the law. The poll revealed a most interesting state of affairs. There was a narrow majority in the South of England in favour of liberalising the law. In the North of England public opinion was two to one against doing so, while in Scotland it was no less than eight to one against doing so. All the indications are that Northern Irish public opinion today is akin to that in the North of England 20 years ago or to that in Scotland five to 10 years ago. Let us not forget that Scottish public opinion is still fairly polarised on this issue, if the debates and Division List of both this House and another place during 1980 are anything to go by.<lb/>
<col>422</col>
This does not mean that public opinion should have the last word. An activity which is essentially private and which does not and cannot harm third parties is by definition none of anybody else's business. This applies even more forcefully to intimate personal behaviour of this nature than it does to questions of the wearing or otherwise of seat belts or crash helmets, to immunisation against infectious diseases, to smoking, to drinking and so on. But if public opinion in Northern Ireland is to be overridden&#x2014;and I believe that in this instance it must be overridden&#x2014;then it is surely incumbent upon the Government to proceed with the maximum tact and sensitivity in so doing. Unfortunately, by pushing this order through at this particular moment it will appear to many people in Northern Ireland that the Government are rushing with unseemly haste in order to prevent the measure being discussed by the new Northern Ireland Assembly, where they know the opposition will be pretty considerable, to put it mildly.<lb/>
There is a more important aspect. Many people in Northern Ireland share the scepticism of some of us here about devolution in general and the Northern Ireland Assembly in particular. But I think almost everybody there resents the under-representation&#x2014;one might say the undemocratic under-representation&#x2014;of the Province at Westminster. With this in mind we have to ask ourselves what we really want. Surely what most of us here today really want is for a halt to be called to the prosecution and harassment, and possibly the blackmail, of a small number of unfortunate individuals. Exactly how this is achieved is less important. The tactful way of achieving this objective initially, I suggest, would be for the Government to ask those responsible for initiating prosecutions in Northern Ireland not to initiate any future prosecutions. There are at least two precedents for acting in this way. The first was in the Isle of Man. When the European Court ruled against birching, legislators in the Isle of Man did not rush off to change the law; the law permitting birching still remains on the Isle of Man's statute book so far as I am aware. All that has happened is that courts no longer impose such a sentence.<lb/>
The second example is Scotland. For many years prior to the decriminalisation of private homosexual activity in Scotland two years ago, prosecutions were not brought, by tacit agreement. I agree that this can be only a short-term answer and not a long-term one, if only for constitutional reasons; bad laws ultimately must go. But within 18 months, or at the most two years, Northern Ireland is certain to be properly and democratically represented at Westminster at long last. That is the moment for an order or, better still, a Bill to be introduced to formalise what would already be an accomplished fact&#x2014;the total decriminalisation of this form of behaviour. The outcome would not be in doubt. The order or Bill would go through however the 17 Northern Ireland Members divided on the issue. But at least those in Northern Ireland who oppose this measure would not be able to claim that it was foisted upon them as a result of inadequate representation at Westminster.<lb/>
My general support for the objectives of this order is so firm that there could be no question of my opposing it; but I do regret that these admirable objectives
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0220"/>
<col>423</col>
cannot be achieved in a more tactful manner, given the sensitive state of public opinion in the Province.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01835"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be indebted to the noble Earl the Minister for the manner in which he introduced this measure, for us to fully understand what is involved. We owe a great debt also to my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan for the very sensitive manner with which he portrayed what was once a massive issue, and now we have overcome it.<lb/>
I am bound to say that I was terribly dismayed to hear my noble friend on the Front Bench, Lord Mishcon, emphasise that all could be forgiven because being a homosexual was not a criminal offence; given all the things that happen to people who are simply found out, let alone brought to trial&#x2014;careers are ruined. If I may say so, I believe that I speak with much more authority than any lawyer. I happen to have been a Staff Side chairman covering no less than 11 trade unions for all the great professions of this country. I do not know how many thieves, cat burglars and murderers were caught and were put to death or sentenced to harsh sentences, but I do know this&#x2014;and I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench will listen to this because it is vitally important, given he told me I did not quite understand, and I will tell my noble friend what I understood: although these people may not have offended criminal law, long before they came to trial no less than 27 males who committed no criminal offence committed suicide. I do not think that one should suavely and in lawyers' terms say that there was no criminal offence; there was something even worse than a criminal offence. It would be far better it' we all acknowledged that the courageous Act of 1967 did a great deal to bring civilised behaviour to these difficult quarters of mankind's behaviour, and which we in this country faced.<lb/>
I am bound to say that I am very grateful for the manner in which the noble Earl introduced this order with particular reference to Northern Ireland, and for the poignant manner in which my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan replied. It helps us to understand people who, for reasons they do not understand and we do not understand, are homosexuals. It would appear that the Victorians understood it so far as women were concerned because lesbianism was not an offence in the reign of Queen Victoria. At least we have caught up in trying to understand the difficulties. That is why I believe we ought to be pleased that such a measure has come to this House, and we ought to approve it.</membercontribution></p>

I was a member of the Wolfenden Committee which made the recommendation that became the 1967 Act my noble friend regards as so merciful. Secondly, he must have completely misunderstood me when I was explaining that in law, to think that it might be a good thing to steal was no crime and that therefore, to think that it might be a good idea to have homosexual relationships was no crime&#x2014;that it was homosexuality. I entirely agree with

I must say that so long as we still govern Northern Ireland, it is quite monstrous that we should not extend the provisions of Wolfenden to the people of Northern Ireland. We do still govern Northern Ireland. The noble Earl the Minister has made it perfectly plain here today that, for the time being, as a result of the elections in Northern Ireland, any question of complete devolution was ruled out; that we were responsible for governing Northern Ireland indefinitely and that so long as that position is maintained&#x2014;if they ever get a Government of their own and wish to reverse it they are welcome to do so&#x2014;it would he quite monstrous to exclude Ulster from Wolfenden.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01839"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships' House has a distinguished history in terms of social reform, including in this field, as I said in my opening speech. The debate&#x2014;a rather longer, more trenchant debate than I expected, but animal welfare and sexual matters always command the attention of your Lordships&#x2014;indicated that, and I am glad that we were reminded at the end that the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, had also played his part in the liberalisation of the law.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not think I have much more to say because relatively few points were put to me, and virtually all noble Lords spoke with eloquence and clarity on the issue. I would perhaps say to the noble Lord, Lord Blease, that this is the first time we have faced each other across the Dispatch Box when he has not been on the Front Bench. I regret his loss to the Front Bench by his own volition, and I am very grateful to him for the very helpful way he conducted opposition during my period in this difficult office. I notice that the noble Lord is now sitting somewhat midway between the Front Bench and what we sometimes think of as "the choristers." He also mentioned that great reforming Home Secretary, Mr. Jenkins, in his speech. I do not know whether we should read anything into this or not, but that is, of course, for the noble Lord.<lb/>
I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Monson, since he did put some questions of substance to me, certainly we were considerate of public opinion in Northern Ireland. In fact, I think we went rather further towards public opinion in Northern Ireland
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0221"/>
<col>425</col>
than many of the speakers on the Liberal Benches and some of the Back-Benches of the Labour Party thought wise, because we recognise that in Northern Ireland&#x2014;as indeed, I can say from experience, in the Republic&#x2014;there are very strong bodies of opinion which believe in prescriptive law and that human laws must be made with reference to interpretations of divine laws. That is not our way in this more secular part of the archipelago, but nevertheless that is very strongly felt and we had to take that into account.<lb/>
Having done that, there was no question of our trying to introduce this order, as the noble Lord, Lord Monson, appeared to be accusing me of doing, in some kind of unseemly haste before the Northern Ireland Assembly meets following the recent elections. The fact of the matter is that we were simply in breach of international obligations. We were in the dock, as it were, and had been found guilty. It was absolutely up to us to make rectification in respect of the individual involved, but also in respect of a change in the law. Perhaps I should have made that clear to the noble Lord and others in my opening speech. When the beak tines you, you must pay your fine; it is no good saying that to do so would generate unseemly haste.<lb/>
The other point I would make to the noble Lord, Lord Monson, is that there can he no effective recourse to administrative action while leaving the law unchanged. Even though there had been no prosecutions' in respect of adult homosexuals in Northern Ireland in recent years, the court still found that "the maintenance in force of the impugned legislation" was in fact in breach of the convention.<lb/>
My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, very clearly drew a distinction between secular and moral laws, and of course I very much subscribe to that view. I think I would end by echoing the wise words, if I may say so, of the noble Lord, Lord Blease, when he appealed for grace and understanding. I do not think two words could be better put together than that, not only in respect of this legislation, but in respect of so much else in Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Scarman Report: Brixton Disorders</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01841">4.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01842"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what progress they have made in implementing the recommendations made by Lord Scarman in his report on the Brixton disorders of April 1981 (Cmnd. 8427 of 1981).</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01843">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. The report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, on the Brixton disorders of April 1981 was dated 30th October last, almost exactly a year ago. If I may so with some diffidence, this was a remarkable report which deservedly won high esteem, except perhaps in the Monday Club, even though there may be differences of view on some of the conclusions. The Government very promptly announced their acceptance in principle of a number of the main recommendations. When the report was debated in another place
<col>426</col>
on 10th December last, and in this House on 4th February, however, the Home Secretary, and the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, not surprisingly, explained that the details were still undergoing study and consultation, and there are at least three major recommendations on which we are still awaiting the government's conclusions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01844">Since the report was published, I cannot discern that there has been an over-abundance of relevant legislation. Nor as far as I know has there been any comprehensive statement on what was being done, and it seemed that the time had come to ask for some account of progress. I am grateful to other noble Lords and to the right reverend Prelate who have put down their names to speak. I rather think the noble Lord, Lord Elton, is going to have quite a formidable questionnaire to answer when he comes to speak at the end. Perhaps I may say that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, had a speaking engagement just about now which was arranged a very long time ago, but that he hopes to be back in time to take his part in the discussion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01845">Lord Scarman was appointed under the Police Act 1964. I think that, for my part, I am bound to talk mainly about the police. It is right to say at the outset that we have gone through this summer, in London and elsewhere, without violence of the kind which led to the setting up of this inquiry, that police recruitment in general has been going well, and that, although the police have had their problems&#x2014;what with all the allegations of corruption, which have been flying about and their almost incredible ineptitude at the Palace&#x2014;they clearly continue to hold a high place in the regard of the community. All the same, no one believes that the problems pinpointed by the Scarman Report have been solved and that we can all just do nothing and hope that they will quietly go away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01846">I should like to pose some questions in the three particular areas of police recruitment, training and consultation within the community. First, on recruitment, I feel that there is some risk of attaching perhaps a little too much importance to the results to he expected from recruiting members of the ethnic minorities, but it is plainly desirable that the service should become more representative of the community it serves than it is at present. I see that the Metropolitan Police saw fit to announce for today's papers the modest success they have had in recruitment from the ethnic minorities. Perhaps the Minister will, in addition, be able to give us the national figures, both for recruitment and for the present numbers in the police service, and, if he does happen to know it, I think we should be interested to know what is the highest rank which a coloured officer has so far achieved in the police.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01847">Lord Belstead told us in the debate that, so far as the Metropolitan force was concerned, discussions were going on with the Inner London Education Authority about courses for promising candidates who narrowly failed the entrance test because their English was not quite good enough. Have those talks prospered? If so, have any results so far been achieved?</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01848">There is another aspect to recruiting which I think is important, and that is to keep out of the service applicants&#x2014;I speak of non-coloured applicants&#x2014;who are likely to show racial prejudice. Lord Belstead told
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0222"/>
<col>427</col>
us that entrance tests were being looked at to see whether they could be made better at identifying cultural bias, as he put it. Has anything been achieved there? What steps are taken during the probationary period and, in particular, in the training schools, to detect signs of racial prejudice among recruits who have survived the initial entrance tests? I am sorry to go on about this, but my fears about the matter and its importance were not assuaged by the behaviour of the Metropolitan Police Federation last Wednesday evening.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01849">I come now to training. The Home Secretary accepted that more effort is needed to be put in and said that the Police Training Council was being consulted, in particular about improving instruction on race relations, public order, and supervision and management. I confess that over the years I have listened with rather wry detachment to some of the comments about the defects of police training. I recall that before the war not only was there no national staff college but also it was not unusual, by any means, for a newly recruited constable to go out on the streets with an experienced but probably rather cynical colleague and with no other formal training whatever. It was a major innovation after the war to set up the regional training centres at which all recruits had to take a 13-week course, as it then was. Be that as it may, I sometimes doubt whether that initial impetus has been kept up and I believe that the Scarman recommendations on training were among the most important in the report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01850">I know that a number of individual forces have done quite a lot. I believe that the Metropolitan force has put in a considerable effort on training in what they are pleased to call human awareness. Outside London I have had, for example, an impressive report from the Chief Constable of Manchester about training in his force. However, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us something of developments on the national scale as regards both recruit courses and advanced instruction at the Bramshill Staff College.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01851">Thirdly, I come to consultation. The Home Secretary said straight away that he accepted the need to develop formal arrangements in every force area for consultation between police and the community at different levels. I believe that guidelines were issued during the summer about making such arrangements. But how widespread has the response been to these suggestions? What sort of pattern is emerging about the make-up of consultative committees? Do the Government consider that they are achieving worthwhile results and, in particular, gaining confidence among the ethnic minorities? Finally in this context&#x2014;and this is one of the missing pieces&#x2014;have the Government decided whether provision should be made for them by statute?</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01852">There is much else that can be said&#x2014;for example, about equipment, and the use of plastic bullets and water cannon. There is also the whole question of police accountability and the powers of the police, especially to stop and search, and the handling of complaints, on which we have just had a White Paper, which seems to me to be slightly oddly timed. But we know that the last two of these topics are likely to feature in a Bill early in the new Session, thanks to the modern practice of disclosing forthcoming legislation
<col>428</col>
well in advance of the Queen's Speech, and anyway, I have pretty well exhausted my quota of questions about the police. Before moving on, though, perhaps I may just slip in a couple more.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01853">First, have any conclusions been reached about amending the Public Order Act 1936 or has it been found that, after all, the drafting of that Act, in which I am bound to say I had some slight concern all those years ago, is perhaps more adaptable than had at one stage been supposed? Secondly, have the Government come to a final view on making racial prejudice a specific disciplinary offence?&#x2014;on which I admit I have some difficulty in going along with the Scarman recommendations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01854">The Scarman Report was bound to touch on matters going beyond the police and I am sure it would be a great over-simplification to put the whole blame on them for the riots. The police may have provided the spark which lit the fire, but the combustible material was already there. It seems to me that high unemployment, particularly among coloured youths, along with problems of housing, education and urban decay, must have served to create feelings of despair, deprivation and hopelessness.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01855">It would unduly widen the discussion on an Unstarred Question to go into all those issues, and I know that other noble Lords are anxious to ask questions about Part II of the Scarman Report on social conditions. However, perhaps I may put in a plea for us to be told a little about plans for tackling the problems of the inner cities, including the involvement of the private sector, on which a certain amount was said at Brighton, and ask whether there is any feeling in the Government that what has already been done in, say, Brixton, is having an impact upon community relations?</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01856">In a short speech of this kind it is not possible to do more than just touch on some of the issues and I am conscious that, for example, I have said nothing about the excellence of much of the work of the police and the widespread sympathy for them in their difficult tasks. But I feel I have gone on long enough and I conclude by saying this. Racial disadvantage is still a fact of life in this country and stands high in any list of social problems. The Scarman Report cast a brilliant light on some of the more important aspects of this problem. Although no one expected the situation to be transformed overnight, we know that some action has followed the report&#x2014;indeed, in some respects more than Lord Scarman himself had hoped for.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01857">However, we are still awaiting legislation and it is a shade disappointing that in one or two respects matters have not moved a little faster&#x2014;for example, on lay visits to police stations, on which, as I understand it, the consultative paper has only just been prepared. But any feeling of disappointment I might have in this context is overshadowed by my feelings about the reaction of the Metropolitan Police Federation, at the meeting to which I have already referred, to the policing plans of the new Commissioner. That is especially so when I think that among those present must have been some of the very officers who patrol the streets where the main difficulties occur. I fear that there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01858">I well recognise the difficulty for the Minister of assessing objectively whether what has already been done on central and local initiative has, indeed, made
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0223"/>

<col>429</col>
for a livelier appreciation of the problems by all ranks of the police service, by a heightened sensitivity and by a quicker response at signs of trouble. But I hope that tonight he will be able to give us some reassurance both as to what has already been achieved and also as to what lies ahead.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01859">4.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01860"><member>Lord Elystan-Morgan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the riots which occurred in the spring and the summer of last year were undoubtedly the very worst challenges to law and order that our community has experienced in this century. What they signified and what they might, indeed, portend in the future, was of such nature as to send a chill of horror into the heart of every responsible citizen.<lb/>
The report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, received as universal an acclamation as, indeed, could have been expected. It was rightly acclaimed as in incisive and accurate analysis both of the fact of violence and disorder, and of the menacing factors which led to them. The Scarman Report gave hope; it showed that the problems were not insurmountable provided we were prepared to pay the price of safeguarding our stability.<lb/>
We knew that, if the challenge was to be met, then bold, decisive, indeed, drastic action was necessary. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, has once again placed the House and the community heavily in his debt by raising this crucial issue at, if I may say so, a crucial time. Eighteen months have elapsed since the first riot erupted. The Scarman Report has been with us now for very nearly a year. In turning to the content of the report itself, I appreciate that I shall in almost every case be turning to ground that has been very well harrowed over by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. Perhaps that is not altogether a coincidence, for I spent a few happy years at a formative stage in my life as a very junior Minister in the Home Office when that Department was presided over by his massive personality.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Allen, I turn to three headings: police and policing methods; a few issues of law reform; and some of the wider considerations raised by the Scarman Report. I deal first with police and policing methods. The noble Lord, Lord Allen, has already referred to the question of police training, and I wholeheartedly commend his attitude to the House. This must surely be one of the most fundamental matters raised in the Scarman Report. The question of training decides the question of what sort of police officer we wish to mould in the United Kingdom. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, ridicules the idea&#x2014;in his most restrained and balanced language, of course&#x2014;that a period as short as 10 weeks in provincial forces and 15 weeks in the metropolitan force (raised, I think, to 16 weeks in April of this year) is sufficient training for the most complicated and demanding tasks to which our police officers have to turn. Indeed, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, came to the conclusion that there was a very strong case for a period of 12 months, but, realising that there were inevitable resource implications tied up with such a revolutionary proposal in terms of time, he came to the conclusion that the very minimum that he could recommend was a period of six months.<lb/>
<col>430</col>
When the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, replied to the debate which this House had in February of this year on the Scarman Report, he was, in my judgment, extremely vague on the question of any change in the basic structure of training. I am sure that the House will scrutinise very closely the words of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, when he replies to the debate tonight on that very question.<lb/>
There is then the question of consultation and accountability. I understand that the Home Secretary has shown clear commitment in relation to this matter by already setting up a number of consultation groups in relation to London boroughs. But as yet, as I understand it, Her Majesty's Government have not committed themselves to setting up a statutory framework for the creation of consultation groups. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, himself, in an important speech last Sunday to the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen, said on this question that:
<quote>"it was necessary for Parliament to act on his recommendations and make consultations between the police and local communities statutuory. Without that consultation, 'We cannot be sure that it will survive the rough times. It is for the rough weather that such machinery is required'... He could not see that the public would have confidence in such consultative machinery unless they knew that it was their right to use it and to make proposals for improving it."</quote>
Therefore, we should be most grateful if the noble Lord in reply can state categorically whether or not the Government are unequivocally committed to a statutory structure for these consultative bodies.<lb/>
The fact that the Government rejected the recommendation in relation to making racial prejudice a specific offence under the police code caused disappointment to very many Members of this House, I know. It was argued of course that it was not necessary, that the general provisions in relation to the standards of conduct were sufficient to cover this. I doubt whether any Member of this House was taken in by that rather thin excuse. It is a challenge that has been thrown down to Government on more than one occasion by the Police Federation. It happened in the late 1960s as well when my own party was in Government. On that occasion also, the minority&#x2014;the small raucous, bully-boys minority which is undoubtedly there in the Police Federation and, which manifested itself a few days ago in the meeting referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Allen, in what was described by the Prime Minister (and we wholeheartedly agree with her) as "disgraceful conduct"&#x2014;managed to get the Home Secretary to fudge this particular issue.<lb/>
Is there any sense at all in saying that a police discipline code which enjoins a police officer to keep himself clean and tidy, not to indulge in corrupt practices and to deal, indeed, with a number of specific matters such as those, should not contain a provision relating to racial prejudice? It is not a question of dotting the i's and crossing the t's in the police code. The whole issue is whether the United Kingdom is prepared to show the whole world that, as far as its police officers are concerned, racial prejudice is regarded as a very, very serious offence. The Government have already gone so far as to say that they accept the recommendation in relation to weeding out those who are racially prejudiced when they are candidates for membership of the police. Why in the name of logic and consistency, therefore, do they not
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0224"/>
<col>431</col>
say that proper sanctions should fairly be applied when such a trait manifests itself in a serving officer?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01861"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may interrupt the noble Lord for a moment, I agree with him, of course, that it is most important to get rid of racial prejudice, but when he uses that term does he mean racial prejudice in both directions? In other words, does he mean racial prejudice not only on the part of white people against the coloured, but on the part of coloured people against the white?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01862"><member>Lord Elystan-Morgan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, undoubtedly I do. In the terms of the force I see no reason why it should not apply equally in both directions. Of course, by "racial prejudice" I mean not so much what might be harboured in a person's mind&#x2014;that can never be made an offence&#x2014;but the overt acts of that particular officer.<lb/>
I want to turn very briskly to the question of the wider issues of law reform. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, paid particular attention to the stop and search law and, indeed, recommended that much greater study should be made of some of the anomalies which exist in relation to the test of whether a police officer is acting reasonably in relation to such a situation. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, in fact referred to the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure and I think indeed that it would be a matter upon which this House could well spend some time looking in some detail at the reforms which are clearly called for in this particular quarter.<lb/>
Then there is the question of strengthening the power of chief constables in relation to Section 3 of the Public Order Act 1936, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. In my submission it is important that a chief officer of police should have the authority, not to ban all marches over a period&#x2014;that might, indeed, be very counter-productive and an extremely blunt instrument&#x2014;but selectively to ban marches of a deliberately provocative racist character, and, indeed, if not to ban the marches completely, to ban them from certain areas of high volatility. I should have thought that that was a reform which would commend itself to the vast majority of Members of this House.<lb/>
There are issues in relation to complaints against the police which are far too complicated to raise in the very limited time that I have left. I merely ask this rhetorical question. Despite all that has been attempted over the last few years, is there any Member of this House who is satisfied that the vast majority of the public are impressed by the machinery that is set up and regard it in any way as being wholesome, or is it not, indeed, the contrary that is the case&#x2014;that the vast majority of the public are thoroughly dissatisfied with this machinery and regard it as wholly inadequate?<lb/>
There are then certain issues that go well beyond the scope of the Scarman Report, particularly the question of racial disadvantage. I do not think that one can improve upon the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, in paragraph 9.1 of his report, where he says:
<quote>"The evidence which I have received &#x2026; leaves no doubt in my mind that racial disadvantage is a fact of current British life. It was,
<col>432</col>
I am equally sure, a significant factor in the causation of the Brixton disorders. Urgent action is needed if it is not to become an endemic, ineradicable disease threatening the very survival of our society."</quote>
Housing undoubtedly forms one of those very special areas of disadvantage. The situation in relation to housing in Britain generally at this moment is most unsatisfactory. The number of housing starts last year&#x2014;1981&#x2014;was by far the lowest in any year since 1960. In the last two years, by changing the rate support grant, the Government have deprived inner city areas&#x2014;a point that was made in the debate that we had last February&#x2014;of some &#x00A3;600 million.<lb/>
Although substantial monies have been deployed to some of the areas of disturbances, the question that I would wish the noble Lord to deal with specifically in reply is this. Bearing in mind the continuous deterioration that has occurred in the 18 months or so since the troubles first manifested themselves, is he satisfied that, despite all the money that has been poured into those areas, that has done anything more at best than retrieve the situation which existed in April last year? For example, in Lambeth in the 12 months since the riots, unemployment has doubled by 50 per cent.; in Brixton in the 12 months since the riots, unemployment among young blacks between the ages of 19 and 24 has increased by 71 per cent. Indeed, for all that has been invested, is the situation in net terms any improvement whatever upon that which was extant at the time of the riots themselves?<lb/>
Sufficient time has now elapsed since the riots and the report for the Government to have decided upon firm outlines of policies. The time has surely arrived for the Government now to publish a White Paper in schedule form setting out their firm proposals in relation to each and every recommendation. We It is a polarisation made up of many ingredients&#x2014;employed and unemployed, police and cynicism and to despair. Edmund Burke says somewhere:
<quote>"For evil to triumph it is necessary only for men of virtue to do nothing".</quote>
For the disasters of Brixton, Toxteth and Moss Side to be repeated again and again in our society it is only necessary for Ministers to languish in complacency, and to be willing to turn to superficial measures rather than to deal with the challenges that confront them in the bold, radical way which the situation clearly demands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01863">5.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01864"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I agreed with nearly every word that was spoken by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, on the policing aspects of the Scarman Report. I only want to add that I was delighted to see that the noble and learned lord, Lord Scarman, noted in the speech to the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen&#x2014;to which the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has referred&#x2014;the fact that there had been substantial progress in the last year: in fact, more than he had expected. One is very glad that the noble and learned Lord saw that there were signs of optimism, bearing in mind that inevitably the two speeches which we have just heard have focused on the enormous amount of work there still remains to do. We should he under no illusion that there is a very substantial task to be undertaken before there can be any real improvement in the image that the police
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0225"/>
<col>433</col>
have in the eyes of the black community. Apparently, as we have heard, there are still some officers who do not think that this is a matter of any importance.<lb/>
But I should like to focus, not on the aspects of the noble and learned Lord's report which deal with the police, but on the analysis he made of the social conditions and their place in the aetiology of the disorders. I put it that way because, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, pointed out, the features that he looked at cannot be regarded as causes of the disorders, but taken together they are such as to create a predisposition towards violent protests. He says;
<quote>"where deprivation and frustration exist on the scale to be found among the young black people of Brixton, the probability of disorder must, therefore, be strong."</quote>
Although there were variations in the mix of background factors between the several areas in which the disturbances took place last summer, most of them were inner city areas which shared some of the features of Brixton, and those were a high ethnic minority population, high unemployment, a declining economic base, bad housing, lack of amenities, social problems, including family breakdown, a high rate of crime and heavy policing.<lb/>
It is fashionable for everybody to say that they agree with the Scarman Report, whether or not they have read it. That means that the Government have to accept the critical importance of racial deprivation, as has already been mentioned, and the imperative need to attack it with a far greater sense of urgency than we have seen from them in the past. The Home Secretary recognises this. In the debate in another place he commended:
<quote>"positive action &#x2026; to deal with more effectively than at present the special needs of ethnic minorities where they exist in education, employment and housing". [<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 10/12/1981; col. 1006.]</quote>
To measure the extent of the problem he said that ethnic monitoring was necessary. He announced that monitoring was necessary. He announced that monitoring would be introduced on an experimental basis in the Civil Service and he hoped this would be helpful to other employers, both in the public and private sectors. I have to return to the question of ethnic monitoring later.<lb/>
The first point that has to be made is that, having identified the extent of deprivation, for which monitoring is useful as a means of gaining in the precision of one's knowledge, the only weapon which is at present available for countering it directly is Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966. That provision, as I think all your Lordships would agree, has been woefully in need of repair and, so far as they go, we welcome the changes announced by the Government in the White Paper on Racial Disadvantage. That is to say, the abolition of the 10-year rule; the extension of the definition of Commonwealth immigrant for the purposes of grant calculation; the abolition of the requirement that local authorities had to have at least 2 per cent. Commonwealth immigrants on their school rolls to be eligible, and so on.<lb/>
However, as we said when we introduced the Local Government Grants (Ethnic Groups) Bill, which had lapsed because of the 1979 General Election, we believe that the scope of direct action against racial disadvantage ought to be widened and that all ethnic
<col>434</col>
minorities should be covered and not solely those linked with the Commonwealth and Pakistan. Our proposals then were rejected by the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, on the grounds that we were asking for additional resources. This is precisely the difference between us and noble Lords opposite, because we do not believe that the problems discussed in this part of Lord Scarman's report can be solved without additional funds, and noble Lords opposite seem to believe that in some miraculous way they can.<lb/>
I am aware that the urban programme funds help ethnic minorities indirectly, and I very much welcome the small increase in these programmes from &#x00A3;210 million last year to &#x00A3;270 million in 1982&#x2013;83. But this increase has to be seen, as the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has already said, in the context of cuts in the rate support grant and in the housing investment programme which in many cases have hit the authorities with the biggest problem of racial deprivation, and Lambeth is a good illustration of this. The need for better co-ordination is just as great as ever.<lb/>
Sir George Young, for whom I am sure everybody has the highest respect, was appointed as Minister of State in the Department of the Environment to consider ways in which the urban programme can be used more effectively to combat racial disadvantage. But having no executive power I am afraid that his achievements are going to be limited. I am not aware of any reshaping of the urban programme as a result of the Minister's work. But in any case I very much doubt whether the redistribution of these fairly small resources could have had more than a marginal effect.<lb/>
Mr. Heseltine has spoken of the need to involve the private sector in his department's urban programme. This is obviously to be welcomed as far as it goes, but the fact has to be faced that most of the work that needs to be done in this area is not profitable by its nature, and to ask commerce and industry to put money into projects that are for the general benefit of the community is certainly worth a try but the response is likely to be fairly minimal when many companies are finding it hard to earn profits at all and dozens of them are going out of business every week.<lb/>
The Secretary of State did have a worthwhile success, and I pay tribute to it, in persuading industry to finance some of the information technology centres established in Merseyside. I should like to be told, if the Minister could reply to this at the end of the debate, what results have been achieved so far through these ventures. Do we even know how many young black people have been given a chance to learn about electronics and computer technology, and how many of them have gone on through these centres to land a permanent job afterwards?<lb/>
Lord Scarman recognised unemployment as a major factor in the social conditions underlying the disorders. I believe we ought to accept that there is never going to be a return to full employment as it was known before the first oil crisis of 1973. I believe mankind has reached a stage of technological development when the needs for shelter, food, clothing and consumer goods can be met with only a fraction of the labour force available if everybody, say, between the ages of 20 and 60 works for 35 hours a week. That is outside the remit of the noble and learned Lord's report, but I consider we are deluding ourselves if we believe that only an upturn in the world economy is
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0226"/>
<col>435</col>
needed to bring about a return to the conditions of full employment we enjoyed for 25 years after the war.<lb/>
To avoid the permanent division of society on new class lines between those in work and those on the dole for life, with black people disproportionately represented in the under-class of the unemployed, we must cut out overtime, reduce the length of the working week, encourage early retirement, make job-sharing easier, and extend the notion of sabbatical years to the non-academic community. But in the meanwhile, and assuming it is going to take some time for the establishment to adjust their thinking in this direction, strenuous efforts have to be made to see that minorities get a fair share of the jobs that are still going: and this is certainly not happening yet.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, quoted some figures of unemployment among young black people in Lambeth. I was informed that the Lambeth Council reported in March that unemployment among the young blacks between 19 and 24 in Brixton had increased by 71 per cent. over the previous year. The leader of the Council, Mr. Robin Pitt, was reported as saying that 78 per cent. of black youngsters between the ages of 16 and 19 were out of work. And, by the way, the Home Office analysis of the arrests during the disorders of last summer make the point that between 40 per cent. and 60 per cent. of those taken into custody, depending on the area, were young adults between the ages of 17 and 20.<lb/>
I do not know whether the Prime Minister still considers that the disorders had. "nothing whatever to do with the dole queue", as she told another place on 9th July last, at column 576, on the basis of the observation that many of the rioters were still of school age, as she put it. I think it is quite likely that the youngsters who are still at school looking at older siblings and seeing how difficult they find it to obtain work realise that it is quite hopeless for them to expect anything better when their turn comes.<lb/>
The Department of Employment has expanded YOP, and the Community Enterprise Programme, and claims, I understand, that ethnic minorities will benefit considerably from this expansion. May I ask the noble Lord how many young black people are off the dole queues at the moment and how many off the register in Brixton itself as a result of these programmes? Do we know the answer to that question? The new training initiative announced in December 1981, particularly the youth training scheme, was expected to benefit ethnic minority unemployed greatly. Has it? The Manpower Services Commission was going to try to make existing programmes more responsive to black people's needs, to encourage them to use these programmes to the full and monitor their use. Where can we find the results published?<lb/>
The Department of Employment and the Manpower Services Commission were joining with others in developing special programmes at local levels in the main areas affected by social unrest. While I do not expect the Minister to provide a complete account in the course of this debate, can he undertake to provide your Lordships with lists of the projects undertaken at regular intervals and the results achieved by them? The MSC was looking into the level of participation by minorities in its business and
<col>436</col>
management courses. What was the result of this study, and if the number of black people on the courses was unsatisfactory, what steps have been taken to increase it? Finally, on the question of employment, what positive action are the Government taking to bring minorities up to a common starting level in those skill areas where they are under-represented, as is provided for under Sections 37 and 38 of the Race Relations Act? I believe that my noble friend Lady Seear will be saying more about this later.<lb/>
I now turn for a moment to housing, and I need not remind your Lordships of the stark picture painted by the Department of the Environment of the conditions in Brixton and Lambeth which they characterised as severe deprivation. Lambeth does at least try to carry out its responsibilities under Section 71 of the Race Relations Act of ensuring that, in the delivery of its services, regard is paid to securing racial equality and, in the allocation of houses, it gives one-third of lettings to ethnic minority families on the basis that one-third of the households in the borough are of minorities.<lb/>
But this is far too crude a policy because the needs of different minorities vary considerably according to the size and structure of their families, and it is necessary to monitor the ethnic composition of the queue of applicants and match it to the accommodation available. An analysis also has to be made of the ethnicity of the tenants and the houses they occupy so as to ensure that members of a particular group are not being less favourably treated than others, not because of any racist intention to discriminate against them but because of the kind of institutional racism to which Lord Scarman refers.<lb/>
I was glad that the Home Secretary came out as strongly as he did in favour of ethnic monitoring because I think it is the only way of making sure that the policies which are supposed to achieve racial equality are in fact doing so and, if not, demonstrating where corrective action needs to be taken. We need a fully monitored equal opportunity policy in the Civil Service, and not just the pilot survey which is being undertaken. It is not reasonable to expect local authorities, let alone private industry, to embark on monitoring when even the Government are adopting such a cautious approach. The Home Secretary tacitly accepts that very little will happen in these centres until the results of the Government experiment are published because, he says, he hopes publication will,
<quote>"be helpful to other employers in both the public and private sectors who are considering undertaking statistical monitoring of their work force".</quote>
Perhaps the Minister will say when the results of the experiment will be published. Is there nothing the Government can do in the meanwhile to encourage local authorities to start monitoring, not just their labour forces but the services they are providing for the people in their areas?<lb/>
On education, Lord Scarman says the time has come for a Government initiative and he lists four priority areas: under-fives, teacher training, language, and home-school liason. He endorses the Select Committee's view that failure to act, now that the facts are generally known, will cause widespread disappointment and ultimately unrest among the ethnic minority groups of our society. Unfortunately, very little seems to have happened since your Lordships debated the Rampton Report last
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0227"/>
<col>437</col>
December. I ventured to suggest then that, with falling school rolls in the primary sector, we had a unique opportunity of redeploying the human and capital resources of the educational system towards the comprehensive provision of education for the under-fives, which, it was widely agreed, would be of particular benefit to the West Indian community.<lb/>
On teacher training, the main development of which I am aware in the last year has been the proposal to close the Polytechnic of North London, which has a proud reputation for training teachers in multi-racial education. I wrote to Sir George Young drawing his attention to the dismay felt by many people over the proposal and he was good enough to promise to raise the matter with Dr. Rhodes Boyson when he saw him at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton. I asked if he would let me know what Dr. Boyson's reaction was to the representations. Is the Minister able to say anything today about the outcome of those discussions?<lb/>
The DES has adopted the traditional method of departments that want to avoid taking any positive action in respect of the Rampton Committee's recommendation. It has embarked on a very wide exercise in consultation with about 100 organisations, whose views have been sought, because the issues that were raised by Rampton, by the Home Affairs Select Committee and in the Education Select Committee's report, in so far as it dealt with the secondary school curriculum and examinations, were all interrelated, and I suppose it will wait until the last comment has been received on the last of those three reports before deciding what to do.<lb/>
In the meanwhile, some local education authorities have taken important initiatives which should be considered. The notion cot having a policy for multiracial, multi-cultural education has taken firm root, though the variations between different authorities seem to indicate that there has been very little interchange of ideas between them. The most comprehensive appears to be the policy of the ILEA, which contains several elements which might be considered by other authorities: explicit confrontation of racism, mother-tongue teaching, the use of literature from other cultures and the employment of specialist staff.<lb/>
Somehow, the discussion of these topics must be kept going at all levels when there are no disturbances to bring them before the attention of the public. It was an Irishman who once said: "Violence is the only way of securing a hearing for moderation", and the most law-abiding members of the West Indian community might be forgiven for thinking, first, that if it had not been for the riots of 1981 there would have been no Scarman Report and, secondly, that because there have been no riots during 1982, the establishment has gone to sleep again.<lb/>
One of the best ways of ensuring that our inner cities remain peaceful would be for the Government to announce a major new assault on racial disadvantage now, when things are quiet. We should do that anyway, not to protect property and make things a little easier for the forces of law and order, but because we believe in justice and equality of opportunity for everybody living in this country irrespective of colour, creed or national origin.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01866"><member>The Lord Bishop of Southwark</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Brixton lies within the Diocese of Southwark. In the past few days, within the limited time available, I have sought the views of a number of people who live and work in Brixton or who know it well. Many, but not all of them are involved in the life of local churches there. Some of what I say will inevitably reinforce points that have already been made by the noble Lord, Lord Allen, and in the subsequent speeches, but I think it is helpful to us to learn something of local comment.<lb/>
If I had more time, I would obviously have liked to speak to more people, but I doubt very much whether I should have achieved a consensus however hard I tried. In attempting to assess the situation, I have been struck very forcibly by the wide divergence of views there are about the follow-up of the Scarman Report, and I have been asking myself why: and a number of background reasons are worth mentioning here. One is the kind of expectations which the Scarman report aroused&#x2014;evidently, if one is to judge by the quotations from his recent speech, greater expectations than he himself had. The specific recommendations are not, after all, very numerous and deal mainly with the role of the police. Since the inquiry was ordered under Section 32 of the Police Act 1964, that is hardly surprising. But the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, said:
<quote>"Much could be done to achieve a better co-ordinated and directed attack on inner city problems",</quote>
and recommended action to achieve it. He also recommended full involvement by local communities, by the private sector and by central and local government. I think it is fair to say that people were not very clear what that might mean, but they had their hopes raised and they are still wondering and waiting.<lb/>
One finds people who say there has been significant progress in improving police and community relations, and others who say very firmly that there has been little or none. The gulf between, say, the attitudes contained in the Greater London Council report on policing London and the views of police working in Brixton is considerable, to put it mildly. This reflects something of the deep polarisation which has occurred and to which the Scarman Report drew attention. It is a polarisation made up of many ingredients&#x2014;employed and unemployed, police and community, black and white. Government and citizen.<lb/>
Whenever there is such polarisation, it is always hard to build bridges, and the people who try are constantly under attack from one side or both sides. I should like to pay tribute here to those who do try to build bridges and have been trying very hard to build them in the last 18 months, and to the witness and leadership not least of local churches, small in number and in membership, but vigorous in their concern about the kind of problems that we are talking about this evening. All these people need the support and understanding of the rest of us.<lb/>
The third difficulty&#x2014;an obvious one&#x2014;concerns timing. As we have already heard, legislation takes time, in particular in a democracy. The processes of change are not always open to view, especially where the police are concerned. The ordinary person in Brixton therefore sees only a little hit of the whole, and
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0228"/>
<col>439</col>
his or her bit may be very different from another bit. I say that because I have had letters telling me that nothing has happened as a result of the report, and I have had other letters describing some of the positive changes which have occurred and even expressing a cautious optimism about the future.<lb/>
One way or another though the importance of action&#x2014;visible, specific action&#x2014;is therefore enormous, because that is what people actually see. Only in this way can we begin to achieve some sense of working together for a more hopeful future&#x2014;a sense of barriers being overcome.<lb/>
As we know, in his conclusion in Part IX of the report, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, identified three main strands: racial disadvantage, the role of the police, and social conditions. Much has already been said, and I have no doubt will be said, about the role of the police, and I do not want to add to this greatly, except again to underline the point of view which I have heard locally expressed. There is total agreement that consultation must be statutory and not voluntary&#x2014;that is, consultation between the police and the community. I was also made sharply aware of the perceived difference between consultation and what was called liaison. Consultation, it was said to me should mean, "The community having a say in the way in which they are policed".<lb/>
The Government have already begun the process of introducing legislation for a new method of handling complaints, through the White Paper that has been published. The need for some independent element, and the establishment of a conciliation process is certainly seen as urgent in Brixton. The present system is far too cumbersome and secretive, and is certainly not seen as impartial, though it may be. But it is not seen in that way, and I do not see how it can ever again be so seen. Everyone was agreed on that point, and I hope that we can be told whether such legislation will come before us soon, because I think that the timing factor is so important here. I believe that it will help the police as much as the public in their relations with one another.<lb/>
There seems to be some resistance to the idea of lay visitors to police stations&#x2014;a resistance which local people certainly as yet do not understand, and I hope that if the problem exists, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, will explain what it is. It is a curious fact that before 1974 at Brixton Police Station there used to be a scheme called Help on Arrest, which involved volunteers going in on request, and which had some similarities to what is now recommended. It is said that the scheme foundered through a drying up of the supply of volunteers, but I rather guess that it also depended too much on simple good will. Again, this underlines the need for a statutory system in future, and I hope that we shall hear whether that is likely.<lb/>
As we know, considerable changes have already taken place in the method of policing used in Brixton since the riots, and these include elements of training along the lines adumbrated in the report. The overall impression that I have received is that tension has lessened but, one must add in honesty, at a cost in terms of the prevention and detection of crime. But behind that rather bald generalisation lie much more difficult issues. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, rejected the idea of "institutional racism",
<col>440</col>
but he accepted the fact of racial disadvantage and of racial discrimination and racist attitudes by individuals. But what is institutional racism? Is it&#x2014;as I think it was understood by him&#x2014;only a conscious policy by an institution to discriminate against black people or indeed any particular ethnic group within? If it is, then it is true that there is indeed little direct evidence of it in this country, and there is legislation to prevent it.<lb/>
But many people in Brixton, as elsewhere, do not perceive it so at all. They see it as the way in which white people, for the most part, continue to hold the levers of power in society and in fact&#x2014;though not always deliberately&#x2014;prevent black people from securing promotion or jobs commensurate with their abilities, or from having leadership in their community. As I say, it may not be conscious policy, but that is what is actually happening: and I may add that it is seen as happening in the Churches, as well as in other institutions.<lb/>
The abolition of <i>jus soli</i>, for instance, or the current opposition to proposed, apparently minor, changes in the immigration regulations, or the cost of delay in processing registration applications&#x2014;all those things have the effect at ground level of undermining confidence in political leadership. Therefore, they reinforce the fear that there is some kind of institutional racism around, and that nothing very much will actually happen to tackle the underlying problems which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, so powerfully indicated in his report.<lb/>
I have received many reports which underline the kind of things that have been said, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and I hope so much that the way forward, and the questions that he put before us, will be thought about very seriously in relation to housing, unemployment, and education, because they certainly are at the very root of the difficulties that are felt in the Brixton community.<lb/>
The Brixton riots were a warning, and a very terrifying one, too. The Scarman inquiry has certainly helped us to focus attention on some of the factors which seem to have contributed most to that and other conflagrations. I think that this debate has already shown, and will continue to show, that significant progress has already been made in a number of ways which affect the role of the police&#x2014;and that is to their credit&#x2014;and we shall look forward to further legislation to reinforce this.<lb/>
But of course that is not all that is required; and the fear that I have repeatedly heard expressed is that the polarisation of our society will in fact continue to grow worse in places such as Brixton. It is at this point more than any other that Government reassurance and positive leadership are most needed, both in terms of showing recognition of the fundamental problems and in offering firm, generous, and wide-ranging action to meet them. What (dare I ask?) will it profit us if we have so quickly won the battle against inflation&#x2014;I certainly want to see that battle won&#x2014;if we have reaped another harvest of bitter despair?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01867">5.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01868"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is common ground that we are deeply indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, for having
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0229"/>
<col>441</col>
initiated this debate, which, quite apart from anything else, has given us the opportunity of listening to the speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark&#x2014;an outstanding speech, if I may say so, and I found myself in almost total agreement with what he said. I think, again, it is common ground that what took place in Brixton 18 months ago were among some of the most serious incidents that we have experienced in this country. Taken together with the disturbances which subsequently took place in Southall, Toxteth, Moss Side and, indeed, elsewhere, they represented, and still represent, a very grave threat to our society.<lb/>
I would say at once that, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, said at the week-end in his Sir George Bean memorial lecture, it is clear that some progress has been made. Indeed, I think the right reverend Prelate who has just resumed his seat said that by and large that was his view, too. In Brixton, the Metropolitan Police and the Home Office have taken, I think, a number of useful initiatives to improve relations between the local community and the police; and I am quite sure that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, will be dealing with this in the speech which he is going to make at the end of this debate. I think it is also right to acknowledge the very substantial amount of work done by many private citizens and, indeed, by many in the private sector.<lb/>
However, today our principal responsibility is to assess the Government's response to the noble and learned Lord's report. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, has directed so many questions at the Government (and, indeed, so have subsequent speakers) that I propose to deal with only a relatively limited area&#x2014;three issues, two of which are in the area of the police. First, I welcome the fact that the Government have now announced their proposals for dealing with complaints against the police. These have already been sharply criticised by the normal coalition that always exists in matters of this sort. Both the National Council for Civil Liberties and the Police Federation have indicated their total opposition to them; and I am afraid that this coalition of opposites always exists when in fact we are discussing complaints against the police.<lb/>
I do not think it is sensible to go into this matter in any detail tonight. The Government's reply to the Fourth Report of the Home Affairs Committee in another place was published only last week, and I do not think it is sensible to make instant comments on matters of this degree of complexity. All I would do is to say that, broadly speaking, I welcome the fact that the Government have accepted the recommendation of the noble and learned Lord that there should be a conciliation procedure for dealing with complaints. I hope, however, that the Government will ensure that this section is going to be drafted, so far as the legislation is concerned, with particular care. Of course, there are, indeed, many complaints which appear at first sight to be minor but which can in fact prove on subsequent investigation to relate to far more serious questions. I think it is important that this is recognised and dealt with, in so far as it can be, in the legislation.<lb/>
I am glad, too, that it is proposed that some of the less serious allegations of criminal conduct by police officers should be referred to the Police Complaints
<col>442</col>
Board rather than to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I know that that view, if I may say so, is very strongly shared&#x2014;at least, I suspect it is&#x2014;by the Director of Public Prosecutions, because the workload in the DPP's office in dealing with large numbers of relatively minor allegations of criminal misconduct is, I think, beginning to assume overpowering proportions. This, I am sure, is a sensible recommendation, and I welcome it.<lb/>
Secondly, I turn to the issue of police training. I spoke at some length about this in our debate last February, and I make no apology for returning to it tonight because I think, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, this is indeed one of the most important single recommendations in the report, and I know that that is the view of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, himself. Let me remind the House again of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, recommended in paragraph 518, when he said:
<quote>"I am satisfied that the length of the present period of initial training for recruits is insufficient. It cannot he right&#x2014;and it is no criticism of them if I say so&#x2014;that young men and women of 19 and 20 are enabled to exercise the powers and responsibilities of the office of constable after a period of initial training which lasts only 15 weeks in the Metropolitan Police and only 10 weeks in the training centres which serve the provincial forces."</quote>
As I reminded the House last February&#x2014;indeed, I do not have to do so again this evening because it has already been done by the noble Lord, Lord ElystanMorgan&#x2014;it was made quite clear by Lord Scarman that what he wanted was not the six months which in fact he recommended in his report but a far longer period&#x2014;that of 12 months' initial training. This recommendation&#x2014;that is, the six months' recommendation&#x2014;was supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers (who already had been looking into this matter because of their own anxieties, as the professional heads of the Police Service, about the inadequacy of the period of training), by the Superintendents Association and by the Police Federation. It was backed by virtually everybody who spoke in the debate we had last February, and it has been backed by virtually everybody who has spoken today.<lb/>
We then turn to what the Government's response has been. We were told by the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, on the last occasion&#x2014;and I quote from column 1398 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 4th February last:
<quote>"... we fully accept the importance given to police training by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman".</quote>
I suppose that was a start of a kind, but it did not in fact go particularly far to indicate that the Government, quite apart from recognising the importance of the issue, were in fact going to accept without qualification the central recommendation.<lb/>
We were told by the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, that the Police Training Council had met in January and that they had set up a number of working parties and would be meeting again in the autumn to review progress, and I know that that meeting is soon to take place. We were informed with something approaching pride that the Metropolitan Police training courses were being extended from 15 to 16 weeks&#x2014;by precisely one week; in other words, an increase of less than 10 per cent. of what the noble and learned Lord,
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0230"/>
<col>443</col>
Lord Scarman, indicated was the absolute, irreducible minimum, so far as he was concerned, for the period of training in an initial training establishment.<lb/>
Quite bluntly, I believe that this approach has been, and remains, too leisurely. We cannot run the risk of continuing to send young men and women out on to the streets as police officers trained for as brief a period as this. Particularly is this so when we see, as we saw only at the end of last week, the inexorable rise in serious crime and (and we appreciate that this has been dealt with in virtually all the speeches which have been made today) the complexity of the task of being a policeman or a policewoman in our multiracial society.<lb/>
I hope that, today, we are going to hear something far more satisfactory from the noble Lord, Lord Elton, than we heard from his noble friend Lord Belstead when we last debated this issue. I have no doubt, of course, that the Police Training Council, which consists of a number of very senior and responsible officers in the Police Service, academics and many others, will produce some valuable ideas: but nearly a year after the report by the noble and learned Lord what we want to hear from the Government&#x2014;and I put this matter in the clearest terms to the noble Lord&#x2014;is that the Government are prepared to make the resources available to make the six months training period recommended by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, a real possibility. That is the question, and I hope we are going to get a clear answer today on that particular issue.<lb/>
I turn now, if I may, lastly, to the wider issues involved in the Brixton disturbances and those in Toxteth, Moss Side and elsewhere. First. I think we should register an emphatic view about what happened last year. We should not encourage anyone to have sentimental feelings about rioters&#x2014;about people who hurl bricks at unarmed policemen, about looters who destroy the businesses of small shopkeepers and those who throw petrol bombs at passing motorists. I deplored then, and I still deplore, the statement made at the time by the chairman of one of our police authorities that, in some mysterious way, such atrocious conduct in some circumstances, can be justified. It cannot.<lb/>
But it is equally absurd to ignore what is actually happening in our inner cities&#x2014;the rotting housing, the poor schools and, above all, the remorseless rise in the length of the dole queues, particularly those affecting young men and women. In no way do I excuse criminal conduct by people simply because they are unemployed or otherwise under-privilaged. Countless thousands of such people live decent and honourable lives. But we simply deny reality if we ignore the helplessness and despair which is now arising in many of our inner city areas. There are hundreds of families, as we all know, where the father has lost his job, the mother may have a part-time job, two children in the family have never had a job since leaving school and two more still at school who know that almost certainly they will be going on to the dole queue as well.<lb/>
We discuss that in the context of today's unemployment figures where it is once again demonstrated that there is yet another rise in the
<col>444</col>
seasonally-adjusted figures for unemployment and where 60 per cent to 70 per cent. of young blacks in Brixton do not have jobs&#x2014;as bad a figure as exists in some of the great cities in the North-East of the United States.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01869"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the noble Lord agree that it is very misleading to give the number of black unemployed without at the same time giving the number of white unemployed which, I should suggest, is quite comparable?</membercontribution></p>

I would find it astonishing were that to be so.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for Employment told us the other day that if unemployment continued to run at a figure of well over 3 million, it would damage the fabric of our society. I think that most of us would agree with that. But, unhappily, there appears at the moment to he absolutely no prospect whatever of a downturn in future levels of unemployment. I think that it is simply silly for us, in any circumstances whatever, to persuade ourselves that with this degree of gravity of the situation obtaining in inner city areas, in some way this can he dealt with by the police alone, however capable they may be.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Scarman, said in his report that while good policing can diminish tension and avoid disorder it cannot remove the causes of social stress where, as in Brixton and elsewhere, they are so deeply embedded in fundamental economic and social conditions.<lb/>
A decade and a half ago, the United States experienced similar widespread disturbances. Just as in this country, indeed, just as in Brixton, it started as a simple, isolated incident. It was in Tampa, Florida, where a policeman was involved with a young black named Martin Chambers. There were riots and these were accorded widespread television coverage. Within 24 hours, there were riots in Cincinatti, six days later there were riots in Atlanta in Georgia and three days later in Newark, New Jersey. President Johnson then appointed the Governor of Illinois to head a national advisory commission to investigate these disturbances. They made a substantial number of recommendations, many of which were implemented. There are, of course, many substantial differences between the situation which then obtained in the United States and the situation in our city areas today.<lb/>
But, having said that. I think that it behoves us all to consider what was said to Governor Kerner's commission by one of its principal witnesses, Dr. Kenneth Clark, then the President of the Metropolitan Applied Research Centre in New York. What he said was this:
<quote>"I read that report of the 1919 riot in Chicago, and it was as if I were reading the report of the investigating committee of the Harlem riots in 1935 &#x2026; the Harlem riots of 1943 and the report of the McCone Commission in the Watts riots in Los Angeles".</quote>
He continued:
<quote>"I must again say in candour, to you members of this Commission it is a kind of Alice in Wonderland&#x2014;with the same moving picture re-shown over and over again, the same analysis, the same recommendations and the same inaction".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0231"/>
<col>445</col>
This country, unlike the United States, has not experienced the same degree of turmoil with so many acts of savage violence over a period of so many years. But, last year, most of us witnessed scenes in our cities that we did not believe we would ever experience in this country. I think that in such a situation it is essential for us to recognise that what is needed in dealing with this is a major national effort to ensure that there is no repetition. We cannot, as a society, tolerate the complacent acceptance of the present levels of unemployment and decaying public services that we see around us in so many of our inner city areas. I believe that if this situation is not reversed, whatever the police may do, the very cohesion of our society will be threatened.<lb/>
But, of course, I recognise that it would be equally mistaken to say that the state and the apparatus of the state can, by itself, do everything. One of the most notable consequences of the disturbances which took place in the United States in 1967 was the decision by many large private corporations to become more actively involved in the regeneration of their own cities. What I think we need in this situation is a real partnership between the local communities, the local authorities, the public agencies, Government and the private sector. That, I believe, is the only way in which urban decay can be checked and then reversed and in which new employment opportunities and a more positive co-operative atmosphere can be created. I hope that we will receive some message of hope on just that area from the Government tonight.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01872"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to be brief and I would like to back up the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, because I think that the questions he has raised this evening are so important. But, against this background, what are we now to think against what happened last week when we had a demonstration on the other side of Parliament Square and we had the Secretary of State and the Commissioner shouted down at a police meeting? Apparently, that has passed overlooked by many: I think it is a very, very important indication. But not noise. What I wish we had had was a little more original thought under caps with chequered bands instead of just noise during that meeting.<lb/>
I have often followed the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, on the list of speakers. We have both studied and had contacts with the police. He has had more contact at the level of the top of the ladder and I have had probably more contact with police constables. But the two together have made quite a good mix.<lb/>
As to the questions which we have in the main report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, I have worked out that there are 13 main recommendations. One cannot speak to more than one or two of them and at this time in the debate I must indeed be very brief. I want to speak again&#x2014;as have so many others&#x2014;about consultation. Consultation is not in the nature of many senior police officers. Trained by university men to use our minds in quite a different way, we have been trained in quite a different way from many, many police officers. There are very few police officers who are really good at consulting when

<col>446</col>
they have mixed committees put together from local authorities and others. They are not so flexible or tolerant and many senior officers are kept for far too long in the same appointments.<lb/>
There is one point which I hope that the noble Lord in the Home Office will study. It is wise for us to see some of the things that develop in other police forces in neighbour countries. It does not naturally or easily happen that police officers become aware of this. There is a great deal of consultation in certain forces which developed in what we used to call the British zone of Germany. It is very interesting that a lot of what was developed in those days was a British worked-out plan which they felt was going to be a great help to those regional police forces which were hived off from the German national police service.<lb/>
Today we still have some such consultation mandatory in certain parts of North West Germany. Some is permissive and some has disappeared altogether. I should like to hear from the noble Lord (in a letter if he cannot do more) how he considers that this particular consultation has developed. Consultation is very difficult to organise and carry through. In Britain little consultation as yet has happened, and little has happened in London where it is most needed. It is not only the politicians with whom the police are expected to consult. Individuals could be so valuable because they are not just delegations of particular communities. As vet we have heard very little about what is happening in the Metropolitan forces and in our county forces. If you speak to senior police officers they always say, "All sorts of things are going on. A lot is happening". It is very, very difficult to find out exactly about their organisation and the amount of consultation which they have started.<lb/>
Now may I say a word about training and take up perhaps two minutes? When we talk of extending the periods of initial training from 15 to 16 weeks, we do not know so much about the quality of that training. I would far rather have higher quality than to see just one week added.<lb/>
It is very different in many ways on the Continent, and there are, both ways, advantages and disadvantages. Most police forces on the Continent are much more serious about initial training. Their periods of training are very much longer and they put far more emphasis on group training and not just on individual training. In Britain we put much more stress on individual training whereas others, the Germans for instance, start with group training which is much easier and then they move on. We have for a long time paid much less attention to group training.<lb/>
Then there is the question of our equipment. Until a very short time ago we had very little equipment compared with that of many other forces. We also have too few civil instructors for our initial training. I went round certain forces a few years ago and I found that the police in this country were scornful about training and scornful about equipment but things have been changing. They realised then that when they have trouble to face dustbin lids alone are not now sufficient.<lb/>
The last point that I should like to intrude here is that the noble and learned Lord's report made no reference to the training of special constables. I would have thought that they could have been a great help. A better trained body of special constables would be a
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0232"/>
<col>447</col>
great advantage. Many of them are at least as able as normal regular constables.<lb/>
Tactics have hardly been studied. Some of the less successful among our inflexible seniors could have really slipped away. Over the past two years it is remarkable&#x2014;how unsuccessful we were in Bristol and in London&#x2014;I do not think a single senior police officer slipped quietly away. What we want is supervision by the brighter, rising officers who are much more sensitive and much quicker in the uptake. We want to see these young officers with their sights on the higher appointments.<lb/>
I should also like to see serious examinations in the Home Office. At the present moment the stereotyped examinations which are taken by junior police officers are laughable. There is not a single sentence of English in some of these examinations&#x2014;just a tick in the box. I like to think that the Home Office overlooked this examination, which might have reached the table of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elton. What we want is common sense all round, and instructions for younger police officers, and, most of all, a true sense of integrity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01873">6.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01874"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, for introducing this debate. I apologise that I missed the first couple of minutes of his speech because I did not think the debate would come on as quickly as it did. I am personally grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark for his speech, which was very good. I want particularly to underline the point he made about expectations. It is possible for us to delude ourselves about that. What has happened is the problem which confronted us last year was successfully defused by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman. The country should be very grateful to him for that. The consequence of that is that there have been expectations and if these expectations are not fulfilled then the reaction may be something that we shall all regret. I think it is fair that we ought to recognise this. I am grateful again to the right reverend Prelate for pointing out the importance of action because it is action that is required; it is action that will deal with these expectations.<lb/>
I want to comment on a few points, and I want to start with a question of consultation and accountability. It is absolutely essential&#x2014;and I use that word advisedly&#x2014;that we should have statutory consultation machinery. As noble Lords know, I was with the Community Relations Commission for nine years. Therefore, I know what I am saying when I say that there have been liaison committees all over the country, but they break down at the first fence. The first time there is a problem they break down, and one of the problems about all these liaison committees is that they are only able to discuss what the police want discussed. Therefore, we need to have consultation committees which have certain powers that are delegated by Parliament and therefore the need to consult on those issues. There should be no problem about separating the question of policy from the question of day-to-day operation. That can be done. What is required is that when there are difficult situations the fact of the consultation committee being
<col>448</col>
a statutory one makes it obligatory on all involved to continue to use the committee. That is the first point, and I hope that the Home Office will take it on board.<lb/>
I have attended meetings of various kinds and I have the impression that the Home Office have not made up their minds as to whether or not they are going to have these committees given statutory powers. I think they are fooling themselves because they think they have done well, for instance, by setting up a good committee in Lambeth. But Lambeth had a committee before; Haringey has one now; and there are committees all over the place. Let us not fool ourselves about it. What we need are committees that have statutory powers and which have the underpinning of the law with them, so that they can actually function.<lb/>
While on that, I want to say that the noble and learned Lord also recommended that the question of an advisory committee for the metropolitan force between the Home Office and the local boroughs should be considered. I should like to hear from the Minister that that is being considered, because none of the discussions I have heard since the Scarman Report has suggested that it is being considered at all. What we have in London is definite polarisation between the GLC, who are insisting on establishing a police authority for London and encouraging everybody to establish a committee which would fit into their framework, and the Home Office, with its nice consultative committee about which it has not made up its mind as to whether or not it will be statutory. I should like to say to the Government that they need to take on board the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, that an advisory committee along the lines he suggested might be a very useful additional instrument.<lb/>
I should like now to turn to the question of recruitment. The noble and learned Lord raised the question of the importance of recruitment from the ethnic minorities. I wonder to what extent the police have liaised with the Army and the Air Force with a view to getting members of the ethnic minorities who are in the forces and who are leaving to join the police force. I speak with a fair amount of knowledge because several of my patients&#x2014;chaps I knew when they were in their mothers' wombs&#x2014;are now in the forces and some have already done their 12 years. They come out of the Army well trained, of course. Something was said earlier about having training in electronics and technology, and I can assure you that some of the boys I know are first-class, from the point of view of electronics and technology, when they leave the Army. Then they can get jobs which in effect they would never have been able to get if they had remained in civvy street. They have had training in the Army which they would never have got in civvy street. I know what I am saying when I say that liaising with the Army is very important for the police to be doing. The chaps I am talking about, of course, would not join the police force because they can command greater salaries and better conditions elsewhere, but there are a lot of others and I believe that quite a few of them would in fact consider a police career and would be very useful.<lb/>
I should like also to comment on the cadet scheme. My information is that it is being wound up because most forces are now up to requirement. The cadet scheme is a second way through which I see a fair
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0233"/>
<col>449</col>
amount of recruitment taking place from the ethnic minorities. Therefore, I should like to hear from the Minister that what I have been told about winding up the cadet scheme is not true. I should like also to say just a word on training. I would merely suggest that, during the course of their training, if officers are made to spend a period of time working with local community relations councils, they would benefit tremendously. I hope that is one of the things the Government have in mind in their training programme.<lb/>
I have been very interested in all that I have heard about the various methods now being used to make sure that people who are racially prejudiced are not admitted to the police force. Be that as it may, once an officer is admitted, it should be quite clear that if he behaves in a racially prejudicial manner the punishment must be of the severest. Therefore, I am not able to understand why there is this hesitancy on the part of the Government to endorse the recommendation of the noble and learned Lord that racially prejudiced behaviour&#x2014;it is behaviour we are talking about&#x2014;should be a serious offence under the police disciplinary code and the police should understand that the consequences of that would be dismissal.<lb/>
A gain, I should like to hear from the Minister some information as to how far the discussion on whether or not the Public Order Act needs amendment has gone. My own view is that it should not be so difficult to make it possible for marches that are obviously prejudicial to public order to be banned. I cannot see why, in order to stop marches that are prejudicial to public order, every other march should be stopped. Therefore, I hope this discussion has got some way, so that the Government can tell us that they are satisfied that, under the present law, this can be done or, if not, that they are proposing to change the law to make it possible.<lb/>
I should like to make just a last remark on this question of racial disadvantage. I grew up in Grenada in the 'twenties, and in Grenada in the 'twenties there was racial prejudice. The black middle class was developed through the teaching profession, through the professions of medicine and law and through the Civil Service. That was how in those colonial territories the black middle class was developed.<lb/>
I have never been able to understand why it is so difficult for a Government who have ruled colonies for all those years and who have seen how these things have happened to stop them here. The truth is that what is required is some activity from central Government to make themselves a model employer, so that they can not only by edict, but by example, encourage equal opportunities in employment throughout the country. Also, by having blacks rising in the Civil Service they can demonstrate that blacks who are capable of making their presence felt can rise to the top. That is something which the Government can do.<lb/>
In fact, discrimination in employment is the one thing which the Government can really deal with, because it is not only the Civil Service; it is the nationalised industries, it is their influence upon local authorities and it is their influence as a contractor. In a funny sort of way, some local authorities are doing better than Central Government in this matter. That is the way in which it is working out, because the Government are so afraid to do what is right and what
<col>450</col>
can have really good consequences.<lb/>
The other point I want to make, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, concerns the North London Polytechnic. I wonder whether there is any kind of cohesion in Government on issues of this kind. The North London Polytechnic was doing a specific job in helping to train a particular type of black teachers, who were already mature, and they were having tremendous success with it. Yet they received a memo from the Department of Education and Science, suggesting that that should be wound up. I find these things quite incredible and I am unable to understand the thinking that goes on in Government when issues of this kind arise. I have spoken for long enough. I hope that I have put a sufficient number of questions to the Minister and that when he replies I may have favourable answers to some of them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01876"><member>Lord Hylton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, whom I first met several years ago just across the river during the final year of the old London County Council. I am sure that the whole House will have listned with close attention to his very thoughtful speech.<lb/>
When we debated the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, last February, I mentioned the Rastafarian dimension of West Indian life in this country. I argued that we should give to Rastafarians the respect due to members of a genuine religion, in the same way as we respect the diet or the sabbath of the Jews or the dress of the Sikhs. I asked that considerate treatment should be extended to Rastafarians in prison. The noble Lord, Lord Belstead, was able to tell me that instructions had already then been given to detention centres to respect the well-known dreadlocks. Later, in a characteristically helpful letter to me, the noble Lord said that Prison Circular Instruction No. 60 of 1976 was being reviewed with regard to Rastafarianism.<lb/>
I should like to ask tonight: has the revised instruction already gone out or, if not, when will it be issued? Now that the loss of liberty is widely regarded as the true purpose and penalty of imprisonment, I am sure that no one would wish to deprive Rastafarians or members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church of spiritual ministration from approved members of their churches while they are serving sentences. If the noble Lord, Lord Elton, could comment on this proposition I should be most grateful.<lb/>
I turn now to a more general aspect of West Indian society in Britain. The West Indian age structure may not yet have been very much studied. Adult West Indians, who arrived in Britain during the 1950s and 1960s, will be reaching retirement age by, or before, the year 2000. As well as there being a young and middle-aged population, we shall then find ourselves with numerous West Indian pensioners. There is time available now to make plans for this rather novel situation, but it is essential that serious thought should he given to this without further delay.<lb/>
On the question of pensions and welfare, I believe that reciprocal agreements already exist between this country and both Jamaica and Bermuda, and I understand that the High Commissioners of the other Caribbean islands are at present considering the negotiation of similar arrangements. It seems that
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0234"/>
<col>451</col>
some difficulties are likely to arise concerning the smaller islands, which have somewhat less evolved welfare systems. If these difficulties should prove substantial, I urge the Government to consider making augmentable pensions available, even without full reciprocity. I say this because I believe that it will be in the best interests of all that West Indians who have contributed much to Britain, often in difficult circumstances, should be enabled to retire to the islands if that is their personal desire.<lb/>
I conclude by mentioning the views of a West Indian friend of mine who has already given evidence to the inquiry of the noble and learned Lord, and who is the director of Caribbean House in Hackney and also an organisation called West Indian Concern. He stresses, particularly, the importance of culture. We English sometimes take culture a little lightly, or even tend to dismiss it altogether. Our own problems in understanding the Scots and the Welsh and, above all, perhaps the Irish show how peoples who share the same language can have very deep mental differences in their culture. It can, I think, be shown that West Indian culture exists in Britain today and that it has slight variations as between one island and another. A further distinction may be made between the culture of West Indians born in the Caribbean and of their children who have been born in Britain. This increases the normal generation gap and aggravates the possibility of teenage rebellion.<lb/>
If all this is correct, one begins to see that institutions designed and adapted for 20th century English people may not necessarily be suitable or satisfactory for people of a very different culture. I believe that this is true not only of school and technical colleges, but also of penal institutions, courts and police forces. One cannot assume that the standard solution will work automatically. Perhaps the most dramatic instances of unsuitable treatment have been seen when local authorities in Britain have taken West Indian children into care. This. I suggest, should not be done on purely Engish criteria. The social services should learn to work with and not against the grain of the West Indian extended family.<lb/>
I would urge that in all fields we should be prepared for cultural and institutional innovation. For instance&#x2014;here I come to the question of the recruitment of police which has been mentioned by so many previous speakers&#x2014;would Her Majesty's Government explore the possibility of enlisting mature adult West Indians into the police on short service contracts of, say, three to 10 years? I am thinking of men and women, perhaps between the ages of 30 and 50, who have shown a stable record in their previous jobs and who are perhaps already known and respected in their local communities. These are the kind of people who can best understand and respond sentitively to the anti-social behaviour of some young West Indians. It may well be that such mature people would he easier to find, and more effective when found, than recent school-leavers. Figures published in today's edition of <i>The Times</i> on the recruitment of West Indians by the Metropolitan Police were modestly encouraging. It is clear, however, that continued and greater effort is needed in this direction, together with a willingness to try new and different methods of recruitment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01877">6.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01878"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to concentrate on one particular aspect of this problem and on one facet of that problem. It is the issue of unemployment. In the Scarman Report the point was made that at that time&#x2014;and we have been told this evening that the figures have worsened since that date&#x2014;55 per cent. of young blacks in Brixton were out of work. Many speakers have deplored this in our debate today. However, I want to underline that this is not only a problem for the present (and not only in Brixton but in many other parts of the country where the same figures could be repeated) but that it is building up a tremendous problem for the future. Not only are these young men out of work, but they are among the unskilled. Because they have not had work, because they have not had training they will continue to be unskilled.<lb/>
All we know about future employment prospects tells us that the position of the unskilled is going to be incomparably worse than the position of any other particular group in employment. If we have a very high percentage of ethnic minorities who are both out of work and unskilled and who pass into the adult labour force as unskilled, in all those areas where we have high densities of ethnic minorities we are going to continue to have a large proportion of the total labour force of those minorities who will probably never get regular work. So I want to underline that this is not only an immediate problem but a problem of great future importance over which drastic and systematic action needs to be taken&#x2014;and taken on a much larger scale than has been contemplated until now.<lb/>
There is another point about leaving so many of the ethnic minorities without a skill. Even if they get jobs in the difficult competition for jobs of that kind, what kind of a labour force inside industry or other areas of employment are we going to have in the future? There will be a divide, with the coloured population in the lowest grades of jobs, supervised and managed by whites. If we are asking for a dangerous, explosive and very unjust situation inside industry, a recipe for it is to have not only the inevitable conflicts, with which we are all so familiar, between management and employees but for them to be reinforced by the fact that there is an ethnic difference, and a difference of colour, as well as a difference of status and grade inside industry. This, therefore, is a problem of long-term importance of, I submit, the very highest order.<lb/>
In Section 37 of the Race Relations Act there is provision for discriminatory training in favour of groups under-represented in particular occupations. They are designated training schemes. I want to ask the Minister&#x2014;perhaps I should have given him notice of this question in advance and I apologise for not having done so&#x2014;how many applications there have been to the Department of Employment for designated training schemes in favour of ethnic minorities (because such schemes can also be provided for women), how many schemes have been submitted, how many schemes have been sanctioned, and whether the Government can take steps to give much greater publicity to the fact that there is availability to undertake these schemes. Perhaps I should declare on interest. I speak as chairman of a small organisation, Charta Mede, which is working on the problems of employment for ethnic minorities.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0235"/>
<col>453</col>
We have found great ignorance of the existence of Section 37 and of what can be done to help to improve the skill levels of ethnic minorities by the use of that section.<lb/>
I should also like to ask what the Government have done&#x2014;I am sorry to be saying these things in the absence of the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, who I know has special responsibility for what goes on inside the Civil Service&#x2014;regarding terms of employment in the Civil Service. Section 37 can of course be used, and surely could be used with very great advantage, by the Civil Service for its own employees. In the strongest words possible I should like to reinforce what the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, has said. If one is trying, however modestly, to work in this field it is the very greatest handicap when you are talking to employers in the private sector if' you cannot point to the Government and say, "Look what the Government are doing in terms of their own employees". It is very understandable that the hard pressed private sector employers, cutting down on staff and with all the problems of survival which many of them are facing, should not be introducing Section 37 designated training courses when they do not see the Government giving a lead. May I therefore ask the Government whether they have introduced any Section 37 training courses inside the public sector and, if not, whether they are prepared to consider courses of that kind?<lb/>
Secondly, in relation to what the Government could do to give a lead in this field, there is that other very ill-understood section of the Race Relations Act 1976, Section 1(1)(<i>b</i>), about indirect discrimination. In connection with such little work as I have done in this field I have often asked (when I remember I always ask) seminar groups what indirect discrimination means. I have found only one group which understood what it meant. Most people believe that it means a particularly underhand and devious kind of discrimination. It is, I believe, one of the most powerful sections of the Race Relations Act. It is not understood, it is not known about, and therefore there is not the faintest hope of its being used. It is extremely easy, without any deliberate intention but simply because of one's customary assumptions, to be guilty of indirect discrimination without any intent so to he.<lb/>
Again, I should like to ask the noble Lord the Minister what the Government themselves are doing to explore their own employment practices and discover whether they are guilty of indirect discrimination&#x2014;if "guilty" is the right word when it is an act which you perform unaware that you are performing it. So long as you are unaware it is, of course, in a sense not to be condemned. But surely it is to be condemned if no steps are being taken to find out whether you are committing it.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Minister will recall that it is now over three years since the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations produced a report on the Government's policies regarding their own employees in matters of race relations, which said that, while they had not detected discrimination, they did consider that there were hazards of fairness in Government practice. Surely that should have been a warning light to the Government&#x2014;that they must be aware that in their own practice there are hazards to fairness. I am aware that there have been difficulties in following up
<col>454</col>
that report, but it is over three years ago and the detection of indirect discrimination is surely one of the most important lines of advance if the Government really want to be sure that there are no hazards to fairness left in their practices.<lb/>
I can fully understand that it is not easy for the Government to tackle the whole of the Civil Service at one time; this would be a very large undertaking. But a narrow front approach is possible. Surely it is possible in some Government departments where it is easy to make a start&#x2014;one cannot make a start everywhere&#x2014;to see what is happening under Section 1(1)(<i>b</i>) and what scope there is for designated training under Section 37. If the Government could be seen using their own legislation in their own practices and giving great publicity and support to designated schemes outside Government service, this would be a very practical advance in the short term. It would also do something to avoid the very serious long-term consequences of having so high a proportion of the ethnic minorities condemned to unskilled levels of work&#x2014;or rather, because they are unskilled, to continuous unemployment.</membercontribution></p>

Perhaps we all owe ourselves a pat on the back for keeping this debate going long enough to enable the noble and learned Lord to arrive in time. I say that, and I am sure he will understand, not in any sense of what little benefit there may be for him in listening to me but because we all want to listen to him.<lb/>
I hope that this will he only the first in a series of reviews which will take place at the initiative of Members of your Lordships' House because it is extremely important that we should continue to ask the Government for progress reports on the Scarman Report. If no one else is disposed to do so, I give notice that I shall raise this subject again after an appropriate interval.<lb/>
What we must insist upon&#x2014;and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark and the noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, underscored this&#x2014;is action. My own questions will relate to the social background to the disturbances in Brixton as depicted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, in Part II of his report, and the recommendations stemming from it. My first question to the noble Lord the Minister is this: what progress has been made in mobilising local resources, in generating local initiatives and in co-ordinating them at local level so as to bring to bear the optimum impact on the social problems in the inner cities&#x2014;and not only in Brixton? This is the burden of paragraph 6.6 of Lord Scarman's report and of recommendation 8.50, which I ventured to suggest in my speech of 4th February was the most important single recommendation in the whole report. I daresay that others will have their own favourite recommendations but that is certainly mine because it
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0236"/>
<col>455</col>
goes to the root on the matter. I recognise that for the noble Lord, Lord Elton, this is a very widely framed question, but I believe it is quite fundamental.<lb/>
I have some notion of the problems which arise between local groups in great need of resources and in great need of support who find themselves in competition for resources and who are starved of encouragement; dog tends to eat dog. I wonder whether sufficient efforts really are being put into this essential mobilisation and correlation of all possible initiatives to deal with the social circumstances and social disadvantages in our inner cities which constitute what Lord Scarman described in his concluding remarks in page 135 as "a potent factor of unrest". My second point is this. I have some notion of the problems faced by and the courage required of people living in deprived areas in standing up and collaborating with, rather than opposing, established authority. So my question to the noble Lord the Minister is this: what signs are there of the emergence of authentic and responsible ethnic minority leadership&#x2014;those bridge-builders to whom the right reverend Prelate referred, who are prepared to work with the police, the social services and everyone else, rather than persist, rather understandably, with a "them and us" attitude?<lb/>
My third and closely related question is this: what progress is being made in the recruitment of ethnic minorities into the social services and probation services as well as in to the police? As I pointed out on 12th February, in my view, it is just as important that the ethnic minorities should be proportionately represented in the former as in the latter. After all, the probation and social services are the services most closely and frequently in touch with ethnic minority families and with young people. What steps are being taken to recruit members of the ethnic minorities into both services, and with what result? My own information on this question is somewhat discouraging. For instance, in the Merseyside probation service, the chief probation officer tells me that there are only two ethnic minority officers in his force of 250 officers&#x2014;that is less than I per cent. in a city where the black population is several percentage points greater than that. I believe it is significant that at the annual conference of the National Association of Probation Officers only five black probation officers were present, in a delegate conference of some 1,000 people&#x2014;0.5 per cent. This seems to me to say something about the lack of adequate representation in the probation service countrywide.<lb/>
Fourthly and lastly, I made the point earlier that Brixton and Toxteth are only two among areas where trouble has occurred, and the problems in those areas and the potential for further disorder in protest against social disadvantage and discrimination exist in Manchester, in Bradford, in Peterborough (as we saw on "Panorama" last night), in Bristol, in several cities in the Midlands, and in a number of other London boroughs. The equivalents of Brixton's Railton Road are to be found in most of those inner city areas. The appointment of Mr. Heseltine to report on Toxteth, his report and the action stemming from it have been very properly acclaimed&#x2014;in particular his energy and commitment to the question of putting things right. But, as my noble friend Lord Harris of Greenwich has
<col>456</col>
pointed out in different words, we do not want to await further disorders elsewhere to be followed after the event by another Scarman Report and another Heseltine Report.<lb/>
My question is this. Understanding as I do the prerogatives and sensibilities of local authorities, is there nonetheless a strong case for extending the Heseltine-type inquiry into other potentially unstable areas, to pre-empt future disorders? I come back to Lord Scarman's Recommendation 8.50; is there not a powerful case for the appointment of a Minister of Cabinet rank with overall inter-departmental responsibility for overseeing inner city problems as a whole&#x2014;a Minister who would not be burdened additionally with the responsibility for a particular department of state, let alone a huge department like the Department of the Environment. Is not this precisely the model required for co-ordination of effort all the way down the line to deal with this crucial, this terribly difficult and potentially disastrous situation?<lb/>
Finally, I just say this: the message that I get&#x2014;and I had this message from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool, who asked me to say how sorry he is not to be here to take part in the debate, and from a number of my contacts in the probation service&#x2014;from both Toxteth and Brixton is that, with a malady so chronic and of such long standing as are the social situations there and elsewhere, progress is bound to be painfully slow. The need is for a great deal of patience combined with unremitting persistence. I, too, understand that the climate locally is showing signs of improving, that there is a growing predisposition to collaborate towards creating racial harmony. It is perhaps only a straw in the wind, but a couple of months ago when I was in Toxteth, Liverpool 8, I saw the most encouraging single example of total collaboration between police officers, social workers, probation officers, teachers and a number of volunteers working with young people in a very rundown community centre and a comprehensive school&#x2014;just one example which we need to be exemplified and multiplied everywhere. I also understand from the chief probation officer of Merseyside that, of his community assistants working with his probation officers, a majority are now black voluntary workers. These are good signs.<lb/>
So the message to all. I suggest, is the need to work together, to persevere, to exercise restraint, not to be provoked by the rude boys or to be prejudiced by statistics which appear to show that one group is more blameworthy than another. Good precepts such as these can be dubbed platitudes; they trip easily off the tongue. I readily accept that. In another forum I would probably be receiving a slow handclap. But they happen to be true, and they are apposite to the situation in Toxteth, in Brixton and in all the inner city areas with large ethnic minority populations. They place a premium on courageous leadership; they place a premium, as my noble friend Lord Harris has stressed, on police training; they present a challenge to everyone who is living and working in the front line of this campaign to create a more tolerant and a more equitable society.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0435P0I0237"/>
<col>457</col>
last two years in the country of Zambia. It is, therefore, natural that my contribution to this debate should have a somewhat different dimension from that of previous speakers. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if I intended to deal with the details of the report of the noble and learned Lord I would have withdrawn, because I think they have already been fully and amply covered. But there is another dimension to the situation which Lord Scarman was asked to investigate and also to the effect of the report which he published.<lb/>
It so happens that I left this country a day or two after the Brixton riots to return to Zambia, and I was met in Zambia with headlines, "Race riots in Britain". I am quite sure that those headlines could be duplicated right across the Commonwealth. If they had been true, if they had been an accurate representation of what was taking place in Brixton, then in my view the Commonwealth would he dead. I knew that they were not true; that, although there was a racial content to the riots in Brixton and the later riots in different parts of the country, the riots themselves were much more complex than simply racial riots. They were partly social, they were partly generational, but they were not solely racial; and if they had been solely racial, then, as I say, I believe the Commonwealth would be dead.<lb/>
It took a great deal of persuasion by the British High Commissioner and his information staff in Lusaka, with a little influence from my side, even to get the Zambians to consider that these might not be racial riots. The High Commissioner and his staff worked very hard indeed, and I pay great tribute to their efforts. But their efforts had been only partially successful when the report of Lord Scarman appeared, and that was the crucial impact on opinion so far as Zambia was concerned; I believe that this is very common across the Commonwealth. That report at least forced Commonwealth citizens to ask questions which previously they had not asked. It was quite natural for them to assume that these were racial riots. They knew of the discriminatory immigration laws passed by Administrations of both parties over the past 15 years. They know&#x2014;it is widely publicised&#x2014;when speeches are made by prominent politicians that incite racial hatred, racial bitterness, racial suspicions, and the kind of discussions going on right now, about the minor amendment of the Immigration Acts so far as the admission of husbands and fiances is concerned, tend to convince members of other Commonwealth countries that this country is becoming a racialist country. That conviction&#x2014;I am not going into this in detail tonight&#x2014;is, of course, hardened by the constant attitudes that are taken towards racialist Governments like those of South Africa.<lb/>
The publication of the Scarman Report caused Commonwealth citizens to pause. As has been vigorously pointed out by my noble friend Lord Pitt and by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, that report caused people to stop and think, but then to ask, "When are the recommendations of this report going to be put into effect? We will wait and pause, and we will give you the benefit of the doubt if we see that action is being taken by the British Government in order to outlaw the racialist discrimination which we believe is becoming a character of your country". But
<col>458</col>
that has got to he seen in practice, not just in the report of the noble and learned Lord and not just in the praise given to that report. It must be in legislative and administrative form.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Pitt pointed out and as was also vigorously supplemented by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, the Government have an opportunity here. The Government themselves, as an employer, have the opportunity and the responsibility of showing that in this country the skin colour of the employee is of no account. Indeed, in certain fields there should be a reverse discrimination so that skin colour gives an added opportunity where there is a meagre number or an absence of employees today. One of those major fields is in Government employment.<lb/>
It seems strange to some of our former colonial subjects that we find integration so difficult in this country, and that it is a matter that has to be debated. They find it strange that there are sections of our community opposed to the employment, the integration and the acceptance as equal human beings, of people of different coloured skins. I shall give one small instance of why it seems strange. Just two days ago, on Sunday, which was not only United Nations Day but also the eighteenth anniversary of the independence of Zambia, I was in State House with President Kaunda. With us were Humphrey Mulemba, the General Secretary of the Party, Mr. Mundia, the Prime Minister, and old Harry Nkumbula, who some people in this Chamber will remember. After the investiture we were having a little party and an informal discussion. I saw that there was one other white person there. Do your Lordships know who he was? He was John Roberts, who used to be the leader of the white party that was attempting, consistently, and made no secret of it, to keep the black majority Zambians out of government. He is now accepted as a farmer in Zambia. He supplies the President with oranges. He is accepted socially as a friend and a colleague. That is the normal attitude towards people of different skin colours in a country like Zambia, despite the experiences they have gone through when a small minority of whites attempted to rule them permanently.<lb/>
That is by no means the only example one can give of how ex-colonial countries have shown that when they have got their independence they welcome the continued presence of people of different skin colours, including white or pink, as equal citizens and as friends and colleagues. That can be done after the experience of the colonial empire, so can that not be done in what is still known as the motherland of the old colonial empire? What is the problem? Why is it that this causes so much anguish in this country, whereas in countries where there have been long years of suffering through discrimination it can be put aside on the basis of "We are all human beings"?<lb/>
Therefore, I put to the Government, and to the Minister who is to reply, two final practical points. Before I do so, may I make a distinction that I think has caused a certain degree of confusion in this debate. There is a distinction, and we should make a distinction, between prejudice and discrimination. We recognised this destinction when we <i>were</i> debating the Race Relations Act. One cannot legislate against prejudice, but one can legislate against discrimination, and prejudice leads to discrimination. The Minister
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0238"/>
<col>459</col>
has been asked many questions on discrimination. I should like him to address himself to prejudice. In the noble and learned Lord's report there is a clear suggestion that a part of the problem, only a part, is that of what is called racial prejudice, although I believe it would be better described as colour prejudice. Here I charge the Government with having a responsibility. Proposals have been made for legislation on discrimination&#x2014;that is, action activated by prejudice. I am concerned about prejudice, about the feelings of people, and I do not agree with those who suggest that the Government can do nothing about prejudice. I believe that they can and from my own personal experience, and the experience of other members of our two Houses, I believe that it is possible for the Government to do something about prejudice. They have a responsibility to do so.<lb/>
First, I refer the Minister to an article in <i>The Guardian</i> this morning which suggests that the way in which geography is taught in most of our schools is, in itself, a stimulus to racial discrimination and to a lack of understanding of the culture and the history of peoples in other parts of the world. This critical report has been suppressed although it is available, if I may advertise, at an address given by <i>The Guardian</i>.<lb/>
Following that, my second point is that the previous Government did try to deal with prejudice. They tried through the Ministry of Overseas Development and tried by setting up a committee to assist the voluntary organisations in this country, including educational institutions, church institutions, and a whole set of voluntary institutions. They tried to educate the people of this country against prejudice and give them an opportunity to know something of the cultures, the problems and the difficulties of peoples of other countries.<lb/>
The previous Government accepted that as a responsibility of the Government themselves. They set up the Development Education Fund; they set up a committee to administer that fund and that fund was to help the voluntary organisations and, if necessary, to take initiatives itself in order to get rid of what is partly a sickness and partly ignorance and very largely a mixture of both&#x2014;namely, feelings of racial prejudice. This Government should take the same responsibility. Let me remind the Minister, if he does not already know, that within a few weeks of this Government being elected they had abolished the Development Education Fund and abolished the committee, although the committee has refused to be abolished and still exists but only unofficially. This Government stopped the work that we had been trying to do under the previous Government, of educating the people of this country&#x2014;not of overseas country countries, but of this country&#x2014;about the needs of people in the developing world in particular, the needs of people who are very often our customers, our trading partners and who very often have been in the past our colonial subjects.<lb/>
I would ask the Minister to look at the matter again and to consider with his colleagues whether there is not an unanswerable case arising out of the report of the noble and learned Lord, for the need for Government initiative in removing that slur of prejudice which has begun to attack our country, to be attached to the name of our country and which, if it is allowed to
<col>460</col>
continue to fester and to develop, can destroy not just this country but the Commonwealth itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01883">7.13 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01884"><member>Lord Scarman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must begin with an apology to the House and to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. It was a great sadness that I could only arrive at a very late stage of the debate on this Question. I am sure that the House will understand that it was extremely important business&#x2014;it could not have been anything else which kept me away. Perhaps the House might like to know what the business was. Strangely enough it was closely related to one of the subject matters of this debate. I was talking in another part of London to the London branch of the Royal Town Planning Institute, to the members of the planning profession who are members of that institute who are concerned with the decay and the deprivation of our inner city areas. I was attempting to persuade them of the immense importance of tackling the decay and deprivation of the inner city areas such as Brixton. Since my apology has led me to mention that, I will in the few moments during which I shall detain the House, ask as my first question of the Government what is being done or what is contemplated for establishing and developing a co-ordinated programme at every level of government&#x2014;central, local and below that in the communities&#x2014;to tackle the physical and social environment in which unfortunately so many members of the ethnic minority groups of this country have to live.<lb/>
I have attended enough of this debate to appreciate how profoundly the House feels on this problem. I shall not cover the matters which I have discussed in my report, but I did for the purposes of talking to these planners just elicit some facts about Brixton. I think that they do make one wonder how far we have to go to get some co-ordinated programme going. Railton and Mayall Roads have been in a broken down, boarded-up condition ever since the end of the war. In 1975 the Secretary of State of the day rejected his inspector's recommendation for a comprehensive redevelopment of that area. The Secretary of State said, with a good deal of justification, that a gradual renewal on traditional lines would be better. Indeed; but did we see any signs of it?&#x2014;no, the comprehensive redevelopment was rejected: the gradual renewal never came, at any rate never started to come until after the riots. There have been, as anyone knows who has recently visited Railton and Mayall Roads, some improvement since the riots and, I suppose it is fair to say, since the publication of the report.<lb/>
One of the themes of the report on the social side, was that unless we get the inner city problem settled, we shall not solve the problems of the frustrations and hopelessness of some of the younger members of the ethnic minority groups. Following a hint which I noticed in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, it will not only be black people who feel these frustrations and who feel isolated from an established society which is indifferent to their plight. Indeed, in the Brixton riots themselves there were plenty of young white people in the predominantly black crowds that were engaged in the disorders. The inner city problem includes the ethnic minorities, but goes beyond them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0239"/>
<col>461</col>
Much has been done, and this is what troubles me. Brixton is an inner city partnership. In Brixton there is a housing action area. There are many people and organisations of goodwill working in an uncoordinated way there and no doubt elsewhere. But I do ask&#x2014;and here I leave the social policy side of the report&#x2014;what are the Government doing about developing the type of co-ordinated programme and policy covering activities at all levels of our society which I think emerges as one of the major recommendations of the report?<lb/>
I turn now very briefly to policing. I should not like this House to he misled by undignified goings-on at a Police Federation meeting into the view that the police do not care and have done nothing. I said it over the weekend and I say it again in your Lordships' House, the police have done a lot. Indeed, if one may be mischievous, I think it is fair to say that they have done very much more than the Government. Their senior direction have taken hold of this report vigorously. They have analysed it and many of its recommendations they are, so far as they can, putting into effect. If the senior direction of the police force can take that amount of trouble over a report which was in some respects critical of them, I do not think that your Lordships or the public need have too much concern about the quality of our police.<lb/>
There are specific problems associated with the police about which I should like to ask some questions, and no doubt some of these problems have been covered in the debate of which I had the misfortune to hear so very little. But, if I may, I shall put the questions again. I do not wish to take up time; I merely wish to end on various notes of interrogation.<lb/>
First, recruitment. I, like others of your Lordships, saw the figures published in the press today, and on a visit to Brixton last Friday I obtained some unofficial information which would indicate that in certain areas of the Metropolitan Police the increase in black people offering themselves as recruits for the police service is very much greater than those figures would indicate. But, be that as it may&#x2014;I do not wish to get into a statistical exercise&#x2014;it is quite something that in the first nine months of 1982 there should be 532 black applicants contrasted with the figure of, I think, 240 for the whole of 1981. But of course, this is not enough. I am sure your Lordships have been saying that repeatedly in the course of this short debate. More has to be done.<lb/>
But do not think that the solution lies wholly with Government or police. I know that there is goodwill in the police now in pushing forward a recruiting programme for young black men and women. But I also know that neither they as a force nor we as a people have yet overcome an almost instinctive hostility towards the police force among young black people. Indeed, as I have heard mentioned since I have been here, these riots were of course not race riots. They were riots by young people, predominantly black, not against white people but against the police. The causes for that are complex and I can leave their analysis to the report. So I ask, what is being done to develop recruiting from the ethnic minority groups beyond the very small beginnings which we are now able to observe?<lb/>
I come now to complaints procedure. I have read the recent white Paper, but I cannot yet claim to have
<col>462</col>
studied it carefully. All I would say to Government, based upon my experience last year, is that they must get it right and they must legislate. What is needed in principle is simple enough: a credible independent element&#x2014;and by "credible" I mean not credible to your Lordships, but credible to the woman whose son has been rough-housed by a policeman in Leigham Court Road. That must be done.<lb/>
Secondly, they must handle the minor complaints. I was delighted to see some proposals for conciliation at that level. One of the troubles with the current complaints procedure is that, if someone makes a complaint, it has to go into this formidable machine of formal investigation with such terrifying figures as the Police Complaints Board and the DPP at the end of it, when all they really want is a confrontation with an individual policeman, perhaps an apology, certainly an explanation and nothing that will do him or them any harm in the future. So I ask that the complaints procedure be most carefully looked at.<lb/>
Associated with that is the proposal in the report that there should be lay visitors to those parts of police stations where suspects are interrogated. I think that this is most important. They should, of course, be random and, again, I find a good reception for this idea among senior police officers. I should like to hear that it is coming.<lb/>
Finally, I would ask whether the Government intend to put community relations&#x2014;in so far as community relations with the police depend upon consultative machinery&#x2014;upon a statutory basis. I am quite unrepentant: mere administrative alternatives, such as the police, to their credit, are trying out in Brixton and elsewhere, will not do. I expect that some of your Lordships know what is going on in places like Brixton and elsewhere. Local people are not wholly satisfied with the administrative liaison committees and with the other apparatus that is being developed for consultations. They are forming, and they are being assisted with funds from certain sources in forming, what they call monitoring groups. It is quite unofficial. If one gets into this sort of rank development, the real plant of community relations will be stifled by all sorts of competitors and people will be confused. Have a statutory basis for the consultative obligation of the police with the community and people will know that it is part of the law of the land that this machinery be kept in being and be used, and they can clamour in and outside Parliament if the machinery is not used. I implore the Government to recognise that there is much to be said for legislative backing of consultative machinery.<lb/>
On other matters, I think it is indeed for the Government to decide whether to do it by administration or by statute. I can see the advantage of using administrative methods where administrative methods will do. But in the really sensitive matter of community relations I think that the communities of the inner city areas are entitled to see that the Government of their country attach such importance to this matter that they are prepared to put it on the statute book.<lb/>
One other matter&#x2014;I do not know whether it has been discussed in the course of this debate; it is rather apt to slip under the carpet&#x2014;is the problem of law enforcement. You cannot achieve social justice unless you enforce the law and maintain public tranquillity.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0240"/>
<col>463</col>
You have to attack street crime, and bring the culprits to justice, if you can. You have to suppress&#x2014;and suppress rapidly&#x2014;public disorder when it arises. Therefore, we must remember the dilemma of the police at all times. I am heartened by what I have read in the press&#x2014;I have no other knowledge&#x2014;of some of the tactical and strategic ideas of the new Metropolitan Commissioner, Sir Kenneth Newman: avoiding, if possible, such confrontations as arose in the disorders of last year, and going in for the precision targeting of ringleaders, and so forth.<lb/>
I end on this note because law enforcement is important. You can put it this way: without law enforcement there will be no social justice. But, of course, without social justice you are going to put law enforcement at risk too. The two horns of that dilemma are crooked and intertwined, and unless you grip both of them the bull will have you.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01885">7.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01886"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, has done a great service to the House by bringing before us a matter of great importance and attracting to that matter a range of expertise and perception which will enormously benefit those whose task it is to tackle the problems with which he is concerned. The debate has demonstrated, if it were necessary, the very wide range of issues covered in the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, who I am most glad to welcome to your Lordships' House on this occasion&#x2014;the inflection there was unintentional!<lb/>
Your Lordships have between you set me an impossible task. I have tried to anticipate in my principal script the points that I expected your Lordships to raise, and I have interpolated a great number of other replies to the points your Lordships have since raised. There will, however, be questions and appetites unsatisfied at the end of this debate which I shall detect with my usual combing of <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, and I apologise in advance to those of your Lordships who, for one reason or another, I have not been able to reply to before I sit down. Even so, your Lordships will find that I sit down a little later than you had expected, and a great deal later than would have been necessary had your Lordships not been so assiduous in putting questions to the Government.<lb/>
When my right honourable friend the Home Secretary presented the report to Parliament he made it clear that he recognised it as one of great significance and gave a firm declaration of intent in response to many of its recommendations. Since then I believe we have made considerable progress. The matter is not closed, of course, and my right honourable friend will receive the views which your Lordships have so cogently expressed tonight with great interest and they will be of particular relevance to his further consideration of this report, which is no less important today than it was on the day it was published.<lb/>
The report set the events in Brixton very properly in a wider social context. That context was the problem of our inner cities and their impact in particular upon members of the ethnic minority communities who are disproportionately concentrated in them. I shall be saying something more about that background later.<lb/>
<col>464</col>
However, the noble and learned Lord reminded us that against it the role of the police is critical, and let me therefore first consider that aspect of the report.<lb/>
It gave us a timely reminder of several fundamental principles of policing in this country: that effective policing depends on consent and on the full support of the community; that there is one law for all which must be firmly and fairly enforced; that those who enforce the law must he aware of the pressures and tensions within the community which they serve and be responsive to them. The Government have examined the noble and learned Lord's recommendations on policing as part of our overall strategy to improve police effectiveness.<lb/>
That effectiveness depends on a number of factors. One of these is the actual strength of the police service, and your Lordships will know that this Government have increased that strength by some 9,000 men and women since they took office. Another factor is the level of active deployment. The result both of this high recruitment and of turning over to civilians work which has to be done within the service but for which police skills and training are not necessary has been to put more men back on the beat.<lb/>
It has also made possible a number of other changes. My right honourable friend has consistently encouraged police authorities and chief constables to work in partnership (within the sound framework of the Police Act 1964) to develop police effectiveness. We recognise and endorse also the message of the report that there must be partnership too between the police and the community in controlling crime and preventing disorder. We therefore welcome the central recommendation for developing local consultation arrangements&#x2014;in which the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, expressed a strong interest at the beginning of this debate&#x2014;as a means of harnessing community support.<lb/>
As police authority for the metropolis my right honourable friend gave priority to re-establishing the liaison committee in Lambeth, and it is already providing a forum where the police, the local authority and the community in Lambeth can exchange views and explore solutions to local problems. In addition, he invited each London borough to join with their local police to prepare joint proposals for consultation arrangements in their own areas, or for developing any that already exist. We gathered views on this from all police areas in England and Wales. There were visits to many areas to see what was already going on there and there were discussions at both local and national level.<lb/>
Two things as a consequence became very clear. The first was that there was a very general realisation that the community and the police had to work together if local difficulties were to be resolved. The second was that no single structure could possibly suit every one of the wide range of different circumstances up and down the country. Community problems come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. If they are to be properly fitted out with consultation it cannot be bought off the peg. It has to be tailor made. Nevertheless, the guidance issued in June on the role and construction of consultation arrangements emphasises the importance which my right honourable friend attaches to regular and effective consultative machinery in each area.<lb/>
It also reflects his understanding that consultation is a two-way process. It is not designed simply so that the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0241"/>
<col>465</col>
police can be informed of a wide range of local views. It must also enable the community to understand the problems which the police face and the procedures by which they operate. Like the right reverend Prelate, we believe that it will assist both parties. The guidance makes clear that operational decisions are the responsibility of the police. Neither a consultative group, nor a police authority, nor my right honourable friend himself, can direct the police in the enforcement of the law.<lb/>
There are, I think, some who would like it to be thought that consultation is meant to soften the edge of policing, That attitude was not much evident in your Lordships' debate but it is found outside this Chamber. That is entirely to misunderstand both the purpose of consultation and the nature of policing itself. The purpose of consultation is to establish a mutual confidence and understanding between a police force and its community. With that confidence we can achieve a secure, harmoniously law-abiding society, and perhaps straighten out the twined and interlocked horns of the dilemma to which the noble and learned Lord referred in his concluding speech.<lb/>
The police will continue to tackle crime and respond effectively to disorder where it occurs. But we, and they, intend that they shall do so as a part of their communities and not apart from them. That will have a preventive effect as well as a creative one&#x2014;and crime prevention is something which we have long believed is a duty of the whole community and not just of the police alone. To that end we recently held a seminar at Bramshill to study this subject. It was attended by senior members of local authorities and government departments as well as the Home Office and the police, and briefly, by myself.<lb/>
Community liaison was not, of course, invented by the noble and learned Lord and he would not claim that it was. That is why we were able to react quite quickly to his message that it was being neglected. We had good precedents to build on, and new initiatives have already been taking place in many areas. In the Metropolitan Police district, for instance, consultative groups reflecting the guidelines are already operating in six boroughs, and agreement in principle to set up similar groups has already been reached in 13 other boroughs and districts. This is very welcome progress.<lb/>
One central question remains to be answered, and the noble and learned Lord, almost predictably, asked it. That is the question whether or not this should be placed on a tatutory basis. As I have already said, my right honourable friend will take careful note of this debate, and of this issue, and he will take notice of the authoritative opinions expressed in a range of your Lordships' House extending, if I may so put it, from the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01887"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend to make it clear that the Government really want to see consultation machinery in operation in other parts of England, or is it&#x2014;as appears from what he has said&#x2014;to be only in the Metropolitan Police area?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01888"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: If I gave that impression, my Lords, I deeply regret it because it destroys what faith I had in the speech I had written. We are certainly in favour of
<col>466</col>
consultation throughout the country. We do not believe it will be of exactly the same sort in every case; it must be tailor-made to the different conditions of different places, and my right honourable friend will be considering what has been said in this debate as to whether or not it should be a statutory requirement.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Inglewood asked me two questions in his intervention. I will write to him on the first. As to the special constables, I can tell him that the numbers have increased between January and June this year by 285. I might suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that that might be the better area in which to deploy the constables he envisaged as holding short contracts. As I see it, training using scarce training resources to introduce a different, a third, type of policeman into the force for a short period is not the best way forward. However, there is plenty of room in the special constabulary for that sort of service.<lb/>
In passing, the noble and learned Lord referred to his anxiety about unofficial monitoring groups. I share that anxiety, especially when it is funded by bodies which overtly set about discrediting the police by searching only for their shortcomings. I entirely agree that there should be proper consultative processes to establish confidence between the police and the community where that is lacking.<lb/>
I have spoken of the strength and the deployment of the police and of the good relations which it is essential to establish between a force and its community. Another critical area highlighted by the report and by your Lordships is that of training. At its meeting on 28th January, the Police Training Council decided to set up sub-committees to look specifically into probationer and community relations training; and on training for public order and for supervision it decided to proceed initially by a review of existing arrangements. All groups will be reporting progress to the Police Training Council. The working party which has looked at courses designed to install a sound understanding of good community relations has made good progress. It will in fact be submitting its report to the council tomorrow. I only regret it could not have been yesterday so that I could have quoted from it. I understand, however, that it contains substantial recommendations for improving the community and race relations training given in the police service. It will, of course, be for the council to consider it and form a view. What they will have before them is a report based on a wide review of existing community and race relations training, both here and abroard, accompanied by practical suggestions for the improvement of present practices.<lb/>
What I do not expect to find in that report is a specific objective test by which innate racism can be detected in probationers, as I think some of your Lordships hoped might be the case. Work done both in this country and in the United States suggests that no such tests exists and that the best method lies in the careful observation of the developing attitudes of young policemen as they proceed through their probationery years, and that of course is what we intend.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, among others referred to the extreme difficulty of accomplishing a complete and satisfactory training programme within the confines of a probationary course, and I quite see the difficulty to which he alludes
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0242"/>
<col>467</col>
and I have been looking at it myself. Perhaps I might at this point make the general observation that to arrive at the right solution&#x2014;which, as the noble and learned Lord has already reminded the House, is in many respects vital if a policy is to succeed&#x2014;often takes very painstaking and ramifying inquiry and consultation, and the process which I have described in the educational and training world is typical of this, and I would not want your Lordships to think the Government are dragging their feet. What we are trying not to do is to push people in front of us so fast that they fall flat on their faces.<lb/>
Training is, in any case, a matter not just for the probationary years but for frequent renewal. The supervisory role is crucial to the police, as in most other enterprises, and it must be given adequate training support. Courses run at regional level for sergeants and inspectors have considerable managerial and supervisory content. And courses at Bramshill are now giving attention to the implications of racial discontent and the social, psychological and economic factors which contribute to it. The Police Training Council will he considering how management and supervision training can be enhanced. They are also looking afresh at the work being done by the regional training centres to see if the very heavy syllabus given in the probationers' foundation course needs to be revised.<lb/>
Having, as it happens, mulled over the examination papers only last Sunday&#x2014;to which I think my noble friend Lord Inglewood referred in relation to the question whether anything was written in English or whether it was just a matter of ticking boxes&#x2014;I assure him that there are some multiple choice papers to be taken, but by no means are all of them such papers, and there are some quite tricky questions to answer in an essay and current account form.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, is right in suggesting that there is less pressure for places in cadet training than there was as a result of the fact that the forces are generally reaching their establishment. On the other hand, he is wrong to think that cadet training is being wound up. It is very much alive. In fact, I had the pleasure of taking a passing-out parade at Hendon last summer and was glad to note not only the very high standard of achievement but also that the police are providing places for youngsters on Manpower Services Commission work experience courses.<lb/>
To interpolate another point raised by a number of noble Lords on the Public Order Act, the Government have&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01889"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the Minister is apparently moving off the subject of police training, may I remind him that I specifically asked whether the Government were or were not going to accept the recommendation of the noble and learned Lord that the minimum period for initial training should be six months? Is the answer, Yes or, No?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01890"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: The answer to that question, my Lords, is wait and see, because, as I tried to tell your Lordships a few moments ago, the preliminary views on the content of training and its duration are only now coming forward. I again undertake to write to noble Lords to whom I have not replied during the debate.<lb/>
<col>468</col>
The Government have noted the noble and learned Lord's belief that there should be a national requirement to give advance notice of an intention to hold a procession, and we are taking full account of that, together with his recommendation that the test for the exercise of powers under the Public Order Act should be reduced to the test of public disorder, in the context of our review of the Act and related legislation.<lb/>
We appreciate the importance of his contribution to the continuing debate about the framing of banning orders and we are studying this very carefully. The noble and learned Lord himself is alert to the political and constitutional difficulties involved in proposals to prohibit one specified procession, and he noted that there might also be practical difficulties in framing the kind of order envisaged in the report; and any amendment to the Public Order Act would of course need to be related to the review of the Act as a whole.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord linked his concern about racist marches with the current public order test. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has readily consented to a number of banning orders sought by chief police officers on the grounds that proposed marches would have threatened serious public disorder. But in considering any change in practice or in the law we must also bear in mind that we should beware of letting extremists force us to made inroads into our democratic freedoms.<lb/>
I think that we all accept&#x2014;the Government certainly do&#x2014;that a police force must be part and parcel of the community that it serves. That is a central message in the report. But if we accept that, we must accept also that it must in general terms resemble that community. That is why my right honourable friend was anxious about ethnic minority recruitment to the police&#x2014;an anxiety shared by many of your Lordships. Accordingly, a study group, with members from the Home Office, from local authority associations, from the police staff associations, from the Metropolitan Police, and from the ethnic minorities, was set up. Its task was to examine the measures which had already been taken nationally to increase the recruitment of black and Asian officers and to consider what more might be done.<lb/>
The Home Secretary received the study group's report in July. It was clear that a number of forces were taking positive steps to attract more black and Asian recruits, and that the number of police officers from the ethnic minorities was increasing. The group found that encouraging, but it found that there were no grounds for complacency. The group made a number of detailed recommendations for ensuring that selection procedures did not present unnecessay obstacles to such recruits. Arrangements had already been made for the standardised entrance tests to be independently examined for possible cultural bias or indirect discriminaiton before they were introduced. But the group also noted that nothing had been done to overcome the possibility of unintentional bias during the selection interviews. Therefore, it recommended that the Home Office should introduce short courses for officers in charge of recruitment in multiracial areas to enable them to assist officers involved in interviewing black and Asian candidates.<lb/>
The group endorsed the view of the noble and learned lord, Lord Scarman, that there should be no
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0243"/>
<col>469</col>
lowering of the entry qualifications for candidates from the minority communities. However, it recommended that chief officers of police should exercise their discretion to accept otherwise suitable candidates who did not meet the minimum height requirements, but who possessed other qualities or skills; and that is not a new discretion.<lb/>
The group also identified positive steps that could be taken by forces to help candidates who narrowly failed to meet the educational requirements. I should like to pause to make it clear that the group's recommendation&#x2014;which we support&#x2014;was to enable new candidates to be brought up to existing requirements, not to make new requirements fit substandard candidates. There has been some misconception about that. The group also recommended that Her Majesty's Inspectors of Constabulary should be invited to monitor the progress made by individual forces with a review of selection procedures to eliminate discrimination.<lb/>
The Home Secretary has accepted those recommendations which call for action by the Home Office. He commended the others to chief officers and to police authorites when copies of the report were sent to them in August.<lb/>
To be more precise and practical, I would say that in December, 1971 there were only 47 black and Asian police officers in the whole of England and Wales. On 30th June, 1982 there were 386; of those 47 had been recruited in the first six months of this year. I can tell your Lordships, and the noble and learned Lord, that the latest total figure that I have is 418. It is not enough, but it is progress, and it is measurable progress, in the right direction. The highest ranking ethnic minority police officer of whom I know is an inspector in the Metropolitan Police. When your Lordships consider the narrow base of recruitment from which he must have proceeded up the ladder, you will think that not insignificant.<lb/>
In passing, I should like to say a few words on Rastafarians in prison, which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised, and which I have slipped in because there was a blank space on the paper before me. The Home Office is continuing to review its policy towards Rastafarian inmates and is giving particular attention to the desirability or otherwise of the recognition of minority customs and beliefs even when the faith cannot be accorded formal recognition as a religion. The review may lead to a revision of the 1976 circular instruction, but it is too early to say what conclusions we shall reach on this sensitive and complex matter. The noble Lord already knows that Rastafarians can keep their dreadlocks, under a decision made earlier on by my noble friend.<lb/>
All the measures that I have mentioned so far are aimed directly or indirectly at securing effective policing. The end result of effective policing should be public satisfaction. Of course no police force will ever satisfy the whole of the public all the time. As noble Lords have recognised, a fair and impartial complaints procedure is an important element in securing public support.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord concluded in his report that, if public confidence in the police complaints procedure is to be secured, the early introduction of an independent element in the investigation of complaints and the establishment of a conciliation
<col>470</col>
process are vital; and, after having said that he had not studied our White Paper too closely, he was kind enough to welcome the latter step. Your Lordships will know that in the White Paper <i>we</i> have accepted both of those recommendations.<lb/>
The new arrangements would substitute for the present uniform procedures a three-tier system to operate according to the seriousness of the complaints. I shall not delay the House by describing the system, since I think that those of your Lordships who are interested will have read the White Paper. But I would say that the introduction of the independent assessor would he an important development. We believe that in cases where serious allegations are made it would provide further reassurance to the public that everything possible is done to arrive at the truth. The assessor's function will be to ensure that investigations carried out under his supervision are conducted expeditiously, thoroughly, and impartially, and he will have the necessary powers for the purpose. In view of the importance of this proposal, our intention is to appoint as the assessor a person of standing and independent judgment, who can command the confidence of the police and the public alike. The other changes described in the White Paper also represent valuable improvements upon the present system. The legislation necessary to give effect to the new arrangements will be brought before Parliament at the earliest opportunity, when I shall commend it to your Lordships for your support.<lb/>
I think that this might be a convenient moment to raise the matter of the specific offence of racially prejudiced behaviour. Of course, it is important not to view this as an isolated matter standing or falling on its own. It must be seen in the context of the general thrust of the recommendations of the report and the progress that it has been possible to make on them as a whole, in particular those relating to local consultation and the means by which the public can more directly put their expectations to the police.<lb/>
As my predecessor the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, informed your Lordships, when the recommendation was discussed by the Police Advisory Board all concerned&#x2014;the police staff associations, the Association of County Councils, and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities&#x2014;agreed that there could be no question of such behaviour being tolerated in the police service. But noting that this could already be dealt with under the police discipline code, they were unanimous also that it would not be appropriate to proceed by way of creating a new, specific offence. I merely put that before your Lordships because it is in the light of those circumstances that my right honourable friend is at present considering the matter.<lb/>
On the question of lay visitors, we indeed agree that suspicion and mistrust about what goes on behind the doors of police stations are an unnecessary impediment to the development of community support for the police against crime and hence of effective policing. Everyone would wish such impediments to be removed, and several noble Lords have advocated lay visitors as a means of doing so.<lb/>
However, there are important practical problems which must be addressed before we embark upon this. Lay visitors to police stations would be a substantial innovation, and there are outstanding questions concerning the need to safeguard the position of
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0244"/>
<col>471</col>
persons suspected of crime, some of whom will never appear in court or on a charge, and may not wish actually to be seen by anybody but the police when they are there. To avoid hampering police operations, and to preserve the independence of lay visitors themselves, bearing in mind the fact that everything in which they become involved will be <i>sub judice</i>, also requires close consideration. I am not saying&#x2014;and I emphasise this&#x2014;that such questions cannot be answered, or that the practical difficulties which have been identified cannot be resolved, but they do exist, and consultations are already in progress with interested bodies, including local authority associations, as part of the assessment of them. When they have been completed my right honourable friend will want to inform Parliament, and therefore your Lordships and in particular the right reverend Prelate, of his conclusions.<lb/>
I have spoken in some detail (your Lordships may think in too much) of what the effects of our initiataives have been and are likely to be upon our police service and upon its relationship with the community it serves. But the report must, as we all recognise, be seen in the context of contemporary conditions. If I refer more briefly to the social context of those problems and our responses to them, it is not because I see them as less important but because my time is limited and the greater part of my own experience and knowledge lies with the police rather than with the community aspects of the problem.<lb/>
The Government, first and foremost, are wholly committed to the principle of full equality of opportunity irrespective of colour or race. That commitment underlies many of the initiatives that the Government have taken in the field of social policy following the noble and learned Lord's report. The Government are seized of the acute problems inherent in our inner cities and the disproportionate pressure they bring on ethnic minorities who live there.<lb/>
Our immediate answer to these problems has been the Urban Programme. This will amount to &#x00A3;270 million in 1982&#x2013;83, and that represents an increase of 28 per cent. over 1981&#x2013;82. Guidelines issued to inner city Partnerships and Programme authorities set out the Government's views on how these very considerable resources can most effectively be deployed. Collaboration between central and local government and other agencies is an integral part of the operation of the programme.<lb/>
We have sought, moreover, to increase its effectiveness by breaking down barriers between the public and private sectors, and to involve the private sector fully in the programme, as the report suggested. A good example is the Merseyside Task Force, which has concentrated on developing more contact and improved working relationships between all the various agencies involved in dealing with urban decline. This is, I think, the sort of co-operative effort that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was urging upon us. In our guidelines we endorse the recommendation that local communities should be more fully involved in the decisions which affect them. The activities of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment in this respect will hardly have escaped the attention of your Lordships.<lb/>
Even before the noble and learned Lord reported,
<col>472</col>
my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment had set up the Financial Institutions Group. It comprises 26 managers seconded from banks, building societies, insurance companies and pension funds. Their remit is to help in developing new approaches to urban regeneration. The Merseyside Task Force has also benefited from the secondment of personnel from Merseyside companies. That involves the private sector, and is an answer, at least in part, to the first of the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt.<lb/>
In recognition of the key role of the voluntary organisations, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has appointed Mr. Ed Berman as special adviser on inner city matters, with particular reference to the role of voluntary organisations.<lb/>
Inner city conditions do place&#x2014;and I have said this twice&#x2014;disproportionate pressures on ethnic minority communities. My honourable friend Sir George Young, who has special responsibility for race matters at the Department of the Environment, is now looking at ways in which the Urban Programme can be used still more effectively to combat racial disadvantage. Within the Urban Programme the Government are providing a substantial increase in the level of support for projects which bring specific benefit to ethnic minority groups. New projects are receiving about &#x00A3;7 million this year. Total support is of the order of &#x00A3;15 million.<lb/>
Local authorities play a crucial role in combating some of the problems of racial disadvantage, both as employers and as deliverers of services: the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, was eloquent on this subject. Earlier this year the Government set up a joint working group with the local authority associations to identify and disseminate good practice in this field, and it is hoped that it will report by the end of this year.<lb/>
My Lords, an important way in which the Government help local authorities to tackle racial disadvantage is through the provision of grants payable under Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966. The report urged us to reform the arrangements for the payment of these grants. We shall shortly be introducing a number of changes which were set out in the White Paper on Racial Disadvantage published earlier this year. We shall also be issuing new administrative guidelines to local authorities within the next few weeks.<lb/>
An inescapable feature of the social context of the Scarman Report is, of course, unemployment. That is a sufficient topic for a debate of its own. The eventual success of our economic policies will bring a long-term reduction in this evil. In the meantime, we must take the steps necessary to enable our young people to become better prepared to meet changing employment requirements. The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, quoted the Services as an example of how to do this. Last December my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment announced what he described as,


<quote>"the most far-reaching and ambitious set of proposals for industrial training ever put before Parliament".</quote>
It includes the proposed &#x00A3;1 billion Youth Training Scheme, which from the autumn of 1983 will
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0245"/>
<col>473</col>
guarantee any 16-year-old school-leaver who does not have a job a full year's training in the kind of basic skills needed by employers.<lb/>
Over the next 12 months it will progressively replace the Youth Opportunities Programme. Meanwhile, the programme is being expanded to cover some 630,000 entrants in 1982&#x2013;83, including 100,000 new-style training places. The Government are determined that as soon as possible every 16-year-old school-leaver shall be either in work or in further education or have a genuine opportunity of a year's training.<lb/>
The ethnic minorities will also be assisted by the Community Programme. This started on 1st October and incorporated the Community Enterprise Programme. This will provide up to 130,000 places, mostly part-time, for up to a year, and assistance will be given with training if required. Not only will the unemployed he able to raise their living standards: they will be given useful jobs with a real wage and a chance to gain experience, and in many cases training, so that they will be better able to compete for permanent jobs.<lb/>
There is great interest in counting the effects of these steps. Ethnic record-keeping by local authorities, which the noble and learned Lord's report specifically mentioned, is among the matters being considered by the joint working group with the local authority associations to which I have already referred. The Government will also be looking at the possibilities for collecting ethnic data in education. Some effects are, however, already measurable. We know, for instance, that the annual rate of increase for minority group unemployment has for the first time in recent years fallen below that for total unemployment&#x2014;10 per cent. as against 12 per cent. That is cold comfort, but it is comfort in a relative sense.<lb/>
Through these measures and others the Government will continue to combat the problems of the inner cities and the disadvantages of some in our society, and to promote the conditions in which violence does not flourish and in which partnership will develop between the police and the community in dealing effectively with crime. May I say to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, whose eloquent and moving speech I listened to with the closest of interest, and which will be read by my right honourable friend and others equally closely, and say also to those people overseas to whom the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, referred, that the party to which I belong is founded on the concept of One Nation. It is both the duty and the wish of the Government to sustain that ideal.<lb/>
At the end of his speech the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, was judicious enough&#x2014;I was going to say, kind enough&#x2014;to give what he called a mischievous commendation to the work of the police by saying that they had done better than the Government. May I accept that, with my responsibilities for the police, with all the gratitude which it deserves, and treat it with all the disdain that it deserves as a member of Her Majesty's Government.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord has produced a humane and perceptive report, and he has embellished it for us tonight with a humane and perceptive speech. Our answer to the noble and learned Lord's report and to his speech is by no means yet complete. It cannot, on the other hand, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord
<col>474</col>
Allen of Abbeydale, be given overnight, but I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that good men are not doing nothing and Ministers are not, in his words, languishing in complacency. Our reply already comprises quite a formidable list of initiatives and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, for giving me this opportunity, at a little too great length, to expatiate upon them to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01897"><member>Lord Avebury</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01898">For how many days Mr. Abdul Qayum Butt, who has committed no offence, has been detained in Ashford Remand Centre; what countries have been approached to see whether they might offer him asylum; what is the maximum length of time they consider it proper to keep a person who is admitted to be a refugee within the meaning of Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on Refugees detained in a prison, and what they will do with Mr. Butt if no other country is prepared to accept him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01899"><member>Lord Elton</member>: Mr. Abdul Qayum Butt was detained under Immigration Act powers at Ashford Remand Centre from 4th June to 19th October 1982, a total of 137 days. Approaches to possible countries of resettlement have been made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and it would be inappropriate for my right honourable friend to answer on the High Commissioner's behalf.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01900">Mr. Butt is a person to whom Article 32(3) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is considered to apply; he is being given a reasonable period within which to seek legal admission to another country and his detention was considered to be a necessary internal measure to be taken during that period. As the noble Lord will be aware, my right honourable friend has again reviewed Mr. Butt's case and, taking account of the representations he had received and the assurances he had been given, has directed that Mr. Butt should be released from custody and granted temporary admission to await further the outcome of UNHCR's efforts on his behalf. He was released on 19th October.</p>

<title>REMAND PRISONERS IN POLICE STATIONS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01902"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01903">Which police stations have been used in the
<col>476</col>
Metropolitan Police District and elsewhere, to hold remand prisoners since July 1981, and how many prisoners have been held in each.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01904"><member>Lord Elton</member>: Since 1st July 1981 an average of about 45 prisoners, mainly remand prisoners, have been held each night in police cells. Of these, about 41 on average were held in police stations and magistrates' courts in the Metropolitan Police area and the remainder elsewhere, namely in the City of London, Essex, Hertfordshire, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley police force areas and, on two occasions in December 1981, in the Mancheser area. Complete information is not held centrally on the individual police stations which have held such prisoners and it could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<title>HORSES: PROTECTION IN SHOW JUMPING</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01905"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01906">Whether the Protection of Animals Act 1911 or any other Act provides protection to horses used in show jumping against ill-treatment and injury caused by raising the height of the jumps to levels which are likely to cause unnecessary suffering: and</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01907">Whether the doping of horses, competing in show jumping, with Phenyl Butazone or other painkilling drugs to enable them to continue in competitions in spite of injury contravenes the law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01908"><member>Lord Elton</member>: The Protction of Animals Acts 1911 to 1964 (and the equivalent legislation in Scotland) provide for the protection of horses used in show jumping against offences of unnecessary suffering. It is for the courts to decide whether the actions referred to constitute offences under the Act.</p>

<title>THE NORTHERN IRELAND YOUTH TRAINING PROGRAMME</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01909"><member>Lord Blease</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01910">Whether they will indicate what measures have been undertaken by Northern Ireland departments to monitor appropriately at educational establishments and at industrial levels the actions taken to implement the declared objectives of the Northern Ireland Youth Training Programme and whether they will state also what research projects have been initiated or sponsored by Northern Ireland departments to assess the practical results of the YTP (N1) that may enable any necessary reappraisal and adjustments of the present programme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01911"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member>: A number of measures are used to monitor the extent to which the objectives of the Youth Training Programme are being achieved. The programme is monitored centrally (<i>a</i>) by the Manpower Advisory Council and in particular by its Standing Committee on YTP and (<i>b</i>) by representatives of the Departments of Economic Development and Education, acting together in an interdepartmental executive. The programme is monitored on a local basis by 13 local liaison committees. In addition, the progress of individual trainees is

monitored by careers officers and by feedback through the new profiling system. No research projects have been initiated, but formal evaluation arrangements for YTP are presently under active consideration, and some initial work has already started.</p>

evidence there is that the disease is spreading; and what threat it poses to humans.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01940"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member>: For some years research into Leptospirosis has been carried out at the Ministry's Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland's Laboratory at Belfast. The research is designed to improve methods of diagnosis, determine the prevalence of infection and the methods by which it can be controlled. The work is being directed primarily towards Leptospirosis in cattle because of the problems of mastitis, abortion and premature calving it can cause. Vaccine trials have been undertaken which suggest that vaccination might prove to be the only practical method of control. The problems associated with the disease continue to be the subject of international discussion, research and collaboration. The development of the disease in this country is not clear but it is most common in cattle. The disease can occur in humans, most notably those involved in the dairy industry, through transmission from cattle. In most cases the manifestations of the disease are not serious.</p>

<title>The Queen's Flight: Andover Aircraft</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01944">2.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01945"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will state the ages of each of the Andover type aircraft operated by the Queen's Flight; and when it is intended to replace them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01946"><member>The Minister of State for Defence Procurement (Viscount Trenchard)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Andover aircraft of the Queen's Flight entered Royal Air Force service between September 1964 and March 1965. They are extremely safe aircraft, and have years of useful life left. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced in another place on 7th April 1981 (<i>Hansard</i>, col. 219) that the replacement of these aircraft had, with reluctance, been deferred for the time being.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01947"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that, in fact, he has not answered the Question on the Order Paper, in which I asked him for the age of each of these individual aircraft? However, in the light of his general commentary on their vintage, is he aware that, although everyone would accept that the maintenance of the Royal Flight is superlatively done, these aircraft are of an age which must raise some doubts as to their safety? Is he also aware that aircraft of the same model&#x2014;the HS748&#x2014;have had one or two very alarming accidents in the last year or two?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01948"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend asked me a similar question last year and I am afraid I must say to him straight away&#x2014;perhaps in order to discourage him from asking the same supplementary questions&#x2014;that I have nothing further to tell him beyond what I said in July 1981. On the particular point of the age of the aircraft, I am informed that two of the Andovers were manufactured in 1964 and one in 1965. On the safety record of the aircraft, bearing in mind all incidents that have taken place and the special standard of maintenance, together with the hours flown by these aircraft&#x2014;which are considerably fewer than the hours flown by standard RAF
<col>482</col>
Andovers&#x2014;and their suitability for landing in small airfields, which is not very easily done by a number of modern aircraft, we are entirely satisfied that there are many years of useful and entirely safe life left in these aircraft.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01949"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Viscount's answer that the aircraft have years of useful life ahead of them rather discouraging? Is it contemplated that these planes should be used to infinity, whatever may happen in between?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01950"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that question and perhaps adjuster of my answer. Certainly there was nothing in my previous Answer, nor that of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, to say that without question these aircraft will go on for an indefinite period. We shall keep the matter of replacement of these aircraft and of those in the communications squadron under review. Various modern aircraft made in this country are obviously candidates when the day comes when we believe that this becomes a real priority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01951"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not rather strange that Her Majesty the Queen, who, after all, is this country's greatest ambassador and unofficial salesman, should be travelling in aircraft 20 years old instead of advertising and proclaiming the best and the newest of British aircraft?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01952"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said in answer to these questions before, whenever Her Majesty flies abroad on any long-distance trip she travels in a VC.10; whenever she wants an HS125 for a particular visit, she has it. Taking account of the nature and frequency of the journeys that the Queen's Flight is called upon to make and the aerodromes at which it is called upon to land, together with the current equipment backed up in the way I have suggested, the particular aircraft in the Queen's Flight are not unsuitable for the task.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01953"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount is aware&#x2014;as he has just said&#x2014;that Britain makes the most advanced aircraft in the world. But does he not also agree that it is much more difficult to convince the world of that while our Head of State is flying in these elderly aircraft? Can he give the House one company in this country that would send its chief executive around in such outdated communications aircraft&#x2014;just one company? Finally, is the noble Viscount aware that the 146 starts on a very important sales tour in the Far East and Australia this week? Would it not give an enormous boost to that sales effort if the Government could say that the Queen is about to adopt this British aircraft?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01954"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his supplementary question. I value his contributions, with all his knowledge of the aircraft world, and I share his wishes for the support of the launch of the 146, which I believe is an excellent aircraft and which, as I have already said, is certainly a candidate when the day comes to consider aircraft for either the communications squadron or the Queen's Flight.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0250"/>
<col>483</col>
If I may say so, I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Beswick, listened to my previous answer to my noble friend. When Her Majesty goes abroad almost invariably she does not travel in an Andover. There are times when other members of the Royal Family go abroad, in particular where small airfields are involved&#x2014;and I think it would be in order to say that some members of the Royal Family like piloting themselves and being able to land at small airfields&#x2014;where the Andovers are taken abroad because they are suitable for the kind of tour that the Royal Family envisages making.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01955"><member>Lord Gridley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that a few years ago I travelled on an aircraft of the Queen's Flight to visit the British Army of the Rhine and as we were approaching to land there it was found that we were straying over the eastern part of Germany, that the navigational equipment had gone wrong, and we had to return to base and get a fresh aircraft?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01956"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not aware of that. I am lucky enough to be able to use, whenever aircraft are not required, aircraft of the Queen's Flight and I have never had any such episode occur. I have travelled in the greatest comfort with the utmost speed and reached my destination&#x2014;bearing in mind the kind of aerodrome one lands on&#x2014;as quickly as I would in a modern aircraft.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01957"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the reverse of what my noble friend Lord Beswick said be the case&#x2014;that for Her Majesty to fly in old aircraft shows how long these aircraft last?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01958"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Beswick, as to what companies, if any, send their chief executives in aircraft of this age? Can he also add the name of whatever other Head of State travels in aircraft of this vintage?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01959"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not answer that question for the specific reason that, when the Head of State travels abroad, she rarely, unless it is definitely required for the purpose concerned, travels in an Andover aircraft. She in fact travels, as my noble friend believes his chief executives always travel, in a suitable aircraft for the job. I should think that there are chief executives of companies in this country who do travel in everything down to their own small aircraft which they can pilot and land where they wish to go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01960"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Minister agree that it is unfair to criticise something merely because of its age?&#x2014;otherwise this very ancient House would be open to severe criticism.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-01962"><member>Lord Gardiner</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
<col>484</col>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what is their response to the Justice Report on <i>Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01963"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have studied the proposals contained in this report with interest. We have also studied other proposals for changes in this part of the law. However we have not yet decided how to respond to them. The Select Committee on Home Affairs in another place is at present conducting an inquiry of its own into procedures for the investigation of possible miscarriages of justice. This includes the way in which claims for compensation are dealt with, and we do not wish to anticipate their report.<lb/>
My Lords, if I may add to that Answer, your Lordships may detect a certain fitness in the spectacle of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gardiner, pursuing uninterruptedly the cause of justice as he sees it, when I tell your Lordships that today is, I am told, the day on which he retires from his 12 years presidency of the Howard League, of which he has, I believe, been a distinguished member since about 1945. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on that notable contribution to public life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01964"><member>Lord Gardiner</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for that reply, may I ask him whether he would be prepared to receive, and discuss these matters with, a deputation from Justice?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01965"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while not closing the door on that offer, which I should like to consider, it might be that it would be more appropriate to do so when the report of the Select Committee is available, but I shall take that on board and write to the noble and learned Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01966"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that there is a good deal of worry in our circles&#x2014;I speak of the Howard League which, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, the noble and learned Lord has headed in such a distinguished way, and other organisations&#x2014;because the Justice Report to which this Question refers says unequivocally in its first two recommendations that this country is out of line with Article 14(6) of the United Nations international covenant on civil and political rights? I think myself&#x2014;and I hope that the noble Lord will perhaps agree, though I doubt it rather&#x2014;that his reply was very lukewarm in relation to an actual breach of this kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01967"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was lukewarm in that the Government share the views of previous Administrations that present arrangements are not in fact in breach of Article 14(6) of the covenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01968"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the terms of reference of the Select Committee include consideration and analysis of what is done in other countries of a similar standard of justice and civilisation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01969"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in response to an earlier Question by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0251"/>
<col>485</col>
Gardiner, we have collected data on what is being done in Western European countries, which we are reflecting on at the moment. The terms of reference of the Committee, of course, were settled some time ago, as it is now in session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01970"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in cases where capital punishment has been carried out and subsequent posthumous pardons have been made, would such instances come within the compass of this review?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01971"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not entirely certain that I grasped the purport of the noble Lord's question. The Article is concerned, as is the Question, with the paying of compensation to people convicted of crimes and subsequently pardoned, whether posthumously or not, as I understand it. The Article refers to people convicted by a final decision. Therefore, if the decision was a final decision of the court and the person subsequently died, I should think, subject to advice, that they would be embraced by the convention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01972"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the point I had in mind was where a person was arrested and was not necessarily in prison but, in the days of capital punishment, had his life taken from him, and later on it was discovered that he was innocent. Ought not such cases also to come within the compass of this review? When a posthumous pardon has been issued by Her Majesty and we, as a nation, have committed the unfortunate crime of hanging the wrong person, ought not some award be made to the wife, children, whoever it might be, of such a person?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01973"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the length of time since capital punishment was the law in this country, I think the question is relatively hypothetical.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01974"><member>Baroness Wootton of Abinger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it the fact that the Select Committee is confining its inquiries to Western Europe, or to the Western world? May I suggest that they might have something to learn from Japan in this context?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01975"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I referred to Western Europe, I was referring to inquiries of our own in the Home Department in response to the earlier Question of the noble and learned Lord. It is not for the Government in fact to dictate to a Select Committee what evidence it shall take.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01976"><member>Baroness Wootton of Abinger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware whether the Select Committee is making inquiries over a wider area than the Western world?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01977"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it is proper for me so to do, I shall inquire and let the noble Baroness know.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Social Security Payments: Effect of Restraint</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01978">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01979"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
<col>486</col>
To ask Her Majesty's Government what the additional expenditure on social security, including national insurance benefits, would be in the current year if all the cuts made by the Government in this sphere since 1979 were fully restored in real terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01980"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if savings made in the social security programme by the Government since we came to office had not been made, the total social security programme would cost about &#x00A3;1.5 billion more in 1982&#x2013;83 than the &#x00A3;32 billion already estimated as the cost this financial year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01981"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I thank the noble Lord for that reply, may I ask him, in view of the fact that the cuts mean much to the recipients and yet, according to the figure he has given, the sum, although substantial, is still small compared with the total overall social security budget, whether the Government will seriously consider restoring the penalties and thus relieving hardship, increasing demand and reducing unemployment, and indeed going some way to pay for the cost of the increase of benefit?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01982"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is true to say that the word "cuts" is not wholly appropriate in this context. Only one benefit has actually been removed, and that is of course the earnings-related supplement to unemployment benefit, although I would accept of course that certain benefits have not been increased at the rate that some would wish. But these decisions have to be taken in the context of the necessity to contain public expenditure overall, and I can give the noble Lord no assurance that they will be restored.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01983"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the figure that the noble Lord quoted include the cuts in real terms which have arisen from the failure of the Government to increase particular benefits in line with the cost of living, such as the death grant, which has remained constant since 1964?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01984"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the figure I gave was a cash figure and not a real figure, as the noble Lord was asking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01985"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the figure which the noble Lord gave include the cost of restoring the child benefit to its real value in 1979?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01986"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. The figure I gave did not include the item to which the noble Lord referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01987"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord have the figure he gave broken down so that he could tell us how much of that figure of &#x00A3;1.5 billion, if I got the figure correctly, relates to the savings that the Government have made at the expense of the unemployed by cutting out the earnings-related benefit?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01988"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, the figure I gave included the money saved from that source.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0252"/>
<col>487</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01989"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was asking whether the figure had been broken down so as to enable the Minister to say how much has been saved by the Government at the expense of cutting the unemployment benefit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01990"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, unemployment benefit as such has not been cut, of course; it is the earnings-related supplement. I do not have a precise figure for the sum that has been saved by that change, but it is of the order of &#x00A3;300 million.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RAF High Wycombe: Land at Bradenham</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01991">3.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01992"><member>The Earl of Kimberley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will confirm that the Ministry of Defence has leased 12 acres of National Trust land at Bradenham in the Chilterns for 99 years for use by the RAF High Wycombe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01993"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can confirm that the Minstry of Defence has leased about 12 acres of land from the National Trust for a period of 99 years and has licensed a further area for 10 years for the dumping of spoil. The leased area is required for a RAF operations centre. Careful landscaping will ensure that when the project is completed there will be virtually no visual impact on the surrounding area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01994"><member>The Earl of Kimberley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that Answer, may I ask whether he would agree that the uproar that this decision has created in the National Trust, largely engineered by Professor Hutchinson, a leading light of the CND, is not a great example of the CND's promotion of unilateral nuclear disarmament through pseudo-objectivity? Would he further agree that the same technique is used by the working party report of the Church of England, of which Canon Paul Oestreicher, last year's vice-chairman of the CND, is a member?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01995"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend goes too far in asking me to agree all the details of his supplementary. What I can say is that there is no question but that, in my opinion, the fuss created within the National Trust seems to be about national policy matters related to armament and disarmament, which is not within either the objectives or terms of reference of the National Trust. The National Trust did indeed negotiate this lease and licence extremely meticulously in relation to its objects and terms of reference. It was not until the Ministry of Defence was able to satisfy them fully that there would really be no lasting effects on the environment&#x2014;indeed, when completed and when the trees are grown, some might say it was an improvement&#x2014;that they were prepared to grant the licence and lease. I hope very much that the matter can be kept on that basis and not turned into an argument on disarmament, which has nothing to do with the case.</membercontribution></p>
<col>488</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01996"><member>Lord Hale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, apart from the question of armament or disarmament, may I ask the noble Viscount to agree that this land is of very great historical, and particularly politically historical, interest? Is it not some of the most fertile and productive in that historic area? After listening to talk about the national heritage, preservation and the green belt and so on, is it the position that the Ministry of Defence can negotiate with all the Government power behind them to take off large chunks of the heritage month after month?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01997"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: That is not so, My Lords, I have mentioned the acreage&#x2014;12 acres are at stake&#x2014;and while the National Trust must speak for itself, I believe it is totally satisfied that the area, after it has been carefully landscaped, will be both decorative and fertile&#x2014;that is, on this 12 acres of land, and the noble Lord seems to be worried about its fertility&#x2014;so I could not agree with the line of his supplementary'.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01998"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the National Trust one of the largest landowners in this country? Is it not unthinkable that they should be exempt from providing land on lease for the protection of the nation, which is indeed a protection of the heritage?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-01999"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe it is unthinkable that the National Trust should not be allowed to lease land for any legal purpose which does not cause an eyesore to the environment or upset in any other way the objects of that excellent body.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02000"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: Is the Minister aware that the fact that the Ministry of Defence has taken the land for 99 years gives us all great hope?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02001"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: I thank the noble Lord for that comment, my, Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02002"><member>Viscount Hanworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the National Trust had not agreed, would it have been possible to have requisitioned the land?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02003"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: I understand that that could possibly have been the case, my Lords, but I assure the noble Lord that it never entered our contemplation at all. We carried out the negotiations with professional and expert people and we were able to satisfy them that they could grant a lease within their terms of reference.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02004"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware&#x2014;I speak with some local knowledge&#x2014;that the protest was not initiated by the CND but by local feeling? Have operations on this project begun? If so, was that justifiable in view of the fact that 3,000 members of the National Trust have asked that the matter should be reconsidered and when legal action is being proposed in the matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02005"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, work began in May of this year after a properly negotiated lease had been obtained and all the necessary legal permissions granted. The noble Lord asks me to agree that this was a spontaneous local protest. I leave the House to judge
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0253"/>
<col>489</col>
against a background of the acreage and what I have said in terms of the effect on the surroundings in the long term.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02006"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the effect on the flora and fauna of the area been carefully considered? I genuinely do not know the answer, and it is a slightly different question from the effect on the general environment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02007"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will let the noble Baroness have a detailed answer to that supplementary because it is not a question I have asked <i>per se</i>. I repeat, we are talking about 12 acres. There will be trees and shrubs growing on it, so I think the fauna and all the rest will probably be quite useful to nature and natural life, but I shall confirm in detail whether they envisage any particular changes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02008"><member>Lord Gibson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the National Trust has always fought to protect land in its care when it is of high landscape value, and will always do so; that it is only when it is of low landscape value that it will consider granting a lease if a compulsory purchase order is threatened; and that when it makes that decision it does so on environmental and not on political grounds?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02009"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: I accept what the noble Lord says, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend Lord Ferrers will then, with the leave of the House, repeat a Statement on the Fisheries Council meeting on 25th and 26th October. Finally, my noble friend Lord Mansfield will, again with the leave of the House, repeat a Statement on the privatisation of Britoil.<lb/>
I should also like to comment on the remainder of today's business. The Industrial Development Bill, which is a consolidation measure, will, on its arrival from another place, be taken forthwith and before the Administration of Justice Bill. If consideration of Commons amendments to the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill is not completed by 7 p.m., it might be for the convenience of the House for that consideration to be adjourned at approximately 7 p.m. for a short period. Consideration of Commons amendments to the Industrial Development Bill and the Administration of Justice Bill would then be taken during the adjournment.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02066"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 1 to 16 inclusive, and then to move the remainder formally as we reach them. I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 1 to 16. These amendments concern compulsory admission to hospital and guardianship. Several of the amendments&#x2014;Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 9, 11, 15 and 16-are purely technical, and I shall not detain your Lordships with a complicated explanation, unless there is a particular point which a noble Lord should like me to clarify.<lb/>
Several of the other amendments-Nos. 1 to 4&#x2014;tighten the safeguards on the admission procedures. Amendment No. 1, for example, strengthens an amendment made by your Lordships at Report, when we said that two recommendations might come from doctors at the same hospital only if there would otherwise be "undesirable delay". The other place has replaced that term by the condition that there would otherwise be,
<quote>"delay involving serious risk to the health or safety of the patient".</quote>
Two other amendments. Nos. 7 and 8, introduce a theme to which I shall return when we come to the new Part on consent to treatment&#x2014;the theme of multidisciplinary consultation. These amendments require the patient's responsible medical officer to consult at least one other person who has been professionally concerned with the patient's treatment before he makes a statutory report to reclassify the patient's mental disorder, or to renew his detention.<lb/>
Another theme in this group of amendments is the increasing involvement of social workers in every case, either before or after admission. Amendment No. 13 provides that a relative can ask a local authority to send an approved social worker to investigate whether an application for compulsory admission should be made. I am sure that local authorities already meet requests such as that, but it does no harm to have a clear statutory duty. That enables the nearest relative to have the benefit of the social worker's advice before an admission is made. Amendment No. 14 involves a social worker after an admission under Sections 25 or 26 for 28 days or more, where the application was made by the nearest relative.<lb/>
I hope that your Lordships will agree that somewhat cryptic description of the amendments is appropriate in the circumstances, and that you will see fit to agree that they should be incorporated in the Bill. I beg to move.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02067"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say a few words very briefly about Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 on the reclassification and duration of authority for detention and guardianship, respectively. The amendments place a fresh duty on the responsible medical officer to consult other professionals concerned with the patient's treatment. This is a welcome extension of wider consultations, which MENCAP and others have advocated all along. I believe that the Government have got this right, and we are grateful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02068"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask my noble friend a brief question in relation to
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0256"/>
<col>495</col>
Amendment No. 4. What happens in an emergency if the medical practitioner in charge of treatment and his nominated alternative are both away? Can the medical practitioner nominate somebody else&#x2014;over the telephone, say&#x2014;so that an emergency sitution can be dealt with? Or have the Government in mind that there would always be a duty officer, or somebody of that nature? Perhaps my noble friend could clarify that for me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02069"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should simply like to refer to Amendment No. 14. We supported this Opposition amendment in another place, but one rather wonders why emergency applications under Section 29 are excluded. Speed may be of the essence in such cases, and there is no reason why a social worker should have a veto over a psychiatrist. But a subsequent interview with a social worker who may know the family background could be of considerable assistance to the doctor after an emergency admission. I should be grateful for some clarification upon this point.<lb/>
Baroness Robson of Kiddington: My Lords, may I refer to Amendment No. 12, where, after the word "patient", the words "in a suitable manner" are being inserted? If my memory does not fail me, when we had our Committee stage on this Bill there were a number of amendments put forward by my noble friends on these Benches and from every side of the Committee which were turned down by the Government because they were not sufficiently clear or specific enough. I should like to know what "in a suitable manner" means, and whether the phrase can really be interpreted when it appears in an Act of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02070"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fear very much that some of these amendments are going to place undue restraints on psychiatrists, who have such an important part to play in getting people back into ordinary life from the agony of a special hospital. I fear that in many ways it is going to restrain them from doing what they believe to be the right thing, and at the right time, if these amendments are carried through.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02071"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot agree with the noble Baroness. Generally speaking, I welcome these amendments. Indeed, with one exception I welcome most of them. Apart from that, I am very pleased indeed to see Amendment No. 14, and also Amendment No. 10. In the early stages we tried to move such amendments; but the Government have had reconsiderations elsewhere, which is acceptable to us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02072"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise briefly to indicate the consent of my noble friends on these Benches to this block of amendments. I should like to do two other things, but briefly. First, I certainly join with the noble Lord, Lord Renton, in what he said about Amendments Nos. 7 and 8. I, too, warmly welcome these. I agree with him wholeheartedly that they make an immense improvement on the procedures which we have had hitherto, and I think they are warmly to be welcomed. I should also like to endorse what has been said by my noble friend Lady Robson in asking
<col>496</col>
for some clarification of the words "in a suitable manner" in Amendment 12. I am not saying here that I do not necessarily accept this amendment, but it would be interesting to hear precisely what the Government have in mind in this regard.<lb/>
May I say just one thing further, and then it will not be necessary for me to say it on any other amendment. If the noble Lord will forgive me for introducing a faint note of criticism into these proceedings&#x2014;perhaps not criticism, but of regret&#x2014;in general terms it is this. Noble Lords will remember that we spent four months on this Bill. We were very grateful indeed that this Bill was introduced in your Lordships' House&#x2014;a House in which a great many noble Lords in all parts of the Chamber have vast experience and expertise; people who have worked in this field for the whole of their professional lives.<lb/>
I think it was very valuable that your Lordships' House had the opportunity of moulding this Bill initially; and in those four months&#x2014;and it was four months from Second Reading until we had finally finished with it&#x2014;I think there were noble Lords in this House who gained a great understanding and expertise in the matter of this Bill as a whole. I therefore merely say that, to me, it seems a matter of faint regret that we should now get the Bill back at the eleventh hour, as it were, in such a form that it is quite impossible for us to make any changes without perhaps imperilling the Bill as a whole.<lb/>
I am not saying that there are very many changes that we should like to make, but since we have acquired such expertise in this particular matter I think it is a pity that noble Lords will not have an opportunity to make minor improvements which perhaps they could have made had we had the Bill returned to us at a slightly earlier stage, instead of a matter of minutes before Prorogation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02073"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me say straightaway that I have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, has said, but I can assure him that the timetable for the Bill has not been arranged in such a way as deliberately to deny your Lordships an opportunity to amend the Commons amendments. I of course appreciate that the Bill is one which began its life in your Lordships' House and was the subject of considerable and important debate here, under the guidance of my noble friend Lord Elton. But I think it would be right to say that the vast majority of the Commons amendments which are before us' today would in general be welcomed by your Lordships. Many of them were certainly taken up in another place in response to points made here in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I appreciate that the end of the Session is now very nearly upon us, but it is only fair to say that the position we find ourselves in today is not unique. It has happened before on many occasions under many different Governments, I fear. It would not be right for me to comment on the timetable in another place, although I would personally have preferred a little more time for your Lordships to consider these amendments. Having said that, in fairness to another place I should say that in the last few days they have been able to consider amendments made by your Lordships to the Criminal Justice Bill, the Transport Bill and the Employment Bill with even less notice
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0257"/>
<col>497</col>
than we have had today. I have certainly taken note of the view of the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, which is undoubtedly shared by other noble Lords, and I am certain that the point will be taken on board by my noble friend the Chief Whip; but I hope your Lordships will agree that we should now proceed to consider these amendments.<lb/>
Perhaps I may go straightaway to the specific point made by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, which I think echoed the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, about the words "in a suitable manner" referred to in Amendment 12. That amendment provides, as the noble Baroness says, that the mental welfare officer must use "a suitable manner" when interviewing a patient with a view to making an application for admission. We have in mind here the special needs of, for example, deaf people and other people with communication problems, and that was why those particular words were included. I can assure the noble Baroness and the noble Lord that there was no ulterior motive.<lb/>
May I turn now to the point made by my noble friend Lord Mottistone on Amendment No. 4. Let us suppose that the first doctor is out of the country and that his nominated deputy dies. You then have to ascertain who in fact is the doctor in charge of the patient's treatment. The medical executive committee of the hospital would want to make sure that someone was responsible for the patient's care, medication and so on, and might appoint another doctor to take charge <i>pro tem</i>. It seems to me that in those circumstances the third doctor would then have the power to make a Section 30 report.<lb/>
The other way out of all this would he to use Sections 25 or 26, or even 29, if it was urgently necessary to detain the patient. I suspect that if we start imagining a long chapter of accidents or disasters, or let our imagination run wild in these circumstances, we might really get ourselves into difficulties. I really do not believe that there will be any difficulty of the kind that my noble friend describes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02074"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend moves on from that, he did not really take my point about an emergency. I was not thinking of people out of the country and dying, where arrangements could be made more of less in slow time; but if a patient really does require medical treatment in a hurry and there is no doctor in the hospital, what is to be done? Under Amendment No. 4, which we are considering, it seems that only one person is to be nominated as alternative to the other person. If they are both not available, is it conceived by the Government that it should be possible to further nominate to deal with an immediate problem, not the sort of longish-term situation my noble friend was describing?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02075"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure that I was discussing a longish-term situation, as my noble friend put it. I believe that it will be possible for hospitals to obtain the services of the medical officer who is the appropriate medical officer in this case, and if a genuine difficulty arose I have no doubt that they would re-nominate someone if that is what is necessary. I really think that my noble friend is exaggerating the difficulties in the situation that may
<col>498</col>
occur. I hope that, on reflection, he will be persuaded along those lines.<lb/>
May I turn now to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, and in particular to the question about the Section 29 arrangements in Amendment No. 14. We excluded them because of the great practical difficulties. The maximum period for which a patient can be detained in hospital under an emergency application is 72 hours. It will be very difficult for all the steps in the new clause to be completed within 72 hours and for the social worker to make a satisfactory, full report within that time. It would not be right to make provision in law for something which in many cases could not be fulfilled. The difficulty therefore is a practical one in the way of the proposal which the noble Lord puts forward and I hope that he will agree that it is a real one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02084"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 17 to 21 <i>en bloc</i>. The purpose of Amendment No. 17 is to broaden the scope of Section 52 of the Act so that the county court will be able to appoint an acting nearest relative for the benefit of a patient who is detained in hospital or subject to guardianship in pursuance of a Hospital or Guardianship Order made under Section 60.<lb/>
The nearest relative for such a patient has, of course, no power to authorise his discharge under Section 47
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0258"/>
<col>499</col>
because of the provisions of subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) of Section 63 but he does have the right to apply to the tribunal on behalf of the patient under subsections (3)(<i>a</i>) and (4) of Section 63 as amended by Clause 19. This represents an additional safeguard of the interests of such a patient and in the Government's view is an appropriate provision in a Bill which is intended to advance the interests of all detained patients.<lb/>
With regard to Amendments Nos. 18 to 21, your Lordships will recall that an amendment to very similar effect to those on the list in relation to Clause 28 was proposed in Committee in this House by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, was then resisted by the Government and then withdrawn. In the Special Standing Committee in the other place, however, the Government's arguments did not prevail and amendments to both Clause 28 and 29 were carried. The effect in each case is to give to a person who is remanded to hospital, either for assessment under the new power conferred by Clause 28 or for treatment under Clause 29, a statutory right to obtain a report from a doctor of his own choosing and the right to apply to the court for the remand to be terminated on the basis of the information contained in that report.<lb/>
We remain of the opinion expressed in this House by my noble friend Lord Belstead&#x2014;it is a matter of irony for me that I am brought in now at the only part of the Bill which I did not speak on then&#x2014;that these amendments are unlikely to be of great benefit to the accused person, first, because he has already the right to commission his own private medical report and, secondly, because the court is unlikely to end his remand on the basis of such a report until it is satisfied that this would be appropriate by the evidence of the medical practitioner responsible for making the report or giving the treatment that the court originally requested. Equally, however, we recognise that there is a strong feeling among many people that such a provision would be helpful and certainly we must concede that it would do no great harm.<lb/>
Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendments.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Elton</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02085"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise not to speak against the amendments but to accept them; but I want to revert to the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, about the short notice that we have had and so on. These are the facts of life towards the end of a Session and we have got to put up with it. I rise to my feet to be fair to the noble Baroness the Leader of the House and to the Chief Whip for sending to us quite a detailed list and a simple explanation of a number of amendments. For that the Government are to be thanked. Their action is appreciated. I would also say that I hope that they will be as generous to me later this evening as I am to them at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02086"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I take the opportunity of welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Elton, on his return to this territory with which he had became so familiar and with which, I may say, he really had become so expert. I say that without any disrespect at all to the noble Lord who has now replaced him in office terms. On this particular block of amendments. I should like to raise one point which arises in both Amendments Nos. 19 and 21. The point
<col>500</col>
is with regard to the ability of the accused person to be entitled to obtain at his own expense an independent report <i>et cetera</i>. I do not necessarily quarrel with that as a principle. I think that there are many occasions on which it is perfectly proper that an independent medical report of that kind should be paid for by the person asking for it. But I must bear in mind&#x2014;and no doubt the noble Lord will bear it in mind&#x2014;that from time to time there will be people with very limited means or even with no means at all.<lb/>
Therefore, I would hope that we might get some assurance from the noble Lord, Lord Elton, that in operating these clauses and, in particular, the requirement that the person concerned should be required to pay the cost of the independent report, where circumstances arise with a person of limited or no means at all, that some effort will be made to provide funding for a necessary report for that person if the need should happen to arise. I do not know what thought has been given to this or what particular funds might be available. I would not have thought that it would be the wish of this House or another place that a person, because of limited or absent means, should be deprived as something which he might regard, rightly or wrongly, as something essential to his interests. I hope that the noble Lord will be able to give us some kind of assurance on that point, about a safety net for those who cannot afford to fulfil this requirement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02087"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, must have breathed a sigh of relief over the important amendments that he persuaded your Lordships to accept when the Bill was before your Lordships previously, amendments for which he had shown initiative and in regard to which great wisdom. But now that he is responsible for other parts of the Bill, the Home Office part. I hope I am not taking an unfair advantage with him to ask him for an assurance that the Commons amendments which he is now suggesting we should agree with do not affect the principle that when the courts have made a hospital order and the person in respect of whom it is made has been sent to prison or perhaps even discharged meanwhile, it is the court and not the hospital authority which retains ultimate responsibility in respect of the case. This is important not only in order that all concerned may know where the responsibility lies but also because upon that may depend the ultimate question of who exercises aftercare.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02088"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Amendment No. 19 refers to people remanded for assessment and Amendment No. 21 to people remanded for treatment. These amendments were SDP amendments in Standing Committee in another place. As important issues of liberty are at stake, the accused person should, in my view, be able to produce his own evidence for the court to balance against the rest, particularly as our attempts in your Lordships' House to reduce the period of remand for assessment from 12 to 8 weeks were not successful. Twelve weeks is a long time if it eventually turns out that the patient's mental condition is satisfactory and that a custodial sentence was inappropriate.<lb/>
This was resisted by the Government in Standing Committee in another place but carried by seven votes to six. I am glad to note that the Government did not
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0259"/>
<col>501</col>
seek to reverse this decision on Report. On these grounds, I congratulate the Government for leaving these amendments in the Bill. This is a tribute to the spirit in which this Bill at all its stages has been approached by all parties in both Houses of Parliament. If we conducted all our affairs in Parliament on the same basis as we have conducted the Mental Health Bill I think that our political affairs would be in better shape than they are. Finally, I should like to add my hacking to the query put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, regarding some assistance with the costs of an independent medical opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02089"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I acknowledge the kind remarks made by noble Lords in welcoming me back to this well trodden ground. On the matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, as I recall, we at no time were considering giving an unfettered right to patients to get opinions at the taxpayers' expense but merely about putting into legislation a confirmation of the right of any patient in a hospital to be seen by another doctor. However, we are dealing here with accused persons most of whom will in any event be eligible for support via legal aid in the preparation of their cases. I am assured that where the commission of an independent medical report forms a proper and necessary part of the accused's case so far as the court proceedings are concerned, legal aid may reasonably embrace the cost of the preparation of the report. Thus the effect of the words,
<quote>"at his own expense"</quote>
is only to make it clear that the subsection does not confer an automatic right to obtain a second report at the taxpayers' expense irrespective of the accused's circumstances, or the merits of his case. It is a right which, in so far as it is exercised at the taxpayers' expense, ought to he exercised reasonably and therefore the legal aid criteria will apply.<lb/>
As to the question of my noble friend Lord Renton, only the court can order a patient into the hospital. His question is whether the hospital can annul the order. The answer to that is certainly, no. Therefore, I commend these amendments to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02095"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 22. I hope that it will be for the convenience of the House if I also speak to Amendment No. 88. I am sure your Lordships are aware that concern was expressed in this House, and elsewhere, about the difficulties which sometimes arise in finding hospital places for mentally disordered people who appear before the courts. Governments of both complexions have sought over the years to resolve these difficulties, and there are signs that efforts to educate health authorities, and professional staff, about the needs of offender patients and the responsibility of the NHS to provide for them are bearing fruit. But there is a general feeling that more needs to be done.<lb/>
The Government agree with all those who have concluded that progress cannot be made by empowering the courts to direct an offender's admission to hospital. We do not believe that it should be left to the courts to try one hospital after another in search of a place. Of course, this happens only rarely at present because in the majority of cases those concerned with the offender will have made arrangements for his admission to hospital, subject to the court's decision, before the case is even heard. It is very often the prison medical officer who makes these arrangements. But where such arrangements have not been made the court will need advice of what suitable facilities are available. This is properly for the regional health authority to provide since only they will have comprehensive knowledge of all that is available within the region's boundaries, and sometimes by arrangement in other regions. Amendment No. 22 therefore provides that whenever a court is minded to make a hospital order or an interim hospital order it may, if it chooses, ask the appropriate regional health authority to provide information as to the availability of suitable hospital places. Amendment No. 88 is consequential on No. 22 and simply provides that the interpretation provisions which apply in Part V of the 1959 Act apply also to Amendment No. 22. I hope your Lordships will accord the same warm welcome to these amendments as they received in the other place.<lb/>

<title>EC: Foreign Affairs Council&#x2014;<lb/>Luxembourg Meeting</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02097">3.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02098"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a Statement on the outcome of the Foreign Affairs Council held at Luxembourg on Monday the 25th and Tuesday the 26th of October.<lb/>
"Agreement was reached yesterday on the implementation of the agreement of 25th May on refunds for the United Kingdom for 1982. This is subject to final confirmation within three days by the French
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0260"/>
<col>503</col>
Government. I am arranging for the text of the council conclusions to be placed in the Library of the House together with a short explanatory note.<lb/>
"The main issue discussed by the council was the method of financing the refunds. In particular, the agreement of 25th May provided for relief for Germany without specifying how the relief was to be given. This has now been satisfactorily resolved, and I am satisfied that the arrangements correctly implement the agreement of 25th May.<lb/>
"The council had a useful discussion of East-West economic relations and of the Community dimension of the current discussions with the Americans. There was general support for the efforts being made to reach agreement on a framework for the handling of East-West trade and economic issues.<lb/>
"As the House will be aware, there remain restrictions on general trade between the United Kingdom and other countries of the Community and Argentina. We have discussed this with our partners and I am glad to report that the council agreed with my suggestion that the Community should put to the Argentine Government immediately a proposal for the reciprocal lifting of these restrictions.<lb/>
"A ministerial conference with Spain in the margins of the council made progress on a number of points. There will be a ministerial conference with the Portuguese in November, and the council reviewed the preparations.<lb/>
"The council agreed a mandate for the negotiation of the trade r&#x00E9;gime with Cyprus for 1983. There was also a meeting at ministerial level of the EC Cyprus Association Council. The Community announced its agreement in principle to a second Financial Protocol for Cyprus to enter into effect on 1st January 1984.<lb/>
"The council also discussed a number of important trade issues for which my honourable and learned friend the Minister for Trade was present.<lb/>
"Points connected with the preparation of the Community position at the forthcoming GATT Ministerial Meeting were remitted to officials for further work. Meanwhile, the Community will continue to participate constructively in the preparations for the meeting on the basis of the guidelines endorsed by the council in July.<lb/>
"On relations with Japan, the council deplored the lack of progress so far in the consultations under the dispute settlement procedures of the GATT. A copy of the council's conclusions is being placed in the Library of the House.<lb/>
"On steel, the United Kingdom pressed strongly for a tighter and more realistic import r&#x00E9;gime for 1983.<lb/>
"On textiles, the Commission reported on the negotiations for new bilateral agreements under the multi-fibre arrangements and were given instructions to re-open negotiations where agreements remained to be concluded".<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02099"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Lord for repeating the Statement. While
<col>504</col>
we welcome the agreement on refunds, so far as it goes, is the noble Lord aware that it is extremely complicated and it seems to fall short of the speedy and permanent solution which we had been led to expect? Is it true that long-term budget arrangements, which are so desirable, were not pressed by the United Kingdom on this occasion? Can he therefore tell the House what the prospects are for a long-term settlement? Also, does the Prime Minister intend to raise this when she goes to the Copenhagen Summit at the beginning of December? Can he also say a word about the United Kingdom contribution to the Community budget? This was thought to be about &#x00A3;840 million, but reports this morning give a figure of about &#x00A3;1 billion. Can the noble Lord say which of the two is the accurate figure?<lb/>
In the discussion on East/West trade to which the Foreign Secretary referred was the question of the Siberian pipeline raised and, if so, with what result? Further on this point of East/West trade, was the proposed sale of butter surpluses to the Soviet Union discussed and what conclusions were reached on that?<lb/>
With regard to the lifting of restrictions on general trade with Argentina and the Foreign Secretary's proposals on this, can the noble Lord say whether any conditions were attached?&#x2014;for example, a clarification of Argentina's position on the total cessation of hostilities. I think the House would wish to know what the conditions were which the Foreign Secretary attached to the proposals that he made. Is he aware that we on this side of the House would support any reasonable step in this direction, and the improvement of trade with other South American countries?<lb/>
With regard to the paragraph on Spain, can the noble Lord say whether there was any time-scale agreed regarding the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community?<lb/>
Lastly, in the sentence on steel, having regard to the considerable anxiety which exists about the state of the steel industry in Britain at present, can the noble Lord say what was the response of other Community countries to the pressure of the United Kingdom for a tighter and a more realistic import r&#x00E9;gime for 1983?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02100"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on these Benches on the whole would like to congratulate the Foreign Secretary on what he has achieved at this last meeting. It seems to me to be extremely satisfactory on almost every point, and more particularly perhaps in regard to the implementation of the agreement of 25th May on refunds for 1982. I think we can only hope that the French will agree, and I believe there is every reason to suppose that they will. The only point which perhaps might have been made and was not discussed was in regard to Poland. I am not quite certain why they did not discuss what action, if any, they might take in regard to Poland in connection with the latest moves of the Government there.<lb/>
I have only one general point to make and that is in relation to the negotiations on the British contribution to the budget. I believe it is only right that the Government should fight their own corner in maintaining that our contribution, generally speaking, is too large&#x2014;I am all in favour of that&#x2014;and in maintaining that there should be a notable reduction. But I suggest that it would be wrong to be too tough in these negotiations.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0261"/>
<col>505</col>
Do they not see that, far from regarding the United Kingdom as one of the poorer members of the Community, the French regard us&#x2014;with some reason&#x2014;as one of the richer members, sitting as we are on a mountain of coal, surrounded by an ocean of oil and gas, with a nuclear energy programme of our own and, above all, with a balance of payments which now is happily more or less in surplus? On the other hand, the French, as we know, are enormously dependent on imported energy, which can hardly be said to be their fault. Any additional drain on their resources consequently affects them more than us. In these circumstances, why should we quarrel unduly about &#x00A3;50 million or &#x00A3;100 million which, in relation to our own expenditure, is now really only a drop in the ocean?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02101">3.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02102"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for their response to the Statement. I think perhaps that of the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, was a little warmer than that of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn. However, I shall do my best to answer their questions.<lb/>
Both noble Lords commented, not unnaturally I think, on what I hope the House will regard as the "meat" of the Statement: that is, the budget. I would agree with the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, that this is a good solution for Britain and also for the EEC. It is not, of course, a long-term solution, as will be quite obvious. The main benefit is that there will be a very substantial bringing forward of the payment of our refunds. We shall receive our basic refund of &#x00A3;600 million before the end of this year and not in 1983, as specified in the 25th May agreement. We shall also receive payments under the risk-sharing formula out of the 1983 budget and not out of the 1984 budget, as the 25th May agreement also specified. Without these concessions we should not have received most of this &#x00A3;600 million until March 1983, and a significant part of it would not have crossed the exchanges until even later. So the bringing forward of the amount is in itself a great benefit.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, also asked about the long term. I can tell him that my right honourable friends and their colleagues have already had bilateral discussions with the Commission and most of our partners. The Commission will shortly put forward some ideas as a basis for discussion. Now, the Community has undertaken to take decisions by the end of November, so we hope that by the time my right honourable friend the Prime Minister goes to Copenhagen in December it will be too late and the matter will not need to be raised again.<lb/>
The noble lord, Lord Cledwyn, mentioned the Siberian pipeline; and the reason it is not mentioned in the Statement is that it was not specifically raised. We hope that the United States ban will disappear on the working out of a new East/West economic policy and that such a policy will include this and facilitate it. The noble Lord also asked about Poland. This was not on the agenda at all. As for the Soviet butter sales, they will be on the agenda of the Agricultural Council and not on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Council.<lb/>
I also asked about Argentina and I can tell the House that our primary aim is to achieve the normalisation of commercial relations as quickly as
<col>506</col>
possible, which is obviously in all our interests, bilaterally and multilaterally, with the other Latin American States. Naturally, if all remaining sanctions are lifted, it will be on the clear understanding that there will be no further acts of violence in the South Atlantic. Should that not be the case, a new situation would arise to which the Community would have to react immediately&#x2014;and indeed we now know that it is well capable of doing so.<lb/>
Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, asked a question on the subject of GATT. The paper setting out the guidelines proposed by the Commission, which was broadly endorsed by the July Foreign Affairs Council, is available to the House. This will also be put in the Library. The ministerial meeting is important as a collective demonstration of political will to maintain and strengthen the open trading system at a time of recession. The United Kingdom is particularly concerned to press for a fairer balance in terms of access to markets where our exporters face unnecessary barriers.<lb/>
I thought that that concluded the answers to the questions, but I see that there was one on steel. We pressed for a substantial cutback on imports and we have good reason to believe that our Community partners will accept this, but a decision still has to be made. I would expect it at the next council or the one after; in other words, either November or December.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02103"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I also express my gratitude for what is, after all, a fairly full Statement. But may I, nevertheless, draw the Minister's attention to that part which refers to the discussion of a number of important trade issues? Would the Minister kindly give us some indication of what they were, other than those which are already referred to in the Statement? Would he also say, in particular, whether there was any discussion on matters relating to the restriction of trade?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02104"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at first blush the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, misread the Statement just as I did.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02116"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 23 to 27. It may be to the convenience of your Lordships if I speak also to Amendment No. 95 at the same time. Clause 32 clarifies Section 3 of the Bail Act 1976 by specifically requiring a magistrates' court, when committing an accused person for trial on a charge of murder, to impose as a condition of bail a requirement that he should co-operate in the preparation of reports on his mental condition. These reports are always required in murder cases so that the possibility of diminished responsibility can be properly assessed. The sort of co-operation which would be required of a person committed for trial but released on bail would, for instance, be that he should present himself to a particular doctor at a particular place for examination.<lb/>
The purpose of Amendment No. 24 is to clarify the position about the payment of the expenses of the medical practitioners who are asked to prepare the reports. It was thought that the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1973 would invariably cover where the accused is charged with murder; but, in fact, on reconsideration, it appears that there are certain limited circumstances in which it is not clear that the court has power to order payment of these expenses from central funds, and it has therefore been thought desirable to clarify matters by this amendment. The first amendment, No. 23, is a drafting amendment consequential on the second.<lb/>
With Amendments Nos. 25 to 27 we come to Part IV of the Bill, which deals with the removal of patients to and from the United Kingdom. Amendment No. 25 rectifies a defect in Clause 35 which has been identified by the Governments of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. Amendment No. 26 is a purely technical amendment. It deletes subsection (7) of Clause 35 to avoid a tautology. The purpose of the new clause which is inserted by Amendment No. 27 is to secure that a detained patient who absconds to England and Wales from the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man shall be apprehended and returned whence he came, in the same way as he would already be apprehended and returned had he absconded in England or Wales and made his journey in the opposite direction.

<title>EC: Fisheries Council Meeting</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02124">4.6 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02125"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be to the convenience of some of your Lordships, if not to others, if I were to repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in another place. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a Statement on the outcome of the meeting of the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 25th and 26th October.<lb/>
"At the meeting, I represented the United Kingdom together with my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of State in my department.<lb/>
"I am pleased to be able to report to the House that nine members of the Council reached agreement on a common fisheries policy, based upon final proposals from the Commission which included important gains for the United Kingdom.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0263"/>
<col>509</col>
In the case of Denmark, final agreement is dependent upon the approval of their Government and Parliament, which is to be sought within the next 10 days. Should that approval not be forthcoming, we and the other eight Governments of the Community expect to implement the r&#x00E9;gime as between ourselves on the basis of national measures approved by the Commission. We hope, however, that the Danish Government, who currently guard the important responsibility of the Presidency of the Community, will gain the approval of their Parliament to this common policy.<lb/>
"The Commission's final proposals showed significant improvements over the proposals I have previously reported to the House. There were increases in the total quotas for the United Kingdom in both absolute and proportionate terms. Improved quotas were obtained for North Sea cod, west coast haddock, saithe and the very important west coast herring. The Commission rejected the demands of Denmark to obtain licences in the Shetland box but the final Commission proposals made an amendment to the boundaries of the box which reduced its size by 6 per cent.<lb/>
"I think that the House should know that in the most recent year for which complete data are available, 34,000 tonnes of fish were landed by Shetland fishermen, but only 92 tonnes were caught by them in this area. The Shetlanders can, of course, continue to fish there in future. The House will know that I have always undertaken that I would only approve an agreement that has the approval of the British fishing industry. When the Commission's final proposals were made I met the leaders of the three fishing industry organisations and all three asked me to accept these final proposals.<lb/>
"The quotas that we have obtained compare favourably with even the best level of fishing in recent years and are far in excess of the average levels. On the question of access to our coastal areas, I am pleased to inform the House that we have succeeded in reducing or eradicating historic rights within our 12 mile limit in 73 per cent. of our coastline where these rights currently exist. We have in fact obtained a significant improvement not just in the post-accession position but also in the pre-accession position. We have also obtained rights in the coastal waters of other member states of critical importance to our fishermen, with particularly important rights in the coastal waters of Ireland and Heligoland.<lb/>
"On conservation, the package gives us a new r&#x00E9;gime on a permanent basis which meets our needs, including the vital Norway pout box. Our national measures will now be implemented by the Community. This will be, for the first time, backed by an effective control system based on United Kingdom proposals. It is a combination of these conservation and control measures that will secure for the British fishing industry the prospect of improvements in fish stocks instead of the decline in stocks which they have suffered in the past. An advantageous system of scrapping, modernisation and construction grants will also now be provided. If, as I hope, this agreement is approved by all 10 member countries within the next 10 days, we will have at last achieved for the fishing industry a firm
<col>510</col>
foundation for the future with an agreement that has their approval.<lb/>
"These new measures, if finally approved, will of course not operate until next January. As the House will be aware, I have been considering the current financial position of the fishing industry. Whilst I am pleased to inform the House that in the first eight months of this year there has been a 16 per cent. improvement in the industry's receipts compared with a similar period in 1981, there have also been additional costs particularly as far as fuel is concerned. I have therefore decided that it is important to provide further aid to the industry for 1982 in order to see that the industry is in a viable position to take advantage of the opportunities the common fisheries policy will provide. Aid of &#x00A3;15 million will be provided and I will be giving the details of this aid to the House at the earliest opportunity."<lb/>

It may well he that the House would like to have a debate upon the matter. I know that our Scottish Members feel strongly about it and I think that a debate should take place.<lb/>
I am sure that aid of &#x00A3;5 million will be welcomed by the industry. On the other hand, some people will think that it is not sufficient. I personally believe that it is important to get the best bargain we can.<lb/>
To return to the Commission, I hope no attempt will he made to alter anything and that it is <i>now</i> agreed that this is a final offer, though on some other occasion we may want to extend aid much further. I should like to have an answer to that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02128"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with some political reluctance I must admit that the Statement is wholly satisfactory and that the Government are to be congratulated. As the noble Earl said, it is a highly significant Statement. The most significant point is that should approval not be forthcoming by Denmark we and the other eight Governments are prepared to take national steps. I hope that the Government will stand by this agreement. Much as I love the Danes, there is no doubt that the greater than sufficiency of their industrial fishing has been more responsible for the decline of fish stocks in the North Sea than any other single factor.<lb/>
I congratulate the Government, and also the Governments of the other eight member states, for the stand which they have taken. I hope that it will not be necessary but, if it is, I think that they should push ahead. We in the Community cannot go on being hung up by one state being able to stop important measures going through because of the unanimity rule. I am also very glad that the leaders of the three fishing industry organisations have approved this settlement. It is very important that the Government should have the cooperation of the industry, and I am very glad that they have achieved it.<lb/>
Also I find it very satisfactory that we have reached agreement on conservation, and in particular that the Norwegian pout box is not to be destroyed or significantly affected. I believe that conservation

<col>511</col>
measures are at the core of any future prosperity which may be achieved. Therefore I congratulate the Government upon having achieved agreement along the lines of our own measures. I, like the noble Lord, Lord Peart, shall be interested in the form that this &#x00A3;.15 million worth of aid will take, over how long a period it is to be spread and, when we get the details, whether the industry will think that it is sufficient. Nevertheless, I welcome the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02129"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I briefly thank the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition and the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, for the welcome they have given to this Statement, even though the congratulations and satisfaction expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, were, as he said, squeezed out of him with some reluctance. However, it is a great pleasure to know that this Statement has his approval.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pearl, said that noble Lords may wish to have a debate. If they so wish, and if the matter is pursued through the usual channels, I have no doubt that a debate may be possible. Both the noble Lord, Lord Pearl, and the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, indicated that they will be interested in what form the &#x00A3;5 million of aid is to be provided. All I can suggest to both noble Lords is that they should be patient and wait to see by what method this aid will be provided. The noble Lord, Lord Peart, said that he hoped that nothing would be altered. I want to make it clear that agreement was reached with all the members of the Community, other than Denmark. Should it be the case that Denmark does not approve this (they have 10 days in which to do so) it will be up to the nine other members, including ourselves, to take national measures which will have the approval of the Commission and which will enable us, therefore, to continue what would have been a common fisheries policy, had there been the agreement of the Danes. But it does not force Denmark to do anything which it does not wish to do within its own coastal waters. I am grateful to both noble Lords for having signified their approval.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02130"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I from these Benches add my congratulations to those of other speakers to the Government on this very satisfactory outcome to a long and difficult question. I have a few specific questions which I should like to put to the noble Earl. He told us that the total quotas for the United Kingdom have been increased in both absolute and proportionate terms. Can the noble Earl tell us what those increases in fact are? At the same time, could he tell us whether there has been any alteration in the situation with regard to deep sea fishing for cod off the Newfoundland coast: whether we have any increased allowable catch in that area?<lb/>
With regard to the concessions which we have obtained&#x2014;the rights in coastal waters of other member states&#x2014;can the noble Earl tell us whether these are new concessions or whether they confirm those which we have traditionally enjoyed? Finally, with regard to the system of scrapping, modernisation and construction grants which will be provided, can the noble Earl tell us whether these will be coming from EEC or United Kingdom funds, or whether the
<col>512</col>
cost will be shared between ourselves and the Community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02131"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Walston, for agreeing that this is a satisfactory outcome. I am quite certain that it is a satisfactory outcome for both the United Kingdom and the whole of the Community. They have been protracted and very frustrating negotiations. Therefore it is a satisfactory outcome.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about the quotas. The noble Lord will realise that the quotas are a very complicated matter. They refer to individual species and individual areas. An example is that the quota for North Sea cod is 114,700 tonnes, whereas the average catch between 1973 and 1978 was under 85,000 tonnes. In that respect it is a positive improvement. I cannot give to the noble Lord the individual facts about Newfoundland cod, but I shall find out and let him know.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked whether the construction grants will be United Kingdom or Community grants. In fact, it will be a Community r&#x00E9;gime, presumably financed by the Community, probably with a contribution from the United Kingdom. However, the details have yet to be worked out. The noble Lord asked one other thing, about concessions. I am not quite certain whether he was referring to access or not; I am afraid I missed the point on which he asked the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02132"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was actually asking about access to coastal waters of other Community countries. I asked whether these were traditional concessions which had been confirmed, or whether they were new ones. I also asked about deep sea fishing off the Newfoundland coast and whether there was any alteration there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02133"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lord, I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Walston, on that last point. The concessions over access are in fact real concessions because in 73 per cent. of the coastal band&#x2014;that is, the 6 to 12 mile ribbon&#x2014;the historical rights have either been expunged altogether or have been reduced considerably. So in fact there is a substantial improvement on that which existed even before we got into the Community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02134"><member>Lord Home of the Hirsel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend the Minister and my right honourable friend Mr. Buchanan-Smith have both showed great patience, tenacity and skill over many years and it is very satisfactory that they have been able to come to this conclusion. The best part of this agreement almost is the conservation side. There has been anxiety in Scotland amongst Scottish fishermen for the future of the fishing industry and this will give them some reassurance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02135"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that. I am quite certain he is right and that there was a time when all fishermen were very anxious about what was going to happen to the supply of fish in the future, but I believe that the conservation arrangements now will protect this.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0265"/>
<col>513</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02136"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we must be grateful to the noble Earl the Minister for giving us this information. It is important that we get a settlement here, because until we do we will not be able to plan ahead in respect of the size, and the support needed to obtain that size, of the fishing industry. It has gone on far too long. I would like to wait and see the exact details of this matter before I join with the praises. I notice that the <i>Financial Times</i> says that we have achieved this by means of concessions and that they are concessions largely by Britain. I want to see what the concessions are in Scotland. I know that the reduction in the size of the Orkney/Shetland conservation box will not give great pleasure there. And the fact that even with what has been done in that area, the licensing of seven Danish boats which never fished there before does not bring great pleasure to that particular part of the world.<lb/>
Are we not in danger of getting excited and of approving increased quotas when it may well be that these increased quotas we are granting may impinge upon our conservation? Will the noble Earl look at this again and let us know how exactly this &#x00A3;15 million is to be spent? When the noble Earl says that the fishing industry agreed to this, was it grudging agreement? I read in <i>The Scotsman</i> today a statement by a Scottish representative that the agreement "caused us heartache and misery". That is not exactly considerable praise for what has been achieved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02137"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, that was a remarkably disappointing contribution after many years of negotiation. He knows perfectly well, of course, that when one negotiates one takes one's own interests into account: that in this case there were nine other countries taking their interests into account, and it has been very difficult to reach an agreement. But there has been an agreement which has had the approval of all the sea fishing organisations. When the noble Lord said that they would be disappointed at the reduction in the Shetland box, that is perfectly true. One small area of the Shetland box has been reduced, but the Statement explained that out of all the 34,000 tonnes of fish landed, only 92 tonnes came from that particular part which has now been excluded. I do not think that the Shetland fishermen have a great deal to worry about because, apart from anything else, they can still go and fish there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02138"><member>Lord Glenkinglas</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend bear in mind that having been on both sides of these debates&#x2014;the Government side and the fishing side&#x2014;I think that the fact that all the fishermen have now agreed is a very clear sign that the negotiations have been successful? The fishermen are not slow in saying quite firmly, when they do not like something, exactly what it is that they do not like. I congratulate my noble friend very much indeed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02139"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his remarks. It is perfectly true that the fishermen never had any hesitation in saying when they did not like something, as my right honourable friend knows only too well. The fact that they have now been able to agree this arrangement is a significant advance.</membercontribution></p>
<col>514</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02140"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has referred to "fishermen". Is he talking about the employers or about the employees?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02141"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, was asking what I meant when I referred to "fishermen"; I was referring to the three fishing organisations, which are the British Fishing Federation, the National Fishermen's Federation and the Scottish Fishing Federation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02142"><member>Lord Boothby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who, for over thirty years, has been in the forefront of this battle to save the inshore fishing industry from destruction, I must confess to the noble Earl that I never thought that I would live to see this day. I am quite satisfied that it is really a day of triumph and I do wish to congratulate not only the noble Earl, the present Minister, but also successive Ministers for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and Secretaries of State for Scotland, two of whom we have had intervening this afternoon, on the long patience, courage and resilience which they have shown in achieving what I believe to be the best possible result we could have obtained and the best fisheries agreement we have ever had.<lb/>
With regard to the attitude of the fishermen, I may tell the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, that I think <i>The Scotsman</i> was talking absolute rubbish, and not for the first time. I rang up Scotland this morning to ask them about this as soon as I heard the news, and I was told that they were very satisfied and never thought that they would get it so good. I would just like to end by thanking God that I have lived to see this day, and to express hearty congratulations to all those concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02143"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02144"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the words of the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, are very important because he has been deeply involved in the fishing industry. He has known its difficulties and frustrations and the difficulties of these negotiations. The fact that he should find this a cause for a success&#x2014;and he called it a triumph&#x2014;will give great encouragement to my right honourable friend. The noble Lord was quite right when he referred to the patience not only of my right honourable friend but also of his predecessors, and I believe that he would extend that sentiment to the Ministers responsible for fisheries in other states of the Community, because they too have had their difficulties. It is a satisfactory outcome and I am deeply appreciative of the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, for having said so in such fulsome terms.<lb/>
When the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, turned to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, and said that <i>The Scotsman</i> was talking rubbish, I was not quite certain whether he was referring to the newspaper or not, but I am sure that he was: the direction he faced gave me cause to doubt it!</membercontribution></p>

I believe, however, that your Lordships will be particularly pleased to see Amendment No. 29, which extends the range of options open to a mental health review tribunal when considering a case. This was a matter raised by your Lordships both in Committee and on Report. Your Lordships may recall that we had intended to provide for this extension by means of the tribunal rules made by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, but so as to make our intentions absolutely clear to both Houses we have agreed instead to provide for this extension on the face of the Bill itself. I hope your Lordships likewise will be persuaded of the merits of this proposal.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02156"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would welcome these amendments, because they go a long way to ease the minds of a lot of people on this issue. There is one point I want to raise, and this is the only place I can raise it. The Government in their very generous allocation of notes on possible amendments
<col>516</col>
referred to legal aid. I pressed this very strongly when the Bill was going through its various stages in the House. The Government say that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has announced his intention of making regulations under the Legal Aid Act 1974 to provide legal assistance by way of representation of patients. That is excellent news, of course. The only question I have is: when is this likely to take place? Will it more or less coincide with the coming into force of the Act? This is quite an important point of principle. That is the only question I have; otherwise I welcome the amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02157"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I was one of those who pressed rather hard for legal aid in these cases, I, too, would like to acknowledge what the Lord Chancellor has done. I think the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is one in respect of which we are entitled to an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02158"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I also add my support to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, as we, too, have been strongly in favour of legal aid for representation of patients before mental health review tribunals. I was very glad to learn from the Standing Committee proceedings of 22nd April in another place of the noble and learned Lord's proposal to bring forward regulations under Section 2A(3) of the Legal Aid Act 1974 as soon as possible. In evidence on that day the representative of the Lord Chancellor's office said that the Lord Chancellor hoped to bring forward regulations in the late summer or early autumn when the necessary consultations are complete.<lb/>
As this is particularly important in view of the clauses now in this Bill providing increased access to tribunals&#x2014;the tribunals will have a great many more applications&#x2014;could I press the Government to tell us how far these consultations have got and whether the new machinery will be in position by the time the Act comes into force?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02159"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe I can satisfy your Lordships on this point. The advice I have is that regulations are being prepared and will come into force within the next few months. I deduce from that, although I do not have it in black and white, that the consultations are complete, and that it is now simply a matter of completing the necessary administrative arrangements. I would certainly hope that the regulations will be in force by the time the Act comes into force.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02187"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we now come to a topic and a block of amendments through which we shall have to pick our way with care, particularly through the procedural niceties of an amendment which my noble friend Lord Mottistone proposes to move in respect of one of the Commons amendments. I will, with your Lordships' permission, move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 34 to 40A <i>en bloc</i>. We can then deal with Amendment No. 41 and its amendment separately, and then I can return to the remainder of the block.<lb/>
The issues concerning consent to treatment have been debated extensively in this House and in the other place. I should like to mention four aspects of the changes which have been made. First, multidisciplinary consultation; the Government have honoured the commitment that my noble friend Lord Elton gave to your Lordships at Third Reading to provide for three people, of whom only one is a doctor, to confirm that a patient has given informed consent to certain very exceptional treatments for mental disorder which need very particular safeguards. We intend that those safeguards should apply to psycho-surgery and hormonal implants but not to electro-convulsive therapy. I think there was agreement in the earlier debates in your Lordships' House that those were the particular treatments to cover. These are the forms of treatment set out in Amendment No. 35 which are so serious that the consent of the patient and a second opinion are required. That amendment, and the next also, provide for a different form of multi-disciplinary consultation. The independent psychiatrist who decides whether or not the treatment should be given must first consult a nurse and another health professional who have been caring for the patient.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mottistone, incidentally, wrote to ask me who the other persons would be. In the case of Amendment No. 35(2), they would be persons appointed by the Mental Health Act Commission; in most cases they will be members of the Commission. They will be persons with some experience of mental
<col>520</col>
disorder who will have the special responsibility of confirming whether the patient has given informed consent to a treatment of special concern. There are also references in Amendments Nos. 35(3) and 36(4) to other persons who have been professionally concerned with the patient's medical treatment. One of those will be a nurse and the other may be a psychologist, occupational therapist or other professional who has been working as one of the clinical team who care for the patient. I hope, therefore. I have been able to reassure my noble friend on that particular point.<lb/>
The second point I would like to mention is the change in the treatments covered, with a flexible approach, since different safeguards are provided for different sorts of treatment. In the most serious category of extreme treatments for mental disorder, where consent and a second opinion are required, the amendments put psycho-surgery on the face of the Bill and provide for other treatments&#x2014;for example, certain hormone implants&#x2014;to be specified in regulations.<lb/>
In the next category, where the patient's consent or a second opinion is required, the provisions no longer apply to all surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures and drugs but only to any that are specified in regulations and to prolonged drug treatment, ECT has been removed from the face of the Bill but will be listed in regulations as a treatment for which consent or a second opinion is needed.<lb/>
I hope I can answer another point raised by my noble friend Lord Mottistone on this. Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 provide for regulations to be made after consultation with such bodies as appear to the Secretary of State to be concerned. My noble friend wished to ensure that medical advice was obtained. I assure my noble friend and your Lordships that there is no possibility of regulations being made on such vital questions of medical practice without consulting the medical profession, including, of course, the Royal College of Psychiatrists: they are very clearly concerned bodies.<lb/>
The third change, Amendment No. 39, is an extra role for the Mental Health Act Commission. The commission will receive regular reports on treatment given to detained patients which has been authorised by a second opinion. Those were the observations I wanted to make on the amendments up to and including Amendment No. 40A. I hope that your Lordships will agree to them. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendments.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Trefgarne</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02188"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have come to the most important group of amendments among all the many amendments that the other place has made to the Bill. Therefore. I hope that it will not be considered inappropriate to make one or two comments before my noble friend Lord Mottistone moves his amendment, as I assume he will be doing. It was clear from our proceedings in Committee and on Report that this was a very difficult matter indeed. As one who takes some interest in legislation I did not envy the Government having to replace the one clause that they had and try to find something which would as near as possible meet all the many opinions that we had, including those of eminent professional men in this House.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0269"/>
<col>521</col>
However, the Government have done it very effectively. They have gone into rather more elaborate detail than one would have wished or thought necessary. But for the power to make regulations, which occurs three times in these new clauses, the detail would have been even greater. Indeed, we have to face the fact that much will depend on what is in the regulations. I do not complain about that. I do not believe that the Government could reasonably have put much of what will have to be in the regulations as an addition to the new clauses. Not only would it have made them even longer and more elaborate but it would have meant going into clinical data which, as scientific progress takes place, change from time to time. It is much easier to lay amending regulations, where necessary, than to make amendments to a Bill of this kind after it becomes an Act. Therefore, I repeat that in my opinion the Government have got this about right. Obviously this is a matter on which opinions can differ on matters of detail. But on balance I think the Government are to he congratulated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02189"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join in underlining the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton. This is indeed a very important part of the Bill. These are the most important amendments from the other place with which we have to deal. It will also be remembered that this particular part of the Bill was the part that occupied our time in your Lordships' House perhaps for longer than any other part of the Bill<lb/>
I should like at the outset to say that I, too, give my personal thanks to the Government for the steps they have taken in order to try to put into the legislation the wishes that were so clearly expressed in all parts of the House in our earlier proceedings. I should also like to pay tribute to those responsible, particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, who played a prominent part in fulfilling an undertaking made I believe, in part in response to an amendment that I moved in your Lordships' House on Third Reading, and we then had to wait to see what happened in another place. Having seen what happened I think the Government have done as well as could be expected.<lb/>
That having been said, I hope I shall have the indulgence of your Lordships' House if on this group of important amendments I take a little longer than I would wish to do at this stage of the Bill. Perhaps I shall be more likely to receive that indulgence if I give an undertaking to be extremely restrained on later amendments. Perhaps it will be understood that these are complex matters and there are one or two aspects on which it would be helpful if the Minister could give an explanation before we leave these matters as a whole.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Renton, has underlined and emphasised the importance of the regulations which are later to be laid with regard to all these new clauses of the Bill. That, of course, is quite fundamental. May I first ask whether the noble Lord is in a position to inform us whether or not your Lordships' House will have an opportunity of debating these regulations when they come to be laid?<lb/>
I notice that the noble Lord, in introducing these amendments, referred to the consultations that will take place. They were referred to in the proceedings in another place. I welcome the assurance given now by
<col>522</col>
the noble Lord that certainly the Royal College of Psychiatrists will be consulted and that professional opinion will be adequately consulted. But in earlier proceedings in another place the Minister for Health gave a fairly welcome assurance that in addition there will he consultations with certain lay bodies, and perhaps voluntary societies and associations which have a very important role to play, and even the community health councils. Perhaps the noble Lord is in a position to confirm the undertaking that there will be consultation in addition to the necessary consultation with professional bodies and certain lay bodies.<lb/>
Moving to Amendment No. 36, may I briefly ventilate my anxiety regarding the phrasing in subsection 3(<i>a</i>) of the new clause. We have the words:
<quote>"certified in writing that the patient is capable of understanding its nature".</quote>
Some of us made clear in earlier stages of the Bill that we preferred the words to be,
<quote>"the patient understands"</quote>
rather than,
<quote>"is capable of understanding".</quote>
There is a difference there. Perhaps I can say that I think I am capable of understanding nuclear physics. I do not actually understand them and perhaps the fault is mine. It is likely that a patient who is capable of understanding does not in fact understand the matters that we are talking about, possibly because his attention has not been properly directed or because of shortcomings in the explanation given to him. Perhaps the noble Lord will say a little more about what he thinks is meant by the phrase:
<quote>"is capable of understanding".</quote>
Does he really mean that at the end of the day everything possible will he done to ensure that the patient does understand?<lb/>
I move briefly to my third and final point which arises in Amendment No. 40. I refer to the definitions of "irreversible" and "hazardous". Subsection (3) in the new clause states:
<quote>"For the purposes of this section treatment is irreversible if it has unfavourable irreversible physical or psychological consequences and hazardous if it entails significant physical hazard".</quote>
There appears to me to he some significance about the omission of the word "psychological" in the second definition. The first definition refers to,
<quote>"unfavourable irreversible physical or psychological consequences".</quote>
The second definition refers to,
<quote>"hazardous if it entails significant physical hazard".</quote>
I was wondering whether the juxtaposition of those two definitions might lead the courts to assume, if they have to interpret this clause, that the omission of the word "psychological" in the second definition and its inclusion in the first definition means that "psychological hazard", if there is such a thing and I think it is possible that there could be, should be regarded as deliberately excluded from that definition. I am sorry to have wearied the House, but this is an important part of the new clauses and it is important that your Lordships' House fully understands and that explanations are given where possible. I hope that the noble Lord will be able to give me information on those points.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02190">4.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02191"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be very brief. The Government's new package is certainly an improvement in our view, on old Clause 41. It is an improvement in presentation and an improvement in the organisation of material. Frankly, the old Clause 41 had turned into a self-defeating maze. The subject is of such importance as to warrant a whole section rather than one labyrinthine clause under the heading "Miscellaneous and Supplementary" which came after "After Care" and "Correspondence of Patients". So far so good. However, I must enter one reservation.<lb/>
Having decided on a new approach to presentation and arrangement of the material, it seems to me a pity that the Government did not take the opportunity of reviewing the whole principle behind this section. The new package simply reaffirms the approach taken in old Clause 41&#x2014;that consent to treatment is not required except in certain circumstances. A great opportunity has, therefore, been missed to reaffirm the basic common law principle that consent is required before treatment can be given and then to proceed to the derogations from that principle that can obtain in certain exceptional cases.<lb/>
The Government start from the principle that consent shall not be required except in certain circumstances. I still believe that, in fact, it is the wrong approach. It is clear that it is far from easy to balance the civil liberties of the subject with the natural concern of professional bodies for those in charge of patients' treatment. I accept that. But I believe that the same objects could have been achieved while maintaining the common law principle in all its august glory and then proceeding to the derogations from that principle. That said, of course, I personally welcome the very considerable move towards multi-disciplinary confirmation of capacity to consent, which was first raised in your Lordships' House. I consider that that is very much to be welcomed.<lb/>
Another point is that the Mental Health Act Commission, which we shall be coming on to shortly, which remained somewhat under wraps while it was in your Lordships' House, has emerged with more teeth and, therefore, we must hope that the combination of the Mental Health Act Commission and a proper scrutiny of the regulations will, in fact, produce a smooth working of the new package that the Government have produced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02192"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to add my words of welcome to these new amendments. I should like to ask my noble friend the Minister whether he will see to it, either through regulations or through whatever other means the Minister has, that speed of decision is made possible within these regulations. I am informed by several psychiatrists that they worry that if they have to ask for several people to give their consent, even perhaps outside the hospital&#x2014;as I think the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, suggested&#x2014;the speed of the decision might be slowed down. I understand from the people who have spoken to me that speed is very often of the essence. I hope that that will be made quite plain when the regulations are laid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02193"><member>Lord Taylor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord used the term "prolonged drug treatment". In my experience
<col>524</col>
that would cover almost the whole of psychiatric treatment. Is that the intention of his phrase?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02194"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend answers that point, I should like to be clear on one or two points. Under Amendment No. 34, Subseciton (1)(<i>c</i>) if a voluntary patient discharges himself and then later is brought back as a statutory patient, do the same rules apply? A number of doctors would prefer never to have any of these arrangements applied to voluntary patients. Do I take it that this only applies to statutorily detained patients?<lb/>
Secondly, we have always assumed that a patient does not want treatment and that he must be safeguarded against being given it if he does not want it. What is the position if a patient wants a certain type of treatment and there is a division of opinion among the other people who are advising on the case?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02195"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall deal first with the points raised by my noble friend Lady Faithfull and then I shall come to the others. As regards the position of the patient who seeks a certain kind of treatment&#x2014;one of the kinds of treatment that will be covered by these amended provisions&#x2014;if the second medical opinion does not agree that the treatment would be given, then it will not be given. All of these treatments require the consent of the patient&#x2014;that is, the main body of the treatments.<lb/>
The second point that my noble friend raised was the question of the application to detained patients and to voluntary patients. I hope that my noble friend will forgive me if I delay answering that point for a moment which, frankly, lies at the very heart of the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Mottistone. If my noble friend Lady Faithful] agrees, we can deal with that point perhaps at better length in a moment.<lb/>
The noble Lord from the Cross Benches raised the question of prolonged drug treatment. We mean, for example, drug treatments beyond a period of, say, three months, which is provided for in Subsection 1(<i>b</i>) of Amendment No. 36. My noble friend Lady MacLeod of Borve asked about the speed at which decisions would be taken. The Mental Health Act Commission will get a second opinion quickly when it is clinically necessary&#x2014;certainly within a day or so. There is in any event an exemption for treatment which is immediately necessary as provided for in Amendment No. 40. The noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, referred to the order of priorities as he saw it. He would have preferred a different supposition to start with I think. But we decided to do it the other way and I think that it is defensible. We start with the greatest safeguards at the beginning of the series of amendments and then move finally to Amendment No. 40A where there is clear legal authority for treatments which are not elsewhere covered.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, asked about a debate on the regulations in Parliament. They will be subject to the negative resolution procedure and so there will most certainly be an opportunity for your Lordships to debate these regualations if your Lordships so choose. As for consultation with bodies other than the particular medical bodies to which I referred, yes, certainly I confirm the undertaking given by my honourable friend in the other place.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0271"/>
<col>525</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, also asked about a patient's capability of understanding. I want to emphasise that the patient does have to consent. That means in law that he has the information and understands it, otherwise it is not a real consent. I hope that that covers the points which noble Lords have raised.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>Britoil: Privatisation</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02197">4.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02198"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (The Earl of Mansfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy is making in another place. The Statement reads as follows:
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a Statement about the privatisation of Britoil.<lb/>
"Almost exactly a year ago, I told the House that I hoped to transfer the entire oil-producing business of the British National Oil Corporation to the private sector this year.<lb/>
"These plans were set out in full and debated at length during the passage of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act. That Act is now on the statute book. Britoil has been set up as a BNOC subsidiary, and the oil-producing business has been transferred to it. As from next Monday, shares in Britoil will be directly owned by the Government.<lb/>
"The way will thus soon be clear for an underwritten Offer for Sale of 51 per cent. of the shares in the company. Subject to market conditions, I intend the flotation to take place next month.<lb/>
"The choice between a conventional fixed price offer and a tender must he made nearer the time. I will inform the House, as I have undertaken to do. If the sale is by tender, consideration will be given to the inclusion of special arrangements for small investors to buy shares at the striking price, without having to bid a specific price in advance. In either case, payment for the shares will be in two instalments, spread over a period of several months.<lb/>
"The offer will also include special arrangements to encourage small investors not only to participate but also to retain a long-term interest in the company.<lb/>
"Finally, arrangements will be made to encourage Britoil's own employees to take a stake in their company. BNOC employees, too, will enjoy the right to make preferential applications for Britoil shares.<lb/>
"Mr. Speaker, as the House knows, the privatisation of Britoil will in no way affect the system of participation agreements, which will remain in place, under 100 per cent. Government control, as a means of safeguarding our national security of supply. But what it will do is enable the people of Britain to take a direct personal stake in the North Sea. It will create an independent British oil company free to seize the opportunities open to it. And it will substantially reduce the size of the public sector in an area where state ownership has no rational justification whatsoever."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<col>526</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02199"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we are grateful to the noble Earl the Minister for reading the Statement which has been given in another place. I should like to put a few questions to the Minister. After all the stages of the Bill he will, of course, be aware that we have very strong views on this side of the House that such vital and successful national assets should not be sold. But is the noble Earl aware that even among those who agree to the sale there is deep concern because, although the Secretary of State says that he will sell subject to market conditions in November, there is a feeling that he is determined to sell this year regardless of the consequences? This view has been made a number of times in the responsible sections of the press. Will the noble Earl assure the House that he will be flexible on this in view of possible changing circumstances?<lb/>
In view of the fact that Britoil is a great public asset which has substantially helped the Treasury, does the noble Earl expect such help to continue after privatisation takes place, or are the public to be deprived of this assistance? Does the Minister consider that although he is seemingly facilitating the sale with payments for shares in two instalments, there could yet be the possibility of immediate profits for buyers? The House will, of course, remember the experience of Amersham International, where very quick gains were made from the sales of public assets. Of course, since then there has been the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which, in paragraph 27, says:
<quote>"We recommend that they"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the Treasury&#x2014;
<quote>"With departments should re-examine carefully what steps could he taken in any future sales to minimise the risk of further large profits being made at the taxpayer's expense".</quote>
Very briefly, in the next paragraph, paragraph 28, the Committee say:
<quote>"We are concerned that in the course of this re-examination the Treasury should look again at the practice of underwriting such sales".</quote>
This is another case of underwriting. Does the Minister expect to spend any public money to prepare Britoil for privatisation? Finally, how do the Government hope to make it possible to achieve the aim to sell widely to small investors? On these important issues I am sure that the House will hope that the Secretary of State will keep Parliament informed on future proposals in this so-called "sale of the century".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02200"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we too wish to thank the noble Lord the Minister for giving us this Statement, which was made in another place. I think that the Statement shows all the problems of a Government that wish to make a commercial business proposition for political reasons; the point taken up by the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, about "subject to market conditions" is one on which I should like clarification. As the noble Earl is aware, the oil sector of the share market relative to the <i>Financial Times</i> index is at the lowest that it has been for seven years. Would he say quite clearly that these are market conditions in which Britoil should be launched&#x2014;in other words, these are conditions in which it should be launched at this moment? If those conditions prevail, will he therefore delay the flotation until at least the oil sector relative to the <i>Financial Times</i> index is higher than its all-time low at the present time?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0272"/>
<col>527</col>
The question of Amersham has been raised. Perhaps the Government are suffering from their embarrassing success in that quotation. Given the poor market conditions at the moment, are they not over-reacting by making sure of an embarrassing failure with the Britoil shares? Therefore, would the noble Earl say that the underwriters, who had a very easy time with Amersham International, should be the same underwriters, who may not have quite such an easy time with the underwriting of Britoil? I think that they would at least balance out some of the criticisms that have been made.<lb/>
I welcome the point made in the Statement about small investors. This is very important and was overlooked during the Amersham sale. The suggestion of partly paid shares is perhaps the only way by which Britoil will ever be launched. There will be very serious capital gains tax worries for the small investor about participation because of the complexity of a partly paid share and the lapse of several months, as is mentioned in the Statement. He may not wish to take up the shares and, therefore, there is the possibility of capital gains tax worries. I hope that these will be clarified nearer the time.<lb/>
Will the noble Earl also clarify another point which looks like departmental jargonese for what is a convertible debenture? The only way in which a small investor can participate in a company and also retain a long-term interest in a company is to own a convertible debenture. If that is the case, perhaps the noble Earl would say so and help us all to know what he means by this particular statement. I think that we should welcome what the noble Earl said about employee participation, which is something about which we on these Benches are particularly enthusiastic.<lb/>
Finally&#x2014;and this is perhaps the most worrying part of the Statement&#x2014;the Statement goes as far as to say that this flotation will:
<quote>"enable the people of Britain to take a direct personal stake in the North Sea".</quote>
This statement runs completely contrary to statements by the chairman of Britoil who says that it is the avowed intention of Britoil to invest overseas in opportunities as and when they arise. Can the noble Earl make this abundantly clear, because if that is true, this is a misleading statement. When the prospectus is printed I believe that any person who wishes to participate in Britoil must know whether it will be British exploration and exploitation or whether it is to be a global oil company with global aspirations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02201"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I could respond first to both noble Lords. Of course, I welcome the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston. If he goes down oft trod and well-known paths, who are we to stop him, even when he reads out chunks from the report of the Public Accounts Committee? His first question to me concerned Amersham. The proceeds of the sale at 10 times the original investment were an excellent return on the taxpayers' money. That should not be forgotten. Perhaps I could respond to the stagging points of both the noble Lord and the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw. There will be a number of arrangements to discourage stagging. For instance, we will be reserving the right to
<col>528</col>
cash cheques on receipt. As I have said, we shall also be encouraging small investors not only to participate but also to retain a long-term interest in the company.<lb/>
Both noble Lords then took up the point as to the state of the Stock Market at the time of the issue of the prospectus. As my right honourable friend has been at pains to point out, the Government's aim is for the flotation to take place next month. But this, of course, must be dependent on market conditions. My right honourable friend no doubt will watch conditions closely. He will take advice, and no decision to go ahead will be taken until the time is right. I have no doubt that the investing public will take a long-term view of Britoil and the opportunities open to it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, asks me about the identity of the underwriters, and I do not suppose that he will be altogether surprised if I tell him that I do not propose to tell him. The other matters which he and the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, raised are all matters which w ill be contained in the prospectus, and I obviously am not in a position this afternoon to tell your Lordships about that, and noble Lords will therefore have to wait, I fear, until the prospectus comes out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02202"><member>Lord Whaddon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I also thank the noble Earl for his Statement. He will no doubt recall the doubts expressed from this Bench regarding the creation of yet another political football for party political reasons. Can he recall the assurance of the Government at the time that there would be a valuation of the assets of Britoil by consultants? We were assured that this was normal procedure. Perhaps he will recall the suggestion made also at the time from this Bench that reassurance might be given to the public that they were getting value for money in privatisation by an assurance from the Government that the shares would not he sold below such valuation. Is he in a position to give that assurance to the House today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02203"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, valuation of Britoil assets is an extremely complicated and indeed complex matter, and there are several factors to be taken into account, and the actual valuation itself can be approached in a number of different ways. These have been considered by the Government. I am not prepared to place what would only be an academic estimate on the value of Britoil. It will be for the market eventually to place a value on the shares.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COMMONS AMENDMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02206"><b>41</b> After Clause 38, insert the following new clause:
<quote>"<i>Extension of section [Treatment requiring consent and a second opinion] and related provisions to voluntary patients</i></quote>
<quote>Sections [<i>Treatment requiring consent and a second opinion], [Plans of treatment]. Withdrawal of consent</i>] and [<i>Urgent treatment</i>] shall apply to any patient who is not liable to be detained under the principal Act or this Act.".</quote></p>

Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Trefgarne</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02208"><member>Lord Mottistone</member> moved Amendment No. 41 A as an amendment to Amendment No. 41:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02209"><b>41A</b> After ("[<i>Treatment requiring consent and a second opinion</i>]") insert ("(except subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) thereof)").</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02210">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that Amendment No. 41A be agreed to. I should perhaps at the outset tell your Lordships that I am advised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists who are firmly opposed to Amendment No. 41, and I understand that that amendment also gives deep concern to the Joint Consultants Committee; so there is a strength of medical feeling behind this amendment that needs to be taken seriously by your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02211">My honourable friend the Minister for Health in speaking in another place&#x2014;and this is recorded on 18th October in the <i>Official Report</i> at column 80&#x2014;made clear that the House was taking a fairly drastic step, and it was, it was taking a very drastic step. It is somewhat surprising for the Government to take such a drastic step at a very late stage in any Bill where there has not really been full opportunity for consultation, not only in your Lordships' House on receiving that amendment within days of it suddenly appearing, but also consultation with interested bodies such as the two eminent medical bodies to which I referred, and indeed many others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02212">Having made that statement my honourable friend the Minister for Health acknowledged that the proposals on consent for treatment were originally intended only to refer to detained patients, on the basis that because such patients were detained and had lost their civil liberties they required protection against treatments being administered without their consent. Nobody would object to that. It makes sense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02213">The other point that perhaps may be made in advance is that the importance of the issue is not really related to psycho-surgery operations because much of what is proposed is already good clinical practice. But it is important in relation to, as described in Amendment No. 35,
<quote>"such other forms of treatment as may be specified, by the Secretary of State."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02214">It is that subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of Amendment No. 35 that I seek to have removed from the overall provision of Amendment 41.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02215">To clarify, if we can, what such other treatments are, my noble friend in talking earlier about this group of amendments gave a point to it, but again in column 80 of <i>Hansard</i> of the other place of 18th October the Minister said:
<quote>"It is designed to apply to the most serious treatments, including psycho-surgery. It will also apply to the most serious treatments that are irreversible or drastic, such as certain hormone treatments."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02216">Thus there is a variety of views on which other treatments should apply, and yet it has been agreed in another place to extend the proposals to voluntary persons before any consultations have taken place with the medical profession.</p>
<col>530</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02217">In effect, the legislation as it stands says that certain forms of treatment, though no one knows which other than psychosurgery, may not be given to patients who want those treatments without their having to suffer the rigmarole of having their personal details discussed by at least several other people, most of them not doctors, and some of whom they will in all likelihood have never met before. When I say "the legislation as it stands," I mean the legislation as it stands if the amendment is accepted and my amendment to the amendment is not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02218">There are other points, and I am delighted to see my noble friend Lady Trumpington in her place because she will be taking some of them for me, and perhaps I might move on to what I think is the concluding argument. The final point is that the extension to informal patients of the provisions of Amendment No. 41 undermines one of the most basic principles of our most imaginative 1959 Mental Health Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02219">That Act put into law the recommendations of the Percy Commission on the Law Relating to Mental Illness and Mental Deficiency and which sat from 1954 to 1957 considering every aspect of mental health legislation. One of its most enlightened and progressive principles was that as far as possible a patient with mental disorder should be treated in the same way as a patient with a physical disorder. Hence their proposal to remove certification, which was seen as a bar to enabling the patient to receive the treatment he needed and wanted. The psychiatric profession has responded to the spirit of the 1959 act to the extent that 95 per cent. of patients in psychiatric hospitals are now voluntary patients. However, I suggest that Amendment No. 41 is putting voluntary patients in the same category as detained patients in a most important respect and is thus tending to reverse the enlightened advances of the 1959 Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02220">I implore your Lordships to consider this as being a matter of the highest importance. Enough time for discussion in another place was not accorded to it&#x2014;it came on right at the end, there being only five Members in the Chamber when the amendment was accepted by the Government; and it has now come to us and we have had to rush to deal with it. I have been writing letters in my own hand to the Minister to get them to him in time so that he may have an appreciation of this most fundamental issue. It has not been discussed with the medical profession and it brings in a totally new picture. As I pointed our earlier, the Minister for Health said it was a drastic step, and it surely was.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02221">I hope my noble friend the Minister will say to himself, "I know I have been advised to reject this", as I am sure he has, "hut I will not do that. I shall be strong and say that it is not really good enough", and at least, with that sort of background, there will be time for the matter to go back to another place before Prorogation at teatime tomorrow. It would be sensible for the Minister to accept my amendment, and I hope your Lordships will find it possible to give me every support, in speeches and in other ways should that become necessary. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02222">Moved, That this House doth agree to the amendment to the amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Mottistone</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02223"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: I must admit, my Lords, that Amendment No. 41 from another place, as it
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0274"/>
<col>531</col>
stands, leaves me a little uneasy. The argument, should it be used, that voluntary patients may become involuntary because of their conduct or would try' to leave hospital would, I believe, be a thin one. If there are such patients, they are certainly not the same ones who ask for psycho-surgery. If such a voluntary patient is detained, the Bill as it stands would preclude giving such treatment without his consent. It was said that the voluntary patient needed protection, but from what? If he does not want that form of treatment, he cannot be given it.<lb/>
A further argument, which is perhaps the most basic, is that the inclusion of consent to treatment legislation for voluntary patients strikes at the very basis of doctor-patient relationships. Of course, where the patient is compulsorily detained there must be safeguards to protect his rights. But if he has a doctor of his own choosing and he accepts his doctor's advice that a certain form of treatment would be beneficial, I believe most people would take the view that he has the right be receive that treatment without interference by the state.<lb/>
The enactment of this new provision would be a dramatic departure from that basic human right. The doctor who recommends or carries out medical treatment is bound by professional ethics and is accountable to a statutory body, the General Medical Council. He is bound to adhere to what is accepted as normal clinical practice which, in the case of psycho-surgery, includes most of the provisions which it is sought to put into law. I look to the Minister to put my mind and that of my noble friend Lord Mottistone at ease on these and other points.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02224"><member>Lord Hill of Luton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, has raised some very important issues. This House welcomed earlier today the detailed protection for the certified patient in respect of the issue for his or her consent, and that protection is absolutely right. But for a voluntary patient, such a patient might just as well, in many conditions, go to the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in Queen's Square or the neurological department of any teaching hospital or other hospital, where this proviso would not obtain. It really is illogical, it seems to me, to bring normal people into the same category as certified people for the purpose of this testing of the power to consent.<lb/>
I know, of course, that there will be marginal cases. I know there will be voluntary patients who are seriously ill, as seriously ill as some who are certified. But, by and large, the contrast is between the seriously mentally ill and the normal person, at least not so suffering from mental disease as to justify certification.<lb/>
Your Lordships may think that it is an unreasonable fear that has been expressed through the noble Lord by the Royal College of Psychologists and others, but it must be remembered that although the specific reference today is to certain forms of treatment&#x2014;psycho-surgery on the one hand and prolonged hormone treatment on the other&#x2014;the Minister has the power to extend that list in the future. We in your Lordships' House know how wise and sensible Minister's always are, but that is not so widely understood outside and there is a real fear that this extension of power may go beyond the very serious
<col>532</col>
conditions in which it is confined at the moment.<lb/>
I hope, therefore, that the Government will withdraw their amendment. That, I believe, would be the easiest way of giving satisfaction in terms of the amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone. I did not realise, until Lord Mottistone pointed it out, that the matter came on in another place late when there were only five Members in the Chamber. There was one speech moving the amendment as expressed in Amendment No. 41 here and the Minister immediately rose and accepted it.<lb/>
It does not make sense&#x2014;wise though the provision is for those who are certified&#x2014;to extend that to those who are not certified but voluntarily go into hospital: to extend that compulsion of the second opinion. It is not surprising, difficult though some may find it to believe, that there are some members of the medical profession and some important medical organisations who believe that it is the thin end of a wedge that will tend to make the requirement of a second opinion extend to other fields and, as is now proposed, to the field of mental disease. I urge the Minister to look again at the matter.<lb/>
The Royal College of Psychiatrists have played an immensely useful part throughout the Bill in consultation and have done their best at the various stages to offer advice. They were not consulted when the Government decided in another place to accept the amendment, and they have not been consulted since. I hope this will be seen in terms of the attitude of the medical profession and its desire for clinical freedom, which I believe to be in the public interest. It is dangerous, in their eyes and in mine, to extend this important decision in relation to the certified to the uncertified and probably the uncertifiable, the voluntary patient who goes into hospital.<lb/>
So I would support what the noble Lord has said, and ask the Minister to think again. It would be a great pity if at this last minute the amendment is passed, is introduced into the Bill, when it is inescapable that it cannot he further discussed or removed. I hope that he will not proceed with the amendment, bearing in mind the views of important sections of the medical profession, and I believe the generally wise view that what is appropriate for the certified patient is not appropriate for the uncertified, the voluntary patient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02225">5.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02226"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to put another point of view in supporting my noble friend Lord Mottistone. Earlier in the debate this afternoon my noble friend the Minister spoke of the greater involvement of social workers in carrying out work under the Bill. I have had many patients who refused to go into hospital on a voluntary basis. They fell into the category of the grey area&#x2014;they could be voluntary, they could be statutory. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, will agree that there is a band of patients who fall into a kind of grey area.<lb/>
But, equally, both doctors and social workers know that if a patient goes in voluntarily, in particular in the field of mental health, he is far easier to treat. He will accept treatment much more easily than if he goes in as a statutory patient. I have had a number of patients who fell into this category, and I was called in to see them before an order was made in respect of them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0275"/>
<col>533</col>
Because I had known them in the past, because we had a good relationship, they agreed to go in as voluntary patients. How will the social workers who carry out that task, who under the Bill are required to do it, feel if, having put to patients the different point of view about going in on a voluntary basis, later find that the patients are to be treated as statutory patients? I think that as social workers we would feel that we had led them up the garden path&#x2014;to put it crudely. I very much hope that the Minister will consider not only the doctor-patient relationship, but in addition the patient-social worker relationship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02227"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to speak very briefly. I have not previously spoken on the Bill, but I have been very interested in this particular point. It seems to me that the amendment means that when I suffer a nervous breakdown, which I am always expecting, and go voluntarily into a hospital, I cannot accept my doctor's advice without somebody else telling me so. That seems to be quite impossible&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02228"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are considering only the most extreme kinds of treatment, such as psycho-surgery. I wonder whether the noble Lord is anticipating offering himself for that kind of treatment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02229"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: I am not anticipating it&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02230"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my amendment does not consider psycho-surgery; it deliberately excludes it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02231"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought that that was the case. Anyway, my point is quite clear. As a voluntary patient I am not prepared to have anyone tell me whether I should or should not take the doctor's advice. There are many other complications in regard to this particular position. If the noble Lord is to say that he can deal with the matter in some other way, and that he might otherwise lose the Bill, personally I should advise my friends&#x2014;and it is not my business, but rather my colleague's business to do so&#x2014;to go along with that, because I do not think that we want to wreck the Bill. However, I have not the slightest doubt about what is right here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02232"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to say only a few words. I have listened to the argument, and I think that probably much heavy weather is being made regarding the amendment. I have the fear that if the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, presses his amendment to a Division, or if the Government withdraw their clause, the Bill, at this&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02233"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that, with your Lordships' permission, I must at this point intervene. It is not a Government clause that we are discussing; the amendment was proposed by the noble Lord's honourable friend in the other place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02234"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that may be so, but I am dealing only with the technicalities of the situation. I am only trying to be helpful, because I am
<col>534</col>
very anxious to see the Bill on the statute hook. We are now placed in a difficult situation, owing to the time factor. If the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, presses his amendment to a Division and it is carried, or, alternatively, if the Government accept his advice and withdraw, the Bill would have to go back to another place. Now the trouble is that time is getting short, and, having served in the other place, I must say, with all due respect to it, that it is a very unpredictable place. We do not even know at what time tomorrow Prorogation will take place, and there is a great risk of the Bill being lost. That is all that I should like to say. I am very keen indeed to see the Bill on the statute hook, but I see the noble Lord's point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02235"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, whether he can perhaps help the House to help him. It seems that the amendment which was passed in another place errs, perhaps in an over-protective direction towards the informal patient. Of course we all accept that this kind of protection is required for a detained patient. But there might be offered here a certain over-zealous protective covering. I very much accept what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, has said&#x2014;that we do not want to lose the Bill. Can the noble Lord the Minister give us any prospect of the matter being put to rights in the regulations, or possibly in the code of practice which the Mental Health Act Commission is due to draw up? Would either of those routes be possible in order to eliminate the anomaly without our having to send the Bill back to another place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02236"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to speak to the same plea; in other words, to double it, as it were. My anxiety is precisely the same. Noble Lords may recollect that I played a perhaps prominent part in persuading the House to introduce an independent element into the whole question of the determination of a patient's ability to consent, and the question of whether or not he had consented, with respect to the treatments, which were then defined as treatments of special concern. I think it only right to say that when I was doing that at an earlier stage of the Bill in your Lordships' House, I did not have in mind the voluntary patients. Therefore, in many ways I sympathise with what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, and indeed by the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, though I think that perhaps some of their fears are a little exaggerated, in that we have not yet seen what are the precise treatments, they have not yet been defined in the regulations, and so on. Perhaps the fears are a little overstated.<lb/>
Nevertheless, on balance, perhaps I would be induced to support the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, in thinking that his ideas might be preferable to the actual Commons amendment. But I share the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, and personally I should he deeply distressed if we were to lose the Bill, which I think is a very valuable Bill indeed. I, too, should welcome some advice from the noble Lord the Minister as to the possible consequences and as to the opportunities open to us at this stage. Of course we all know that we can change the Bill and take the consequences, but the Minister might be able to tell us what those consequences are likely to be. If he could do that, it might be helpful to some of us.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0276"/>
<col>535</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02237"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise if I intervened rather hastily when the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, was speaking a few moments ago, but I did not want the noble Lord inadvertently to convey to your Lordships the impression that the amendment was some kind of Government plot. At the outset I want to make it absolutely clear that the amendment was proposed by the Opposition in the other place and accepted by the Government, and therefore enjoyed the support of the two largest parties in the other place. I hesitate to say that it enjoyed all-party support. I am not certain what the attitude of the other parties in the other place would have been; that was not clear from the record of the debate that I have seen.<lb/>
Amendment No. 41 applies the special safeguards for psycho-surgery and other exceptional treatments for mental disorder&#x2014;I want to repeat that: it applies the special safeguards for psycho-surgery and other exceptional treatments for mental disorder&#x2014;to informal patients, as well as to detained ones. Of course, that does not authorise treatment without consent for informal patients, but it extends to them the special protection of the Mental Health Act Commission in the small number of cases where very exceptional treatments for mental disorder, like psycho-surgery or hormone implantation, are used, and where it is particularly important to be sure that informed consent has been given.<lb/>
That change was made at a very late stage and without the consultation with the medical profession which has accompanied the other changes in the Bill. I know that the Royal College of Psychiatrists feels strongly about the lack of consultation, and I have every sympathy with them. I wish to say quite plainly that the Government would have much preferred to consult the Royal College and others, and I am very sorry that because the amendment in question was tabled in the other place at a very late stage&#x2014;just before Report&#x2014;there simply was not time to do that. But, as I have said, there was agreement on all sides in the other place that the change was desirable and that it should be made while they had the opportunity.<lb/>
The Royal College of Psychiatrists is also concerned about the principles of the amendment, because it applies to informal patients; but I wish to assure your Lordships and the Royal College and others concerned with this amendment that it is a very limited one made for special reasons, and does not affect relations between doctor and patient for the generality of treatments. I know that the Royal College is also afraid that at some time in the future other treatments might be included in the regulations to be made under Amendment 35&#x2014;electro-convulsive therapy, for example. The Government are clearly committed to putting ECT into the other set of regulations, so that ECT can be given without consent if necessary, and those regulations will apply only to detained patients. That is the undertaking given by my honourable friend the Minister of Health in another place, and I repeat that undertaking here tonight.<lb/>
The procedures which will affect informal patients will apply only to psycho-surgery&#x2014;that is on the face of the Bill&#x2014;and to those other treatments which are specified in regulations. Those regulations can be made only after consultation with interested bodies&#x2014;that, too, is in the Bill&#x2014;and we shall also be
<col>536</col>
seeking the advice of the Mental Health Act Commission. We intend to put certain hormone treatments in the regulations, but we shall not add other treatments unless there is a clear consensus of advice that we should do so. These regulations will be laid before your Lordships' House under the negative resolution procedure, so that your Lordships will have a chance to scrutinise them.<lb/>
I hope that with that assurance my noble friend Lord Mottistone will not wish to press his amendment to Amendment No. 41. I appreciate that his amendment is intended to narrow the scope of Amendment No. 41, but I hope nonetheless that he will be persuaded by the arguments that I have deployed. If treatments are of such special concern that it is decided, after full and thorough consultation, that they should be given to detained patients only with consent and a second opinion, then those same safeguards really should be extended to informal patients. That was the clear view of the other place, and I hope it will likewise be the view of your Lordships.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, specifically asked me about what would be the procedural consequences of your Lordships' disagreeing one of the Commons amendments at this stage, or perhaps agreeing only to a revised form of a Commons amendment at this stage. I must say that as far as I know the other place have made no provision to consider any matter of that kind. That is not to say that provision could not be made: I have not inquired into it. I hope the Commons will not he asked to consider any revision to the proposals which have come forward. I believe that on the merits of the case your Lordships ought to accept the amendment proposed by the Commons and disagree the further amendment proposed by my noble friend.<lb/>
I do not wish to argue against this amendment simply on the grounds that the other place has no time to consider it. If time is essential then time clearly must be found, but I believe that on the merits of the case the amendment made by the other place ought to be agreed, and I hope that in the light of that my noble friend Lord Mottistone will not wish to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02238"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for those remarks, particularly the closing ones, because it seems to me that it would be intolerable, if we felt in our wisdom that we ought to make this amendment, that we should be hampered by the thought that procedure might get in the way. I appreciate what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, with his great experience of another place, but I really do think that if we feel we ought to have my amendment in the Bill, to adjust it to a better balance, then we should say so; and I am delighted that my noble friend has said that, though he does not want that, procedure is not the hampering factor.<lb/>
I should also like to make another remark about what my noble friend said. He said on many occasions that there was overwhelming support in another place, and that both the major parties agreed. Of course, we do not really know that, because the amendment was put down and spoken to by three or four Members. There were others present, not just those from the Opposition party which agreed to it, but there were not
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0277"/>
<col>537</col>
very many who spoke and it was not taken to a Division, so we shall never know what people thought&#x2014;not really. It is not like something put in the form of a Question; it is just that the Government accepted an Opposition amendment. It was as simple as that. So I do not think that is an important factor.<lb/>
I personally think that the most important speeches that have been made on this point have in fact been those made by the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Luton, and my noble friend Lady Faithfull. Both, from their different ends, back up the principle behind this amendment. I think we must therefore test the opinion of the House and see what noble Lords think about it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02244"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps, for the record. I may say that Amendment No. 41 refers to the new clause in Amendment No. 40. The noble Lord will recollect that I asked him some questions. He answered all of them except one in regard to the definitions. Since this is also relevant to Amendment No. 41 perhaps he could now reply to that question. On this, I asked whether there was any special significance in the omission of the words "psychological consequences" in relation to "hazardous" when there was the inclusion of "psychological consequences" in relation to "irreversible". I asked him specifically whether the inclusion of the word "psychological" in one case and its omission in the other had any particular significance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02249"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to speak on Amendment No. 42. I thought the amendments were going to be taken <i>en bloc</i> from No. 42 to No. 49. It is with great relief that I once more speak on this important matter of after-care for
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0278"/>
<col>539</col>
detained patients, a matter which your Lordships were good enough to include in this Bill. A Bill of this sort without an after-care clause would not have emphasised the vital importance of this need to the people who make the Act work when it is operational.<lb/>
Today, I should like to thank the other place for having amended the after-care Clause No. 39 by adding two very important sections. The Member for Birmingham Stechford, Mr. Davis, moved an amendment to include cases under Sections 72 and 73 of the principal Act. The matter of this clause is an excellent example of the need for two Chambers. The other place improved what the supporters of my amendment had tried to do, which was to provide for a statutory obligation for after-care to be provided on discharge from hospital for the most difficult and dangerous patients who are kept in very secure conditions. Many of them have to be resettled into the community. Sections 72 and 73 refer to persons removed to hospital from prisons. It was a total mistake that they were not included in the first amendment which I moved in this House. As these patients have prison sentences and records, it was easy to assume that they were still under the umbrella of the Home Office and probation after-care.<lb/>
My Lords, some of these patients suffer from severe mental illness, psychopathic disorders and most appalling behaviour problems. As the other place queried why I had not include them, all I can say is that my amendment came rather late after I had visited a secure hospital unit and having talked with staff and met patients, I realised how important and vital aftercare is if they are to be discharged. My visit was delayed because of snow. I was very worried when I discovered Sections 72 and 73 cases were not covered by a statutory after-care. I am very pleased and thank the Government for accepting the amendment in the other place.<lb/>
The Government have assured us that after-care for mentally ill patients is an obligation. It is important that all voluntary patients as well as those on Sections 72 and 73 who are mentally ill and in need of aftercare will receive it. I hope and pray that Clause 39 will be helpful. It does something which I think has not been done before; that is, to lay the duty on the health districts, the local authority services and in cooperation with relevant voluntary agencies. I believe that these very difficult problems will more likely be solved if they are shared in co-operation with people pooling their expertise and skills.<lb/>
Under this Bill, when it becomes an Act of Parliament, there are to be approved social workers. They are to have two years' extra training if they have not been qualified in mental health work. This must help and benefit in after-care treatment. When resources are scarce, joint funding between health and social service departments must he wise when providing after-care facilities for the mentally ill. I thank everyone who has helped with this after-care clause.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02265"><b>51</b> Clause 42, page 31, line 42, leave out 'detained under the principal Act or this Act' and insert 'suffering from mental disorder'.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02266"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 41. With your permission, may I speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 54, 55, 59 to 68, 72 and 73. These all relate to the Mental Health Act Commission and its functions. A number of them relate to a wider power to investigate complaints, including complaints from former detained patients and complaints by other people about the use of the statutory powers. The commission is also given a wider duty to keep under review the exercise of all the powers in the Act and the discharge of the duties it imposes. The first of its biennial reports will be made two years after it is set up&#x2014;a year earlier than was proposed when the Bill left your Lordships' House&#x2014;and the code of practice will he subject to a negative resolution procedure to facilitate parliamentary scrutiny.<lb/>
Perhaps the most important amendments of all are Nos. 51 and 72, which enable the commission's responsibilities to be extended to informal patients as well as detained ones, as was urged by some of your Lordships at earlier stages of debate. The code of practice will give guidance on medical treatment for all mentally disordered patients, not just detained ones. That is a significant step in widening the commission's role, though we will expect it to give particular attention to the need for guidance on the special ethical and professional issues involved in treating detained patients. I have already mentioned the new clause extending the greatest safeguards in the consent to treatment procedures to informal patients.<lb/>
The third way in which the commissin has been extended to informal patients is Amendment No. 72, which gives the Secretary of State a flexible discretionary power to direct the commission to review particular aspects of the care and treatment in hospital of informal patients. I must not raise false expectations. We do not intend to invoke that power straight away since the commission's first priorities must be the responsibilities for detained patients which are the reasons for its creation. As I have said, those tasks have been extended during the passage of the Bill, and it would not be sensible to direct the commission to take on extra responsibilities for informal patients until it has come to grips with its primary duties. But the power for an extension will be there in the Bill, with your Lordships' agreement, to be used if and when the time is right.<lb/>
Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Trefgarne</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02267"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very pleased indeed to see Amendment No. 55, which means that any code of practice will receive scrutiny by both Houses of Parliament. That is very important indeed and it was a matter that some of us pressed in this House. The other matter that pleases me is that although the Government do not intend to rush their fences, voluntary patients will get protection as with the other type of patients in the setting up of the
<col>542</col>
commission. That I think is important. We had voluntary patients discussed in another aspect. Those noble Lords who supported the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, will now agree with me that this is very desirable so far as voluntary patients are concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02268"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the complications of Amendments Nos. 41 and 41A, and so on, I did not thank my noble friend&#x2014;which I now do&#x2014;for having reassured me on one point where the specific requirement within the Bill for obtaining medical opinion has been struck out. He mentioned one of the amendments to which that referred. It is also struck out by Amendments Nos. 54, 86 and 18.<lb/>
I did not raise this when my noble friend Lord Elton was talking to us about No. 18, so I thought I would do it altogether at this stage as a separate thing. It concerns me a little that the specific requirements which were in the Bill for the Secretary of State and, in the case of No. 18, the court, to obtain a specifically medical opinion as well as any other opinion which may be relevant, is rather a backward step because it is surely wrong that there should be any suggestion that the doctors who specialise in this area are not people of great eminence and probity who should be consulted on matters of importance at all times. I get a slight feeling that they are being a little "swept away" by this Bill. I hope that my noble friend can give me some reassurance in general and in particular on the three amendments to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02269"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will realise by now that I have no intention of trying to alter the Bill or even to improve it at this eleventh hour, but I wonder whether perhaps in his reply the noble Lord could be a little more forthcoming as to the possible extension of this role of the Mental Health Act Commission in investigating complaints and the possibility at some stage of extending that to voluntary patients. As the noble Lord acknowledges, the Bill in fact gives the Mental Health Act Commission certain duties regarding the care of voluntary patients. That being so, surely it is logical that in the end one should extend those duties even to the possibility of the investigation of complaints. The noble Lord said that various things were being done and it would no be practical to do this at the outset, and so on. But would he make it clear that it is the Government's intention that in principle that extension should be made at some appropriate time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02270"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord also spoke to Amendment No, 73, which is the one that I wanted to touch on. It provides that in the second year after it is established, and then in every subsequent second year, the Mental Health Act Commission shall publish a report. In Standing Committee in another place, that was changed to annual reports, which I personally favour. Unfortunately, that was overturned at Report stage in the other place and so we now have biennial reports. I still think, and I hope the Government will give consideration to this, that there is a very strong case for having annual reports.<lb/>
When we were considering the Mental Health Act Commission at an earlier stage in your Lordships' House it appeared as a rather cloudy body. It is now
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0280"/>
<col>543</col>
becoming less shrouded and is emerging as an extremely important body with teeth. Among its functions are such things as to appoint and monitor independent second medical opinions, to prepare a code of practice, to decide the treatments which should be included in the regulations&#x2014;and that is a very important function&#x2014;to review the exercise of the powers of detention of patients under the Act, to investigate any complaints, to visit and interview patients and, finally, at some future date it seems, from what we have just heard, that it will also incorporate voluntary patients within the ambit of its responsibilities. It is an extremely important and wide-ranging body that we are setting up, and I must say I cannot for the life of me see why a body of this sort, like other quangos (if that is the right term) should not report annually.<lb/>
The other place has decided that it is going to report biennially, but I hope the Government will keep this under review; and I also wonder whether it might not be possible for the Mental Health Act Commission to consider in the alternate years when it is not required statutorily to make a report, either to do so voluntarily&#x2014;because particularly in the first year of its operation we shall be extremely interested to hear what it is up to&#x2014;and alternatively whether in the alternate years between the statutory reports it should not set itself to make selective reports on particular issues within its remit. It seems to me that the issues within its remit are many and of very great importance, as I have already pointed out. That seems to me to be another road the commission might go down, and I should like to have some assurance from the noble Lord that he will convey these suggestions to the commission when it is set up, and that it will give them serious consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02271"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would be a mistake to impose too many burdens on the commission in the early months and years of its life. Certainly, I think that annual reports would be too great a burden, but I hope the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, will agree that what is now proposed is at least an improvement on the original provisions in the Bill. That is not to say that the Mental Health Act Commission could not and would not produce <i>ad hoc</i> reports about something which they think ought to be brought specifically to public attention in between their biennial reports, but I certainly would not wish to impose an obligation upon them to do so.<lb/>
As for the extension of their activities to cover the affairs of informal or voluntary patients, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, that is a matter which the Secretary of State of the day will wish to direct them to do in due course. However, I must make it clear that we do not anticipate that happening right away, for the same reasons that I advanced to the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, just now. In the early months and years of the life of this commission, they will have their hands full in seeing to the primary purposes for which they have been established, namely, safeguarding the affairs of the detained patients: and I think it would be wrong to ask them to look after the affairs of the informal patients at the same time. In the light of how they get on with their primary task, my right honourable friend, or whoever
<col>544</col>
might one day succeed him, may wish to consider the possibility of directing them to look into the question of the informal patients when the moment appears right for that purpose.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mottistone asked me first of all, in respect of Amendments Nos. 54 and 86, about consultation arrangements. I can assure him that we shall consult everyone with an interest in these matters, and especially the medical interests. I really would wish to dismiss at once the suggestion that we are in any way dispensing with medical advice in the preparation of these things. I am sorry that idea has gained currency, if only in the mind of my noble friend, and I do assure him that it is not so. On the question arising out of Amendment No. 18, which my noble friend Lord Elton spoke to earlier, that is consequential to the provision for an accused person to get his own medical report; and in that case the court will of course want to have regard to the relevant advice. I think those are the main anxieties in the minds of your Lordships concerning these matters and I hope you will now see fit to agree to these amendments.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02311"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether I may say a brief word about Amendment No. 72. This is an important amendment, whereby the Mental Health Act Commission may be directed by the Secretary of State to keep under review the care and treatment of voluntary patients. That is a considerable advance on the original concept, whereby only detained patients came under the control of the commission, and we welcome it. But had we been in a different stage of the Session, I would have moved to leave out, purely as a matter of drafting, some words in line 5 of the new subsection (3A) which appear to me to be otiose and unnecessary. They are the words,
<quote>"or any aspect of the care and treatment".</quote>
They add nothing to the words:
<quote>"review the care and treatment"</quote>
which precede them. There is nothing we can do about it, but I felt that it was desirable just to point that out. Also, I wonder if I may ask my noble friend whether the expression "postal packet", which we find in new subsections (3D), (3E) and (3F), includes letters and postcards. Apart from those minor points, may I say that I think the Government have done well to persuade the House of Commons to make Amendment No. 72.</membercontribution></p>
<col>548</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02312"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the first point of my noble friend about the drafting and the otiose words, to which he referred, your Lordships will have heard him make that kind of complaint before. I have to confess that my noble friend is almost always right in drawing the attention of your Lordships to these difficulties. I am sorry that this one has been detected at such a late stage in the passage of the Bill that we might have difficulty in persuading the usual channels that time ought to be found in the other place tomorrow to consider just that point. So I hope that my noble friend will not persist with it.<lb/>
As for the second question which my noble friend put to me, I can assure him that "postal packet" includes letters and postcards. My noble friend also asked for an example of some other aspects of care and treatment, which the Mental Health Act Commission might be asked to look at. We have in mind, for example, that they might be asked to do a particular study of the use of electro-convulsive therapy. But there are, no doubt, other examples which would occur to your Lordships who are familiar with these matters. I hope that those answers reassure my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

At the same time may I speak to Amendment No. 119. These are technical amendments and I hope that they need not detain us for long. However, I should like to say a word about Amendment No. 79 which meets the desire of many of your Lordships that the Bill should amend the restrictions on legal proceedings in Section 141 of the 1959 Act. Three changes have been made. In criminal proceedings, the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions must be sought instead of the leave of the High Court. In both criminal and civil cases the amendment removes the requirement that substantial grounds of bad faith or lack of reasonable care must be shown before proceedings begin. It will, however, still be necessary to show bad faith or lack of reasonable care in the substantive proceedings. That gives hospital staff and others a defence for actions properly carried out in their professional duties. Section 141 will not apply at all to legal proceedings against the Secretary of State or a health authority.<lb/>
It will be recalled that Section 141 was much debated at earlier stages in your Lordships' House. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, and the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, moved amendments. On other occasions the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, intervened as well. I think that there was a good deal of correspondence between various noble Lords and myself subsequent to that.<lb/>
The Government still believe that Section 141 is an important safeguard for hard-pressed staff, so we could not agree to the repeal or substantial weakening of the section proposed in a number of the amendments which were moved in this House. But we have been impressed by the strength of opinion both in this House and in another place. We have also had regard to the views expressed to the Special Standing Committee by professional staff. The Royal College of Psychiatrists, for example, said:
<quote>"The College supports those who urge the Government to amend section 141 of the Act".</quote>
The Royal College of Nursing said in oral evidence:
<quote>"&#x2026;the consultations that we had with the Royal College of Nursing showed that there were no strong feelings that section 141 should remain. We agreed that the DPP would be a better route if section 141 were to be retained".</quote>
In the light of all these opinions we have felt able to accept Amendment No. 79 and I hope that your Lordships will likewise welcome it. I beg to move.<lb/>

<col>551</col>
noble friend Lord Trefgarne should explain at some length the effects of the various subsections in this new clause. I was one of the people principally concerned in the 1959 Act with Section 141 as it was then enacted, but I think I was also the first member of your Lordships' House to criticise it when it was dealt with in Committee. It was a difficult matter. I think we all agreed that there had to be some safeguards before proceedings could be brought in these sometimes rather difficult and delicate circumstances, but Section 141 contained conditions which stultified the outcome of proceedings and could be said to have prejudiced them. I think we now owe it to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, who must have had to be consulted, to have a satisfactory solution, a very much more simple arrangement and one which I should have thought all noble Lords could find acceptable. Speaking for myself, therefore, I say that we should be grateful.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COMMONS AMENDMENT</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02341"><b>82</b> After Clause 47, insert the following new clause:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02342" align="center">'<i>Electoral registration of patients etc</i>.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02343">. In section 4(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1949 for the words from "who is a patient" to "at any place" there shall he substituted the words "who is detained at any place in legal custody or by virtue of any enactment relating to persons suffering from mental disorder".</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02344">(2) Schedule (<i>Electoral registration and voting in case of voluntary mental patients</i>) to this Act shall have effect with respect to electoral registration and voting in the case of voluntary mental patients.'.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02345"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 82. It may be for the convenience of your Lordships if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 93, 96, 97, 99 and 121. These amendments give effect to the Government's decision that voluntary patients should no longer be prevented from registering as electors solely because their only place of residence is a mental hospital. The amendments do this by allowing voluntary patients to make a declaration which entitles them to be registered as electors for a home address or other address outside the hospital and to obtain an absent vote at the time of an election.<lb/>
This issue has already been debated at some length in this House. Your Lordships will remember that the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, introduced amendments seeking to remove from Section 4(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1949 the words which prevent mental hospital patients from using their hospital address to register as electors. The Government's view, expressed then by my noble friend Lord Belstead, was that such an amendment raised considerable practical difficulties and that the proper vehicle for discussing the issues was a Representation of the People Bill. There was a further debate in the Special Standing Committee in another place where an amendment similar to that put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, was accepted.<lb/>
The Government have listened with great care to the various arguments put forward, that this Bill should be used to effect a change in the law. We took the opportunity afforded by the Recess to find a way of giving effect to the principle behind the Standing Committee's decision which would avoid the
<col>552</col>
difficulties to which that amendment would give rise. The results of our deliberations are set out in the amendments now before your Lordships.<lb/>
Under these amendments, it will be open to a voluntary patient resident in a mental hospital on the qualifying date for electoral registration to make a declaration, if he can do so without assistance. Assistance for this purpose does not include assistance made necessary by blindness or any other physical incapacity. The declaration will specify the address where the patient would be resident if he were not in hospital or, if he cannot provide such an address, the address at which he was resident before admission. A member of the hospital staff will attest the declaration. It will be transmitted to the electoral registration officer for the address specified in the declaration and he will insert the elector's name in the register of electors. Once registered, the patient will be entitled to apply for an absent vote at parliamentary and local government elections.<lb/>
We believe that this system offers a workable solution to the various problems which have prevented successive Governments from allowing voluntary patients to register. In particular, the difficult common law tests which prevent those termed "idiots" and "persons of unsound mind" from voting are replaced by the simple practical test of a patient's ability to complete a form. We shall consult with the political parties, representatives of electoral registration officers and health authorities on the formulation of guidance to enable our proposals to be implemented in the most effective way. The qualifying date for inclusion in next year's register&#x2014;10th October 1982&#x2014;has already passed, but the amendments will come into force in good time for patients to make declarations qualifying them to vote at elections from February 1984.<lb/>
These amendments will give the vote to many thousands of patients who are quite capable of exercising it. The amendments have been welcomed by those who moved the original amendments in another place and by others, including MIND, as a great step forward. I commend them to your Lordships' House and beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Elton</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02346"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I telephoned the office of the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, this morning with certain views. I had assumed that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, was going to deal with this amendment. I hope that the message reached the noble Lord, Lord Elton. It appears that that is the case.<lb/>
These amendments were considered in another place in the early hours of Tuesday, 19th October, amidst, I am sorry to say, the generation of some heat. But noble Lords need not fear, That is typical of what happens in another place at about 3.30 in the morning. There is always the risk of an explosion, so we need not worry too much. Here we can discuss the amendments calmly and quietly, but at the same time I must advise the House that we are dealing with an important point of principle. The point is that voluntary patients in a psychiatric wing of a general hospital in registering for the vote have the choice of opting for either the hospital address or a home address. In addition, a postal vote can be readily obtained&#x2014;there are no problems. But where a person
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0285"/>
<col>553</col>
is a patient in a mental hospital, under the provisions of Amendment No. 99, that person has to follow an extremely complicated completion of a form of application, and can only register for an address outside the hospital. This may not be difficult for newly-arrived or short-stay patients, but it may be extremely difficult to establish an address so far as a patient who has been resident for some years is concerned.<lb/>
I welcome the efforts made to make provision for voluntary patients to have voting rights, but the finalisation of objectives as indicated in Amendment No. 99 is not only highly complicated but establishes two classes of voluntary mental patients: one with the right to register without distinction of type of address, and the other obstructed by complicated regulations and the restriction of registering only from an address outside the mental hospital. To my mind, this is unfair discrimination. In passing, I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord Underhill will wish to make a contribution because, of course, my noble friend has considerable experience in these matters. It would have been better to have recorded the principle in this legislation and left the Home Secretary to carry out the normal practice of consultation with the political parties. So far as I am aware, no such consultation has taken place. Had this been done, then no doubt the complexities and unfairness of the present proposals would have been avoided.<lb/>
I must say that I feel very strongly on the matter, but at this stage, with Prorogation tomorrow, I realise that to attempt to reject the amendment, which this House is quite capable of doing, might even lose the Bill. We all want the Bill on the statute book&#x2014;it is urgently needed. Therefore, may I appeal to the noble Lord the Minister for a little help? Will it be possible for the Government to give a generalised undertaking to take another look at these provisions, bearing in mind our reasoned objections, before regulations are brought in? I am not asking for a firm promise to amend, but for a general undertaking to think the matter over and, if necessary&#x2014;and I recommend this&#x2014;to carry out consultation as is normal practice under the Representation of the People Act.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02348"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for generations all people of voting age except felons, bankrupts and Members of your Lordships' House were entitled to vote at parliamentary elections. There may be people who, misreading this new clause, might think that something ridiculous was being enacted by us, in that people who could not read or write and who had no understanding of anything were being given the opportunity of having their hands forced to put crosses on election papers and perhaps voting by post. But as I understand it, especially if one considers what is contained in Amendment No. 99, which is the new schedule, and especially paragraph 3(5)(<i>d</i>), a person will not be able to vote who is a voluntary patient unless that person is capable of making the declaration required. That is a statutory safeguard against people who have no hope of understanding being able to vote and perhaps against their votes being exploited occasionally by unscrupulous people. I welcome what has been done and I believe that it has been rightly
<col>554</col>
done&#x2014;hut by jove! the Government took a tremendous chance with this because they did not consult Mencap, and it is only by the grace of God that they got it right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02349"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, I would not dream of placing any impediments in the way of this particular Commons amendment. Indeed, I welcome the amendment and its effect, but I am hound to say that, like the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, I am a little disappointed because in a sense I felt that the Bill as it was before Report stage in another place was marginally better. I think that it has deteriorated a little and I still feel that there is a distinct risk that certain voluntary patients who are perfectly capable of voting, and despite what is in this Bill, may nevertheless have difficulty in enforcing their right to vote.<lb/>
I was a little reassured by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, with regard to the consultations which will go on following the enactment of this Bill; consultations with the political parties and so on, and the steps that will be taken in formulating the regulations. But it is only right to place on record the fact that we have now differentiated between two classes of mental patient. The person who is mentally ill and who is in the psychiatric ward of a general hospital is now in a totally different and much more privileged position with regard to voting than the person with precisely the same mental complaint who happens to be in one of the hospitals covered by this particular clause. It is perhaps regrettable that the rights to vote of identical people should be differentiated between in that particular way. However, my noble friends and I are prepared to accept the amendment, and I was glad to hear the words spoken by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, with regard to the further steps which will be taken before the next register is compiled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02350"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, has been good enough to give some of the prehistory of this amendment. I introduced two amendments; one at Committee stage and one at Report stage. They were in a slightly different form but did not find favour in your Lordships' House. But then an amendment was tabled by my honourable friend Mr. Mike Thomas in Standing Committee in another place, which was won. So this very important step was pioneered by the SDP in another place and I am happy to say that, in accordance with the spirit which has animated many of the proceedings concerned with this Bill, was carried with Conservative support.<lb/>
What we have before us today is a new Government version, which I welcome. There are details to which one might object but it is very difficult to do something such as this without producing one or two anomalies. The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, referred to one such anomaly whereby voluntary patients who are in a psychiatric unit of an ordinary general hospital already have the right to vote from the hospital but, according to the Government's new clause, those in psychiatric hospitals are going to have a postal vote.<lb/>
One can understand the Government's desire to disperse the vote of voluntary patients because in some cases the population of a hospital might be very big&#x2014;it
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0286"/>
<col>555</col>
might be 1,000&#x2014;and if all the votes were cast in one place it might have a considerable effect on a local election. That might be no bad thing, but one can understand the concern of the Government to achieve a certain dispersal if this vote. I myself feel that, anomalies or not, the Government have taken a very important and courageous step, although it might be in a sense misconstrued.<lb/>
I was very glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Renton, point out that apart from Members of your Lordships' House and a few other categories of people who have transgressed the law, the right to vote is a fundamental right for all citizens of this country. The Government have performed a notable service in enfranchising, if that is the correct word, no less than 120,000 of our fellow citizens. This is a very important achievment in the Bill. I hope the House will not take it amiss that I have striven to show the part we played in this; this does not mean that we do not also appreciate the part played by the Government. We very much welcome the new clause and the schedule.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02352">6.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02353"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend said that I might deal with a few angles from the standpoint of the Representation of the People Act. I will endeavour to do so. A number of noble Lords have stressed the anomalies which the Government's proposal leaves, and I will not reiterate those. I would remind your Lordships that as far back as 1974 a Speaker's Conference recommended that there should be no difference between patients in mental hospitals and those in psychiatric wards of general hospitals. The Government's proposal does not meet that recommendation of the Speaker's Conference. That Speaker's Conference also recommended that an inter-departmental working party should be set up, and that was set up between the Home Office, the DHSS and other organisations. They identified a number of problems, six particular ones. Back in 1976 the Government announced that they accepted the Speaker's Conference recommendation in principle but subject to these points which the working party indentified being resolved.<lb/>
The working party was then instructed to consult relevant organisations and also the political parties. I was sorry to see that on 21st October, when this matter was discussed in another place, the Minister of State at the Home Office said:
<quote>"However, when it"&#x2014;</quote>
that is the working party&#x2014;
<quote>"reported in 1978 the working party did not put forward single or conclusive recommendations on all the issues involved".</quote>
I have a copy of the working party report because I was one of those who were fortunate to be included from a political party to discuss the matters involved. The working party gave very careful consideration to those six particular problems. Although it is true that they
<col>556</col>
did not put their conclusions in the form of a direct recommendation, I am satisfied that the safeguards, the proposals there would have enabled the Speaker's Conference recommendation to be carried out. It is at that stage, when the report was presented, that I think my noble friend regrets the opportunity was not taken to consult fully with the political parties.<lb/>
The working party states in paragraph 6 that it started from the premise that the Representation of the People Act would be amended as required by the Speaker's Conference and therefore it was only going to deal with the problems that were outstanding. There is a very important paragraph in the working party's report which I will read:
<quote>"The mentally ill and mentally handicapped are not, of course, all resident in mental hospitals. Some mentally ill patients in particular, as already noted, are treated in general hospitals. Many mentally ill and mentally handicapped people are cared for by their families or in residential homes. The departments concerned are not aware of any problems arising from the electoral registration of these people".</quote>
That is an important statement in the working party's report. The Government's conclusions as set out now in the Bill do not meet those fundamental points.<lb/>
The Government have endeavoured to get over the problem by this proposal of a person giving an address at which he normally resides. But this may be an address of many years ago. I would like to question that, and draw attention to what the working party proposed on this point. I am not an apologist for the working party; I was brought in at the tail end, after they had had statements from the various bodies concerned. They referred to the possibility that a patient might be treated in the same way as the Representation of the People Act treats service voters. Also they pointed out that several difficulties are inherent in this proposal: first of all, the additional work that will fall upon both the health service and registration staffs; also there could be objection that in effect patients would be liable to choose the constituency in which they wished to register and in some cases this would relate to many years ago. But this proposal has gone further because there has been added to the declaration the words,

<quote>"if he is able to do so without assistance".</quote>
No such proposal of that kind appears anywhere in the working party's report, and patients at a general hospital are not required to make that sort of declaration. So, again, we have a difference of treatment between patients in one hospital and patients in another.<lb/>
Also, as I stress by reading paragraph 7 of the report:
<quote>"There are other persons who are mentally ill and mentally handicapped who are looked after at home. They may register at that address and they are not required to make any declaration".</quote>
Furthermore, I think it is a fact&#x2014;as is known to those of us who have experience of elections&#x2014;that many persons regarded as mentally healthy find great difficulty in completing Form A. I can assure your Lordships that anyone who has done work on the doorstep for postal votes knows that a great many people find difficulty in completing the necessary form applying for a postal vote on the ground of physical incapacity.<lb/>
There are one or two other points I would put to the Minister. Difficulties could be caused if persons were registered at certain addresses, possibly at a hospital
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0287"/>
<col>557</col>
address, or if they were listed in a way to associate themselves with mental sickness. Is it the intention to consider that these names may be added at the end of each section of the register in alphabetical order, as may apply to service voters? If so, I would ask this: how will persons obtain their addresses in order to send them electoral literature? Again, I notice that the Minister of State said, when this matter was discussed the other day in the other place, that there will be no problem because the registration officer will know the address of the hospital and each elector is entitled to receive the election address; therefore, the problem can be easily solved. Unless I am corrected, the only addresses that will be available will be either those of people who are in the normal electoral register or addresses on the absent voters' list&#x2014;unless it is the intention of the Government to provide in regulations that it must be a duty of the registration officer to give this sort of information. Otherwise it will not be possible for those concerned to see that electors receive the election literature.<lb/>
I am pleased to note the provision, in paragraph 7 of the proposed schedule, that persons registered by virtue of this declaration may apply to be an absent voter and vote by post. But there is the advice that was given to the working party, and this appears in paragraph 22:
<quote>"Mental incapacity to attend the polling station is not a ground of eligibility at present".</quote>
There is a difference between physical incapacity, for which a person may get an absent vote by RPF 7, and mental incapacity. I am afraid I must deal with these points; I say that with all due respect to the Chief Whip. It is rather important that the opportunity is taken on this proposal to try to clarify, if the matter is not already clarified&#x2014;and I do not think it is&#x2014;the difference between physical incapacity and mental incapacity, because those who are given the opportunity of a postal vote if they make this declaration will come under the heading of mental incapacity.<lb/>
The last point is that there is a very useful annexe to the working party's report which deals with the position of Northern Ireland. It indicates quite clearly that for Northern Ireland elections there is no problem of registration of persons suffering from mental illness anywhere, even in hospitals. The statement has been made that no problems whatever have arisen in Northern Ireland in connection with that sort of registration. While appreciating the step forward that the Government have made, there is still more to be done if we are to meet the recommendation of the Speakers' Conference, and there are some practical problems arising in connection with the regulations on which I hope there will be the fullest consultation with the political parties, as the noble Lord said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02354"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to your Lordships for the varied reception that these amendments have received and for the general agreement that they are a move in the right direction. It is a matter for regret that there has not been longer for discussion in the House, although there were two debates on the matter. Although we felt that it would have been better to have placed this in another vehicle, it was clear from what went on in another place, and from a great deal of what went on in this House, that
<col>558</col>
it was preferred that it should go here. The Government have abided by that.<lb/>
The points raised by your Lordships on the question of adding names of these people to the end of the register, and a great many other questions, will be reviewed by the Government in the light of what has been said by your Lordships. My understanding is that Form A, the new form, is sent off with an address and that is the address that appears on the register. Therefore, there will be no distinction on the register of this type of voter. I cannot be more specific, but if I am wrong I shall write to the noble Lord. As I say, there will he consultation. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, asked about consultation. I have already given that undertaking and what the noble Lord said will also be noted.<lb/>
I recognise the distinguished work of the noble lord, Lord Underhill, in the working party. At the same time, I should say that the working party could not agree on who should advise the electoral registration officer on which patients were legally capable of being included on the register. That, of course, is the key problem, which was never solved. We have, instead, a test which may or may not be too severe. It is no more severe than Form A. I find it less difficult perhaps than the noble Lord, Lord Underhill. I do not think it is terribly difficult and it is better than nothing.<lb/>
On the question of dispersal of votes, the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, said that hospitals might be 1,000 or 1,500 strong and that, in a local election, can be a tantalising prize for people who want to carry out unscrupulous and, for mentally disturbed people, unsettling forms of lobbying. It is right that this effect should he dispersed in the manner we have suggested.<lb/>
If I have left out other matters, I apologise, but I think your Lordships' are agreed that these amendments should go forward even if we do not all think they are perfect. I hope your Lordships will allow this to happen.<lb/>

In effect, it allows the relative the chance to change his or her mind when it is explained that an action for damages is intended and the responsible person will eventually meet the sum equivalent to payment for services to the injured person.

Under Section 2(1) of the Damages (Scoland) Act 1976 an injured person's right to raise and pursue an action for damages passes to the executor of his estate on the death of that injured person. Clauses 8, 9 and 12 are subject to the section and no specific provision to that effect is thought to be needed in Part II of the Bill. The existing reference to that section in Clause 9 is certainly correct, but if it remains in the Bill it might be thought that the rule did not apply to Clauses 8 and 12. That is the explanation of Amendment No. 2. Amendment No. 3 is very simple drafting amendment. I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 2 and 3.<lb/>

These amendments give effect to the Government's further consideration of the scope of "relatives" for the purposes of an action for damages. As a significant minority of caring and stable relationships now exist outside marriage, we have concluded that it would be unjust to deny to an injured person's unmarried partner the right to damages. In order to be consistent, the same extension is applied to the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 as to Part II of the Bill, in respect of damages for both loss of support, which may he claimed by relatives of the deceased, and loss of society, which are restricted to claims from the immediate family.

Of course, barristers who are recorders or assistant recorders and so on can do it anyhow and continued to be able to do it throughout the period that I am talking about, after Section 9 of the Supreme Court Act came into force. But the inadvertent effect of Section 9 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 was to deprive solicitors who were recorders of the right to do this work at all although they were equally qualified to do it. This was, of course, an act of discrimination against the solicitors' profession, which neither they deserve nor was it intended.</membercontribution></p>

The purpose of the new clause as now explained is to ensure that questions may be put to a prospective juror to ascertain whether he is qualified for jury service at any time, and not just when he attends in pursuance of a jury summons. The result will be that if a juror refuses without reasonable excuse to answer, or knowingly or recklessly gives a false answer to the questions which are customarily set out in the jury summons, he will commit an offence which is at present triable summarily before magistrates with a maximum fine at present of &#x00A3;100, though under the Criminal Justice Bill it will be a maximum of &#x00A3;200.

Then the subsection sets out in (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) the circumstances in which it applies. This provision adds after (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>), paragraph (<i>f</i>), which reads:
<quote>"that the death occurred while the deceased was in police custody, or resulted from an injury caused by a police officer in the purported execution of his duty".</quote>
My right honourable friend the Home Secretary repeated last year to coroners advice originally given by the then Home Secretary in 1969, that it is desirable for an inquest to be held in every case of a person dying in legal custody, including police custody, and that such an inquest should preferably be held with a jury. This amendment gives that advice in a new and now statutory form, if it is passed.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02547"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had a distinct impression&#x2014;I may he completely wrong&#x2014;that the noble and learned Lord was encouraging me to be brief, and therefore I intend to accept that encouragement. I merely wish to say that the noble and learned Lord has graciously said that this was an Opposition amendment in another place and that the Government had been good enough to accept it. There have been cases within the memory of all your Lordships in recent years which have caused grave anxiety where death or a severe injury has occurred while someone has been in custody. It is proper that it should now be part of the law of the land that in such cases where a death occurs a jury should be present

when the coroner is conducting his inquest. We obviously concur with this amendment which had its origin in the Opposition in the other place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02549"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful indeed to both noble Lords for welcoming this amendment.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02557"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall detain the House, I promise, for only a few moments. It is interesting to notice how things become somewhat onerous, arduous, and subject to criticism when we are not very careful about our legislation. The position is terrifically odd under the Explosive Substances Act. What has happened until now&#x2014;this arose recently before a magistrate who himself did not know what this procedure was&#x2014;was that if a charge was to be brought under this Act a charge had to be brought first in the court before the Attorney General's fiat was applied for. This meant in effect that the Director of Public Prosecutions would not wish to prefer the charge until he knew that the Attorney General was likely to grant his fiat. That would mean that he would consult with the Attorney General and the Attorney General would say that it was likely, or not likely. If it was likely, the charge would be preferred.<lb/>
After the charge had been preferred and came before the magistrates the whole procedure would then have to he gone into of applying for the fiat of the
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0296"/>
<col>575</col>
Attorney General all over again, with all the forms that have to be completed in that connection. Now this procedure, as the noble and learned Lord in his usual summarising, lucid manner explained will be this: there will he uniform practice, and sensibly the Attorney General's fiat will be sought immediately that the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering the question of a charge. It will then be given, or not given, and the procedure will be uniform and simple.</membercontribution></p>

<title>British Gas Corporation (Disposal of Offshore Oilfield Interests) Directions 1982</title>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02618">7.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02619"><member>Lord Bishopston</member> rose to move, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the British Gas Corporation (Disposal of Offshore Oilfield Interests) Directions 1982 [S.I. 1982 No. 1131], laid before the House on 6th August 1982, be annulled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02620">The noble Lord said: My Lords, we had some comments on parts of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 earlier today, and doubtless we shall be returning to the subject on future occasions. That Act, as we all know, was debated in great detail in both Houses and Her Majesty's Opposition made their views on the measure very clear during the long and contested stages of the measure over a period of some months. One aspect was very clear to Members of both Houses on all sides, namely, that the Government were anxious to rush the measure through, indeed with indecent haste, as shown by the tabling of this order a few days after the House rose for the Summer Recess. The reasons have nothing to do with the best use and conservation of vitally important national energy and power resources. There could rarely have been such dubious reasons for a policy affecting assets owned by the nation and vital to its future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02621">Under the order, the British Gas Corporation is required, with no choice whatever, to establish a
<col>580</col>
subsidiary A, having as its main object the searching, boring and getting of petroleum and to make a scheme for the transfer of the property, rights and liabilities of the corporation and Gas Council (Exploration) Limited, a wholly owned corporation subsidiary. The Government direct that the BGC shall establish six subsidiaries, one to hold all of the very considerable assets of BGC. Subsidiary A will transfer property, rights and liabilities between itself and subsidiaries B, C, D and E. Not satisfied with five subsidiaries, the Government bring in Subsidiary F, and they will be concerned with the exploration and production of oil.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02622">We have a situation, to put it bluntly, where the privatised bodies will be concerned with the explorations and, indeed, the exploitation, of now publicly-owned assets. So from henceforth the aim will not he, as in the case of the British Gas Corporation at the moment, to use these resources in the national interest. Rather, the main objective will be the privatisation of oilfields and the exploitation of their resources for private commercial gain. So if there is any help to the national interest it will come as a mere by-product of the other private interests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02623">The disposal of the BGC's offshore oilfield interests required by the order takes away what has been described as modest holdings in a predominently American-controlled and owned North Sea oilfield. Yet the Government say, "We want to take away these assets from the public sector, from public control, and hand them over to private enterprise". These powers are whipped away despite the fact that the powers of diversification came from the Gas Act 1972, which was produced when the party opposite was in power, and I believe has still not been repealed. So the party opposite has changed its mind and believes that this kind of diversification, which is in the interests of the Gas Council and indeed of the British consumer, is no longer justified.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02624">These diversification powers have helped BGC and the consumer, and indeed the taxpayer. They have helped the corporation to fulfill its duties admirably. It is extraordinary that the Government should say that the case for privatisation is proved because public ownership has failed the nation and it means bad service and high costs. Here we have probably one of the best loved commercial institutions in the country. The gas service is admired for its efficiency and indeed for its profitability&#x2014;a profitability which would have been even greater had it not been for the tax burdens laid upon it by the present Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02625">The order brings in a piecemeal operation, with subsidiaries taking well-used assets from the public sector. Under the Act the BGC will be excluded from oil production. Of course in exploring for gas the corporation has to deal with the oil that it finds in the process, and instead of that source of income being used commercially to offset some of the corporation's other social liabilities, it will be taken over by others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02626">I believe that it was in July of last year that the Government directed the BGC to dispose of its 50 per cent. interest in production licensing, covering over 100 square miles in Dorset, including the Wytch Farm oilfield. We know the sorry story about the sales following privatisation in a number of areas, and I think that the time has come when we should be insisting that the BGC oil assets are not sold below valuation. Perhaps the Minister will say something
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0299"/>
<col>581</col>
about that, because if we are talking about the transfer of assets from BGC to subsidiaries, we ought to know something about the income which BGC will receive from the assets being taken away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02627">The BGC oil assets produced profits which helped to subsidise some of its social responsibilities, and helped the consumers with gas prices. It seems that that help will not be available because the profits will go elsewhere; and I think that the Minister ought to comment on ways in which this shortcoming will be met. Perhaps he will tell the House whether private operators will pay tax, as the BGC does at the moment. Will he say whether private enterprise will pay the taxes which have been imposed upon the Gas Council up until now? Will they be paying tax to the Government in the way in which previous owners have done? There are of course considerable oil reserves which the BGC should be allowed not only to explore, but to develop and to profit from. But the Act takes away that facility.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02628">British Gas makes a substantial contribution to the Treasury. I understand that the corporation tax paid in January 1982 amounted to about &#x00A3;130 million. From its oilfield interests it also is liable for petroleum revenue tax and supplementary petroleum duty. The Government imposed a gas levy payable on gas that they buy from the North Sea oilfields; that was introduced in the period 1980&#x2013;81. In that year the gas levy was &#x00A3;129 million&#x2014;a tax on gas paid by the consumer into the Exchequer. In 1981&#x2013;82 the gas levy was &#x00A3;394 million, and it is forecast that in the year 1982&#x2013;83 the figure will be about &#x00A3;600 million. I am not sure whether the forecast will be affected by the present policy and the first steps in the order towards privatising the assets that are now publicly held.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02629">Can the Minister tell the House how the changes in the order and other orders for privatisation that are to follow will affect such taxation prospects and the returns to the Treasury? It is all very well for the Prime Minister and others on the Government side to say that public ownership means higher costs; but of course they have imposed this taxation on the Gas Council, the Gas Council gets the blame for putting up prices, and the Government have always had the assets which arise from that policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02630">What is to be the future of the subsidiaries mentioned in the order when they are privatised? Is there to be a sale of the major percentage of the BGC interests?&#x2014;not just 51 per cent. but up to 100 per cent. I ask that because I believe that in the course of the debates on the legislation the Government have said that there is no limit. We start at 51 per cent., which takes away the public control and accountability from this massively successful enterprise, and we could end up with the whole lot being sold off. During the earlier debates the Government said that though they were selling 51 per cent. or more, they could still retain control with a "golden share". How will that happen if we have no shareholdings whatsoever?</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02631">I realise that the Minister might say that these points will have to follow later in future orders, but if we are starting on the road, with this early order, we have a right to know what the Government have in mind. So, how will control over the general assets which have been privatised continue to be exercised? These are questions to which I believe the House will want to know the answers.</p>
<col>582</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02632">Although the BGC is to be excluded from oil production under the Act, it can still continue to explore for gas. In that case, can the Minister assure the house that when its oil is taken over the the BNOC, the BGC will still be able to exercise its rights to gather gas? This is an important question in the light of the changes which are taking place in the North Sea areas and with privatisation coming on.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02633">Although we are debating what appears to be a limited order&#x2014;the first steps towards privatisation&#x2014;it is important for us to see a few steps ahead so far as Government policy in this matter is concerned, so that we can determine not only the relevance, but also the rightness, of the policy that we are discussing tonight. We have been told that subsidiary A could be sold to an individual purchaser, and that subsidiaries B, C, D and E could be sold separately to other buyers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02634">I am sure that there is concern on all sides of the House about the need for an overall fuel and energy policy, but how does this make it easier for the Government of the day to make sure that the stewardship of the resources is being properly handled? How can we still be represented on the various boards, councils, and organisations which run both publicly- and privately-owned resources in the North Sea area? Shall we still be at the table, or shall we be shut out while the private sector takes over completely?</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02635">In my final remarks I want to put to the Minister a number of questions that I believe arise from the order. I am sure that the replies will be of interest not only to my noble friends, but also to noble Lords on the Government side. I say that because the fact is&#x2014;and this should be recognised as being increasingly important&#x2014;that whatever may be our views about the policy, about the rightness of selling or not selling the assets, once the decision is taken, all sides of the House, all parties, have an increasing responsibility to see that the mechanism for so doing contains adequate safeguards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02636">Therefore it is so important that we should not take sides, saying perhaps that we are for what is said on this side, or against what is said on the Government side, because we are all in this together. During the stages of the Bill it was quite clear that to many of the policy questions there were no answers at all. I shall not suggest with any great force that the Government had no right to bring forward a Bill before having thought out every single conclusion. But I do suggest that on major policy decisions, or on policy matters which may point us in one direction or another, we have a right to know what the Government have been thinking during the long weeks of the Recess and since the Bill received the Royal Assent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02637">I must say&#x2014;and I say this sincerely&#x2014;that some of the Ministers here tonight and, indeed, those who took part in the discussions on the Bill probably did as good a job in getting the Bill through as anyone could do in view of the lack of policy decisions and the details that were available at that time; but the time for them to be more specific has now arrived and, indeed, is long overdue. So the order brings into effect, as we say, several sections of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02638">With regard to Section 32, which was debated here as putting the Secretary of State above the law in so far
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0300"/>
<col>583</col>
as he could order both corporations, the Gas Corporation and BNOC, to do things which were not covered by legislation, will the noble Earl say what action has been taken with regard to Section 32 in relation to the overriding of any enactment? That, I think, is an important question. The House gave the Minister that massive power, and I think he should account for that particular section of it. Will the noble Earl say what consultations have taken place with regard to the disposal of British Gas Corporation assets since the passing of the Act, and with what result? Can we be told what method of disposal is to be adopted? Obviously, we do not expect the Minister to come with a detailed survey of that, but we should like to know what thinking has taken place, especially since the issue of the review by the Public Accounts Committee of the early effects of privatisation&#x2014;Amersham and all that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02639">May I ask whether the Secretary of State will be taking advantage of Section 11(5) of the Act by transferring the assets to himself, which he has power to do? Under the operating agreements the Gas Corporation partners have a first right of refusal in the event of any party wishing to dispose of its shares. Can we be told how these rights will he looked after, and how the BGC partners in the various consortia are to be protected? Because it seems to me that the order goes against those built-in rights. Or perhaps the Government may say that the massive powers of the Secretary of State enable him to extinguish all these rights which have existed up till now and which I hope will continue into the future. Are the Government aware that many have been saying&#x2014;experts in the City, and many others who should know&#x2014;that the present time is not the best time to sell? The Minister may say, "We are not selling by this order", but we hope he will take into account the concern on all sides of the House, and, indeed, in many areas of the country, about the future aspects of this policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02640">Another question&#x2014;I am sorry to ask so many, but I think they are important questions&#x2014;is: Can we be told about the Government's intentions regarding compensation to BGC? Here we have assets being taken away, and, obviously, the use of these assets were all a part of the financial and commercial structure of the corporation. If they are being taken away, what about compensation? These assets, as we told the Government during the passage of the Bill, have been created and financed by the consumers of British Gas, as British Gas has been self-financing for many years. If subsidiaries holding the assets are to be sold or deleted from the balance sheet, the cost falls on the consumer. So if there is no counterbalance to these assets which are going out, then, of course, the consumer and the Gas Corporation will be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02641">I believe that the need for a comprehensive and overall fuel policy is important, and I hope that in the changes that will follow from the implementation of this Act the Government will bear in mind very much the need to keep a comprehensive policy as far as possible under public control, as indeed such a vital asset must be in the interests of the nation. We have debated the possibility of the disposal of assets to foreign or non-EEC hands, and I think that in future policy-making the Government should bear this in
<col>584</col>
mind. Noble Lords may recall that the first five amendments at the Committee stage of the Bill were all concerned with keeping control of the assets&#x2014;not selling more than 49 per cent. That has been decided. We also wanted to ensure that the assets, when sold, did not go into foreign hands; and there were other safeguards that we sought as well.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02642">Of course, we shall expect the Government to keep Parliament informed on future developments, especially, as I say, the Secretary of State has power to override legislation. In that case I am sure the House would agree that to whom much power is given much accountability is expected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02643">Finally, British Gas has a commendable record and is a great asset by way of the service it has given over many years. We want to ensure that, whatever changes take place, the British public will continue to be as well served in the future, though it may be under different auspices, as it has been in the past. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02644">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the British Gas Corporation (Disposal of Offshore Oilfield Interests) Directions 1982 [S.I. 1982 No. 1131], laid before the House on 6th August 1982, be annulled.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Bishopston</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02645">8.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02646"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while supporting the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, from these Benches, I think we should make it quite clear that the reason we do so is that, as far as I understand it, these orders are the technical enactment trigger that will start making the privatisation process a reality. All we are asking the Government in this case (if you call this the first pressure, as I believe it is called in military terms) is to restrain their finger on the trigger until perhaps the market conditions are a little better.<lb/>
But now that the orders are before us, I think the first question that must arise is: Why is the complexity of the scheme apparently so necessary? I seem to recall that there was a very straightforward scheme, to which I do not think we on these Benches objected, under which these assets were to be hived off into one company in which the BGC could still retain an interest. That seems to me a very straightforward way if these assets have to be hived off from the British Gas Corporation, and I have no objection in principle that they should dispose of their oil assets. Nevertheless, I think there is a complexity in the orders put before us. It may be that they have to go this way under the procedures in the Act; but there is obviously much more to privatisation than meets the eye, and I think much more than the Government first thought of when they wished to implement this ideological view.<lb/>
But now that we are on this road, I think the other question we should like to ask is: What value is being put on the assets which are to be disposed of under these orders, bearing in mind that the asset value of oil companies relative to their share prices is very far removed? I would think that in many cases oil companies in the market are now as low as 10 per cent. of their asset value, in others it is not so much. Therefore, on what basis is the valuation going to be made? If it is on asset value, I have a suspicion that the British Gas Corporation will be jolly pleased to be rid of them. It is very difficult to sell oil shares in the present market conditions, and if the Corporation can
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0301"/>
<col>585</col>
find a good buyer on asset value then they will do a very good deal. On the other hand, if they sell off at a market value, bearing in mind the depressed state of the market, which we keep emphasising to the Government, they will have a bad deal. In the same way, so will all those shareholders who have been encouraged to invest in Britoil. This is not the right time to launch a project of this size and, indeed, of this complexity.<lb/>
There was another point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston. I thought he was going on to say that the British Gas Corporation should be encouraged&#x2014;and, indeed, we had a whole debate on this subject in the House&#x2014;to continue and to expand their exploration activities until we know what the strength of our reserves really is. What happens if they hit oil? It is quite possible that while searching for gas&#x2014;and it is a risky business in many ways&#x2014;they will strike oil. What is going to happen when, although they were searching quite genuinely and their technicans said that they were looking for gas, they hit oil? Are they going to be licensed to develop this as part of their normal development of the rig, or have they got to give away the oil and start all over again until they find a pure gas well?<lb/>
I think the Government are going to say that, of course, if they are boring for gas and they strike oil, they will devolop the well. It is ridiculous to consider anything else. But let us look again at the complexity of these orders and wonder why! The only time I have seen a scheme of this complexity was, I think, in a capital tax avoidance scheme which was put to me some time ago. This was a wonderful way in which, by using subsidiaries in this way, one could transfer assets and somehow apparently escape the rigours of capital gains tax. It may be that the Government advisers found this scheme somewhere else and found it was suitable for the scheme that they had in mind. I wonder what that scheme is. Its complexity makes me slightly suspicious. Could it be that the Government are looking for &#x00A3;200 million to put into Britoil in order to get the balance sheet right before it is presented to the public, and that they are telling us that this is a very complicated procedure, that all this transfer of assets is very difficult and so on?<lb/>
But the reality of the matter is that they are &#x00A3;200 million short before they go to the market. I am not going to bring out the Britoil prospectus or develop ideas of what is wrong with it; but this &#x00A3;200 million is essential if Britoil is to be successful, Therefore, I should like to know what is the total value that the Secretary of State wishes to obtain from the sale of these assets. If it is in the region of &#x00A3;200 million, then I think that all this complexity really may be simply to bolster up the balance sheet of Britoil. Otherwise, perhaps the noble Earl would be able to explain from where they are going to get &#x00A3;200 million before they launch the prospectus. This is a matter which I am sure will come out in the course of other orders which will come before us.<lb/>
Let us bear in mind that because of the anticipated yields that Britoil is going to have, the Government will have to discount the assets of &#x00A3; 1.5 billion (which apparently they are) by 30 per cent. That produces net assets, up to that stage, of &#x00A3;1 billion and 51 per cent. is about &#x00A3;500 million, less of course the &#x00A3;200 million necessary for the working capital and the window
<col>586</col>
dressing of the balance sheet. Therefore net gain overall for the taxpayer for the whole operation, by my very rough calculation, is only about &#x00A3;300 million. I ask the noble Earl whether he could give us his guidance on what is the value that he expects to obtain from the sale of these assets.<lb/>
I have three more questions. Will these orders in any way affect good relations that the British Gas Corporation already enjoy with the oil companies? I assume the answer must he no; but I think it only correct for the noble Earl to put on the record that this working relationship will continue. The other question I have for the Minister is this: Will there be an opportunity for employee participation in the shares of these multiple subsidiaries from B to F? Will the employees have an opportunity to participate, as they do under the Statement that he made earlier this afternoon in the House?<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, I come back to the point that I started with, the point that I am here tonight to support the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, and, in doing so, to ask the Government whether they will not hesitate a little longer and at least give the House a clearer indication as to what they consider are the right market conditions before they pull the trigger on this massive Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02647">8.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02648"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are many reasons why I am interested in this and one of them is the importance to employment in the pottery industry. Gas is being used quite a lot in the pottery industry and the price of this gas has a great deal to do with the value of our exports and in keeping up employment. At the present moment North Staffordshire and the Stoke-on-Trent area, which is one of the most famous in the world for the pottery industry, is in difficulties. The question that arises is this. What benefit are these intricate orders going to give to those people who use their sources of energy to build up our exports? We are now discussing Statutory Instrument 1982 No. 1131 on the British Gas Corporation. I do not think that one person in a hundred in Britain and probably not five out of 20 in both Houses of Parliament really appreciate what will be the impetus of this statutory instrument upon the privatisation and the subsidies that will be necessary. What does the order do? Frankly, I consider it is petty, contemptible and shot through with the spiteful acquisitiveness of a Government which is probably the most heartless Government in the 20th century. Even financiers have found fault, and with good reason, with some of the methods of privatisation that have been entered into. I will quote the <i>Financial Times</i> on that a little later. I am not plucking that out of the air&#x2014;as I was accused of doing the other day over the fair wages clause, when the Minister himself did not seem to be aware.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02649"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: That is right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02650"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: We had to find jobs and shares for somebody under this order, which is a preparation for privatisation, to set up six subsidiaries and to fiddle and mess around with production and profits. British Gas has four minority interests in four North Sea oil licences. A 64,000-dollar question has just been asked by the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw&#x2014;what if the gas
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0302"/>
<col>587</col>
people, in their search for gas, discover oil? What is the puzzle we are then faced with in this apotheosis of privatisation? Have we abandoned completely the middle-of-the-road approach that 20 per cent. of British industry could very well be public enterprise. I will not use the old-fashioned word "nationalisation" which in the Coal Board and others has served its purpose, and certainly so in the Post Office.<lb/>
British Gas then has these four minority interests which have been qualified and mentioned by both noble Lords who have already spoken. The Government's apparent interest in monetarism fails to realise that, in the United States of America, 11 million people are looking for jobs and the walls of the temple of monetarism are crumbling. So are they in this country. The human misery and the massive unemployment and the indignity imposed upon the British people by the apotheosis of monetarism is partly seen in this statutory instrument. What do they do? They set up new minor and (1 use the expression) "tory quangos". There are to be these subsidiary concerns: "B", "C", "D", "E", each of which will hold little hits of the British Gas Corporation's oil interests. Into one subsidiary we will put about 25 per cent. shares in one British Gas Corporation licence in the Fulmar field, for example. A completely new subsidiary will be established into which will be put a 25 per cent. share in, say, the North-West Hutton Field. All is a mixture, with no analysis of what happens when they come across oil in their own right; and this grand principle of privatisation is introduced by the party opposite because it is in power. "It is right to do that", they may say, "because we won the last election. "But they did not bring all these features of their policy before the public. We are going to set up four new chairmen. We are going to set up new companies, boards, rooms, chandeliers, cigar cutters and the lot. It is one of the biggest quangos and it is going to put money into the pockets of those who are able to invest in it. The House should have a full debate on this matter, and we should know what happens. What are we doing by this piece of tricky inosculated legislation? We are privatising public money. We are using public money to prop up these quangos. Amersham was a typical example. Our control will be completely lost.<lb/>
Now I want to quote something. Even the City is cynical about these high subsidies to the stock market and speculators buying public bargains. The man in the street has not a clue about this. The <i>Financial Times</i> "Lex" column referring to British Airways, pointed out:
<quote>"the Government seems determined to stuff&#x2026;British Airways, with hefty sums of cash (not to mention what may have to be provided to top up its pension fund) and tow it down the privatisation runway&#x2026;to sell off a sick company in a cyclically depressed industry&#x2014;in which much of the competition is state-subsidised".</quote>
People have forgotten this. It is subsidies backwards to private enterprise. It is through an artificial injection of funds and they are trying to justify it. The <i>Financial Times</i> said on 11th October of this year:
<quote>"The Government should not, with troubled industries, be allowed to underwrite their prospectus profits with taxpayers' money".</quote>
<col>588</col>
The question that arises from me is: How much of a taxpayer's money ultimately will have to subsidise these enterprises? The acquisitive society in which we are living seems to have gone mad and the country must know at the next election, from whichever party may win, that we cannot go on like this, crumbling the walls of public enterprise that has been set up over many years and a generation to please pettifogging party ideas which are interfering with the standard of living and the possibilities of our exports. This is one of the major mistakes of the Government opposite.<lb/>
I have spoken for long enough at the end of the term and I do not want to bore the House and I hope I have not bored the House. I am sure that the Government will give us an opportunity to have a full debate. The Government have many men who are as kindhearted as I am with the world. On both sides of the House we want to see a different system of living. I assure the House that there is something wrong about this apotheosis of a monetary system and of the whole business of privatisation of things that have been built up by the mass of the people whatever their politics. Are we going to have 20 per cent. of enterprise in Britain under public control? Most of it is as profitable as most of the international companies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02651">8.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02652"><member>Lord Briginshaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join my noble friend Lord Davies in assuring the House that I do not propose to make a lengthy speech at the end of the proceedings. But I must congratulate my noble friend Lord Bishopston and also the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, if I may, on leaving the Minister with a number of pertinent questions, which I am sure he will deal with in due course. In speaking to the Motion for annulment, and in support of my noble friend Lord Bishopston, it seems to me not only appropriate but necessary to restate some key contributions made when this House, in Committee on 4th May 1982, discussed the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Bill, Clause I, entitled: "Oil Corporation's power of disposal". On that occasion Lord Bishopston moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>"Page 2, line 2, after ('shares') insert ('not exceeding in value 49 per cent. of the total').".</quote>
These are worth restating in justification of the Motion this evening, because my noble friend brought out the essence of the problems before us. The noble Lord said at col. 1051 of <i>Hansard:</i>
<quote>"I beg to move the amendment standing in my name and in the names of my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw. This is a very important and controversial Bill and is the legislative background for the privatisation of much of the BNOC and some of the British Gas Corporation".</quote>
My noble friend Lord Bishopston emphasised this at that time&#x2014;and I reiterate it:
<quote>"The oil-producing business of BNOC is to be transferred to a subsidiary called Britoil, and 51 per cent. of the shares are to be sold to the public. The Bill is an important one because it concerns a very significant aspect of our national resources&#x2014;energy assets&#x2014;and the Committee will want to proceed responsibily and constructively to look at some of the provisions within it.".</quote>
Lord Bishopston went on in his contribution to say that in some ways Amendments Nos. 1 to 5 which have been restated this evening,
<quote>"are all very much concerned with the control of the assets, with whether they shall be in the hand of the nation, as we believe they must be, or whether they shall be privatised and fragmented.".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0303"/>
<col>589</col>
That is another important aspect. He continued.
<quote>"This is an important measure, but in some respects it has little, or very little, to do with the enhancing of Britain's fuel and power policy, as one will conclude from the Minister's Second Reading speech.".</quote>
With respect, I could have drawn noble Lord's attention to the foregoing in the record for their reading; but we are here today to give emphasis to our Motion for annulment of the order, to which we refer in the Motion. If it is true that the Bill itself is controversial&#x2014;and it certainly is&#x2014;then it is perfectly proper for us to localise&#x2014;as I am trying to do&#x2014;the points of contest and bring the circumstances and the importance of matters into reality. As we examine the privatisation phraseology, in addition to what has already been contributed this evening, we see that it is a word being used, I suggest, as a cosmetic to cover the inner reality of the Government's intentions&#x2014;and detail has already come into our discussions here.<lb/>
The enabling of the public to take shares in Britoil diverts attention. I am suggesting, from the realities of the Goverment's intent which my noble friend Lord Bishopston so ably and responsibly drew to your Lordships' attention earlier&#x2014;and he has done so this evening&#x2014;in his original contribution in Committee which I feel justified in restating today.<lb/>
What I think we are trying to do on this side of your Lordships' House is to avoid our country being taken on this dangerous journey which the Government have chosen. The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, on 4th May drew timely attention to what is lacking in policy direction; and with your Lordships' indulgence, even at this late hour, I would quote him, because it appears to be almost classic. He posed a question. He said at col. 105 and I quote:
<quote>"I stand to be corrected, but l think there is nothing said on what will he the future policy of the Government. Who will devise it? If the government answer if that it is a public company, it is like any other oil company and can decide policies which best suit them or what they believe to be their shareholders, in terms of investment and of purchasing equipment from abroad or from British companies. It is fair enough to say that, but I ask: What is this 49 per cent. there for? Is it just to sit there and watch the company become non-British, or is it there to protect the Britishness"&#x2014;</quote>
I like that word&#x2014;
<quote>"of Britoil? That is what I believe most people imagine Britoil to be as a company: and they will put their money in it on that basis."</quote>
I personally feel sure that your Lordships will accept the logic of what the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, poses. I have not heard any answers so far as policy is concerned to the questions posed at that time.<lb/>
The amendment for annulment seeks at this eleventh hour to save the nation from what is a possible severe loss in the Goverment's reckless pursuance of its doctrinaire course in so fragmenting a part of the nation's energy resources. I suggest that the world is awash with oil at the present time and is likely to continue to be so for some years to come. That is the view I put forward for your Lordships' consideration today.<lb/>
The price the Government expect to derive from this sale of a national asset may seriously fall short of the target. It is a great gamble. It is, I am suggesting, a wanton distribution of the nation's assets, and I hope we shall have persuaded your Lordships to support the annulment as proposed in the Motion this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02653"><member>Lord Balogh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this measure before you is a foolish effort on the basis of a foolish theory and a foolish Government. What is quite certain is that the percentage of profits taken by the Government will decrease. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Energy extol a return to the market&#x2014;a market which automatically secures an optimal distribution of resources. But such a market never existed and it will certainly never exist in the future with bigger and bigger companies depressing the numbers in order to get a full scope for their accumulating. What .they imply is a general existence of free and perfect competition, but what we have is a very imperfect market in which the big units fight each other but at the same time try to break through to the source of profits.<lb/>
No better illustration can be given of what sort of market we have than the price of oil, which is going up and down and up at the same time as the price for the purchase of these companies diminishes. They bewail the policy of the previous Government and condemn it, but what the previous Government did was to depress the price of the gas and oil which they took from the foreign companies and increase the "take". Therefore, any upward pressure on the prices of oil is likely to go with an increase in the take of the public.<lb/>
Together with the mutilating of Britoil, one can foresee increases in price, in the price margins and in the profits flowing to the main private companies. But the main private companies are mostly foreign owned, or at least foreign controlled, so that the situation is at least very galling. Perhaps there will be a time when the present Government realise the evil aspects of their way and will allow us to get back to a steady growth.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02655"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome this debate for a variety of reasons, and not least because it will, I hope, enable me to explain the purpose of these regulations and what it is that we are about. The debate has given noble Lords an opportunity of raking over the still warm ashes of the Gas and Oil (Enterprise) Act, and a few old prejudices have been produced for the general edification of your Lordships. I do not know why it is that when the Labour Party carries out its policy it is regarded, at least by it, as leading to a new Jerusalem or a new Garden of Eden&#x2014;I suppose according to whether one is urban or landward orientated. But when this side of the House, so to speak, starts to do what it was elected to do, great cries so up.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw&#x2014;and I really wonder whether he was thinking about what he was saying&#x2014;said that the complexity of these regulations was due to some nefarious desire on the part of the Government to salt away &#x00A3;200 million, which has something to do with Britoil, and absolutely nothing to do with the issue that we are discussing tonight. I really wonder, when he looks at what he said in <i>Hansard</i>, whether he will think that is a great contribution to our times as a debating Chamber.<lb/>
I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Briginshaw, when he said that a number of pertinent questions had been put to me. In fact most of them are impertinent. I use the word in its very strict sense, and for a particular reason&#x2014;because these are preliminary regulations and will in no sense affect the tactical way
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0304"/>
<col>591</col>
in which privatisation will eventually take place. I shall explain why in a moment.<lb/>
The general objective is to initiate preliminary work&#x2014;and I stress that phrase&#x2014;towards the disposal of the British Gas Corporation's interest in the Beryl A and B, Montrose, Hutton, North West Hutton and Fulmar oilfields. But no decisions have yet been taken on how the disposal will subsequently be carried out. The intention is, therefore, to keep open all possible options.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw said: "Don't pull the trigger". But in order to pull the trigger and to achieve something you must have a gun in your hand and, hopefully, something in the chamber. If we are to continue with this illustration, what these directions do is to open up a number of different options as to the type of weaponry which might be employed.<lb/>
Within this framework, the directions have four detailed objectives. The first is to provide for the interests to be "packaged" into new companies, so as to open up the option of disposing of them in company form. On this point, we could have provided for all the interests to be transferred to a single new company, but this would have limited unnecessarily the disposal options available. The interests relate to four licence areas. They can, therefore, be separated into four different companies. In the interests of maintaining flexibility, we have provided for such a separation. We have also provided for the four separate companies to be all owned by a new holding company, so that a disposal of all the companies together could easily be carried out simply by disposing of the holding company.<lb/>
Clauses 2 and 4 of the directions accordingly require BGC to establish five subsidiaries, referred to, simply and graphically, as A, B, C, D and E. The intention is that B, C, D and E will each hold the interests relating to one of the licence areas. Subsidiary A will be the holding company which will own B, C, D and E.<lb/>
Clauses 3 and 5 of the directions provide for schemes to be drawn up, under Section 10 of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act, to transfer the interests to the new companies. In order to arrive at the position we are aiming for, two schemes are needed. The first will transfer all the interests to subsdiary A, in return for the issue of shares by subsdiary A to the corporation. The second will then transfer the interests on to B, C. D and E, in return for the issue of shares by B, C. D and E to A.<lb/>
Once these schemes have been implemented, a number of disposal options will be available. All of the assets, in the form of subsidiary A, could be floated on the Stock Exchange. Alternatively, A could be sold to a single purchaser. Subsidiaries B, C, D and E could be sold separately to different purchasers. It would also still be possible to undertake a direct sale of the interests themselves, rather than of the companies holding the interests. Of course, it is complicated, but, as I have said, it is to provide as many options as possible.<lb/>
I appreciate that noble Lords will be disappointed that I cannot say at this juncture which of these options will be adopted. There will, though, be a further opportunity for the House to debate the Government's proposals if it so wishes. The directions
<col>592</col>
laid in the Recess&#x2014;and I shall come to these&#x2014;are not sufficient by themselves to bring about the disposal. This will require a further statutory instrument, which will either consist of a second direction to BGC instructing them to carry out the disposal, or an order, under Section 11(5) of the Act, transferring the new subsidiaries to the Secretary of State prior to the disposal being carried out by him. As has been guessed at&#x2014;I do not use that word "guessed" in the pejorative sense&#x2014;on present plans, the Government envisage issuing a Section 11(5) order. But in either case the statutory instrument involved would be subject to the negative resolution procedure as this one is. Therefore, Parliament will definitely have an opportunity to call for a further debate. At that stage, I anticipate that the Government would certainly be in a position to say which disposal option was being proposed. It will be at that point as well that we will be able to give our views on issues such as whether it would be appropriate for the articles of association to include any provisions against undesirable changes in control, and the sort of things that we debated when the main Act was before your Lordships. I cannot speculate tonight, simply because such points have not yet been settled.<lb/>
The second objective of the directions is to provide for participation arrangements to be established in relation to the interests before they are disposed of. Clause 3(2) of the directions calls, first, for arrangements for 51 per cent. participation to be established between subsidiary A and BGC. Subsidiary A's obligations under these arrangements will then, by virtue of Clause 5(1), be passed to B, C. D and E. The corporation's corresponding rights will, by virtue of Clause 7, he transferred to a sixth new subsidiary, referred to as subsidiary F.<lb/>
The net effect at this stage will be the establishment of participation arrangements between the four subsidiaries holding the interests and subsidiary F. But the Government intend subsequently to use Section 11(5) of the Act to transfer subsidiary F's shares to the Secretary of State, with a view to vesting them in BNOC. The final outcome will, therefore, be the establishment of participation arrangements between BNOC and the four new companies holding the interests. These arrangements will then continue to apply after the disposal regardless of the disposal route adopted.<lb/>
Of course, I appreciate that this is complicated, but I anticipate that, having read the <i>Official Report</i>, the matter will be quite clear, particularly so far as participation is concerned. One has to get the rights vesting, as they are at the moment, back to BNOC. At least so far as participation is concerned, I hope that this part of the exercise will be welcome to noble Lords opposite, who I know are not over-enthusiastic about the main object of these directions.<lb/>
The third objective of the directions is to provide for an independent petroleum consultant to prepare reports evaluating the interests. Such reports will be an essential requirement for the disposal, whichever way it is ultimately carried out. In parenthesis, it is obvious that at this stage I cannot say what conclusion the independent consultant will come to. The fourth objective is to require BGC to compile, or cause to be compiled, such information about the activities of subsidiaries A, B, C. D and E as may facilitate their disposal. In particular, this will involve the prepara
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0305"/>
<col>593</col>
tion of an accountant's report of the sort which appears in a prospectus for an offer for sale. The compilation of this will enable the Government to keep the flotation option open.<lb/>
That explains the matter and what I shall now try to do, shortly, is to answer some of the points which have been put to me. If I do not answer them all, I will try to do so by correspondence. The first matter which the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, raised was about the regulations being laid in August. I have to confess that the Government would have liked to lay them before the end of term, so to speak, but, unfortunately, it proved impracticable. In fact, nothing has really been lost.<lb/>
I say that for a number of reasons. First, there is no question of concealment, or of trying to get something through without its being known and debated. As these directions deal only with preliminary work towards the disposal of BGC's offshore oil assets, and do not bring about the disposal, nor do they say how the disposal will he carried out, nothing has been done under these regulations which is irreversible. It is therefore, in my submission, by no means improper for the regulations to have been laid in the Parliamentary Recess. No money has been spent and thrown away. Nothing has been done which could not be reversed if Parliament decided that what the Government are doing is wrong.<lb/>
The next point which was raised by the noble Lord was the taxation policy. The new owners, if I may use a slightly sloppy phrase, will he subject to exactly the same tax r&#x00E9;gime as at present obtains for all other private companies operating in the North Sea. So they will be subject to the same general taxation r&#x00E9;gime as applies at present. The noble Lord then asked whether there will be any changes to the gas levy. The answer to that is, no. The gas levy relates to the corporation's gas business. It will be entirely unaffected by the disposal of the corporation's oil interests in the business. The noble Lord asked what proportion of the British Gas Corporation's oil interests will be disposed of. The present plans of the Government are that 100 per cent. of its oil interests should be disposed of.<lb/>
The noble Lord next asked about the exploration role of the British Gas Corporation and, I think, quoted Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act. What I say to the noble Lord about that is that no decisions have been taken to change the exploration role of the British Gas Corporation. Its proper role is to supply and distribute gas rather than oil. Therefore, the Government have in effect told the corporation that in applying for Eighth Round licences it should limit applications to areas of gas prospectivity.<lb/>
I now come to a question which was asked by a number of noble Lords, but in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek: what happens if the corporation, while pursuing its role of trying to discover gas, in effect gets a gusher of oil? It will be the Government's intention to privatise any future oil discovery in due course, and I make no bones about saying that. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, thought that this was at variance with Section 2(2); but I would remind him that what it says is that the corporation shall have power in particular to search and bore for and get natural gas and to bore for and get petroleum found in the form of crude oil in the course of searching, boring for or getting natural gas.<lb/>
<col>594</col>
In other words, if it does get oil, even under the 1972 Act, it is an ancillary part of its role to obtain and distribute gas.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked whether there had been any consultation. I would remind him that under Section 11(1) of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act the Secretary of State is required to consult the corporation before issuing directions. The corporation was fully consulted before the directions were issued. It is only right to say that the points raised by the corporation are confidential to the corporation and the Government, but the Government consider that the points raised were satisfactorily resolved.<lb/>
The noble Lord&#x2014;if I am taking time to answer his questions it is because I treat them seriously&#x2014;asked whether the eventual disposal of the oil interests of the British Gas Corporation would in any way lead to a lessening of control by the Government over North Sea oil. A point I want to emphasise is that the framework of regulatory controls which the Government, and in particular my right honourable friend, can exercise, the participation agreements and the tax r&#x00E9;gime are, taken together, fully adequate to ensure that the nation derives proper and, indeed, all possible benefit from our oil. All this will remain in force. I do not think I need to remind the House of all the various regulatory controls which the Secretary of State for Energy can call upon, if necessary. The noble Lord asked whether the Government or the Secretary of State would make use of Section 11(5). As I have said, that is at the moment the road which the Government see themselves going down.<lb/>
Finally, there was the point that this is not the right time to do it. I hope that, whatever the differences as between one side of the House and the other on either the wisdom or the desirability of privatising the British Gas Corporation's oil interests, the noble Lord now understands that at some stage one has to get the preliminaries settled and the framework erected. That is what these regulations do.<lb/>
I come to the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, who asked about the valuation of the assets. I think I have pretty well answered that point. I cannot comment on the extent or the value of the assets, but what I can say is that the actual disposal&#x2014;the next stage&#x2014;will go ahead, as I explained to the House earlier this afternoon in relation to Britoil, only if the position is right in the circumstances of the time which then obtain.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about employee participation. I have to tell him that this has not yet been considered, but I have no doubt that it will be and that, in the same way as my right honourable friend and the Government are keen that employees should, in a proper way, participate in a disposal of this kind, their interests will be taken into account.<lb/>
"Will the directions affect the British Gas Corporation's relations with oil companies?", asked the noble Lord. For the life of me, I cannot see that they can and no reason, indeed, why they should. However, I shall reflect upon that and, if I do see a reason, I will get in touch with the noble Lord. The noble Lord then spoke about the Britoil part of it. I hope he now realises that this is nothing to do with Britoil. It is entirely the British Gas Corporation.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Briginshaw, spoke about the 49 per cent. of state shareholding. He is going back to
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0306"/>
<col>595</col>
the oil side of the Oil and Gas Enterprise Act. This has nothing to do with the present exercise which, as I have said, is a preliminary towards the privatisation of the oil interests of the British Gas Corporation.<lb/>
I hope that I have reasonably comprehensively answered the points, or most of them. I want to emphasise that what is included in these proposals should not and does not constitute an attack on the British Gas Corporation. The corporation has many successes to its credit and one hopes that it will respond constructively to the challenges which it faces and which it will continue to face in carrying out its main business&#x2014;that is, the supply of gas. But I have to repeat that we see no reason why nationalised gas utilities, such as the British Gas Corporation, should be involved in oil production, when the history of North Sea oil development is one essentially of successful private enterprise. Contrary to what has been said by some noble Lords opposite this evening, we believe that the nation's best interests will be served by providing for the oilfields to be developed in the private sector. Therefore. I commend the directions to the House as the first step towards this goal.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02657"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain the House for more than a minute amount of time of about 60 seconds in making my final remarks. I believe that your Lordships will feel that, whether we agree with the Minister's conclusions or not, he has done his hest to answer the many questions which we have asked of him tonight. I want to stress a point I made during my speech: that whether we agree with the Government's overall policy or not, we all have a real duty and responsibility, when these orders or legislation come before us in relation to this Act, to give them the closest examination&#x2014;and this applies particularly to Members on the other side as well.<lb/>
I believe the Government will accept that those who accept their policy of privatisation and those who do not have a right to see the future policy of the Government in more than little pieces. One felt tonight that this was a rather small part of the policy. No managing director, if I might use that term in relation to the noble Earl tonight, would go to his board of directors and give them just a small part of his policy. They would naturally and rightly demand to see more of the prospective and future policy as well, to see how it all fits together. So although one recognises that there are areas of confidentiality which the Government cannot disclose, we do expect&#x2014;and tonight we have been given it&#x2014;the fullest co-operation from the Government in respect of these matters.<lb/>
I shall not be pressing the amendment of the order. We welcome the opportunity we have had to debate the replies from the Minister, and I am grateful to my noble friends and others who have taken part in the debate. I believe we would all agree in our hope that the Government will take note of the many constructive suggestions which have been made tonight, and we hope that the Government will bear them in mind when future policy decisions are to be taken.</membercontribution></p>

However, we have not yet decided how to respond to them. As the noble Lord will be aware, the Select Committee on Home Affairs in another place are conducting an inquiry into procedures for the investigation of possible miscarriages of justice. This includes the way in which claims for compensation are dealt with, and we do not wish to anticipate their report.</p>

In this instance. I understand that solicitors representing the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis attended the civil proceedings and advised that no fresh allegations arose during them. Accordingly, the Metropolitan police do not propose to initiate further inquiries into the conduct of the police officers involved.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02676">Whether they intend to retain the rule stated in the Industrial Injuries Compensation document reprinted in March 1980 (page 53) that widow's benefit ceases on remarriage, but that a woman widowed as a result of an industrial accident qualifies for a gratuity of a year's pension (then &#x00A3;1,240): and how many women have qualified for this gratuity since 1979.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02677"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: I refer the noble Lord to the White Paper entitled <i>Reform of the Industrial Injuries Scheme</i><sup>*</sup> published last November in which Her Majesty's Government announced the proposal to abolish industrial death benefit as part of a reconstruction of the scheme. In 1980. 273 widows qualified for such a gratuity and provisionally the number of widows who received a gratuity in 1981 was 200.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02680">Why the White Paper <i>Standards, Quality and International Competitiveness</i> does not emphasise the necessity for due consideration to be given to their likely acceptability internationally, in the development of new British Standards, particularly in advanced technologies such as information processing, storage and transmission.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02681"><member>The Secretary of State for Trade (Lord Cockfield)</member>: The White Paper on <i>Standards, Quality and International Competitiveness</i> makes a number of references to the importance of ensuring that British Standards reflect requirements of world markets. These apply equally to all sectors, including those using advanced technologies. The White Paper also recognises that a larger number of British Standards may need to be derived from foreign or international

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02700"><member>Lord Bellwin</member>: The proposal to reserve 24 acres at Marsh Lane, Angarrack for industrial and commercial development is contained in the Hayle Local Plan which was placed on deposit by Penwith District Council on 15th April 1982. In accordance with the statutory procedures, copies of the local plan were sent to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment who, following consultation with my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, decided not to object to any of the policies or proposals on the plan.</p>

The attacks on military installations and equipment proved very effective and no special action is being taken to procure new weapons for this purpose. The runway itself was attacked with 1000 lb. bombs, which had limited effectiveness, and when available the new JP 233 cratering weapon will be used for this type of target. So far as danger to the aircraft is concerned, JP 233 has been designed to avoid this.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02719"><i>"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons</i>,</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02720">"The Duke of Edinburgh and I have received much pleasure from the knowledge that so many people shared with us our happiness in the birth of a son to The Prince and Princess of Wales.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02721">"The Duke of Edinburgh and I were pleased to receive the State Visit of His Majesty The Sultan of Oman in March. We also recall with pleasure the pastoral visit of His Holiness Pope John Paul the Second in May, and the visit in June of the President of the United States of America and Mrs. Reagan as my guests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02722">"We look back with much satisfaction on the visits we have made this year. We were in Canada in
<col>604</col>
April to sign the proclamation of the Constitution Act 1982 and we are now concluding a tour including visits to Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Nauru, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Fiji. As Head of the Commonwealth I was present in Brisbane to close the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02723">"We were greatly saddened by the death in August of King Sobhuza of Swaziland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02724">"My Goverment welcomed the independence of Antigua and Barbuda and its decision to join the Commonwealth. They also welcomed the admission of the Republic of Maldives to membership of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02725">"My Government responded swiftly to Argentina's unlawful and unprovoked invasion of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. They made strenuous efforts to persuade the Argentine Government to withdraw their forces peacefully but were eventually obliged to resort to military action in self-defence and to protect the democratic rights of the Falkland Islanders. The Armed Services and the Merchant Navy have earned the gratitude of the nation by the courage, skill and devotion to duty they displayed in the course of their successful campaign. My Government profoundly regret the loss of life and casualties incurred. They have begun the urgent task of economic and social rehabilitation and further development of the Islands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02726">"My Government were deeply grateful for the support shown during the Falklands crisis by so great a proportion of the international community, in particular by the countries of the Commonwealth, the European Community and the North Atlantic Alliance, and by the dependent territories.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02727">"My Government welcomed the entry of Spain into the North Atlantic Alliance. They have continued to fulfil their commitment to real increases in defence spending and have announced further measures to strengthen our defences and make good the losses suffered during the Falklands conflict. They played an active role at the meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Alliance in June. They have taken part in Alliance consultations over the negotiations on intermediate range nuclear forces between the United States and the Soviet Union and have warmly welcomed the resumption of negotiations on strategic nuclear forces. They have played a full part at the Second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament and in other arms control and disarmament negotiations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02728">"With other members of the Alliance and of the European Community, my Government have condemned the imposition of martial law in Poland. They have continued to support efforts to restore the independent and non-aligned status of Afghanistan.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02729">"My Government have played a constructive role in the development of the European Community and were able to make useful progress during the period of the United Kingdom Presidency. They have continued to negotiate for an acceptable revised Common Fisheries Policy, and have participated in negotiations with Spain and Portugal on their forthcoming accession to the Community.</p>
<image src="S5LV0435P0I0311"/>
<col>605</col>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02730">"My Government have continued, with our Community partners, to seek a comprehensive settlement of the Arab/Israel dispute and an end to the conflict in the Lebanon with all its tragedies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02731">"My Government have participated in continued efforts to reach a settlement in Namibia and have supported attempts to solve the problem caused by the occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02732"><i>"Members of the House of Commons</i>,</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02733">"I thank you for the provision that you have made for the honour and dignity of the Crown and for the public services.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02734"><i>"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons</i>,</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02735">"My Government have maintained the economic policies necessary to strengthen the foundations of economic recovery. They have continued to make progress in reducing inflation and achieving lower interest rates and have helped business and individuals through tax changes and improved incentives designed to encourage the productive private sector and to promote the wider ownership of wealth. My Government believe that these policies offer the best hopes of achieving a lasting reduction in the present distressingly high levels of unemployment. Meanwhile, the help given under the special employment measures has been substantially increased.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02736">"Legislation has been passed to facilitate private investment in parts of the businesses of the British National Oil Corporation and the British Gas Corporation and to promote competition in the gas industry. An Act has been passed to reduce further the involvement of the public sector in transport.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02737">"Legislation has been passed to improve the law on industrial relations. A Youth Training Scheme has been drawn up, and other training arrangements have been improved. A comprehensive programme is being vigorously pursued to improve management and efficiency in the Civil Service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02738">"Legislation has been passed to protect ratepayers from supplementary rates and to improve the accountability and efficiency of local authorities. An Act has been passed to clarify the powers of the Greater London Council to provide travel concessions for the elderly and disabled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02739">"Provision has been made for the reestablishment of a representative Assembly in Northern Ireland, and elections to it have taken place. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, supported by the Army, have continued to serve the people of Northern Ireland with steadfastness, dedication, and courage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02740">"An Act has been passed to give the courts stronger and more flexible sentencing powers, especially in regard to young offenders, and to make other improvements in the criminal justice system. Legislation has been passed giving local authorities in England and Wales powers to regulate various activities which might otherwise cause nuisance or give offence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02741">"Acts have been passed to amend the law governing jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments
<col>606</col>
in civil and commercial matters and to improve the arrangements for legal aid in criminal cases and the general administration of justice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02742">"My Government have protected the real value of the retirement pension and other related benefits. The law on mental health in England and Wales has been reformed. An Act has been passed to establish a system of unified housing benefit and to place a duty on employers to provide sick pay during the early weeks of sickness.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02743">"In Scotland the law relating to civic government has been modernised and other changes have been made in local authorities' functions and responsibilities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02744"><i>"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons</i>,</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02745">"I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may attend you."</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02746">After which the Lord Chancellor said: "My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, by virtue of Her Majesty's Commission which has been now read we do, in Her Majesty's name, and in obedience to Her Majesty's Commands, prorogue this Parliament to Wednesday, the third day of November, to be then here holden, and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to Wednesday, the third day of this November next."</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02775">What steps are being considered to train National Health Service staff in the use of new technology.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02776"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: Health authorities and relevant professions are regularly concerned with training, or arrangements for training necessary for the application in the National Health Service of new technological developments over a wide range of disciplines and activities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02777">Departments, the National Training Council and National Staff Committees and the Common Services Agency for the Scottish Health Service have also promoted in the past few years, or have under consideration, a number of specific training initiatives in the field of information technology.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02778">These have included:</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02779">A major nursing seminar on the "state of the art" of computer based nursing and health care systems,

prediction of future trends and educational and training needs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02780">Training courses and appreciation seminars for NHS managers and other staff at various higher education institutions and at the Hospital Estate Management and Engineering Centre.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02781">Developmental studies on new applications of technology, including the establishment in one health district of an "office of the future" which will maximise the use of electronic equipment and avoid unnecessary paper work.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02789">Whether they will intervene to resolve the problems afflicting Tadworth Court Hospital in Surrey and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, to prevent the loss of Tadworth Court Hospital and reduction of beds in Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02790"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: The Hospitals for Sick Children are seriously overspending on their allocation which has not been cut. The board of governors has a duty to control expenditure to within its cash limit and is therefore reviewing all the hospitals' activities. Should the board decide that Tadworth Court should be closed this proposal will be referred to Ministers for final decision. We shall obviously wish to consider very carefully all the representations we receive before coming to decisions on any proposals of the kind that may be put to us. The closure of beds at Great Ormond Street is a temporary measure pending the outcome of the review. Should the board propose to prolong the closure of these beds, this too will come to Ministers for final decision.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02793"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: The number of cases is not known but the Attendance Allowance Board has suggested that where the situation arises it will consider issuing a short-term certificate of attendance needs to enable payment to continue until a medical examination can be arranged.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02808"><member>The Minister of State for Defence Procurement (Viscount Trenchard)</member>: Her Majesty's Government do not keep any central records of vacant factories or of industrial sites available for development. However, I am informed by the Secretary of State for Industry, who is responsible for the activities of the English Industrial Estates Corporation, that the corporation has 30 factory units vacant in the area, comprising 16,000 square metres of factory floorspace, and owns one vacant plot comprising 11 acres of land suitable for further industrial development.</p>
<p id="S5LV0435P0-02809">EIEC reports that much of the vacant industrial space in the area is old, unserviced and totally unsuitable for modern business requirements, or too specialised for general industrial use. The level of inquiries from both small and larger businesses seeking good general purpose modern accommodation in the area has been encouraging in recent months and EIEC expects an upturn in the rate of occupations in the coming year.</p>

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02812"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member>: The European Commission Recommendation C(79)549 of 29th May 1979, which refers to the application of inland postage rates to Community countries has been noted.

<p id="S5LV0435P0-02826"><member>Lord Cockfield</member>: Section 50 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 provides for an individual's residence status to be decided without regard to any place of abode maintained in the United Kingdom for his use, if he is working full time and all the duties of his office or employment are performed abroad, or any duties performed in the United Kingdom are incidental to his duties abroad. Husbands should not therefore be inhibited by income tax from visiting their families in the circumstances to which the noble Viscount refers.

The purpose of the index is to cover all the goods and services purchased by households in general and to provide for these an overall measure of the changes from month to month in their prices. The weights given to the various items of goods and services are determined by the annual family expenditure survey and so reflect the fact that some people do not purchase tobacco and alcohol.
